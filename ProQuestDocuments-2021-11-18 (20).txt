Texto completo: Long before President Donald Trump raised alarm by halting hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. aid in an alleged effort to influence Ukraine, his administration had built up plenty of practice in using federal funds to punish a favorite target: California.
The Justice Department said it would deny criminal justice grants to sanctuary cities that don't assist immigration agents, a move that several lower courts have blocked. The Department of Transportation is moving to cancel a $929 million grant to California's high-speed rail project and may try to claw back an additional $2.5 billion the bullet train program already has received.
And the Environmental Protection Agency said Tuesday that if California didn't improve its air quality, the feds would withhold billions in federal highway funding a move that Gov. Gavin Newsom called a "threat of pure retaliation" against a state that has sued the Trump administration 60 times.
Since he took over as president, Trump has used his power over federal funds as a cudgel to push cities, states and foreign governments to do what he wants.
"The threat of withdrawing federal funding is not a new tactic," said Michael McConnell, a Stanford law professor. "But President Trump has tended to personalize the threats more than prior administrations."
And the actions that have prompted threats of funding clawbacks range from momentous to minuscule. Earlier this month, the Trump administration threatened to withdraw federal funding for a Middle East studies course at Duke University and the University of North Carolina over its depictions of Christianity and Judaism.
But now what appears to be another move to block federal funds approved by Congress has sparked a full-blown political firestorm. Trump's decision to freeze nearly $400 million in U.S. aid to Ukraine before urging the country's president to investigate one of his political rivals has led to the threat of impeachment looming over his presidency.
Trump also has pushed legal boundaries on the use of federal funds in other ways, experts say. After Congress declined to approve funding for a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, Trump declared a national emergency to move funds from the Defense Department for wall construction. And he considered freezing more than $4 billion in aid to foreign countries last month before deciding not to amid political backlash.
Trump has long painted himself as a master dealer in the business world, making his willingness to drive a tough bargain central to his image as a successful real estate mogul. But between court decisions blocking some of his funding moves and the crisis over Ukraine, he's found that those tactics don't necessarily translate as well in a government setting.
Trump is far from the only president to use similar tactics. The Constitution gives the power to appropriate federal funds to Congress, but in many cases, that power is delegated to the president and the executive branch.
Presidents have used foreign aid as a carrot or a stick to extract diplomatic commitments and reforms from foreign governments. And it's also been used domestically: Barack Obama's administration, for example, threatened to block federal funds for states that discriminated against Planned Parenthood and didn't allow transgender students to use the bathrooms of their choice, although it never actually did so.
Still, Trump has used federal funds as leverage more often, more brazenly and in ways that have pushed the legal envelope more than past presidents, legal experts say.
What sets the Ukraine example apart and potentially makes it so perilous for Trump is that he allegedly was acting to damage a potential 2020 rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, not to change policy.
"What's especially concerning about the Ukraine example is he seems to do it not just for public policy ends but for his own personal, political ends," said Michael Dorf, a Cornell Law School professor who focuses on constitutional law.
Trump has insisted that he acted appropriately and was not drawing a quid-pro-quo between federal aid and Ukraine digging into Biden, and he blasted the whistleblower who made the call public.
"I want to know who's the person that gave the whistleblower the information, because that's close to a spy," Trump said at a closed-door meeting Thursday at the United Nations, The New York Times reported. "You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? With spies and treason, right? We used to handle them a little differently than we do now."
Republicans pointed out that the record of Trump's call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky released by the White House did not directly mention the aid funds the president had temporarily frozen although the document notes that it is "not a verbatim transcript."
Many of Trump's threats about federal funding haven't gone further than tweets. In February 2017, soon after taking office, he suggested he could cut off federal money to UC Berkeley after the university called off a speech by right-wing activist Milo Yiannopoulos amid violent protests.
The high-speed rail line is one example where the Trump administration has moved to take back federal money. In yanking back federal funds, the Department of Transportation argued that the state has failed to follow through with its plan for the bullet train project, which has been marred by extensive budget overruns and delays. But Democratic leaders in the state have claimed that Trump acted out of animus for the state, targeting it for political reasons.
Erwin Chemerinsky, the dean of UC Berkeley Law School, argued that Trump's apparent solicitation of help from a foreign government for information that could damage a political rival was in and of itself a violation of federal law, whether or not he implied a connection with U.S. aid to Ukraine.
But he said Trump's broader history of using federal money as a political tool was a dangerous trend: "Congress has to set the strings on grants, not the president."

Texto completo: Washington • It’s a beautiful day for an impeachment.
Or at least an inquiry about an impeachment inquiry.
So on Friday, as summer stretched on, I went to the Capitol to see what the speaker of the House was thinking, now that she has lowered the boom.
At the tender age of 73, Donald Trump may finally have to face some consequences for his depredations. His casino games have caught up with him and this time Daddy’s not here to bail him out. How delicious that a woman has the whip hand.
“Isn’t it something, Maureen?” Nancy Pelosi asks about what she calls her “wild week.”
I nod. It surely is. “The president says you’re no longer speaker of the House, that you’ve been taken over by the radical left,” I say to Pelosi, who looks smart in a pink pantsuit and sparkly pink high heels.
She laughs. “See, I always think he’s projecting: When he says ‘She’s not the speaker of the House,’ what he really means is ‘I shouldn’t be president of the United States.’ When he says that Adam Schiff should resign, what he really means is ‘I, Donald Trump, should resign.’ He knows that this is really very incriminating.”
The speaker is in a fine mood, now that she’s turned her focus from reining in the progressives to reining in the president.
Does she no longer think, as she said for months, that impeachment is so divisive that it needs to be a bipartisan effort?
“No, I said I hoped it would be bipartisan. I still hope so. It’s up to the Republicans whether they honor their oath of office or honor their oath of Trump.”
I ask her how she feels about those who say she came to this moment belatedly.
“I don’t come to anything belatedly,” she shoots back. “I have said from the start, we’ll go where the facts take us and we will be ready. And we are ready. And they’re shocked.”
Trump was clearly smarting that Pelosi is now on the side of an impeachment inquiry. Is the highchair king about to have his most epic tantrum yet?
Even Trump’s pal Chris Ruddy told NPR that the president may not understand the implications of the inquiry or that he’s going up against “the smartest person in Washington right now,” as Ruddy called Pelosi.
The speaker would have preferred to send Trump packing at the ballot box. But since he keeps contaminating the ballot box, asking foreign countries to meddle in our elections to help him win, what choice did she have?
The man who always claims the system is rigged against him keeps trying to rig the system — proving Pelosi’s point that Trump projects.
About the White House officials who engaged in what she calls “the cover-up of the cover-up,” she notes: “You’d think that there would be some sense of decency on the part of the people who work for the president.”
I ask her when the last time she talked to Trump was.
“You mean the latest?” she says, laughing. “It may be the last.”
They were talking about gun violence on the phone on Tuesday morning when the president suddenly changed the topic to the whistleblower complaint. “My conversation with the president was one in which he said the phone call was perfect and he couldn’t wait until I saw it because it was perfect. It wasn’t perfect.”
The White House says it plans to work with Democrats in Congress even less than usual. On Friday, The Times reported that Trump met with NRA ghoul Wayne LaPierre to talk about how the NRA can chip in some blood money for the president’s defense if he stops “the games” — “the games” being any attempt to curb our periodic human sacrifices.
Hasn’t Trump learned his lesson about scummy quid pro quos?
It’s hard to fathom why he would slip the noose on Robert Mueller’s testimony on Russia and then turn around the very next day and ask Ukraine to interfere in an American election.
“I’ve said before, I do not have the medical background to analyze the president’s behavior,” Pelosi says. Maybe it’s time to break the last taboo and put a psychiatrist on staff at the White House to analyze a president’s mental state, or possible impairment?
“No, I think the White House should have an honest lawyer on staff,” she says. “And not a rogue Justice Department.”
Speaking of rogue justice and psychiatric emergencies, what does she make of America’s mayor becoming America’s nightmare?
“I’m focused on the president,” she says, adding disgustedly about Rudy Giuliani: “I mean, that’s almost like a joke.”
She did not arrive at her decision lightly. In between speaking at two funerals — that of Cokie Roberts, the journalist, and Emily Clyburn, the wife of the House majority whip, Jim Clyburn — she talked to her members, lawyers and constitutional experts.
“I had one phone call; it lasted all weekend,” she says dryly.
She drafted her historic statement Monday night on the plane from New York to D.C. “‘Betrayal’ was a word that my members wanted me to use,” she says. “I didn’t have that in my original statement. Betrayal of the Constitution. Betrayal of our national security. Betrayal of the integrity of our elections.”
If only she could click those sparkly slippers three times and send Donald Trump home.

Texto completo: Jessye Norman, the renowned international opera star whose passionate soprano voice won her four Grammy Awards, the National Medal of Arts and the Kennedy Center Honor, has died, according to family spokesperson Gwendolyn Quinn. She was 74.
A statement released to the Associated Press on Monday said Ms. Norman died at 7:54 a.m. EDT from septic shock and multi-organ failure secondary to complications of a spinal cord injury she sustained in 2015. She died at Mount Sinai St. Luke's Hospital in New York, and was surrounded by loved ones.
"We are so proud of Jessye's musical achievements and the inspiration that she provided to audiences around the world that will continue to be a source of joy. We are equally proud of her humanitarian endeavors addressing matters such as hunger, homelessness, youth development, and arts and culture education," the family statement read.
Funeral arrangements will be announced in the coming days.
Ms. Norman was a trailblazing performer, and one of the rare black singers to attain world-wide stardom in the opera world, performing at such revered houses as La Scala and the Metropolitan Opera, and singing title roles in works including "Carmen," "Aida" and more. She sang the works of Wagner, but wasn't limited to opera or classical music, performing songs by Duke Ellington and others as well.
Ms. Norman was born on Sep. 15, 1945, in Augusta, Ga., in segregationist times. She grew up singing in church and around a musical family that included pianists and singers. She earned a scholarship to the historically black college Howard University in Washington, D.C., to study music, and later studied at the Peabody Conservatory and the University of Michigan.
She made her operatic debut in 1969 in Berlin, wowing audiences around the world on stages in Milan, London and New York, thanks to her shining vocals, no matter the language. The New York Times described her voice as "a grand mansion of sound."
"It defines an extraordinary space. It has enormous dimensions, reaching backward and upward. It opens onto unexpected vistas. It contains sunlit rooms, narrow passageways, cavernous falls," the Times' Edward Rothstein wrote.
In 1997, at age 52, Ms. Norman became the youngest person ever to earn the Kennedy Center Honor in the organization's 20-year history at the time. She received her National Medal of Arts from former President Obama and has earned honorary doctorates from a number of schools, including Juilliard, Harvard and Yale. She is a member of the British Royal Academy of Music and the Georgia Music Hall of Fame. Ms. Norman even has an orchid named after her in France, and the country also made her a Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters.
She's earned 15 Grammy nominations throughout her career, picking up her first in 1985, for best classical vocal soloist performance, for "Ravel: Songs of Maurice Ravel." She earned the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2006.

Prosecutors want 10 months in prison for man who threatened Globe

Texto completo: Federal prosecutors are recommending 10 months behind bars for the California man who pleaded guilty in May to charges that he threatened to kill employees of The Boston Globe, according to a Monday court filing.
In a government sentencing memorandum, Assistant US Attorney George P. Varghese also recommended that Robert D. Chain pay the Globe more than $16,000 in restitution after the newspaper spent that much on “additional security expenses as a direct result of Chain's threats."
“Chain terrorized the employees of The Globe newspaper," said Varghese in the filing. “As described by the victims, employees feared for their lives just because they were doing their jobs."
Chain, said Varghese, “deserves to be sentenced commensurate with his crimes."
Chain is scheduled to be sentenced on Wednesday.
In a Sept. 27 court filing, Chain's attorney, William D. Weinreb, recommended the court sentence his client to time served followed by three years' supervised release that would include six months' home confinement.
In a Monday e-mail, Weinreb said, “Mr. Chain deeply regrets his inexcusable actions and looks forward to the chance to apologize to the victims at the sentencing hearing."
In about 14 calls to the Globe's newsroom in August 2018, Chain repeatedly vowed to attack journalists on behalf of President Trump, a Republican who has denounced news organizations as the “enemy of the people."
Chain's threats included: “You are the enemy of the people and we are going to shoot you all." “You are the enemy of the people. We will hunt you down and kill you and your dogs." “We're gonna shoot you [expletive] in the head, you Boston Globe [expletive]. We're gonna shoot every [expletive] one of you."
Chain began calling the Globe on Aug. 10, 2018, and continued until the FBI's SWAT team arrested him Aug. 30, 2018, at his Encino, Calif., home, where they discovered 20 firearms, including a semiautomatic rifle he had purchased in May 2018, records show.
Chain was indicted on seven counts of use of interstate and foreign commerce to transmit a threat to injure another person based on the calls to the Globe's main newsroom telephone line. Court records include partial transcripts of his comments, which often included expletives and lewd language directed at Globe employees.
According to federal prosecutors, Chain also called writers at The New York Times, leaving “vicious and vulgar voicemails for them as well."
Chain, 69, apologized for his actions in an August letter addressed “To those I have harmed." In the letter, Chain said he could not believe he “said those hateful and disgusting things."
“To the young people I harmed, I can only say, I am sorry," Chain said in the letter. “I am sorry. I am sorry."

Texto completo: Reported Kurt Volker's resignation an hour before national outlets
They were trying to find a local angle to a national story. Instead, journalists at Arizona State University's student newspaper beat every news outlet in the country to the latest twist in the burgeoning controversy over President Trump's dealings with Ukraine.
It was the State Press that broke Friday's news that Kurt Volker, U.S. special envoy to the Eastern European country, had resigned. Volker, whose departure followed the release of the whistleblower complaint alleging Trump abused his office by seeking the Ukrainian president's help in the 2020 election, is executive director of Arizona State's McCain Institute.
The student paper first tweeted the news at 6:10 p.m. Friday, setting off a race among national political reporters to confirm it and racking up thousands of retweets along the way. At 6:18 p.m., the article hit the paper's website, published alongside dispatches on the university's clubs and teams. For a little while, the State Press was the only publication that had the story. The Associated Press, the New York Times and CNN followed with their own reports about an hour later.
"It's funny because usually we're competing against local outlets, not competing against the New York Times and Washington Post," said State Press managing editor Andrew Howard, 20, who wrote the article. "When I was worrying about publishing the story, I was worried about who in Arizona was going to beat us. I wasn't thinking about nationally."
The scoop brought a whirlwind of attention to the State Press, which operates independently of the Phoenix-area university's Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and employs dozens of journalists in training. The paper got upward of 100,000 hits on the story, one of its editors said, and won accolades from the likes of CNN's Brian Stelter and the New York Times's Maggie Haberman.
"It's amazing to see so many people coming to the support of student journalists around the globe," said editor in chief Kimberly Rapanut, 22. "I think it's easy to forget that student journalists are real journalists also."
Howard picked up about a thousand new Twitter followers and made his television debut with a live appearance on the BBC - an experience he described as both "cool" and "terrifying." He called his grandmother after finding out CNN was talking about his paper, telling her, "Gram, turn on CNN - you're going to want to see this."
The recognition thrilled the young journalists, whose story received mentions in most major news outlets. It also kind of stunned them.
"We knew that it was news and that we wanted to be the first to break it," said 20-year-old Adrienne Dunn, another managing editor at the State Press. "But none of us had any idea how big of a deal it would be for everyone in the newsroom."
Tom Blodgett, the editorial adviser to the State Press and a former staffer himself, said he is "bursting at the seams" with pride for the students, whom he called "excellent young journalists." He said that although the paper has been cited by major publications in the past, he could not recall a bigger scoop.
In a Friday night message to the staff, he wrote: "Feel good tonight. Feel great tonight. You've earned it. And then back to work because we build our reputation from great days but even more from what we do every day."
By Saturday afternoon, the students had found a little time to celebrate between papers and exams and were considering ordering pizza when they go back to work next week. They were still fielding calls from reporters - and excitedly watching readers flock to their site.
"Nothing is more important to our newsroom than for people to read what we do, especially as a student newsroom," Howard said. "We work a lot of long hours, we don't get paid very well, and we do it because we love what we do and we think what we do is incredibly important."

Texto completo: I don’t know who sold progressive Democrats on the idea that the way to beat Donald Trump is to abolish the private health insurance of 160 million Americans and offer instead “Medicare for all” (and Mexico will pay for it), but it’s a political loser and an easy target for Trump to feast on. A much better campaign theme is hiding in plain sight. I call it “the Earth Race.”
In the 1960s, John F. Kennedy energized the country behind a “space race”: to make America the first nation to put a man on the moon. Democrats need to run against Trump on the Earth Race: to make America the leader in all policies and technologies that help men and women everywhere live sustainably here on Earth?
Yes, I know, mitigating climate change and saving the environment never poll well. But times change, and it depends how you frame the issue. Mother Nature is forcing herself onto the ballot, and Trump’s efforts to roll back more than 80 rules and standards protecting clean air, water, climate, parks and wilderness make him uniquely vulnerable. He can’t pivot away from what he’s doing. He owns it, and it’s villainous. This time is different.
In this era when so much activism is online, when was the last time you saw a bottom-up, mass movement of young people in America and across the world — some four million in all — take to the streets on every continent as they did recently to demand action to stop the heating of our planet? These young people are telling us, and their voting parents, that this issue is a political winner — theirs is a movement in search of courageous political leaders.
I am not saying that the Earth Race is the only issue to run on. I’m all for strengthening Obamacare and even adding a public health insurance option. But if I were running for president against Trump, I’d be leading with the Earth Race as an economic opportunity, a national security necessity, a health emergency, an environmental urgency and a moral obligation. No other issue can combine those five.
I’d pound Trump every day with this message: “Trump says he cares about you. Well, that’s funny, because he clearly doesn’t care about the water you drink. He just revoked a rule that prohibited coal mining debris from being dumped into local streams — among other actions to weaken the Clean Water Act — so that pro-Trump coal companies can make more money while they make you sick. What kind of president does that?
“Trump says he cares about you. Well, that’s funny, because he clearly doesn’t care about the air you breathe. He’s weakening clean air rules so that power and coal companies can emit more pollutants, methane and carbon dioxide into the air — so they can make more money and give your kids more childhood asthma today and disruptive climate change tomorrow. What kind of father does that?
“Trump says he cares about making America great again. Well, that’s funny, because he clearly doesn’t care about American automakers and their supply chains. He’s trying to force California and other states to weaken their gas mileage and pollution standards so our companies — which don’t even want this change — can make gas guzzlers and no longer produce cars that get mileage as good as those in Japan or emit as little pollution as China’s expanding electric car fleets. Who the hell does that?
“The last time our auto industry indulged in a race to the bottom on mileage and pollution standards, it went bankrupt. That’s why automakers are resisting Trump’s effort to dumb them down. There are 42 Chinese companies actively manufacturing and selling electric cars in China right now — and they can’t wait to ship them here once Trump forces our manufacturers to make more polluting gas guzzlers.
"All 18,000 public buses in Shenzhen, China, a city of 12 million people, went electric by the end of 2017. ‘Taxis soon followed suit,’ TechCrunch reported in January. In Shenzhen today, 99 percent of the more than 21,000 cabs run on electric batteries. How does America become great again if we’re surrendering the world’s next great industry — clean power generation and transportation — to China?
“Trump says he’s pro-business. Well, that’s funny, because he’s trying to expand the use of polluting coal when both wind and solar are now cheaper in many locations, including red states. Even Texas is enjoying the cost, environmental and job-creating advantages of wind over coal, producing almost twice as much wind energy as California.
“The Los Angeles Times reported last week: ‘The cost of wind power has fallen about 50 percent since 2010. Solar has dropped 85 percent. That makes them cheaper than new coal and gas plants in two-thirds of the world, according to research organization BloombergNEF.’
“Trump says he wants to make America energy independent. Well, that’s funny, because he just rolled back the lighting standards initiated by President George W. Bush and his assistant secretary of energy Andy Karsner to phase out energy-sucking, heat-emitting incandescent and halogen bulbs and replace them with energy-efficient LEDs.
“Andrew deLaski, executive director of the Appliance Standards Awareness Project, told NPR: ‘The rollback will eliminate energy-efficient standards for light bulbs that were slated to take effect in January that would save consumers billions of dollars and reduce millions of tons of climate change carbon dioxide emissions.’ Who does that?”
How do you run against all these things Trump’s doing? With a simple message repeated over and over: “Trump is poisoning Americans and weakening America. Join the Earth Race. Make America healthier, wealthier, smarter and more secure.”
And with a simple solution, too. The Earth Race doesn’t need a giant Green New Deal that tries to change everything at once, as noble as that goal is. It just needs to aggressively amplify what is already happening.
If a candidate can’t make headway with that message, either America is doomed or he or she doesn’t belong in politics.

Texto completo: One of the most shocking revelations in the transcript of President Donald Trump's phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was that so much of what Trump had to say on the call focused just on getting Ukrainian officials to investigate his political opponents. Another surprise was that Trump said repeatedly that Attorney General William Barr would be running point, working with Trump's private attorney Rudy Giuliani, on these matters.
These facts now implicate the attorney general, the nation's chief law enforcement officer, directly in the commission of acts that many of the country's leading legal experts consider federal crimes — whether as election law violations, bribery or other offenses concerning public corruption.
Even Barr seems to understand the extreme impropriety of what the transcript suggests. Hence Barr's formal statement suggesting that what Trump told Ukraine's president about the attorney general's role was essentially false.
What's even more egregious here is to think of the transcript in relation to what else Barr may have been doing in handling the Ukraine matter.
It's deeply concerning to now know that Barr's Justice Department told the director of national intelligence to withhold the whistleblower's complaint from Congress, while Barr admits he knew at the time that he was named on the phone call at the heart of the whistleblower's allegations. Perhaps that would be excusable if the Justice Department's advice to the director was ordinary and well within the law.
Layer onto all of these concerns another revelation in Wednesday's news — according to The New York Times, the director of national intelligence and the inspector general of the intelligence community each referred the whistleblower's complaint to the Justice Department for a possible criminal investigation into the president's actions. Within a matter of days, Barr's Justice Department somehow reached the conclusion that the complaint could not trigger an investigation because the allegations could not involve a crime.
Barr's Justice Department came up with the idea that "the information discussed on the call didn't amount to a 'thing of value' that could be quantified," according to BuzzFeed News. That logic flies in the face of what the nation's foremost legal experts, including Trump's deputy solicitor general, concluded in the Mueller report. In the case of Ukraine, just chalking up all of Giuliani's out-of-pocket expenses in the hunt for fake dirt on Biden would likely show the immense value that he and Trump placed on the information.
Finally, what makes matters worse for Barr is that the president has twice publicly discussed having the attorney general investigate allegations involving Ukraine, Clinton and Biden. And the attorney general famously tried to avoid answering Sen. Kamala Harris' simple question whether the White House ever asked him to investigate anyone. After the release of the Ukraine-gate transcript, the cloud over Bill Barr is thick. There's one way for him to remove it. Step aside.

Ocasio-Cortez Calls for a Government Bailout for the City's Taxi Drivers

Texto completo: The congresswoman referred to their plight as "indentured servitude," becoming the most prominent voice to back a rescue plan.
[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox .]
Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is calling for a government bailout for New York taxi drivers, emerging as the most prominent voice to back a financial rescue plan for thousands of drivers who were channeled into exploitative loans.
Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat who said her district in the Bronx and Queens is home to many cabdrivers, jumped into a debate over how to help drivers who were urged to take out loans with high fees, interest-only payments and other one-sided terms. They borrowed the money to buy taxi medallions, the city permit that allowed them to own and operate their cabs.
"This is manufactured financial indentured servitude," she said during a congressional hearing on lending on Thursday. "And it is wrong. We need to bail out these drivers."
Two other Democrats from New York, Representatives Nydia Velázquez and Carolyn B. Maloney, also decried the loans in the meeting, the first congressional hearing to address the driver debt crisis since it was revealed by a New York Times series.
The Times reported this year that a handful of New York taxi industry leaders had made hundreds of millions of dollars by artificially inflating medallion prices and issuing reckless loans to thousands of immigrant drivers. As regulators stood by, medallion prices soared above $ 1 million before the bubble burst in late 2014, rocking the industry.
More than 950 New York cabdrivers have filed for bankruptcy, and thousands more are struggling to hang on, The Times found.
Federal prosecutors in Manhattan and the New York State attorney general's office are investigating the lending practices, and the city is taking steps to hold the industry leaders accountable. Those leaders have denied wrongdoing, blaming woes in the industry on ride-hailing companies such as Uber and Lyft.
Lawmakers have also drafted new rules to help prevent abusive practices and created a task force to discuss the taxi crisis.
But a schism has emerged among some city officials over a government bailout of drivers. Some say the city bears partial responsibility for the crisis because regulators encouraged the buying frenzy. Others, including Mayor Bill de Blasio, say a bailout would be too expensive.
The mayor's office has said a bailout could cost as much as $ 13 billion. Others put the cost as low as $ 300 million under a possible hybrid solution that would provide government assistance, but also require lenders to forgive some of the debt.
A spokeswoman for Mr. de Blasio did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
New York City's congressional delegation, along with the City Council, has taken a leading role in pushing for at least a partial bailout. In July, Ms. Velázquez and nine other members of the delegation sent a letter calling for the task force to discuss a bailout. Last month, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and 10 other members sent a letter asking several federal regulatory agencies to provide information on how they plan to protect cabdrivers.
At the hearing on Thursday, Ms. Maloney called for the federal agencies that now hold some of the loans to stop foreclosing on borrowers. "After years of predatory loans and inflated medallion prices, the yellow cabs of New York really turned into financial traps for thousands of mostly immigrant drivers," she said. "It's a New York City scandal, really."
Ms. Velázquez said that in response to the Times series, she was preparing legislation to strengthen protections and disclosures in small business loans.
Bhairavi Desai, the head of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, which represents both drivers who own medallions and those who work for fleets, attended the hearing in Washington with 15 drivers. She said she believed that a bailout was increasingly possible.
Ms. Desai, a member of the task force, also said she hoped that a bailout plan was among the recommendations set to be released early next year.
Several City Council members who have urged a bailout said they were encouraged by the support from Washington.
"There is growing momentum behind our push for the city to buy or guarantee these wildly inflated mortgages so that they can finally be refinanced on fair terms," said Mark Levine, a city councilman in Manhattan. "A consensus is emerging that this would be far less costly than the ridiculous multibillion dollar estimates that have been thrown around. Having the congressional spotlight shine on this crisis is a huge boost to our efforts."

Texto completo: ‘GLIMMER OF HOPE’: With the war in Syria in its ninth year, the United States is renewing a push for a political settlement in the hopes of preventing more deaths in the conflict that has already claimed hundreds of thousands of lives and displaced millions of people.
At a State Department briefing in New York City yesterday, Jim Jeffrey, the special representative for Syria engagement, told reporters that agreement by all parties to establish a constitutional committee is a sign that the regime of Bashar Assad is beginning to realize a military victory is becoming increasingly difficult.
“This is not the end of the efforts by Assad to get a military victory, we don’t think, or even the efforts of Iran and Russia to support him,” Jeffrey said. “But it shows that they were under pressure, and being under pressure, they’ve at least opened the door to a political solution.”
“We need to keep the pressure on and we will, and our friends and allies will as well, but we also need to recognize that there may be a glimmer of hope that this conflict can be ended the right way,” he said.
CHEMICAL ATTACK: At the same time, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accused Syria of using chlorine gas as part of the government offensive against rebels in Idlib in May.
“It is ... the latest instance in a long pattern of Assad’s chemical weapons attacks that have killed or wounded thousands of Syrians,” said Pompeo, who stopped short of threatening a military response, even while insisting the United States “will not allow these attacks to go unchallenged.”
“As part of our maximum pressure campaign, today the United States Department of Treasury designated Russian entities for supporting Assad’s brutal war machine and facilitating the shipments of jet fuel to Russian military forces in Syria. I’m also announcing today that the State Department will provide an additional $4.5 million to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons to help its investigations of continued chemical weapons use in Syria.”
In 2017 and 2018, the United States launched missile strikes against Syrian targets after determining the regime used chemical weapons against civilians and rebel forces.
AUSTIN TICE: Pompeo also called on Syria to release American journalist Austin Tice, who was taken captive while working as a freelance reporter for McClatchy and the Washington Post in 2012.
“He has now spent seven years in captivity. He is just one of a number of American citizens held in Syria, and we call upon the Syrian regime to release them all,” said Pompeo. “The Trump administration never forgets about Americans wrongfully detained or held hostage abroad.”
AMBASSADOR WITHOUT PORTFOLIO: In his session with reporters at the United Nations, Pompeo skirted questions about Rudy Giuliani’s claim that his interactions with Ukraine were done at the behest of the State Department.
Asked directly if that was true, Pompeo avoided answering, saying instead that to the best of his knowledge, “each of the actions that were undertaken by State Department officials was entirely appropriate” and consistent with the objective of creating a better relationship between the United States and Ukraine.

HAPPENING TODAY: Defense Secretary Mark Esper welcomes Norwegian Defense Minister Frank Bakke-Jensen to the Pentagon at 1:30 p.m.
ALSO TODAY: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo meets with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov at the United Nations.
CONFIRMED: Air Force Gen. John Hyten has successfully countered sexual misconduct allegations to win Senate confirmation to be the next vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Yesterday’s vote was 75-22, with Iowa’s Joni Ernst the lone Republican among the nays.
ALSO CONFIRMED: Acting Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy is acting no more, having also been confirmed by the Senate, by voice vote.
CHANGING OF THE GUARD: Monday marks the last day on the job for Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Joseph Dunford, who completes a four-year term that began under President Barack Obama in which he served with five defense secretaries or acting secretaries: Ash Carter, Jim Mattis, Patrick Shanahan, Richard Spencer, and Mark Esper.
In keeping with his low-key style, his retirement will be a private family-only affair when he actually hangs up his uniform at a later date. The Marine general did record a farewell message to the troops reflecting on his more than four decades of service, including as a battlefield commander in Iraq, top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, and commandant of the Marine Corps.
Army Chief of Staff Gen. Mark Milley will be welcomed as the next chairman in a ceremony at Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall at 11 a.m. Monday.
200 TROOPS, BATTERY INCLUDED: The Pentagon released details of the “modest deployment” of additional U.S. troops to Saudi Arabia to bolster the kingdom’s defenses against missile and drone attacks while calling on other allies to do the same.
“Other countries have called out Iranian misadventures in the region, and we look for them to contribute assets in an international effort to reinforce Saudi Arabia's defense,” said chief Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman in a statement.
The United States is sending one Patriot missile defense battery, four Sentinel radars, and 200 troops to operate them.
“This deployment augments an already significant presence of U.S. forces in the region,” said Hoffman.
ON STANDBY: The Pentagon has also put additional missile defense forces on notice that they could also soon be going to the region, including two more Patriot batteries and a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system (THAAD) unit.
They have been given “Prepare To Deploy Orders” and told to “maintain a heightened state of readiness.”
IN CASE OF EMERGENCY, BREAK GLASS: While Congress has approved another short-term continuing resolution or CR to keep the government funded for six weeks while budget negotiations continue, the Pentagon is making plans for the worst — just in case.
Deputy Defense Secretary David Norquist has issued guidance for “Continuation of Operations During a Lapse in Appropriations” that would furlough 622,000 civilian employees of the Department of Defense in the event of a government shutdown, but it’s unlikely to be needed as President Trump is expected to sign the stop-gap measure that passed the Senate yesterday on a vote of 82-15.
The House passed the measure last week.
SUICIDES UP: The Pentagon has released its report on military suicides last year, which for the first time includes data on families as well as troops. The report shows that in 2018, 541 active and reserve troops died by suicide, with the rate per 100,000 increasing from 21.9 in 2017 to 24.8 in 2018.
The rate has been slowly but steadily rising over the past five years, as has the rate for the civilian population.
“The most recent data from the CDC indicates that suicide rates are rising across the country,” Elizabeth Van Winkle, the Pentagon’s executive director of force resiliency, said at a briefing for reporters, adding that “this is hardly comforting, and our numbers are not moving in the right direction.”
“We also hold ourselves to a higher standard,” she added.
SOME MYTHS: The report also explodes some myths about military suicides, including the ideas that deployment to a war zone increases the risk of suicide and that troops who take their lives are suffering from mental illness.
MATTIS: THE REPUBLIC WILL SURVIVE: At his appearance at the Atlantic Festival yesterday, former defense secretary Jim Mattis steadfastly held to his policy of not criticizing a sitting president, explaining he still considers himself more of a military man than a civilian politician.
“Military people and those in the departments do not make political assessments of a sitting commander in chief. This is a longstanding tradition. There's a reason for it. We have civilian control of the military,” Mattis said. “And when people try and say, ‘But you've also been in a civilian position.’ When I just got out of the car down here and walked into this building, the young man in charge of security let me through the door, said, ‘Welcome, General Mattis.’"
When asked about “the current situation” by The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg, Mattis held his ground. “In the finest traditions of the free press and of every American having their own rights, you ask annoying questions, I frustrate you in return, and the game goes on.”
But Mattis did offer that the nation would survive what he called “a rather historic moment in our country's life.”
“We'll have to see how it plays out, but the Constitution is showing that it's a very hearty document, I think right now, that it can hold fast, even against turmoil such as we're experiencing today,” he said.

Navy's startling UFO videos keep earthlings guessing

Texto completo: What to think about the objects captured on three videos by the U.S. Navy? The videos were leaked in 2017 and 2018, and can be viewed online, but the Navy last week finally confirmed them and, somewhat disquietingly, admitted it has no idea what the objects are. It calls them "unidentified aerial phenomena." What the videos reveal are Navy pilots encountering flying objects they cannot identify, moving in ways no one inside or outside the government has been able to explain. The objects are cloudy yet mesmerizing, tiny dots sowing enormous and fundamental questions.
Where did they come from? Are they using technology of which we can't conceive? Are they being piloted by life-forms we cannot begin to understand?
The videos were shot by Navy pilots in 2004 and 2015. A 2017 story by The New York Times about one encounter included the federal government's first-ever acknowledgment of the secret Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program. Mull the term -- "threat identification."
In the videos, astonished crews debate what the objects are and where they came from. "There's a whole fleet of them!" one voice says in one video, and then: "They're all going against the wind, that wind is 120 miles (per hour) to the west!" But the best summary is a stunned: "What the (expletive) is that thing?"
The craft seem to do things no human-made craft can, like suddenly appearing at an altitude of 80,000 feet, hurtling down to 20,000 feet, hovering, then shooting back up to 80,000 feet. They are shockingly fast, spherical and have no visible means of propulsion or trails of exhaust. The Navy says these videos represent just a tiny fraction of reported "incursions." Mull that, too.
A Navy spokesman said the newfound transparency about unidentified aerial phenomena is part of an attempt to get pilots to report such sightings without fearing any stigma. It's a stunning turnaround for a government that spent decades assuring the country that every object in our skies could be explained and scoffing at UFO enthusiasts who embraced the unlimited possibilities they saw in the skies.
For all of us on the ground, though, it's a reminder that we don't have all the answers, that we live in a limitless and mysterious universe. And in that context, our daily strife and struggles are just a bit of cosmic dust.

Paul Krugman: Impeaching Trump is good for the economy

Texto completo: If there’s one thing the tweeter in chief believes, it is that what’s good for Donald Trump is good for America. A little more than a month ago (although it seems like much longer) he told a rally that “you have no choice but to vote for me,” because his electoral defeat would lead to a market crash.
But a funny thing has happened over the course of Trump’s latest terrible, horrible, very bad, no good two weeks. Suddenly, impeachment (though not removal from office) has gone from highly unlikely to highly likely. In fact, given the explosive nature of the now-revealed whistleblower complaint, I don’t really understand how he can not be impeached.
And the financial markets have basically shrugged.
On the surface, this may seem strange. After all, whatever the eventual outcome of the surging prospect of impeachment, the immediate effect is surely to cripple the Trump administration’s ability to pursue its legislative agenda. Why doesn’t this worry investors?
The answer is, “What legislative agenda?”
Even when Trump’s party controlled both houses of Congress, he had only two major legislative initiatives. One was a big tax cut for corporations and the wealthy that will generate trillions in deficits but doesn’t seem to have done much for the economy. The other was an attempt to take away health insurance from around 30 million Americans, which didn’t pass.
What about now? Well, I guess impeachment could get in the way of the big infrastructure plan Trump has been promising for three years. OK, you can stop laughing. “Infrastructure week” has long since become a punch line; nobody, and I mean nobody, believes that any real plan, let alone one that could pass a Democratic House, will ever be forthcoming.
At this point, the only halfway significant item on the legislative table is Trump’s proposed replacement for NAFTA — which is basically indistinguishable from NAFTA. Trump may think it’s important to stick a new name on the same old trade agreement, but hardly anyone else agrees.
To be fair, legislation isn’t the only way presidents can make policy, and the prospect of impeachment will probably exert a chilling effect on Trump’s ability to pursue policy through executive fiat. But here’s the thing: Since most of what Trump is trying to do is bad for America, whatever paralysis impeachment may induce is all to the good.
For Trump has, in effect, been waging a war on competence.
In Trump’s vision of government, career diplomats who do actual diplomacy, experienced regulators who actually try to enforce regulations, researchers who produce objective data — up to and including weather forecasters whose predictions he doesn’t like — are all part of a deep state that’s out to get him. So Trump officials have been engaged in a systematic campaign to degrade America’s Civil Service, driving out people who know what they’re doing and replacing them with political hacks.
Consider the case of the Agriculture Department’s Economic Research Service, a respected, heretofore apolitical unit that produces highly useful reports — reports that farmers and businesses rely on — on various trends affecting rural America. After the agency produced reports documenting the obvious — that the 2017 tax cut disproportionately benefited well-off farmers — and refused to cook up studies justifying other administration policies, it was summarily told to relocate from Washington to Kansas City.
The obvious and successful purpose of this move was to induce mass resignations by the unit’s experts, and it’s very unlikely that if and when the agency is reconstituted it will be nearly as good at doing its job.
A similar process of hackification has been going on throughout the federal government. And let’s be clear: This degradation of government is bad for business. Businesses may not always like government regulations, but they do like government that is predictable, is competent and makes decisions based on clear criteria, not political connections.
But here’s the thing: An impeachment inquiry will surely have a chilling effect on the Trumpian project of government degradation. It may not come to a dead halt, but Trump’s team of cronies will be distracted; they will be less brazen; they will be worrying about more potential whistleblowers going public about what they’re doing.
If we had a normal administration, one that, whatever its ideology, was trying to govern the nation well, the distraction and paralysis that comes with an impeachment investigation could have adverse side effects, although even then the historical record is unclear. (Compared with the Trump era, the Nixon administration was a paragon of good government.)
But this isn’t a normal administration; it has never seemed to care much about governing, and it is actively hostile to civil servants trying to do their jobs. So paralysis is good. The more time Trump appointees spend worrying about potential prosecution rather than planning loyalty purges, the better off all of us, from ordinary citizens to giant corporations, will be.
Impeaching Donald Trump is good for the economy.

Lucky life of a newspaperman

Texto completo: I've been lucky.
In February 1968, I came down to Washington, D.C., from the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism to do some research, stopped up at the Washington Post and walked out with a job. A week later, for reasons I never understood, I got a raise. After graduating in June, I started work, and now, 51 years later, I am about to stop. This is my final column. I think I've earned that raise.
In 1976, eight years after I started, I was offered a local column. Ben Bradlee, the executive editor, made the offer at a lunch I had requested so I could tell him I was quitting. A rival news organization had offered to make me its White House correspondent. But before I could resign, Bradlee upset my plans. I never got around to quitting and never told Bradlee that I had intended to.
I was lucky.
Bradlee asked me to show him five sample columns. Instead, knowing I need the juice of a deadline, I wrote one the next day and gave it to the city editor. "I'm the new local columnist," I brazenly told him. "Check with Bradlee." He never did.
The next day, my column was in the paper.
I was lucky.
Back then I wrote three columns a week - an exhausting but exhilarating schedule. Little by little, I broadened my scope until, in Bradlee's telling, he picked up the paper one day and discovered that I was in Beirut. By fiat, he moved me from the Metro page to the A section and, later, at the insistence of the publisher, to the op-ed page. I wrote what I wanted from where I wanted, and not once did the publishers tell me what to write or what not to write. On occasion, though, Katharine Graham offered some constructive criticism. Once, at a formal lunch for the new Russian ambassador, she strode purposely across the dining room to tell me that my column that morning "was a real piece ... "
"Don't hold back, Katharine," I responded. "Tell me what you really think."
She laughed.
There were no better bosses than the Grahams - and, more recently, Jeff Bezos. I roamed the world on their dime. Flying into Cairo for the first time, I looked out the window. A sandstorm obscured the pyramids, but I envisioned them anyway and I could not get over the fact that I was being paid to see them. What fools the Grahams were. I would have done it for nothing.
Back in 2017, I helped produce a documentary for HBO on the life of Ben Bradlee. HBO called it "The Newspaperman," and I thought, how wonderful, how apt. That was Bradlee and, with the same permission he gave me to write a column, I take that appellation for myself as well. It is, I think, the highest of callings, and I never wanted to be anything else. You go to work and someone pins an imaginary badge on you and deputizes you to go forth and discover life, ask questions, turn over rocks and, in the case of a column, think so hard it's physically draining.
I had grown up reading the once-liberal New York Post. It was a brave, scrappy paper with great, iconoclastic writers, particularly its columnists. I gorged on Murray Kempton, Jimmy Cannon and Pete Hamill. I read them all, envied them all and wanted to be like them. Later, I became a copyboy for the New York Herald Tribune and noticed that reporters were required to read the paper. They got paid for it. Amazing. Professional ballplayers must feel the same way. Imagine getting paid to play a game!
That first day at the Washington Post, I was assigned a desk next to Carl Bernstein. We became fast friends and so, like a barnacle on a ship, I attached myself to him and Bob Woodward, going through Watergate with them. Earlier, I watched in awe and pride as the Post risked all sorts of legal and financial penalties to publish the Pentagon Papers after the New York Times had been enjoined from doing so. This was one great newspaper that I had just walked into. Again, what luck!
Now it is over. I have written books and screenplays and will continue to do so. My girlfriend and I are going to Paris for a month and we're getting a dog. I will have time to walk it now. I will miss newspapering, but I know I had the best it ever had to offer.
I was very lucky indeed.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- As the day progressed on Thursday, so too did the rapidly evolving news on the controversial whistleblower complaint and related impeachment inquiry. It's the latest example of a divide in media coverage of President Donald Trump.
The whistleblower complaint lodged about Trump over his interactions with a foreign leader was declassified and made public, the acting national intelligence chief testified before Congress as part of House Democrats' impeachment probe, and news broke that Trump had implied the whistleblower's sources were "spies. "
Throughout the day, prominently featured headlines on news sites and banners across television networks were evidence of how media's framing of issues arguably helps reinforce viewers' ideological perspectives.
More: Joe Biden says Trump tried to 'hijack an election' in wake of whistleblower complaint
For example, just before midday Thursday, as acting National Intelligence Director Joseph Maguire testified before Congress and the whistleblower complaint had already been released, the following headlines were featured on major news outlet websites:
The Washington Post: "Whistleblower claimed Trump abused office and White House officials tried to cover it up"
The New York Times: "Whistle-Blower Alleged White House Cover-Up of Ukraine Call"
Fox News: "Maguire Under Fire - Trump intel boss cautions impeachment-driven Dems: Complaint based on ‘second-hand information’"
Breitbart: "Schiff posts deep state complaint… Pelosi humiliated" and "Dossier 2. 0: POTUS seeks ‘interference from a foreign country in the election’. . . . . . Trump covering up Ukraine call transcript!"
As Maguire gave his testimony, conservative-leaning outlets notably chose to focus on the Democratic push for impeachment as well as a perceived slipup from House Intelligence Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff, who read what he referred to as a parody of Trump's phone call with Ukraine's president.
"Spymaster Spars: Intel chief's patience with Schiff wears thin after hours of questioning on whistleblower complaint," read a headline on Fox News' website.
More: 'Unique and unprecedented': Intel chief Joseph Maguire cites executive privilege in delaying whistleblower report to Congress
Here were television banners when Congress' questioning of Maguire adjourned midday Thursday:
CNN: "Whistleblower: Trump tried to get Ukraine to interfere in election, and White House tried to cover it up"
Fox News: "House Intel Cmte hearing with acting DNI Maguire wraps on Capitol Hill"
MSNBC: "Acting DNI wraps whistleblower complaint"
CBS: "Acting DNI: Complaint is ‘unprecedented’ and whistleblower ‘did the right thing’ by reporting POTUS-Ukraine call"
ABC: "Maguire: I think the whistleblower did the right thing"
When The New York Times and the Los Angeles Times both reported that Trump had referred to the whistleblower's White House sources as "close to a spy," most news outlets led with that coverage. Those remarks were said at a private event.
"You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now," Trump reportedly said.
"Trump threatens US officials who gave information to the Ukraine case whistleblower," a Vox headline read.
Slate's homepage had the following story: "Trump Implies Whistleblowers Should Be Shot, Which May Conflict With Rules. "
Fox News' story based on that private event, not featured as prominently on the website, was titled "Trump slams mainstream media as ‘scum’ and ‘animals’ during private event, criticizes whistleblower. " It did not mention Trump's remarks about spies.
Later in the day, however, another piece was published by Fox News: "Republicans race to identify whistleblower's WH sources as apparent inconsistencies emerge. " It did include the remarks.
More: 'Almost a spy': Donald Trump suggests whistleblower source committed treason as Ukraine firestorm builds
At shortly after 5 p. m. ET Thursday, banners across television news networks read:
Fox News: "Impeachment obsession: Dems press ahead despite lack of public support"
CNN: "Whistleblower: Trump abused power by trying to get Ukraine to interfere in 2020 election, White House tried to cover it up"
MSNBC: "Whistleblower: White House tried to ‘lock down’ records of Pres. Trump’s call with Ukraine president"

Dems call it coverup; Whistleblower tells of Nixon-style move to 'lock down' info on Ukraine chat; Trump rips official as 'almost a spy'

Texto completo: The White House staffers scrambled to cover up President Trump's dicey gambit to draft a foreign leader in his plot to dig dirt on Joe Biden, hiding a phone-call transcript from cabinet members on a secret server, according to a bombshell whistleblower report released Thursday.
The insider said senior White House officials tried to "lock down" all records of a July call in which Trump sought to pressure Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky.
In a plot that echoes Watergate, the president's men ordered staffers to stash the transcript of the call in an ultrasecret system separate from the one in which such documents are normally stored, according to the unidentified whistleblower.
"This set of actions underscored to me that White House officials understood the gravity of what had transpired in the call," the whistleblower wrote in his report, which is likely to expedite Democrats' impeachment inquiry into the president.
Trump immediately responded to the release of the report in an all-caps tweet that sought to rally GOP support for his embattled presidency.
"STICK TOGETHER, PLAY THEIR GAME, AND FIGHT HARD REPUBLICANS. OUR COUNTRY IS AT STAKE!" Trump tweeted before deleting the message without explanation.
He later lashed out at Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), suggested the whistleblower is "almost a spy" who should face punishment, and mused about whether he could somehow stop the impeachment process.
"Democrats are going lose the election and they know it. That's why they are doing it," he said at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland after returning from his three-day trip to New York. "There should be a way of stopping it."
On Wednesday, Trump suggested that the complaint was the work of a single disgruntled Democratic sympathizer who had infiltrated his administration.
The inspector general, however, quotes at least six officials as witnesses to what appears to be strong evidence of impeachable offenses.
"Multiple U.S. officials told me that the Ukrainian leadership was led to believe that a meeting or phone call [with Trump] would depend on whether Zelensky showed willingness to 'play ball,' " the whistleblower said.
The complaint also suggested that the White House may have acted to hide other presidential statements, raising the possibility that other impeachable abuses of power may have been covered up.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi slammed the administration's conduct.
"This is a coverup," she said, repeating the phrase for emphasis.
"The president of the United States in his actions in a telephone call with a head of state betrayed his oath of office, our national security and the integrity of our elections."
Trump's behavior recalled President Richard Nixon's infamous plot to find info on Democrats by breaking into the party headquarters at the Watergate Hotel in 1972, followed by efforts to withhold a recording that proved he'd illegally blocked the FBI's investigation into the matter.
"If this was all so innocent," said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), "why did so many officials in the White House, in the Justice Department and elsewhere make such large efforts to prevent it from being made public?"
Trump on Thursday continued the tirade that began with Pelosi's Monday announcement of the impeachment investigation, complete with Nixonian whiffs of paranoia directed at perceived enemies.
He essentially accused the whistleblower and his White House sources of spying and treason, adding that the press are "scum" for good measure. His personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani joined in the fray, dismissing the report as "crap."
Giuliani plays a starring role of sorts in the whistleblower's nine-page account, which says Giuliani alarmed government officials by going around "national security decision making processes" to do Trump's bidding.
Giuliani, the ex-mayor who's morphed into one of Trump's most aggressive attack dogs, had several communications with Zelensky's advisers after the phone call, according to the report.
On one occasion, Giuliani traveled to Madrid to speak with a Zelensky adviser, a rendezvous that a concerned official characterized to the whistleblower as a "followup" to Trump's call.
Giuliani has admitted to conducting an extensive effort to find dirt on Joe Biden, a leading Democratic presidential candidate, and his son Hunter. Giuliani has said without proof that the ex-veep wanted Ukraine's former top prosecutor fired to prevent an investigation of Hunter, who was previously on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.
Trump asked Zelensky to communicate with both Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr, according to a rough transcript of the call released Wednesday.
The report said Barr "appeared to be involved" in Trump's effort to get dirt on Biden, but did not go into detail about the AG.
The whistleblower is a CIA officer who was detailed to the White House, The New York Times reported Thursday. He's returned to the agency since the report emerged.
The White House initially refused to give Congress either a transcript of the call with Zelensky or a copy of the whistleblower complaint, but relented after House Democrats initiated an impeachment probe.
They say Trump tried to use the power of American foreign policy for his personal political gain, a violation of his oath of office.
Congressional Republicans were mostly mum about the new documents Thursday. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) refused to answer questions from reporters during the day.
However, Rep. Mike Turner (R-Ohio) said, "Concerning that conversation, I want to say to the president - this is not okay. That conversation is not okay. It's disappointing to the American people."
The fact that a possible White House coverup involved computer servers would amount to an ironic twist in the Trump scandal, given his obsession with Hillary Clinton's use of a personal server to host emails.
Larry Pfeiffer, a former CIA chief of staff, said the White House has an alternate server for only the most secret U.S. covert actions, such as the effort to kill Osama Bin Laden.
That server would not have been an appropriate place to move records of a conversation like the one between Trump and Zelensky, which was only sensitive because Trump may have broken laws barring soliciting foreign help.
"It would not have been a place to hide activities of the president," Pfeiffer told CNN.

Texto completo: The accolades for the Finger Lakes wine region of New York to continue to accumulate.
The most recent example: Wine & Spirits Magazine has named Dr. Konstantin Frank Winery as one of the Top 100 Wineries of 2019.
Also on the worldwide list is such prestigious wineries as Champagne Krug in France; Penfolds in Australia; and Stags' Leap Winery and Tablas Creek in California. Dr. Frank was the only winery named from the Finger Lakes region of New York. The winery previously was named in the Wine & Spirits Magazine Top 100 in 2016.
Over the past few years, the winery has rolled out more personalized tasting experiences geared toward the varied interests of its visitors. It remodeled its tasting rooms and allowed each guest to choose wines to taste from the entire list including reserve and single vineyard wines. The Terrace at 1886 allows guests to enjoy flights of wine paired with local cheeses on the new outside terrace overlooking the vineyards on Keuka Lake. Now in its fourth year, the 1886 Food and Wine Experience offers guests a thorough educational tour and tasting paired with creative small bites.
Dr. Konstantin Frank Winery is at 9749 Middle Road, a few miles north of Hammondsport, Steuben County. The winery, which opened in 1962, was at the forefront of the post-Prohibition wine movement in the Finger Lakes. The vineyards on Keuka Lake are home to some of the oldest vines in the U.S.
More Finger Lakes accolades • For the second year in a row, the picturesque Finger Lakes wine region was named top wine region in the USA Today 10Best Reader's Choice poll. The Finger Lakes Wine Festival in Watkins Glen and F.L.X. Table in Geneva also finished in the Top 10 in their respective categories.
• Finger Lakes wines regularly have strong showings in the national wine press. The most recent example: New York Times wine writer Eric Asimov included Nathan K Finger Lakes Dry Riesling in a list of 20 wines under $20.

Spotlighting NYC's indigenous voices

Texto completo: A new exhibit is raising the volume on New York City's Native American voices.
To help bring the city's indigenous Americans to the forefront, the Museum of the City of New York presents "Urban Indian: Native New York Now." On display from Friday through Feb. 15, the exhibit offers a compilation of contemporary art, documentaries and community memorabilia meant to provide insight on what it means to be part of indigenous tradition in a fast-moving metropolis.
Jason Lujan of the Chiricahua Apache nation in Texas co-curated the exhibit with Rebecca Hayes Jacobs, a Mellon postdoctoral curatorial fellow at the museum. For Lujan, the exhibit is a way to highlight the voices of Native American New Yorkers, of which more than 100,000 thousand self-identifed in the 2010 United States Census, whom he has come to know personally and who he feels represent the life of native people in the city.
"There have been many occasions where native and indigenous voices have been included, but often as a third person or defined by the institution or by someone else," Lujan told amNewYork. "Here I felt this was a really good way to collapse any of these kinds of distinctions between what is native and what is not native ... and present things in the way that I feel is accurate to how the community exists in New York City."
The exhibit is part of Jacobs' capstone for her fellowship with the museum. Jacobs, who is not Native American, explained that she wanted to work with Lujan to find a way to show the "complexity of native perspectives and experience in New York."
"Jason and I were interested in collapsing the distinctions between art, politics and community life because we think everyday life is political and it is artistic," Jacobs said. "We wanted to really be respectful of what life is like and has been like in very recent years for Native American folks living here. And recognizing that traditions are lived in the present and heritage is part of what people carry with them."
Out of the collection of various designs, historical videos, activism pieces, quilts, and publications - all created by or about Native Americans of New York - one of the most prominent pieces for Lujan was created by artist Steven Deo. The framed piece is the front page of The New York Times from Sept. 12, 2001, with the headline "U.S. attacked," seemingly being pushed up by photographed hands in the shape of the Twin Towers. At the bottom of the piece is the phrase, "If we could push the towers back into the sky" written in red.
"I had never actually seen this piece in real life. [Deo] was one of the first people I met when I moved to New York City. ... Shortly after we met, he moved away, traumatized by Sept. 11," Lujan said. "When this exhibition came along, this seemed like a really good opportunity and for some reason that was one of the first works that sprung into my head and it felt like serendipity."
The exhibit is opening in coordination with the 50th anniversary of American Indian Community House, a New York City-based nonprofit that seeks to improve the well-being of Native Americans and better societal understanding of indigenous cultures.
Along with "Urban Indian," the museum will host events with American Indian Community House throughout the fall. There will be a Native American heritage celebration on Oct. 13 and a conversation on Nov. 5 with Native American New Yorkers who were born and raised in Brooklyn.
'Urban Indian: Native New York Now' is on display at the Museum of the City of New York from Friday through Feb. 15, 1220 Fifth Ave., mcny.org

Texto completo: The latest weekly tally includes 275 more reports of patients sickened, in 46 states. There are now 12 deaths linked to vaping-related lung injuries.
The number of people with lung illnesses linked to vaping has risen to 805, from last week's figure of 530 cases, and 12 people have died, compared to a total of seven last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported on Thursday.
The illnesses are widespread, with cases reported from 46 states so far, and the United States Virgin Islands. Ten states have reported deaths.
Based on 373 cases where data on the patients was available, the C.D.C. says that nearly three -quarters were male, two-thirds were 18 years to 34 years old and 16 percent were younger than 18 years.
People with the illnesses become weak and short of breath. Many need supplemental oxygen and treatment in intensive care units, and in some the lung damage is so severe that they must be placed on ventilators to keep them alive while their lungs recover. In a few cases, lung function has been so poor that ventilators were not enough, and the patients also had to be connected to machines that pump oxygen directly into the bloodstream.
Most of the patients have recovered enough to go home after days or weeks in the hospital, but doctors say it is too soon to tell whether they will suffer permanent damage to their lungs.
The case count started to snowball in August after health officials made the connection between vaping and the lung problems, and reported it publicly. Doctors around the country then began to realize it might explain some of the odd, pneumonia-like illnesses they were seeing in otherwise healthy people, and many began to question their patients about vaping. The rising numbers include new cases but also earlier ones that are just now being recognized as doctors look back at past patients whose illnesses were not understood at the time.
Many people who became sick have said they were vaping THC, the ingredient in marijuana that induces a high, but some patients report vaping only nicotine. Some of the patients who died were older and had underlying illnesses, health officials have said. But on Wednesday, Mississippi health officials reported a vaping-related death of a person who was under 30.
No specific ingredients or devices have been identified as the cause of the illnesses, and health experts say multiple devices or ingredients may be involved. Investigations are being conducted by the C.D.C., Food and Drug Administration and state health departments.
Given the unanswered questions about the exact cause of the illnesses, many health experts say people simply should not vape. Those who continue to do so should not buy vaping liquids off the street, or add ingredients to commercial products, the C.D.C. said. It emphasized that adults who do not smoke should not start using e-cigarettes, and that young people and pregnant women should never use them.
At a hearing Wednesday before a subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, a C.D.C. official said she was "extremely frustrated" at the pace of the investigation. "I wish we had answers already," said Dr. Anne Schuchat, the principal deputy director of the C.D.C. "I actually think there may be a very complex set of root causes here that are going to be difficult for us to address as a nation. And we need to take it very seriously."
Dr. Schuchat told the panel members that the agency's investigation was difficult because the suppliers of the THC products were underground and did not operate legally. The problem is compounded by a growing population of young people who are addicted to vaping, she said.
"We have a very vulnerable population and a very challenging supply chain to address," she said.
Nationwide, vaping has become a runaway train, with various private and public entities now trying to put on the brakes.

-
The Trump administration has said it would consider banning flavored e-cigarettes, which come in candy-like flavors that are widely seen as a lure for young people.
- Several television networks have stopped broadcasting ads for Juul, which dominates the market and makes the easy-to-hide devices that look like thumb drives and have become wildly popular among teenagers.
-
The governor of Massachusetts has issued a four-month ban on the sale of all vaping products, and Rhode Island, Michigan and New York have banned most flavored vapes.
- Walmart has said it would stop selling e-cigarettes.

Walmart has said it would stop selling e-cigarettes.
But vaping is a burgeoning industry around the world, and the global market for e-cigarettes reached about $ 11 billion in 2018, according to a report from Mordor Intelligence, a market research firm.
In 2019, more than one in four high-school seniors had vaped during the previous 30 days, according to a survey with a nationally representative sample of about 14,000 students by the University of Michigan's Monitoring the Future Study.
In a letter published in the New England Journal of Medicine, some of the researchers who conducted the survey said its findings suggested significant levels of nicotine addiction among teenagers, and they wrote, "New efforts are needed to protect youth from using nicotine during adolescence, when the developing brain is particularly susceptible to permanent changes from nicotine use and when almost all nicotine addiction is established.

Texto completo: Our guide to the city's best classical music and opera happening this weekend and in the week ahead.
CLEVELAND ORCHESTRA at Carnegie Hall (Oct. 3, 7 p.m.; Oct. 4, 8 p.m.). With a decent claim to being the nation's best, this ensemble opens the Carnegie season on Thursday in gala fashion. Expect the suite from Strauss's "Der Rosenkavalier," the overture to Nicolai's "The Merry Wives of Windsor" and two works by Beethoven: the Romance for Violin and Orchestra in G and the Triple Concerto. Anne-Sophie Mutter, Lynn Harrell and Yefim Bronfman are the soloists. Oct. 4 brings heavier fare, with Mahler's Symphony No. 5 preceded by Jörg Widmann's "Trauermarsch." Bronfman again is the soloist; Franz Welser-Möst conducts the lot.
212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org
JEREMY FILSELL at St. Thomas Church (Sept. 27, 7 p.m.). With Daniel Hyde departing for King's College, Cambridge, Filsell, the new organist and director of music at St. Thomas, opens his tenure with this recital at the church's grand organ. Fully a product of the English choral tradition, Filsell nonetheless specializes in French music: As well as pieces by the American composers and organists Julian Wachner, Calvin Hampton and Gerre Hancock, he performs works by Jean-Jacques Grunenwald and Marcel Dupré.

NEW JUILLIARD ENSEMBLE at Peter Jay Sharp Theater (Oct. 1, 7:30 p.m.). The tireless Joel Sachs conducts four works on this program, all of them recent, if not strictly new: Shulamit Ran's "Fault Line," with Lila Duffy the soprano; Magnus Lindberg's "Souvenir"; Alexander Goehr's "... Between the Lines"; and the premiere of a new version of Balazs Horvath's "Die ReAlisierung einer komPosition," featuring a Juilliard acting student, Michael Braugher, as a rapper. Admission is free.
212-799-5000, juilliard.edu
NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC at David Geffen Hall (Oct. 3, 7:30 p.m.; through Oct. 5). In an untypically conservative program, Jaap van Zweden conducts Berlioz's "Symphonie Fantastique" and Sibelius's Violin Concerto, with Augustin Hadelich. Earlier in the week (Tuesday, 7:30 p.m., at the Appel Room), Nadia Sirota hosts the first Sound ON concert of the season, with music by Jacob Druckman, John Luther Adams, Thea Musgrave and Ellen Reid.
212-875-5656, nyphil.org
'A NIGHT OF WOMEN COMPOSERS' at National Sawdust (Sept. 27, 7:30 p.m.). This Brooklyn concert space's fifth season opens with a tribute to seven women composers -- from Clara Schumann to Ellen Reid -- one that includes excerpts from Paola Prestini's "Silent Light" and Missy Mazzoli's "Proving Up." An enormous roster of artists will be on hand to perform, not least Timo Andres, Nico Muhly and the Young People's Chorus of New York City.
646-779-8455, nationalsawdust.org
'TURANDOT' at the Metropolitan Opera (Oct. 3, 7:30 p.m.; through Oct. 31). Franco Zeffirelli's dazzling production emerges for yet another run, despite continuing critical concern about the problematic way it deals with a problematic opera. Just 13 performances for the entire season, with five of them in April featuring Nina Stemme in the title role. For the October stretch, Christine Goerke dons Turandot's crown, with Eleonora Buratto as Liù, James Morris as Timur, and Yusif Eyvazov as Calàf during the first half of the month and Riccardo Massi in the role during the second half; Yannick Nézet-Séguin conducts all but two shows.

Texto completo: A barber who spent nearly a century of cutting hair in upstate New York "didn't know the meaning of the word retired."
When Anthony Mancinelli became a barber nearly a century ago, Warren Harding was in the White House, a haircut cost 25 cents and leeches were still used to treat high blood pressure.
As hairstyles changed over the decades, he adapted.
"I cut them all," he told The New York Times last year, "long hair, short hair, whatever was in style -- the shag, the Buster Brown, straight bangs, permanents."
"I have some customers, I cut their father, grandfather and great-grandfather -- four generations," he added.
Mr. Mancinelli never stopped cutting hair -- except to join the Army and serve in World War II -- and in his 90s he was recognized by Guinness World Records as the world's oldest working barber.
He died on Sept 19 at his home in New Windsor, N.Y., a Hudson River town about an hour's drive north of New York City. He was 108. His son, Bob, 82, said the cause was cancer of the jaw. His father had retired, reluctantly, only weeks before.
"He didn't know the meaning of the word retired," Bob Mancinelli said.
Anthony Mancinelli was born on March 2, 1911, near Naples, Italy, and emigrated to the United States with his family when he was 8, joining relatives in Newburgh, just north of Windsor. He began helping out in barbershops when he was 11 and started working as a barber when he was 12. He dropped out of high school to cut hair full time.
In 1930, he opened Anthony's Barbershop in Newburgh and kept it going for 40 years, before selling the business and going to work at other shops.
His fame began growing in earnest at age 96, when he was recognized by Guinness as the world's oldest working barber. The commendations kept rolling in -- from local civic groups, elected officials and barbering companies -- all congratulating him: at 100 years old, 101, 102 and so on.
"The longer he kept working, the more famous he got," said Jane Dinezza, the owner of Fantastic Cuts in New Windsor, the last salon where Mr. Mancinelli worked.
Over time, she said in a phone interview, she became less of his boss and more of a liaison to media outlets, as reporters started showing up to interview him, seating him in his own barber chair. "He was spending more time in the chair than his customers," Ms. Dinezza said.
Instead of paying the usual $ 20 for a haircut, many customers would insist on giving him up to $ 100 a cut, she said. And he was invited to so many events, she said, "I started saying, 'No, I'm sorry, it's just too much hoopla for him -- you know, he's not the pope."'
Mr. Mancinelli retained a trim build, a steady hand and a full head of snow- white hair. Even in his final years he spent long hours on his feet, in a pair of worn, cracked black leather shoes.
His good health baffled his doctor, he said. He was on no daily medication and never wore glasses.
"He never took a pill in his life," Ms. Dinezza said. "Towards the end, people would follow him through the grocery store just to ask him the secret to living that long. He'd just point up to God."
Longevity did not run in his family, and he was never big on exercise. Diet-wise, he said, "I eat thin spaghetti, so I don't get fat."
When pressed, Mr. Mancinelli would cite his love for his work and his avoidance of smoking and heavy drinking. Even after age 100, however, he did enjoy the occasional whiskey sour at his American Legion Post 1796 in New Windsor, where he was a member for 75 years.
In addition to his son, Mr. Mancinelli is survived by four grandchildren and several great- and great-great-grandchildren. His wife of 70 years, Carmella, died in 2004, and Mr. Mancinelli visited her grave every morning on his drive to work.
In recent months he had become weaker and even fell in the shop, his son said. Ms. Dinezza then broached the topic of retirement.
"He was angry about it -- he thought he could keep going," she said. "My daughter said, 'Don't do it, Mom, he'll just get a job at another salon."'
Mr. Mancinelli agreed to retire and relax at home. But he remained fiercely independent in his final years, living alone, doing his own shopping and cooking and laundry and religiously watching pro-wrestling on TV.
He also insisted on continuing to trim the hedges in his yard.
"He'd say, 'No, I'll trim them myself,"' his son said. "'I'm a barber."'

Texto completo: A whistleblower, a phone call and critical military aid are what set the House Democrats' formal impeachment inquiry into President Trump in motion this week.
The investigation is focused on a conversation between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which Trump pressed Zelensky to investigate former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, Trump's possible opponent in the 2020 presidential election. Trump has acknowledged that at the same time he was withholding aid to the country.
Here's a look at some of the main events that led up to the impeachment inquiry and what has happened since the announcement.

2014: The United States becomes one of Ukraine's strongest allies
President Obama's administration begins funneling millions of dollars in aid to Ukraine after the country's president, Viktor Yanukovich, was ousted in a 2014 revolution for backing separatists who supported Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimean peninsula. With a new but fragile pro-Western government in power, Vice President Biden oversees the effort in which U.S. funds are aimed at boosting Ukrainian armed forces in the face of Russia's military involvement.
Months after Biden assumed the role, his son Hunter Biden had joined the board of Burisma Holdings, a private Ukrainian natural gas company -- a position that has since raised some concerns about a potential conflict of interest. It was during this period that Burisma's owner was being investigated by Ukrainian prosecutors over possible financial abuses, although Hunter Biden was not accused of any wrongdoing.
White House officials pointed to Hunter Biden's status as a private citizen, and the vice president said his son made his own business decisions.
Late 2015: Obama administration and its European allies pressure Ukraine to remove top prosecutor
While Vice President Biden represents U.S. interests in Ukraine, the Obama administration and its European allies push to remove the country's top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, as part of a crackdown on corruption -- a long-standing problem in the country. As part of the maneuver, Biden threatens to withhold a $1-billion loan guarantee to Ukraine if Shokin doesn't resign.
Shokin had led the investigation into the owner of Burisma, although the inquiry was dormant at the time Biden pushed for the prosecutor's ousting, the Washington Post reported.
No evidence indicated Biden or his son acted improperly.
2016: Shokin is out
In March of 2016, Ukrainian officials vote to oust Shokin. The same year, a Kyiv district court finds no evidence of criminal wrongdoing by Burisma's owner, according to CNBC.
April 2019: Zelensky elected president of Ukraine
Hunter Biden's term on the Burisma board expires and he steps down from the company, according to Reuters.
The same month, comedian Volodymyr Zelensky is elected Ukraine's leader. He pledges to focus on ending the war against Russia-backed separatists in the country's east.
May 2019: Giuliani skips Ukraine trip after Democrats say he tried to recruit the country to help sway 2020 election
President Trump's personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani cancels a visit to Ukraine after Democrats denounce his effort to push the country to open investigations that he hoped would benefit Trump politically. Democrats say the plan signaled a clear attempt to recruit a foreign nation to influence a U.S. election.
"We're not meddling in an election, we're meddling in an investigation, which we have a right to do," said Giuliani in an interview with the New York Times.
July 25: The phone call
Trump directly asks Ukrainian President Zelensky for a "favor" while discussing U.S. military aid during a July 25 phone call, according to a White House memo that would later be released.
The phone call was one day after former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III testified before Congress on the nearly two-year investigation he led into Russian election interference in 2016 and potential obstruction of justice.
Aug. 12: Complaint filed
The whistleblower complaint is filed with the intelligence community's inspector general, Michael Atkinson.
Sept. 9: House Intelligence Committee notified of complaint
Atkinson notifies the House Intelligence Committee about the complaint, which he characterizes as "urgent" and "credible."
Sept. 13: Intelligence Committee chairman issues subpoena for complaint
Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Burbank) issues a subpoena for Joseph Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence, to appear before the panel after Schiff said Maguire had not transmitted the complaint to Congress within seven days, "in violation of the law."
Sept. 18: Reports emerge that Trump made a "promise" to a foreign leader
The Washington Post reports that the whistleblower complaint is about a conversation between Trump and a foreign leader.
Sept. 19: Intelligence inspector general refuses to tell Congress about whistleblower's complaint
The government's intelligence inspector general refuses to discuss the substance of the whistleblower complaint at a closed-door House Intelligence Committee meeting. Trump rejects the report as "fake news" and "presidential harassment."
Some of the whistleblower's allegations appear to center on Ukraine, according to reports from the Washington Post and the New York Times.
Sept. 20: Ukraine scandal emerges
Trump defends himself as House Democrats demand the release of the whistleblower complaint. The controversy refocuses attention on Trump's attempts to undercut Biden after reports that the president urged Ukrainian officials to investigate Hunter Biden's business dealings for possible corruption.
Tuesday: House Democrats launch an impeachment inquiry
Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) announces that the House will begin a formal impeachment inquiry of the president.
"The actions of the Trump presidency have revealed the dishonorable fact of the president's betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security and betrayal of the integrity of our elections," Pelosi says. "No one is above the law."
Wednesday: The memo is released
The White House releases its account of the 30-minute Trump-Zelensky call.
According to the memo, Trump asked Zelensky both to investigate Biden and to look into CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm that did work for the Democrats in the 2016 election. Trump asked Zelensky at least five separate times on the call to work with Atty. Gen. William Barr on such investigations.
Thursday: The complaint is released and Maguire testifies
The House Intelligence Committee releases a redacted version of the complaint in which a whistleblower alleges that White House officials took unusual steps to secure the transcript of Trump's July 25 call with Zelensky.
In the complaint, the whistleblower told the intelligence community's inspector general that Trump was "using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election."
Pelosi characterizes the whistleblower's account as evidence of a White House "cover-up." She says the allegations about Trump's contacts with Ukraine would now be the central focus of the Democrats' impeachment investigation.
At a contentious House committee hearing Thursday morning, Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence, is criticized by Democrats for initially failing to disclose the whistleblower's complaint.
The Los Angeles Times reports that, meanwhile, Trump raged at the Democrats' new impeachment proceedings and slammed the intelligence officer and the White House aides who helped the whistleblower as "almost a spy," and suggested it was treason.

Texto completo: There's a common thread that stretches forward from Donald Trump's financial scandals of the 1980s to his damning phone call with the president of Ukraine.
It's the self-dealing.
Wherever he was, whatever his title, the president has used the powers at his disposal to enrich or otherwise benefit himself, regardless of what law, fiduciary duty or oath of office bound him to do.
Trump ran his campaign in 2016 on a single premise: greed. (Okay, two premises: greed and racism.) He boasted to his fans about his (inflated) wealth and gilded lifestyle, both products of clever deployments of his avarice. It was a trait he promised, paradoxically, that he'd apply more altruistically once elected.
"My whole life I've been greedy, greedy, greedy," he said at a January 2016 rally. "I've grabbed all the money I could get. I'm so greedy. But now I want to be greedy for the United States. I want to grab all that money. I'm going to be greedy for the United States."
His track record suggested that would be unlikely, perhaps impossible - in part because his life has always been about blurring lines between personal gain and professional or legal responsibilities.
This was the case when the Trump family set up a shell company called All County Building Supply & Maintenance in the early 1990s, to pretend to purchase boilers, cleaning supplies and other building equipment from (real) vendors. This middleman, which existed only on paper, then "resold" everything at an inflated price to the Trump Organization. The purpose of the shell company was to allow Trump's father, Fred, to transfer huge cash gifts to his children as though they were ordinary business transactions. This helped the Trump family evade a 55 percent estate tax, as the New York Times reported last year.
It was also the case from the 1980s through the past presidential campaign, as Trump siphoned funds from his charity for his personal benefit. He used Trump Foundation money to settle legal disputes involving his for-profit companies, to renovate a fountain outside one of his hotels and to buy enormous portraits of himself, as my Post colleague David A. Fahrenthold documented.
It was likewise the case when his once-publicly-traded company, Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts, inflated financial results in a way that the Securities and Exchange Commission said served to mislead investors. And also when his private company allegedly provided false sales figures for real estate developments in Mexico, Panama, Toronto and New York.
And so on.
Such cases repeatedly showed that Trump had no problem draining money from bondholders, investors or tax coffers if he thought he could get away with it. They also illustrated exactly how he might govern as president: in his own interest.
Trump's supporters shrugged off his refusal to divest from his business interests, arguing that it didn't matter if he continued to make money while president so long as he still did right by the country. But we knew at some point he'd have to decide between a policy that benefited the country and one that benefited himself.
And we knew which choice he'd make.
So it was no surprise that his administration abruptly canceled the planned relocation of the FBI headquarters, which might have allowed the existing site to be redeveloped into a hotel that would compete with the nearby Trump International Hotel.
Or that foreign leaders and business executives have patronized this and other Trump properties around the world, in a transparent attempt to influence U.S. policy on aid, arms deals and merger approvals. In fact, during their now-infamous July 25 call, the Ukrainian president made sure to note a recent stay at a Trump property in New York.
It's likewise shocking, but not altogether surprising, that military personnel have had unnecessary layovers at Trump's Scottish resort. Or that Vice President Pence stayed at the president's Irish resort while attending meetings 180 miles away. Or that the Secret Service has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars at a single Trump hotel - in Washington.
This is exactly the kind of stuff that worried those who wrung their hands about his shady, self-dealing, private-sector past.
Moreover, given Trump's rampant small-time grifting in public, it seemed impossible to imagine he wouldn't go after bigger fish in private - including, say, extorting a foreign power into smearing a political rival.
Trump maintains that his call with the Ukrainian president was "perfect." And, hey, maybe he genuinely believes this. Indeed, the best defense you can give for Trump's actions is that after all these years he has become incapable of telling the difference between his own interests and anyone else's - and by extension, what it means to be "greedy" for himself vs. "greedy" for the United States.
Perhaps for Trump, as for France's Louis XIV, "l'état, c'est moi."

Texto completo: If the documented history is to be believed, the odyssey of the African American began in 1619 with the arrival of the privateer The White Lion, which brought 20 African slaves ashore in the British colony of Jamestown, Virginia 400 hundred years ago! 22 years after that, in 1641 are fates were sealed when the institution was legalized!!! Forced bondage was ingrained into our society. It was another 200 plus years before that was rectified. In perspective, it's a ridiculous notion that modern society wants to ignore or minimize the reverberations caused by these inhumane practices. That's why the work of historians, griots, documentari ans and artists willing to serve a reminder of that from which we came are of great import.
This week past, we will see if recently revealed works will become pivotal fixtures in the consciousness in generations going forward. The first of these was unveiled at the 2019 UrbanWorld Film Festival. This year, the 23rd annual, saw the UrbanWorld Film Festival, along with founding partner HBO, feature 78 official selections and 7 spotlight selections representing inclusion in the broadest sense, highlighting content from around the globe by creators of color and women.
"Each year we strive to expand our programming slate to expose stories, themes and characters that have been under-represented in our world. This year is no exception," said Gábriellé Glore, festival director & head of programming, UrbanWorld Film Festival. "What is most exciting to see is the continued elevation of quality manifested across our content creators' work, as we celebrate their creativity and craft." The centerpiece of the Festival was undoubtedly the opening night kick off where Focus Features' debuted the powerhouse film, 'Harriet.' The film stars Tony-winning Broadway actress Cynthia Erivo in the Kasi Lemmons directed inspiring biopic about renowned abolitionist Harriet Tubman, who escaped slavery and risked her life to lead others to freedom through the network of safe houses known as the Underground Railroad. Erivo, Lemmons and producers Debra Martin Chase (Black Girls Rock "Shot Caller" award winner) and Daniela Taplin Lundberg were all on hand to present the power women flexed in getting this story to the masses. Lemmons, who also served as this year's festival ambassador, offered, "I'm thrilled to share Harriet with the UrbanWorld Film Festival audience. The experience of creating this film was lifechanging for me in so many ways," said Lemmons. "We were honored to open this festival and discussing our journey with such a passionate group of film lovers." The award-winning director, writer, actress and professor's feature films include "Eve's Bayou," "The Caveman's Valentine," "Talk to Me" and "Black Nativity." She is currently directing the first two episodes of the 4-part Netflix mini-series "Madam CJ Walker." Closer to the crib, New York Times best-selling author Ta-Nehisi Coates returned to the Apollo stage to kick off the national book tour for his heavily anticipated first novel, "The Water Dancer." The night was elevated to magical when it was announced that Oprah Winfrey would interview the Apollo Theater's inaugural master artist-in-residence. In his latest work, Ta-Nehisi Coates, the National Book Award-winning author of "Between the World and Me" and "We Were Eight Years in Power," brings home the most intimate evil of enslavement: the cleaving and separation of families. Driven by the author's fierce imagination and striking ability to bring readers deep into the interior lives of his brilliantly rendered characters, "The Water Dancer" is the story of America's oldest struggle-the struggle to tell the truth-from one of Americas most exciting writers. The banter and chemistry of the pair was worth the admission price alone. Oprah envisioned herself in the story and noted that she would be destined for fieldwork, as she was not 'Big House' material. "I definitely wasn't cut out for the big house. That's why it feels good to own a big house," she quipped. The launch of "The Water Dancer" book tour and Coates's appointment as Apollo Theaters inaugural artist-in-residence further enforces the nonprofit theater's commitment to celebrating African American arts and culture, supporting emerging and established artists of color across disciplines, and serving as an artistic, educational, and community resource. As it should. Over and out. Holla next week. Until then enjoy the Nightlife.

Ukraine scandal: Trump's new impeachable offense is threatening the life of a CIA officer

Texto completo: We now know that The New York Times has reported that the government official who blew the whistle on President Donald Trump’s attempts to use a foreign government for his own corrupt purposes was a member of the CIA who was detailed to the White House. We should not know this, because in a matter of days or perhaps hours — maybe even by the time you read this — we will probably know the man’s name and everything else about him.
This is a problem, because there are people who want to do harm to this whistleblower and his colleagues. Prominent among them is the president of the United States himself, who has already said that he would like to know the identities of those who have placed him in jeopardy (or, in yet more jeopardy) of impeachment. Indeed, Trump thinks the whistleblower should be dealt with as an enemy spy and a traitor to the state.
In his usual emulation of the mob bosses and dictators he admires, the president said: “I want to know who’s the person, who’s the person who gave the whistleblower the information? Because that’s close to a spy. You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now. ”
He means the death penalty, of course.
This is the same president who thought he could mend fences with the intelligence community at the start of his term by giving a speech at the most sacred place at the CIA, in front of the wall of unmarked stars that commemorate American intelligence professionals who gave their lives in the course of their duties. As usual, Trump couldn’t help himself, and instead of showing respect to the people who died in anonymity to protect the nation, he talked about his favorite subject: himself.
CIA officer trying to do his job
This time, a CIA officer is trying to protect his nation by warning his superiors of a danger emanating from the Oval Office itself. This was not some rogue nitwit stuffing classified material in her pantyhose like Reality Winner, or a self-important stooge like Edward Snowden collaborating with our avowed enemies overseas. This is an intelligence community professional who, as Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph McGuire confirmed repeatedly to the House Intelligence Committee, went through all the proper channels and observed every legal necessity to alert his colleagues that the president was trying to muscle an American friend under attack by Russia into doing his personal bidding.
The whistleblower’s reward for observing proper procedure has been a chorus of orchestrated Republican talking points aimed at discrediting him and his motives. The message from the GOP is clear to this and any other whistleblower who might ever threaten a Republican president: Cross our Dear Leader, and we will destroy you. Such is the patriotism of a party that is now nothing more than a seedy cult of personality. Even Sen. Mitt Romney — not exactly a tower of courage himself these days — said recently about the Republicans trying to avert their eyes from Trump’s misdeeds: “I think it's very natural for people to look at circumstances and see them in the light that's most amenable to their maintaining power, and doing things to preserve that power. ”
Trump’s apologists will wave away his comments (including his reference to journalists as “scum”) as just another meaningless example of the president’s swaggering New York style of verbal venting. It might be acceptable for a rich kid from Queens to talk like a sociopathic mobster or beetle-browed junta enforcer when he’s trying to bully the local stonemasons and carpenters on his latest slapdash condo project, but it is utterly unacceptable in a president of the United States. The House Judiciary Committee should add this threat against a CIA officer to its list of impeachable offenses.
Trump’s unhinged rhetoric has inspired unstable people to take matters into their own hands, including one who is now in prison for sending bombs. The president must be called to account for his abuses of power sooner rather than later, but every decent American left in public life must immediately demand that he stop any further attacks on this whistleblower, before it’s too late and there’s another star on the wall at Langley.

Ukraine memo clouds over AG William Barr

Texto completo: One of the most shocking revelations in the transcript of President Donald Trump's phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was that so much of what Trump had to say on the call focused just on getting Ukrainian officials to investigate his political opponents. Another surprise was the fact that Trump said repeatedly that Attorney General William Barr would be running point, working with Trump's private attorney Rudy Giuliani, on these matters.
These facts now implicate the attorney general, the nation's chief law enforcement officer, directly in the commission of acts that many of the country's leading legal experts consider federal crimes -- whether as election law violations, bribery or other offenses concerning public corruption.
The revelation of Barr's possible involvement should alarm all of us concerned about the rule of law in this country. At a minimum, it's no longer sustainable for this attorney general to oversee the Justice Department's handling of the Ukraine scandal.
Consider a contrast: One of the most egregious acts revealed in the Mueller report was when the president asked then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to "take (a) look" at investigating Hillary Clinton. Sessions refused. Not to his great credit, though, because the right answer is so obviously to refrain.
Even Barr seems to understand the extreme impropriety of what the transcript suggests. Hence Barr's formal statement, issued soon after the transcript's release, suggesting that what Trump told Ukraine's president about the attorney general's role was essentially false.
But Barr long ago lost the benefit of the doubt. We cannot accept at face value what he says when it comes to the defense of the president or himself.
What's even more egregious here is to think of the transcript in relation to what else Barr may have been doing in handling the Ukraine matter.
It's deeply concerning to now know that Barr's Justice Department told the director of national intelligence to withhold the whistleblower's complaint from Congress, while Barr admits he knew at the time that he was named on the phone call at the heart of the whistleblower's allegations. Perhaps that would be excusable if the Justice Department's advice to the director was ordinary and well within the law. But the DOJ advice was not close to that line. Even Fox News' Judge Andrew Napolitano has called the DOJ legal theory for withholding the whistleblower's complaint "cockamamie."
Layer onto all of these concerns another revelation in Wednesday's news -- according to The New York Times, the director of national intelligence and the inspector general of the intelligence community each referred the whistleblower's complaint to the Justice Department for a possible criminal investigation into the president's actions. Within a matter of days, it seems Barr's Justice Department somehow reached the conclusion that the complaint could not even trigger an investigation because the allegations could not involve a crime.
Barr's Justice Department came up with the idea that "the information discussed on the call didn't amount to a 'thing of value' that could be quantified," according to BuzzFeed News. That logic flies in the face of what the nation's foremost legal experts, including Trump's deputy solicitor general, concluded in the Mueller report. In the case of Ukraine, just chalking up all of Giuliani's out-of-pocket expenses in the hunt for fake dirt on Biden would likely show the immense value that he and Trump placed on the information.
Finally, what makes matters worse for Barr is that the president has twice publicly discussed having the attorney general investigate allegations involving Ukraine, Clinton and Biden. And the attorney general famously tried to avoid answering Sen. Kamala Harris' simple question whether the White House ever asked him to investigate anyone. After the release of the Ukraine-gate transcript, the cloud over Bill Barr is thick. There's one way for him to remove it. Step aside.

Texto completo: The mother of the alleged victim told the police that the girls who attacked her daughter on a school bus used racial slurs.
Two girls, 10 and 11, face criminal charges of harassment and assault of a 10-year-old girl on a school bus in a small upstate New York town, in an episode that the local police are treating as a racial hate crime.
The two girls charged in the alleged attack, which occurred on Sept. 10, are white, and the girl who was assaulted is black, the police in the Village of Gouverneur, in St. Lawrence County, said.
It is now up to county probation officials to decide whether the accused girls should be prosecuted in family court, a probation department supervisor said. The girls were charged as juveniles.
"The loss of civility in this world is being played out in the realm of 10- and 11-year-olds," Lauren French, the local school superintendent, said in an interview on Wednesday. "There is no shade of gray in this. This event was wrong on all levels."
The girl who was assaulted had her right eye blackened from being punched, lost hair when it was pulled and bruised her knee after falling backward onto a school bus seat during the attack, the police said.
A bus aide who was riding with the children at the time and did not intervene was charged with three counts of endangering the welfare of a child, the police said.
"That this was allegedly perpetrated by her own classmates, on a school bus with an adult monitor present, makes this incident even more shocking and troubling," Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said in a statement.
Mr. Cuomo, who noted in his statement that the episode had lasted 20 minutes, said that he was directing the state Division of Human Rights to open an investigation. He also said he had asked the Hate Crimes Task Force to assist the local authorities.
The arrests coincide with a national push to treat acts of bullying among juveniles as crimes, sometimes at the request of victims' parents. It also coincides with a rise in hate-crime incidents in schools across the United States; 753 such cases were reported in 2017, according to F.B.I. data.
"A lot of people are saying that by calling it bullying, we are not taking it as seriously as we could, and not treating it as damaging and harmful as it really is," said Amanda Nickerson, director of the Alberti Center for Bullying Abuse Prevention at the University at Buffalo. "Some are arguing we have to elevate this to other levels."
Some municipalities have enacted local laws that can lead to parents being fined for their children's actions. In North Tonawanda, N.Y., near Buffalo, parents may be fined $ 250 and jailed up to 15 days if their children engage in bullying behavior. Gouverneur does not have such a law.
Ms. French, the schools superintendent, said that she agreed with the police's decision to treat the episode as a crime, as did Mayor Ronald P. McDougall of Gouverneur.
But some anti-bullying advocates said they believe the drive to turn young children into criminals over such behavior has gone too far.
"Parents are out for blood," said Ross Ellis, the founder and chief executive of Stomp Out Bullying.org, a national organization. "I had a mother call me who wanted a 3-year-old on the playground arrested. I get that you don't want your child beaten up, but it's got to stop on both ends."
Ms. Ellis said that the girls accused of bullying should receive counseling and that school officials and the girls' parents should meet to explore the roots of the behavior. "It's a terrible thing that happened, but make it a teachable moment," she said.
Gouverneur, which has 4,000 residents and is about 30 miles from the Canadian border, is 95 percent white and 1 percent black, according to 2010 census data.
The police said that their inquiry began on Sept. 10, when the alleged victim's mother filed a complaint saying that her daughter had been subjected to "racially motivated language" and beaten up on the bus.
The police arrested the two girls on Monday after a two-week investigation, charging them with second-degree harassment. The 11-year-old was also charged with third-degree assault as a hate crime, the police said.
The bus aide, Tiffany N. Spicer of Edwards, N.Y., who is also white, was employed by the First Student bus company. She was released on appearance tickets and ordered to appear in court at a later date, the police said. She could not be reached for comment.
Jay Brock, a First Student spokesman, said in a statement that Ms. Spicer, 28, had been placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of the police investigation. "We, too, take this incident very seriously," Mr. Brock said.
Last week, a case involving the arrest of even younger children after an episode of school violence gained wide attention. On Monday, a reserve officer with the Orlando Police Department was fired after he arrested two 6-year-olds in separate incidents at a charter school without the proper approval. One of the children had kicked a staff member, and was handcuffed and charged with battery. The charges were later dropped.
It is not uncommon for young people to be charged with hate crimes. In 2017, 17 percent of those arrested and charged with committing hate crimes in the United States were under 18, according to the latest available F.B.I. data.
And while hate crimes at schools have increased, reported incidents of bullying at schools have declined in recent years. The National Center for Education Statistics found that 20 percent of students 12 to 18 reported being bullied at school in 2017, down from 29 percent in 2005.

Texto completo: While the companies are similar, their executives don't want a competition
The merging of large media companies often fans anxiety around declining print subscriptions, the pressure for online clicks and the competition that social media poses to mainstream news outlets.
But Vox Media and New York Media are attempting to tell a different story: a partnership driven by shared ambition instead of mere survival. On Tuesday, Vox announced it was acquiring New York Media in an all-stock transaction that combines their print, digital and podcast platforms.
It's a strategy media experts say could work because of the similarities in Vox and New York Media's online brands. And if executives can keep their promise and avoid editorial layoffs, analysts say, the combination would stand apart from other media mergers that hollow out journalistic ranks to meet financial targets.
"This sounds as if it could be a 'good merger' for once, not one that is cheered by Wall Street because they're going to lay off hundreds of people," said Jane Hall, an associate professor of media studies at American University. "So we'll see."
The acquisition will include New York Media's namesake print magazine, which has chronicled characters from the city's high rollers to its bottom feeders for more than five decades. New York Media also has an array of websites focusing on food, politics, style and culture, including the Cut, Grub Street and Vulture.
Vox's digital portfolio has similar coverage areas. They include SB Nation, the Verge, Polygon, Eater, Curbed and Recode.
Jim Bankoff, the Vox Media chief executive and chairman, and Pam Wasserstein, the CEO of New York Media, said the merger will not diminish the brands of either company or spark a competitive showdown. Rather, they said, the deal is a logical step.
Wasserstein said in a statement that as she talked with Bankoff about "what the future might look like together, it quickly became apparent that our companies pair incredibly well."
"Vox is kind of like a family of sites, and the digital part of New York is a family of sites," said Rick Edmonds, a media business analyst at the Poynter Institute, a nonprofit journalism training center. "It's kind of a 'Brady Bunch' story when you put them all together." (At least one person took the marriage metaphor one step further.)
Still, there was some initial eyebrow-raising at the sudden shake-up. In August, the merger between Gannett and GateHouse Media came amid turmoil for the print newspaper industry and marked an uncertain new chapter for a former titan of American media.
With their online and magazine products, Vox and New York Media are distinct from Gannett and other traditional newspaper companies. But they face many of the same head winds in charting a future that both satisfies readers and makes financial sense. In an email to employees, which was widely circulated online, New York Magazine editor in chief David Haskell wrote that he "had a rush of vertigo" when he first heard about the deal.
"Change is alarming," he wrote, before going on to explain his excitement.
Bankoff and Wasserstein told the New York Times that Vox expects to remain profitable, even with the addition of New York Media. Two people familiar with the deal told the Times that Vox expects to exceed $300 million in revenue by the end of 2020 putting it on par, in terms of annual revenue, with BuzzFeed.
In March, New York Media laid off 16 full-time staffers and another 16 freelancers or part-time employees as it underwent a restructuring. The cut represented roughly 5 percent of New York Media's full-time staff, CNN reported.
New York Magazine's union released a statement Wednesday morning saying that while Wasserstein "attempted to reassure us that our day-to-day professional lives will remain the same," employees were "deeply unsettled" by the way they found out. The union said that staff learned of the deal only after the New York Times published an article and after a news release was issued.
In public statements, Bankoff and Wasserstein held themselves apart from other media mergers they said were meant to "buy some time or quickly change a narrative if a company has failed to innovate." They wrote that they've "observed a spate of mergers and acquisitions in our sector and have often been struck by their lackluster rationales and ambitions."
By contrast, they wrote, "this combination is solely about leadership, growth, and opportunity. Two companies that are already strong - creatively, financially, and culturally - are coming together to be even stronger."
Bankoff will remain at the helm of the expanded Vox, and Wasserstein will take on a new role as president of Vox, overseeing initiatives including consumer businesses and the current New York Media brands.
Edmonds said it will probably take years before Bankoff, Wasserstein and their teams sort out how to integrate Vox and New York Media's products. For example, the merger could pose an opening to drive more traffic across the brands and give advertisers more placement options.
Time will tell, Edmonds said.
"They always say it's a perfect marriage," he said. "And sometimes it is. Sometimes it isn't."

Peter Gelb, step down! Why the Met Opera's general manager is unfit to lead

Texto completo: It seems that Peter Gelb, the general manager of New York City's world-famous Metropolitan Opera, doesn't think we know what “corroboration" means.
According to reporting by NPR's Anastasia Tsioulcas, Gelb called a meeting on Saturday with the opera company's orchestra and chorus, in response to concerns about superstar singer Plácido Domingo. The subject: why he hadn't suspended or investigated Domingo, a Met favorite for over 50 years who was cast in two fall productions, in light of 20 women accusing the singer of workplace sexual harassment that spanned decades .
Asking that those present keep it in confidence, Gelb allegedly gave these reasons. First, the women were all anonymous. (Wrong: two allowed journalists to use their names.) Second, he said they had only come forward to the Associated Press, which published the allegations over two articles, and not other credible news outlets. Thus, Gelb reportedly said, the reporting lacked “corroboration."
Lacked corroboration. And this from the son of legendary newspaperman Arthur Gelb. Either Peter Gelb didn't have the facts straight, or he deliberately fed his staff . . . shall we call them “alternative facts?"
Domingo, who has disputed the allegations, withdrew from his planned appearances at the Met late Tuesday afternoon, issuing a statement that indicated he would not return to the opera house. An accompanying statement from the Met suggested the opera house had asked for his resignation. Does that settle the matter?
Not this time. It's too late. With his decision to go all-in defending the Spanish singer, Gelb proved that he cares more about one powerful, profitable man than the well-being of his staff. And with that, he's proven himself unfit to lead America's most iconic opera house.
So most of the accusers were anonymous. Of course they were! Reputation is everything in music: just one assertion that a musician is difficult to work with can spell doom. Two accusers, Angela Turner Wilson and Patricia Wulf, spoke on the record using their full names. One's a teacher. One's retired. The stakes aren't as high.
Now, let's talk corroboration. The AP articles describe how the allegations were supported and fact-checked. For the first article, the AP spoke with “almost three dozen" other opera-world professionals who confirmed Domingo's behavior, verified the accusers worked where they said they did, and talked to colleagues the accusers confided in. For the second article, the AP obtained Wilson's diary from 1999. These stories show the same patterns of behavior: late-night phone calls, unwanted kisses, clandestine strategies to avoid being alone with Domingo backstage. They read like a twisted rendition of the catalog aria from “Don Giovanni" — this many in L.A., this many in D.C., this many in Texas . . . “if she wears a skirt, you know what he does."
And if the AP hadn't been enough for him, Gelb would have only needed to look at articles from NPR or The New York Times (his dad's old paper), for which Wulf also spoke on the record.
No matter what journalists say, or how clearly they explain their rigorous process of reporting and verifying these stories, one gets the feeling that short of Domingo acting out in front of Gelb's eyes, no evidence was ever going to be enough. To him, the word of that one man was more important than that of 20 women. All this while other American companies struck Domingo from the roster, Europe continued to receive him with standing ovations, and the singer's superfans unleashed volleys of vitriol at anyone, reporter or opera fan, who posted a negative word online about their cherished Maestro.
If Gelb was attempting to reassure his rankled rank-and-file staff, he failed, and multiplied his troubles while he was at it. Gelb has gotten into dustups with the media before, but largely in response to negative reviews of Met productions. And classical music news usually doesn't make waves outside of a small network of enthusiasts (just ask my click count). But questioning the integrity of both the accusations and the AP's fact-checking? That'll get Gelb attention, and not the kind he wants. Even Brad Hoylman, the New York state senator for the district including Lincoln Center,weighed in with a tweet that called the treatment of the women “appalling" and pushed for Domingo to withdraw.
It's not like the Met is a stranger to handling allegations of backstage sex-pestery. The day after The New York Times published allegations of sexual abuse against longtime Met head honcho (and former Boston Symphony Orchestra music director) James Levine in December 2017, Gelb announced that Levine had been suspended and all his further Met conducting engagements were canceled. A scant several weeks later, stage director John Copley was dismissed from the Met's production of Rossini's “Semiramide" after a male chorister complained about a sexually charged remark. And just yesterday, the Met suspended tenor Vittorio Grigolo from all future performances pending an investigation by The Royal Opera; last week while touring Japan with the London company, Grigolo allegedly groped a female performer during a curtain call.
But in the Domingo case, the Met held to its initial decision to wait for the results of LA Opera's independent investigation, which was announced the same day the AP's first article came out. Why did Gelb double down to defend Domingo till the last minute?
I'll take a wild guess and say it's mostly about dollar bills. In an era of declining ticket sales, big names like Domingo sell seats. On Tuesday morning, seat maps for his Sept. 25 and 28 performances of Verdi's “Macbeth" (opposite Russian soprano Anna Netrebko, another singer with a colossal fanbase who has been openly dismissive of #MeToo allegations) showed that the 3,800-seat house was almost entirely sold out.
That doesn't happen often. And with Domingo scheduled to perform so early in the season, it was unlikely that any findings would surface in LA Opera's investigation before he appeared a few times.
What's more, Domingo has friends in very high places. To name one, there's Met Board of Directors chair Ann Ziff, who has given many millions to the Met and sits on LA Opera's board alongside Domingo. In the past two years, she underwrote exclusive 50th anniversary galas in the singer's honor at both the Met and LA Opera.
Whatever the reasons for Gelb's circling the wagons around Domingo, he simultaneously created a toxic environment for his staff and confirmed my worst fears about opera. His response reinforces a paradigm of opera as a hidebound, hierarchical world, where venerated men get away with absolutely anything. In the meantime, artists who depend on good relationships with the powerful few (a.k.a. almost everyone else working in opera) must stoically sing past all kinds of inappropriate behavior — or leave the field entirely.
It's time to ask: what do we want opera to stand for? I know what I want: I want an opera world where no one has to worry about giggling and smiling through harassment when they go to work. I want a world where having a famous name, or the support of the top 0.01 percent, or legions of adoring fans to descend on accusers and critics, doesn't mean it's easier to escape accountability. I want a world where less sympathy is given to abusers than those they abused, no matter how well those abusers might sing.
It's time for Gelb to go, and take the board with him. Time to bring in a team that wants to reclaim the beautiful living tradition of opera for the 21st century, this messy epoch that people still see as a newborn despite its being old enough to vote and almost old enough to drink. And until that happens, the Met Opera deserves every empty seat inside that house. Let them be testaments to all the singers and other professionals who ever learned, in some way or another, that what they survived didn't matter.

Texto completo: I’ve been lucky.
In February 1968, I came down to Washington from the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism to do some research, stopped up at The Washington Post and walked out with a job. A week later, for reasons I never understood, I got a raise. After graduating in June, I started work, and now, 51 years later, I am about to stop. This is my final column. I think I’ve earned that raise.
In 1976, eight years after I started, I was offered a local column. Ben Bradlee, the executive editor, made the offer at a lunch I had requested so I could tell him I was quitting. A rival news organization had offered to make me its White House correspondent. But before I could resign, Bradlee upset my plans. I never got around to quitting and never told Bradlee that I had intended to.
I was lucky.
Bradlee asked me to show him five sample columns. Instead, knowing I need the juice of a deadline, I wrote one the next day and gave it to the city editor. “I’m the new local columnist,” I brazenly told him. “Check with Bradlee.” He never did.
The next day, my column was in the paper.
I was lucky.
Back then I wrote three columns a week - an exhausting but exhilarating schedule. Little by little, I broadened my scope until, in Bradlee’s telling, he picked up the paper one day and discovered that I was in Beirut. By fiat, he moved me from the metro page to the A section and, later, at the insistence of the publisher, to the op-ed page. I wrote what I wanted from where I wanted, and not once did the publishers ever tell me what to write or what not to write. On occasion, though, Katharine Graham offered some constructive criticism. Once, at a formal lunch for the new Russian ambassador, she strode purposely across the dining room to tell me that my column that morning “was a real piece of s...”
“Don’t hold back, Katharine,” I responded. “Tell me what you really think.”
She laughed.
There were no better bosses then the Grahams - and, more recently, Jeff Bezos. I roamed the world on their dime. Flying into Cairo for the first time, I looked out the window. A sandstorm obscured the pyramids, but I envisioned them anyway and I could not get over the fact that I was being paid to see them. What fools the Grahams were. I would have done it for nothing.
Back in 2017, I helped produce a documentary for HBO on the life of Ben Bradlee. HBO called it “The Newspaperman,” and I thought, how wonderful, how apt. That was Bradlee and, with the same permission he gave me to write a column, I take that appellation for myself as well. It is, I think, the highest of callings, and I never wanted to be anything else. You go to work and someone pins an imaginary badge on you and deputizes you to go forth and discover life, ask questions, turn over rocks and, in the case of a column, think so hard it’s physically draining.
I had grown up reading the once-liberal New York Post. It was a brave, scrappy paper with great, iconoclastic writers, particularly its columnists. I gorged on Murray Kempton, Jimmy Cannon and Pete Hamill. I read them all, envied them all and wanted to be like them. Later, I became a copyboy for the New York Herald Tribune and noticed that reporters were required to read the paper. They got paid for it. Amazing. Professional ballplayers must feel the same way. Imagine getting paid to play a game!
That first day at the Post, I was assigned a desk next to Carl Bernstein. We became fast friends and so, like a barnacle on a ship, I attached myself to him and Bob Woodward, going through Watergate with them. Earlier, I watched in awe and pride as the Post risked all sorts of legal and financial penalties to publish the Pentagon Papers after The New York Times had been enjoined from doing so. This was one great newspaper that I had just walked into. Again, what luck!
Now it is over. I have written books and screenplays and will continue to do so. My girlfriend and I are going to Paris for a month and we’re getting a dog. I will have time to walk it now. I will miss newspapering, but I know I had the best it ever had to offer.
I was very lucky indeed.

Texto completo: On May 1, The New York Times published a story that contained the most important facets of the Ukraine story. The Times reported that President Donald Trump, through his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, was pressing Ukraine's government to investigate Joe Biden. And yet, having uncovered a massive scandal, The Times buried its own scoop. The revelation, which many people now see an an impeachable offense, was buried in the middle of a story that was primarily devoted to carrying Mr. Trump's water.
Headlined "Biden Faces Conflict of Interest Questions That Are Being Promoted by Trump and Allies," the story spun out a version of the narrative Mr. Giuliani has been trying to implant in the media. It suggested that, during his tenure as vice-president, Joe Biden took untoward action to help his son Hunter's business in Ukraine by demanding the firing of a prosecutor who was investigating him.
The news about Mr. Trump's role arrived only after nine paragraphs of insinuations against Mr. Biden. And then, after a brief detour that casually reveals that the Biden story is the product of an extraordinary abuse of power by the president, it returns to a long unspooling of the Biden-Ukraine narrative.
Even at the time, and especially in retrospect, it was an example of extremely bizarre journalistic judgment. ...
The Times article had important ramifications. It immediately cast Mr. Trump's Biden campaign as an oh-by-the-way detail, allowing the scandal to fester unremarked in the background for months until happenstance thrust it back into the headlines.
The strange saga of The Times scoop also suggests something more disturbing: that Mr. Trump has hacked into the mainstream media's ethics and turned them to his advantage. What's more, even now that his conduct has been exposed, Mr. Trump's gambit that he could abuse his power to discredit an opponent may yet succeed.
The alleged Biden scandal that The Times was attempting to plumb has been conclusively debunked. Mr. Biden's call for firing a notoriously ineffectual Ukrainian prosecutor was in line with the stance not only of the Obama administration but the IMF, the World Bank, Western allies and good-government types of all sorts. What's more, the case against the Ukrainian firm that employed Hunter Biden had been dormant before the prosecutor's firing.
Mr. Trump has presented his demands that Ukraine investigate Mr. Biden as high-minded opposition to "corruption." This turns reality on its head. Mr. Biden was pushing Ukraine to root out corruption, and Messrs. Trump and Giuliani are working hand in hand with the most corrupt elements in the Ukrainian polity - the actors who secretly hired Paul Manafort to elect pro-Russian kleptocrats. Mr. Trump, meanwhile, has displayed a notable indifference to foreign corruption. He has publicly disparaged the federal law preventing American businesses from bribing foreign officials, and enforcement of the law has plummeted under his administration.

Texto completo: The inquiry into President Trump has the potential to reshape his presidency. Here's how impeachment works.
WASHINGTON -- Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced Tuesday that the House would launch a formal impeachment inquiry in response to the dispute over Mr. Trump's efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate his potential 2020 rival, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.
The rising furor has heightened interest in how the impeachment process works. Here's what you need to know:
What is impeachment?
The Constitution permits Congress to remove presidents before their term is up if enough lawmakers vote to say that they committed "treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors."
Only two presidents have been impeached -- Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1998 -- and both were ultimately acquitted and completed their terms in office. Richard M. Nixon, resigned in 1974 to avoid being impeached.
What is a "high crime"?
The term "high crimes and misdemeanors" came out of the British common law tradition: it was the sort of offense that Parliament cited in removing crown officials for centuries. Essentially, it means an abuse of power by a high-level public official. This does not necessarily have to be a violation of an ordinary criminal statute.
In 1788, as supporters of the Constitution were urging states to ratify the document, Alexander Hamilton described impeachable crimes in one of the Federalist Papers as "those offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust. They are of a nature which may with peculiar propriety be denominated POLITICAL, as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself."
What is the process?
In both the Nixon and the Clinton cases, the House Judiciary Committee first held an investigation and recommended articles of impeachment to the full House. In theory, however, the House of Representatives could instead set up a special panel to handle the proceedings -- or just hold a floor vote on such articles without any committee vetting them.
When the full House votes on articles of impeachment, if at least one gets a majority vote, the president is impeached -- which is essentially the equivalent of being indicted.
Next, the proceedings move to the Senate, which is to hold a trial overseen by the chief justice of the Supreme Court.
A team of lawmakers from the House, known as managers, play the role of prosecutors. The president has defense lawyers, and the Senate serves as the jury.
If at least two-thirds of the senators find the president guilty, he is removed, and the vice president takes over as president. There is no appeal.
How does a House impeachment inquiry start?
This has been a subject of dispute. During the Nixon and Clinton impeachment efforts, the full House voted for resolutions directing the House Judiciary Committee to open the inquiries. But it is not clear whether that step is strictly necessary, because impeachment proceedings against other officials, like a former federal judge in 1989, began at the committee level.
The House Judiciary Committee, led by Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York, has claimed -- including in court filings -- that the panel is already engaged in an impeachment investigation. Mr. Trump's Justice Department has argued that since there has been no House resolution, the committee is just engaged in a routine oversight proceeding.
Ms. Pelosi did not say in her announcement that she intended to bring any resolution to the floor.
Whether or not it is necessary, it has not been clear whether a resolution to formally start an impeachment inquiry would pass a House vote, although the number of Democrats who support one has recently been surging. As of late Tuesday, The New York Times counted 203 members who said they favored impeachment proceedings, 88 who said they opposed them or were undecided, and 144 who had not responded to the question.
What are the rules for a Senate trial?
There are no set rules. Rather, the Senate passes a resolution first laying out trial procedures.
"When the Senate decided what the rules were going to be for our trial, they really made them up as they went along," Gregory B. Craig, who helped defend Mr. Clinton in his impeachment proceeding and later served as White House counsel to President Barack Obama, told The Times in 2017.
For example, Mr. Craig said, the initial rules in that case gave Republican managers four days to make a case for conviction, followed by four days for the president's legal team to defend him. These were essentially opening statements. The Senate then decided whether to hear witnesses, and if so, whether it would be live or on videotape. Eventually, the Senate permitted each side to depose several witnesses by videotape.
The rules adopted by the Senate in the Clinton trial -- including ones limiting the number of witnesses and the length of depositions -- made it harder to prove a case compared with trials in federal court, said former Representative Bob Barr, Republican of Georgia who served as a House manager during the trial and is also a former United States attorney.
"Impeachment is a creature unto itself," Mr. Barr said. "The jury in a criminal case doesn't set the rules for a case and can't decide what evidence they want to see and what they won't."
What are the standards for impeachment and removal?
The Constitution does not specify many, making impeachment and removal as much a question of political will as of legal analysis.
For example, the Constitution does not detail how lawmakers may choose to interpret what does or does not constitute impeachable "treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors." Similarly, there is no established standard of proof that must be met.
Is the Senate obligated to hold a trial?
The Constitution clearly envisions that if the House impeaches a federal official, the next step is for the Senate to hold a trial. But there is no obvious enforcement mechanism if Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, were to simply refuse to convene one -- just as he refused to permit a confirmation hearing and vote on Mr. Obama's nominee, Judge Merrick Garland, to fill a Supreme Court vacancy in 2016.
Still Walter Dellinger, a Duke University law professor and a former acting solicitor general in the Clinton administration, said it is unclear whether it would be Mr. McConnell or Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. who wields the authority to convene the Senate for the purpose of considering House-passed articles of impeachment.
Either way, though, he noted that the Republican majority in the Senate could vote to immediately dismiss the case without any consideration of the evidence if it wanted.
To date, Senate Republicans have given no indication that they would break with Mr. Trump, especially in numbers sufficient to remove him from office. In their internal debate about what to do, some Democrats have argued that this political reality means that they should instead focus on trying to beat him in the 2020 election, on the theory that an acquittal in the Senate might backfire by strengthening him politically. Others have argued that impeaching him is a moral necessity to deter future presidents from acting like Mr. Trump, even if Senate Republicans are likely to keep him in office.
In that same Federalist Paper written in 1788, Mr. Hamilton wrote that the inherently political nature of impeachment proceedings would be sure to polarize the country.
Their prosecution, he wrote, "will seldom fail to agitate the passions of the whole community, and to divide it into parties more or less friendly or inimical to the accused. In many cases it will connect itself with the pre-existing factions, and will enlist all their animosities, partialities, influence and interest on one side or on the other; and in such cases there will always be the greatest danger that the decision will be regulated more by the comparative strength of parties, than by the real demonstrations of innocence or guilt."

Texto completo: A new crime drama debuts on ABC. And "Abstract: The Art of Design" returns for a second season on Netflix.
What's on TV
STUMPTOWN 10 p.m. on ABC. A pair of hairy kidnappers discuss the origins of the beans in a cup of coffee ("It's tart, but it has an earthy finish -- I'm going with Ethiopian") in the first episode of this new crime drama, which is set in Portland, Ore. Based on a comic book series by Greg Rucka and Matthew Southworth, the series stars Cobie Smulders ("How I Met Your Mother," the "Avengers" movies) as Dex Parios, a private investigator with a military background and an uneasy mind. "Assuming Dex has weekly cases, they'll need to tighten up; the pilot's kidnapped-girl plot is expository filler," Mike Hale wrote in a review for The New York Times. "There's a potentially appealing mix of wisecracking humor and underplayed, credible action, though, that could blossom if it's given precedence over the melodramatic back story."
THE MASKED SINGER 8 p.m. on Fox. Who were those masked singers? That's a question some viewers were asking -- not necessarily happily -- after extravagantly costumed contestants from this weird competition show popped up again and again during the Emmy Awards on Sunday night. They'll have to wait for an answer: The show pits singers with varying degrees of celebrity against each other, their identities hidden by crazy costumes. The first season's winner was eventually revealed to be T-Pain in a monster get-up. The second season, debuting Wednesday, will bring a new set of contestants.
IT'S ALWAYS SUNNY IN PHILADELPHIA 10 p.m. on FXX. Last year's season of "It's Always Sunny" was a particularly topical one, with setups that squeezed comedy out of political polarization and "fake news." This year's season -- the show's 14th -- again brings back Kaitlin Olson, Rob McElhenney, Glenn Howerton, Danny DeVito and Charlie Day, the stars whose characters' lives revolve around a fictional Philadelphia pub. The new season involves a prized melon, a gorilla and Airbnb. It kicks off in characteristically indecorous form Wednesday night.
What's Streaming
ABSTRACT: THE ART OF DESIGN Stream on Netflix. "My heroes were Langston Hughes, James Baldwin, Nikki Giovanni, Sonia Sanchez -- playwrights, poets," Ruth E. Carter says in an episode of this documentary series. "Those were the designers that inspired me." That isn't the most predictable list of luminaries she could have given; none of them are from her field. Carter, a veteran costume designer for film and television, made history last year when she became the first African-American woman to win an Oscar for costume design. Her illuminating episode is one of several in the latest season of "Abstract," which offers a collection of roughly 45-minute documentaries, each focused on a different creative person whose work has some connection to design. Other subjects in the new batch include the M.I.T. Media Lab professor Neri Oxman, the Icelandic artist Olafur Eliasson and the typeface designer Jonathan Hoefler. While some of the show's subjects, like Carter, speak about what inspires them, the series is itself inspirational catnip for artsy perfectionists.

Texto completo: After more than 50 years of chronicling the highbrow, lowbrow, brilliant and despicable characters of the city whose name it took, New York Magazine has a new owner.
On Tuesday, Vox Media agreed to acquire New York Media, the company behind the biweekly print magazine and five popular online offshoots, in an all-stock transaction. Neither company would disclose the value of the deal.
While consolidations in the media industry typically mean cutting costs at the expense of quality journalism, Vox and New York said their combination was something different. They are bringing together a much-decorated print magazine, websites, a podcast empire and several streaming television deals -- the very model, they hope, of a modern media company.
"No one had to do this," Pamela Wasserstein, the chief executive of New York Media, said on Tuesday. "It's a brilliant, in our view, opportunity, so that's why we leaned into it. It's not out of need. It's out of ambition."
New York Media is the home of the websites The Cut (style, culture), Grub Street (food), Intelligencer (politics), The Strategist (shopping) and Vulture (pop culture) and was losing as much as $ 10 million a year before a recent upturn, according to two people with knowledge of the company. The company laid off about 5 percent of its staff this year.
The publishing company was started by the investment banker Bruce Wasserstein, who died in 2009, and is owned by the Wasserstein Family Trust. Ms. Wasserstein, the company founder's daughter, who declined to comment on New York Media's finances, started exploring a sale more than a year ago and had stopped looking for a buyer when she started discussions with Vox Media in June. She will continue to run the business of New York and its sites, with the title of president of Vox Media. She will also have a seat on the Vox Media board.
Jim Bankoff, the Vox Media chief executive and chairman, pledged that the merger would not result in editorial layoffs or the folding of any of the New York-related publications, including the print magazine, or the Vox brands, which include The Verge, Eater, Curbed, Vox and SB Nation.
"Nothing changes editorially for any of our brands," Mr. Bankoff said.
In a joint interview, he and Ms. Wasserstein said the new company would aim to be more than the sum of its parts and would be more attractive to advertisers.
David Haskell, who succeeded Adam Moss as New York's editor in chief in April, said in a phone interview, "There's a part of me that's a little wistful about saying goodbye to the independent family business, but a bigger part of me is confident that Pam found us the ideal long-term partner."
Mr. Haskell will remain in charge of the print magazine and its digital titles, reporting to Ms. Wasserstein. Melissa Bell, the publisher of Vox Media, will continue to manage Vox's editorial teams and report to Mr. Bankoff.
New York was started by the editor Clay Felker in the 1960s as a Sunday supplement of The New York Herald-Tribune. After The Trib and its successor publication folded, New York returned as a stand-alone magazine in 1968. Standing front and center in a newspaper ad for the magazine's comeback were three of its best-known writers, Jimmy Breslin, Gloria Steinem and Tom Wolfe.
The current crew at New York, one of a dwindling number of magazines that regularly publish ambitious essays and feature stories, includes Rebecca Traister, Andrew Sullivan and Jonathan Chait. The film "Hustlers," which has grossed more than $ 62 million in the United States since its release on Sept. 13, is based on a New York article by Jessica Pressler. New York has won 44 National Magazine Awards and the 2018 Pulitzer Prize in criticism for its art critic, Jerry Saltz.
Once owned by Rupert Murdoch, New York was bought by Mr. Wasserstein in 2004 for $ 55 million. Ms. Wasserstein joined the company full time a few years after his death.
The company she ran is effectively taking a minority stake in the privately held Vox Media, which has raised more than $ 300 million in funding, including $ 200 million from NBCUniversal. The company was valued at $ 1 billion in 2015.
With the rise of digital media in the last two decades, many companies built on magazines have struggled. The once-mighty Time Inc., for instance, was scooped up last year by Meredith, which worked quickly to offload signature publications like Time, Fortune and Sports Illustrated.
More recently, digital media companies have also started to struggle, leading many outlets to ponder joining with rivals to increase their chances of long-term survival. Venture capital-backed sites like BuzzFeed, Vice, Bustle, Refinery29 and Group Nine have sought mergers in the last year, arguing that scale and cost savings are crucial at a time when digital advertising, dominated by Google and Facebook, fails to pay the bills. More than 1,000 employees lost their jobs this year in layoffs at BuzzFeed, AOL, Yahoo, HuffPost and Vice Media.
Digital media companies with diverse revenue streams can still thrive. Mr. Bankoff reshaped Vox Media to rely less on digital advertising, and after expanding its video and podcast businesses, the company had a modest profit on $ 185 million in revenue last year.
Even with the addition of New York Media, Vox Media expects to remain profitable, Mr. Bankoff and Ms. Wasserstein said. Bolstered by its new acquisition, Vox Media expects to exceed $ 300 million in revenue by the end of 2020, according to two people familiar with the deal, putting it on a par, in terms of annual revenue, with BuzzFeed. (Mr. Bankoff and Ms. Wasserstein declined to comment on financial projections for the revamped Vox Media.)
"We see a lot of mergers that are done for the wrong reason: because one or two companies might be desperate, or for financial engineering," Mr. Bankoff, known for his straightforward style, said. "We've been struck by the lackluster ambitions of a lot of the other tie-ups, and the lackluster rationales. What was important to us both was making sure that the market knew that this was something different."
Vox Media got its start, in 2005, as SB Nation, a network of sports fan sites. Since Mr. Bankoff, a onetime executive at AOL, was hired in 2009 to lead the company, it has started new titles such as The Verge and Polygon, which cover tech and gaming, and acquired others. Those include Recode, founded by Kara Swisher (also an opinion writer for The New York Times) and Walt Mossberg, as well as Eater and Curbed.
Vox.com, founded in 2014 by Ms. Bell, Ezra Klein and Matthew Yglesias, is the general-interest flagship known for explanatory journalism. The site's "explainers" have become a journalistic genre, with their guides to everything from nuclear-weapons deals to internet ephemera.
The company cut a production deal in May with the streaming service Hulu to create TV shows centered on food and family with David Chang and Chrissy Teigen. Vox Media also renewed a production agreement with Netflix for "Explained," a series based on Vox's specialty, and it has generated revenue by building its conference business and licensing its content management system, Chorus.
Ms. Wasserstein and Mr. Bankoff started discussing the possibility of joining forces in June at the Code Conference, an annual tech-industry gathering produced by Recode. This year's conference took place at the Phoenician resort near Phoenix.
"We always talk about the industry, and I was like, 'Maybe we should explore this,"' Mr. Bankoff said.
When they looked into it more seriously, they found that the two companies complemented each other, they said. Analyses showed a "surprisingly small audience overlap," Mr. Bankoff said.
The combined sites will have 125 million monthly unique visitors, the companies estimated.
Mr. Moss, who stepped down as New York's editor in chief after a 15-year tenure during which he revitalized the magazine and presided over the start of the related sites, said he was in favor of the deal.
"New York was pretty much unique in being a small, family-owned company, and did very well at that," Mr. Moss said. "But moving ahead into economic waters that are hard to predict, it's stronger to be bigger."

Texto completo: President Donald Trump said Tuesday that he will release the transcript of his July phone call with the Ukrainian president in an effort to quell the controversy over whether he pressed for Kyiv to investigate a political rival.
Trump insisted that the call was “totally appropriate” and pledged to release its full text Wednesday.
“I am currently at the United Nations representing our Country, but have authorized the release tomorrow of the complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript of my phone conversation with President Zelensky of Ukraine,” he wrote on Twitter. “You will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call. No pressure and, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo! This is nothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time!”
While the July transcript will answer some questions, the call is only one aspect of Trump’s dealings with the Ukrainians that have come under scrutiny in recent days. A whistleblower complaint that the administration has blocked lawmakers from seeing is said to deal at least in part with Ukraine and cover multiple actions.
Trump said earlier that he held up U.S. aid to Ukraine that has become the subject of scrutiny because European countries have not paid their fair share to support the country, and pointed to the fact that the money was eventually released as evidence that he had done nothing wrong.
The funds were frozen before Trump pressed the new Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to investigate a leading Democratic presidential candidate, former Vice President Joe Biden.
He also said that a groundswell for his impeachment among Democratic lawmakers amounted to a new “witch hunt.”
“I’m leading in the polls and they have no idea how to stop me,” Trump said, addressing reporters minutes before his annual address to the U.N. General Assembly. The president trails the leading Democratic candidates in most polls. “The only way they can try is through impeachment,” he added.
The $391 million aid package in question was provided to Ukraine for its defense against a Russian-backed separatist insurgency in its east which has left more than 13,000 people dead over the past five years.
Trump also noted that the funds allocated for Ukraine “were fully paid,” although he did not mention the fact that his administration acted only after the delay became public through news media leaks, and under bipartisan pressure from Congress.
He also did not mention that he had changed his explanation for withholding the money from just a day before. On Monday, he linked his decision to block the aid to his concerns about corruption in Ukraine, citing Biden as an example. By emphasizing instead his overall concern about foreign aid, he was advancing a rationale less tied to his demand for an investigation.
Trump earlier repeated his assertion that the transcript would exonerate him.
“When you see the call, when you see the readout of the call, which I assume you’ll see at some point, you’ll understand that call was perfect,” he said.

Texto completo: Trump has set his own interests above the nation’s In the Trump era, a columnist risks appearing like the boy (or girl) who cried wolf. Time and time again, we say this scandal is the big one.
But in our ill-fated version of the story, the wolf comes every time. The violations of morality and law have become progressively bolder and more dangerous to the constitutional order. And they have culminated in an abuse of power both highly serious and totally unconcealed.
By his own admission, the president of the United States urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to open a criminal investigation of the son of a political rival. Trump denies that this request involved a quid pro quo. But with Ukraine engaged in conflict with Russian-backed separatists, and with $250 million in American military aid being held up (at the time) for "review," the threat did not need to be explicit in order to be palpable and powerful. A mob boss doesn’t need to issue threats personally in order to be feared and obeyed. And that is what the Trump presidency increasingly resembles — a criminal family sending out their slimy factotum (a part played enthusiastically by Rudy Giuliani) to "fix" what needs fixing.
This groundbreaking form of political corruption shocked everyone with a conscience who was privy to it. U.S. embassy staff in Kiev expressed alarm about Giuliani’s contacts with Ukrainian officials. A whistleblower in the intelligence community risked his or her career to report it. The intelligence community’s inspector general found the matter of "urgent concern." But acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire and the Department of Justice — playing the role of political enforcers — have blocked the transmission of the whistleblower’s report to Congress. They are pursuing a cover-up in plain sight.
The Constitution assumes that the president will interact with foreign governments to seek the interests and express the values of the United States. With Trump, nothing decent can be assumed. By making corrupt personal requests of a foreign power, the president is not only misusing $250 million in leverage, he is misusing the presidency itself. His actions may constitute bribery, extortion and/or the violation of campaign-finance laws. But his breach of public trust is ultimately a more serious matter. Trump has violated his oath of office by using his office for selfish gain.
Here we need to be clear. Treating the presidency in this fashion is not only corrupt but unpatriotic. Trump is not only a preening, prating fool; he has set his own interests above the interests of the nation. He has replaced love of country with a kind of self-love that dishonors the institution he leads.
And Trump may have lost the ability to distinguish between patriotism and egotism. He may regard his crass political needs as the definition of his nation’s good. In this case, he is both bent and delusional.
The American criminal justice system was created to deal with normal types of political corruption, not with a rogue president, testing the limits of executive power. That form of warped ambition must be checked and balanced by the coequal branches of government. But many members of Congress — mostly Republicans but also some Democrats — appear to have lost their taste for that role.
The political risk to elected Republicans when they oppose Trump appears very real — though it is hard to be sure when so few test the proposition. But the moral hazard is far greater. When they use their office to shield shady political dealings, they become a party to public corruption. When they ignore or excuse Trump’s use of the nation’s power and influence for private reasons, they have chosen Trump above their country and deserve to be defeated. Every one of them. Worst of all, they are teaching their political supporters that the rule of law is a small and expendable thing.
In the scarier regions of the Trump right, the problem is far advanced. Every revelation of the president’s abuse of power is met with a sentence beginning: "But Biden ..." Their tolerance for corruption seems limitless — and frightening. By what firm political principle would they condemn Trump if he closed down The New York Times (an "enemy of the people") or arrested a few whistleblowers (part of the "deep state" that is conducting a "coup")?
None of this seems possible. But too many impossibilities have recently become realities. Opposing Trump’s corrupt abuse of power — here, now, before it goes further — is the calling of patriotism in our time.

IHOP on Jefferson Avenue in Detroit quietly closes

Texto completo: Stacks of fluffy buttermilk pancakes at the International House of Pancakes or IHOP on Jefferson Avenue, east of downtown Detroit, will be no more.
The location, once known as a gathering spot for city officials, quietly closed more than a week ago after not renewing its lease.
Saber Ammori, a local businessman, bought the building as an investment in Detroit from the previous owner at the beginning of this year.
"I bought it knowing the lease was going to expire and was hoping that IHOP would renew," Ammori said.
During the time he owned the building, Ammori said, he never had conversations with the franchisee about the rent and never increased the rent.
"I love the location and think it will be a great location for a new restaurant and I am open to other sorts of developments," Ammori said.
The restaurant, located about a mile east of the Renaissance Center, opened in 1994 on property owned by Walter Bridgforth Jr., former husband of Grammy Award-winning singer Anita Baker.
Bridgforth and Baker owned the land for five years before the IHOP opened. During that time, Bridgforth was criticized for demolishing the 140-year-old Chene House on the property. Known as a Detroit landmark, the Chene House was once the home of Little Harry's restaurant.
Bridgforth told the Free Press then that renovating the building, "just didn't make economic sense."
For years, according to Free Press archived reports, Bridgforth tried to entice several restaurants to build on the property before finally convincing IHOP.
"Typically an IHOP sets up shop in the suburbs," Bridgforth told the Free Press when it opened. "And it warms my heart to no end to know that we have this type of restaurant in the city."
Nearly two years after its 1994 opening, the location was noted by the New York Times as an all-day breakfast spot where many Detroit city officials met.
A combined IHOP/Applebee's restaurant is located on Jefferson in Detroit's Millender Center, about a mile west and across the street from the Renaissance Center. The location is part of TEAM Schostak, which operates 65 Applebee's locations in Michigan. This is Team Schostak's first combined IHOP/Applebee's location.

U.S. Faults E.U.'s Inertia On Sanctions For Venezuela

Texto completo: The Trump administration opened a double-barreled critique on Monday of what it described as a limp European response to the crisis in Venezuela, renewing demands for tougher sanctions against President Nicolás Maduro's government and more aid for refugees.
The broadsides, delivered as leaders arrived for the annual United Nations General Assembly, sought to re-energize global support for Venezuelan opposition leaders who have been trying since January to oust Mr. Maduro from power.
Several European officials agreed that far more needed to be done to help the nearly seven million Venezuelans in desperate need of food, safe water and medical supplies. But they stopped far short of embracing any new sanctions against Mr. Maduro and his loyalists, including some who have assets in Europe.
The numbers of refugees fleeing Venezuela -- expected to grow to five million by the end of 2019 -- "are terrifying," Edita Hrda, a European Union diplomat, told an Atlantic Council forum in New York. But she said attention to Venezuela largely has been limited to the Western Hemisphere, and noted that plans to broaden assistance would be a focus of a conference in Brussels in late October.
That drew a retort from John Barsa, who oversees assistance to Venezuela for the United States Agency for International Development. He described meeting a pregnant Venezuelan woman last month in a Colombian border town who needed care.
"The first thing coming out of her mouth was not 'How's the conference planning going?"' Mr. Barsa said.
He said the Western Hemisphere "has never seen human suffering on such a staggering level. The international community cannot turn a blind eye to this human tragedy."
Hours later, top diplomats from the United States and Latin America voted to begin a legal process, based in the so-called Rio Treaty, a regional security compact, to impose additional regional sanctions against Mr. Maduro's government. The Trump administration endorsed the use of the Rio Treaty earlier this month. The last time it was invoked was after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11.
Of the 19 nations that are signatories to the treaty, 16 voted on Monday to broadly investigate and penalize people connected to Mr. Maduro's government who are accused of money laundering, illegal drug trafficking, terrorism and transnational organized crime.
Uruguay voted against the measure, Trinidad and Tobago abstained and Cuba was absent.
"We know that exceptional situations require exceptional responses," said Foreign Minister Ernesto Araújo of Brazil. He said the crisis in Venezuela "includes clear and growing elements that threaten peace and the security of our region."
The treaty allows for additional diplomatic pressure and economic punishment to be brought against violators, such as those implicated in organized crime. It also opens the door to a possible military response, although American officials maintain that is not currently being considered, and the Venezuelan opposition's official for foreign affairs, Julio Borges, said on Monday that the process needed to advance "step by step."
President Trump will lead a meeting on Venezuela at the United Nations on Wednesday, in his most visible step in the United States' pressure campaign against Mr. Maduro. The effort has included multiple rounds of sanctions; support for the claim of the opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, to be interim president; and most recently, attempts to convince Europe to intensify its own sanctions against Mr. Maduro's loyalists.
European officials had pledged to expand the economic punishment against Mr. Maduro's government after political talks brokered by Norway collapsed last week. One senior American official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomacy frankly, said Monday that new European sanctions were not expected until sometime in October at the earliest.
European officials were likely to move first to use sanctions to punish Mr. Maduro for human rights violations, stemming from the June death of a Venezuelan Navy captain who was accused of plotting a rebellion.
The United States and a vast majority of Latin American nations are also pushing for the freezing of bank accounts and other assets that Mr. Maduro's loyalists have in Europe, where the senior American official said some have moved their families to live comfortably -- and far from the perilous conditions in Venezuela.
Juan Pablo de Laiglesia, a senior diplomat from Spain, said Europe was still considering issuing new sanctions against Venezuela on the grounds of human rights violations for the death of the navy captain, whose lawyers accused the government of torture.
As to the broader sanctions against Mr. Maduro's loyalists and their assets in Europe, "it will depend on the situation and how it evolves," Mr. de Laiglesia said in an interview.

Texto completo: Did that look of unalloyed contempt come naturally to Corey Lewandowski, or did he rehearse it? I picture him in front of a mirror as his “testimony” before the House Judiciary Committee approached, fine-tuning his sneer, perfecting his glare, testing different tilts of his head to see which conveyed maximal disgust with his inquisitors. He was hellbent on acing this performance.
And ace it he did, if the goal was to distill the Trump ethos into a few ugly hours. A flamboyant defiance of authority? Check. An extravagant disdain for precedent and procedure? Check. Cockiness, a persecution complex and a proudly situational relationship with the truth? Check, check, check. Bashing the media and even taking a whack at Hillary Clinton, he was Donald Trump in absentia, Donald Trump in excelsis, showing his former boss and future patron how scornfully Trumplike he could be.
You know those nature videos in which some vain and feathery bird, in the grip of a mating ritual, puffs up his chest and fans his plumage to impress the object of his adoration? This was the political equivalent of that. He preened and Trump swooned, tweeting about how “beautiful” the spectacle was.
So Lewandowski, who’s apparently on the cusp of a Senate campaign in New Hampshire and would obviously like Trump’s help, got what he wanted. But did Democrats, who had summoned him to Capitol Hill on Tuesday to be the first witness in their nascent impeachment inquiry?
Not really, not from where I sit, and that reflects the sad and alarming fact that they still can’t quite wrap their minds around the impudence of Trump and his enablers, they’re still putting too much faith in an old-fashioned rulebook and they’re still not looking around corners as well as they should be.
Alas, the route to the far side of Trump probably doesn’t run through committee hearings like the one that Lewandowski predictably turned into a farce. It runs through the ballot box. Nancy Pelosi gets this, and it’s possible that some of the House Democrats who keep muttering about impeachment get it, too — and are either fulfilling what they see as their constitutional obligation or trying to mollify a restive Democratic base. But I do worry that they’re blundering, and I hope against hope that after Democratic voters pick their presidential nominee, Democratic lawmakers will concentrate their energies on getting that person elected.
How, for instance, did Jerry Nadler, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, and his colleagues on that panel not realize that Lewandowski’s appearance would play out precisely as it did? Any diligent student of Trump and his loyalists could and should have expected his stonewalling, deflection and outright mockery, and if Democrats didn’t possess whatever requisite combination of legal authority and political will to hold him in contempt right then and there, they shouldn’t have given him the stage. Because to let him behave that way — he even sent out a fundraising solicitation during a pause in the hearing — and then go merrily on his way is to look pathetically weak.
Yes, they got him to verify, on national television, that Trump had tried to enlist him in what amounts to obstruction of justice. But that was already in Robert Mueller’s report, and it got lost somewhat in the reciprocal grandstanding and ambient vitriol. The Americans who tuned in — a small minority — had already made up their minds about Trump’s culpability and how much to care about it, or they saw, more than anything else, a boatload of blowhards making a lot of nasty Washington noise. When everybody’s seething and sniping, the effect is equalizing and indiscriminate. Nobody looks good.
My sense is that Democrats to some extent keep being surprised and taken aback by just how many people are willing to abase themselves for Trump and by just how expansively they’ll shred etiquette, trash tradition, junk their reputations and test the very boundaries of the law. It’s one of the great perversions of his administration: that a president so undeserving of fealty and protection gets a magnitude of it — from congressional Republicans, from Steve Mnuchin, from Bill Barr, from Wilbur Ross, now from Joseph Maguire, acting director of national intelligence — that far worthier predecessors in the White House didn’t.
Part of what could be called the Corey Lewandowski trap is Democrats’ failure to accept this. Part of it is their assumption that Trump’s cocky comrades would hesitate to display the garish public colors that they do. But those colors are much of what the president’s supporters like and what fires them up. They embrace Trump as someone who raises a middle finger to propriety, to elites and to the establishment, because they somehow don’t see him as part of that crowd and because they deem that gesture necessary and courageous. So Lewandowski happily mimicked it, not just at the hearing but also the morning after, during an interview with CNN’s Alisyn Camerota, when he inaccurately described Mueller’s report while blithely conceding that he hadn’t read it.
Lewandowski’s performance, like Maguire’s refusal last week to share any details of the whistleblower’s complaint, was just the latest reminder of the terrible corner that Trump puts Democrats in. Proudly flouting convention and brazenly bending the law, he dares them to try to muscle him back into line, but it turns out that any such effort is anything but swift and sure. And any such effort is interpreted by rigidly partisan voters along rigidly partisan lines.
What’s more, the frequency of his questionable or outrageous behavior keeps Democrats in a near-permanent state of hysteria that can easily look like overreaction and makes many of the offenses that they’re condemning blur. Was Lewandowski’s snit before Nadler & Company really any more reprehensible and infuriating than the worst from Trumplandia the week before? Is the whistleblower’s reported complaint urgent in the context of Trump’s rampant conflicts of interest and sustained nuttiness?
It’s overwhelming — by design, I think. Trump has discovered that shamelessness is its own reward, and his disciples have learned that lesson well. Lewandowski all but strutted out of that hearing room as Democrats muttered meekly about a contempt citation that would involve time, courts, etc. There’s a way to sidestep that trap. Hint: It has to do with November 2020.

Texto completo: Just as the aftershocks of the special counsel's Russia investigation seemed to have settled, the latest tremblor out of the Oval Office is whether the president used the levers of his foreign policy toward Ukraine for political gain.
A confidential whistleblower report might provide an answer. But once again, the nation's grinding democratic processes are falling short of providing Americans what they need to decide whether Donald Trump did something wrong.
Short of someone violating the law by leaking that whistleblower complaint, or the whistleblower risking retaliation by bravely going to Congress, there's no quick or certain process for the public to learn its contents.
There is, however, a steady drip of news media reports, and a few admissions by Trump himself on Sunday.
According to The Washington Post and The New York Times, a whistleblower complaint filed with the intelligence community's inspector general focused on a promise Trump made during a phone call on July 25 with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. (This happened to be the day after Robert Mueller's much-anticipated congressional testimony. ) During that conversation, Trump asked the Kiev leader to investigate a key political opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden, and Biden's son Hunter, regarding the younger Biden's past business dealings in Ukraine.
The Wall Street Journal later buttressed this reporting, revealing that Trump pressed Zelensky about eight times during their call to open the inquiry.
VIEWS FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP AND OTHERS: 'The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption'
Still unclear is whether there's any connection between Trump's desire for dirt on the Bidens and $250 million in U. S. military aid for Ukraine, which has been engaged in a five-year civil war with pro-Russian separatists. The aid was inexplicably delayed, then released soon after Congress raised concerns about the whistleblower complaint.
Was a meeting with Zelensky or the promise of Ukrainian assistance somehow, by inference or otherwise, made contingent on Kiev investigating Biden? If true, that would be a gross abuse of presidential power.
Trump acknowledged Sunday that he spoke with Zelensky about a Biden investigation, defending the conversation as appropriate and "perfect. " His defenders, meanwhile, fanned out on the morning talk shows to dispense a confusing smokescreen of unproven allegations against the Bidens.
All the while, the unnamed whistleblower's account languishes in the dark.
The intelligence community's inspector general, Trump appointee Michael Atkinson, was so troubled by the report that he deemed it of "urgent concern. "
The law requires that an urgent-concern whistleblower complaint "shall" be turned over to Congress. But the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, blocked this. His legal response, supplied by the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, is that the alleged target of the complaint — presumably Trump himself — is not a member of the intelligence community, so the urgent-concern requirements for the whistleblower law are not applicable.
That justification is painfully reminiscent of the legal gymnastics Mueller employed when he concluded that he was barred from saying whether Trump broke the law by obstructing justice in the Russian influence investigation, but that he also couldn't "exonerate" him.
A system of checks and balances guaranteed by the Constitution should inform the American people when their president violates the law or commits an impeachable offense. That system is being stretched to the breaking point.
Now it's up to members of Congress — not just Democrats but also Republicans who claim to believe in the rule of law — to get to the bottom of this latest tawdry tale by holding hearings, obtaining transcripts, and finding a way to gain access to the whistleblower complaint or that person's testimony.

Texto completo: From the first month of ownership, you'd owe more on your car than it's worth. Four years later, you'd still have a year or two of payments left, but your car would've lost most of its value.
Car payments are so prevalent in society today that people think they're a normal part of life. But if you took the average car payment of $545 and invested it into a Roth IRA instead, 30 years later you'd be sitting on a cool $1.4million.
Look, I like my car too – but not that much!
For me, that's motivation enough to save up and pay cash for a car instead of financing one. But I get plenty of objections to this way of thinking.
Here are some of the excuses I hear. And the truth about them:
'But the 0% interest rate is a great deal!' No, it's not. That new car starts losing value the instant you drive it off the lot.
From the first month of ownership, you'd owe more on your car than it's worth. Four years later, you'd still have a year or two of payments left, but your car would've lost most of its value.
And let's not forget that 0% is not the same as cash, and not everyone who falls for the 0% marketing pitch actually qualifies for the deal. But by then, you're already in love with the car of your dreams and are willing to sign anything to drive it home. And of course, some of those "deals" aren't quite as attractive once you read the fine print.
Making money off car loans is their business. You're not outsmarting anyone!
'I just had a baby, so I need a "safe" car. . . like a new Tahoe.' This is one I hear all the time from people I know who have kids – especially new parents. Do babies take up more room? Yes. Do you want your baby to be safe in the car? Yes! But those things don't equal a new SUV. Safe does not equal new.
There are plenty of safe, preowned cars out there. And you shouldn't let your desire to keep up with the Joneses drive your money habits and decisions. The Joneses are broke. Keeping up with broke people who are just trying to look rich is a really bad plan.
'How am I supposed to buy a car without a car loan?' Save up and pay cash for your cars. Yep, I mean it!
All it takes is making the decision to pay yourself instead of the bank. If you have a car loan, go crazy and pay it off quickly. Or, sell it to get the process rolling to pay yourself instead of the bank.
The first car you buy with cash might not be your dream car, but that's okay. Just because it's not your dream car doesn't mean it has to be a junker. Pick out a car with a body style that doesn't change often. I can't tell you how many luxury-brand cars I see on the road, and yet have no idea what year they were made.
The moral of the story is simple. Own your cars. Don't let them own you!

STOP THE RED INK THE WHITE HOUSE NEEDS A FEW BUDGET HAWKS

Texto completo: The national deficit for the current fiscal year tops $1 trillion, with a month still to go in the federal fiscal year. Congress and President Donald Trump need to get a grip.
Otherwise, former President Herbert Hoover will be proved right: "Blessed are the young, for they shall inherit the national debt."
The U.S. Treasury Department this month reported that national budget expenses exceeded revenue by $1.07 trillion for the past 11 months, and that total could worsen as there are 30 more days left to be tabulated before the end of the current federal fiscal year. That's the highest deficit in seven years, and is hardly a distinction the president will brag about.
Spending for those 11 months climbed to $4.1 trillion, 7% higher than the same period for the prior fiscal year, while revenue grew to $3.1 trillion, up 3% from the previous fiscal year. The only other time the federal government has had trillion-dollar deficits was between 2009 and 2012 when federal spending jumped to cope with the nation's worst financial crisis since the 1930s.
Deficits typically do not skyrocket when the economy is expanding, as it has been for 10 years. The deficit was $585 billion in 2016, so it's nearly doubled in three years and is 19% higher than a year ago.
Lack of constraints on spending and deliberately granting tax breaks that undercut government revenue collections were the main ingredients of this toxic financial mix.
Specifically contributing was Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cut, higher military spending and rising interest expenses on the government's debt.
All of that is leading to more government borrowing. White House officials even have suggested that 50-year or maybe even 100-year Treasury bonds be sold to cover debt expenses. The current maximum is 30 years. If such bonds are issued, it would truly mean our children's children would be paying for the nation's current debts.
Deficits used to be reviled by Republicans, which as a political party for decades was steadfast against ballooning budget losses. But Mr. Trump and Congress have lurched forward with little concern about unchecked deficits now and those that are expected in years to come.
The red ink needs to stop. The country's interest payments alone on its debts this year are $380 billion, up $47 billion from a year ago. Debts could accumulate to a point that the nation would be beholden to the Chinese or other nations for a bailout.
The consequences are dire if we don't change course, and soon. Budget hawks need to return to the White House and to the Capitol and set things straight, working on a plan for a balanced budget in the foreseeable future.

Texto completo: Ibram X. Kendi faced the worst imaginable kind of deadline pressure while writing his latest book.
Kendi was diagnosed in 2018 with stage 4 colon cancer when he was working on the follow-up to his National Book Award-winning “Stamped from the Beginning: The Definitive History of Racist Ideas in America,”
About 88 percent of people diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer die within five years.
“For a time I wasn’t sure whether I’d survive cancer,” the soft-spoken Kendi says during a telephone interview. “One of the things I knew I wanted to do before — if I was to pass away — was to finish (the book), so I committed to doing so, despite the pain.”
Kendi, 37, a professor of history and international relations at American University in Washington, D.C., wrote when the symptoms during his six months of chemotherapy treatment weren’t that severe.
He finished the book, “How to Be an Antiracist,” which was published just last month and is currently on the New York Times bestseller list for nonfiction.
He underwent surgery following the completion of chemotherapy and doctors have declared him cancer-free.
Kendi, founding director of the newly formed Antiracist Research and Policy Center at American, will visit Harrisburg Sunday, Oct. 6, for the final day of the annual book festival sponsored by Midtown Scholar Bookstore. The book fest begins Oct. 3.
Kendi will share the stage with author Imani Perry (“Breathe: A Letter to My Sons”) for a conversation about racial justice in America moderated by author Keisha Blain (“Set the World on Fire: Black Nationalist Women and the Global Struggle for Freedom”).
That discussion is just one of numerous events featuring writers representing just about every imaginable literary genre. For a complete schedule of events, all of which are free, go to hbgbookfest.com.
------------
Book’s inspiration
Kendi says he was moved to write “How to Be an Antiracist” in the fall of 2016 while he was traveling around the country and speaking to people about “Stamped from the Beginning,” urging them to become antiracists.
“For some people who had never really heard the term antiracist, they wanted to know more,” Kendi says. “They wanted to know how they can be an antiracist, and so that question people kept asking me is what ultimately led me to write this book.”
“How to Be an Antiracist” is part memoir, part scholarly essay, part social commentary, part polemic. The sum makes it a powerful and moving reflection on racism in America, as well as suggesting a path forward that could lead to an antiracist society.
Kendi says he realized early on that the book, to be effective, would have to include personal information about himself and his family, especially his parents. For inspiration, he turned to other books that used personal memoir to tell a larger story, including “The Autobiography of Malcolm X” and “The Souls of Black Folk” by W.E.B. Du Bois.
“From the beginning it was going to be part memoir, but before I came to that decision it was difficult,” says Kendi, who lives in Washington with his wife, a pediatric emergency room physician, and their daughter. “I’m a very private person and as a scholar we’re really not trained to use personal narrative in our work. And then, also, I didn’t really want to reveal some of the most shameful moments of my life. But I felt it was necessary to do so, so I could sort of show people just how deeply self-critical and self-aware we have to be to be antiracist.”
------------
Definitions
In the book, Kendi, the youngest person to ever win the National Book Award for nonfiction, offers numerous exacting definitions of terms that help outline and support his views on racism.
For example, a racist is “one who is supporting a racist policy through their actions or inaction or expressing a racist idea.”
An antiracist is “one who is supporting an antiracist policy through their actions or expressing an antiracist idea.”
Kendi is much more interested in attacking the racist policies instituted by racists than in attacking the racists themselves.
He writes about his illness near the end of the book, comparing the metastasis of his cancer to what he perceives as the metastasis of racism in America.
He believes that if he can beat cancer, then America can defeat racism.
“Racism functions at the level of policy and ideas,” Kendi says. “Obviously, ideas are entrenched but policy that is 200 years old can be changed tomorrow, just as it can last another 200 years. And so we have a series of racist policies in this country that can be transformed and changed, so the question isn’t really whether it can be changed, it’s how we go about changing it.
“And the way you do that is ... getting antiracists into power to make those changes. And then, once we start creating racial equity as a result of those policy changes the racist ideas will have less and less to stand on.”
Kendi views President Donald Trump as a barrier to antiracist policies.
“(Trump is) a racist in a position of power who pursues racist policies,” Kendi says. “As long as he’s in office he’ll continue to do so. If we drive him out of office, we can put in someone who could presumably support antiracist polices.”
Kendi says he currently is not publicly supporting any of the current presidential candidates. He says that could change and he might get involved in the political process at a later date.

Texto completo: Once upon a time, there was an ideal. It was called the United States of America.
And in 2016, the presidency of the United States was captured by the flamboyantly incompetent star of a TV reality show, a man who doesn't believe in any ideal beyond his own enrichment and aggrandizement. Some shaken observers assured us everything would yet be all right. The institutions of democracy - the courts, the Congress, the news media and the agencies of the federal government - would save America from the worst consequences of one of its worst decisions.
"The Guardrails Hold," exulted the headline of a piece by the late conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer. He was highlighting acts of resistance to Donald Trump's bizarre excesses by entities as varied as the Boy Scouts of America and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
That was in August of 2017. It has since become painfully clear Krauthammer exulted too soon. The vaunted institutions of democracy have proven largely unequal to the task of checking Trump's transgressions.
The courts? The record is mixed; Trump's bid to rig the Census was rejected, his Muslim ban was not.
The Congress? A hotbed of spinelessness that has given Trump less trouble than the Washington Generals give the Harlem Globetrotters.
The news media? Aggressive reporting is met with widespread apathy and partisan claims of "fake news." The New York Times reported that Trump committed "outright fraud" as a businessman. Nobody cared.
Which brings us to federal agencies and last week's news that the acting director of national intelligence is apparently shielding Trump from questioning over allegations of still-unrevealed misconduct. It seems Trump, who has a history of cavalier behavior with classified information - he once blurted intelligence secrets to Russians in the Oval Office - had an interaction with a foreign leader wherein he made an unspecified "promise" that so troubled one official it led to the filing of a formal whistleblower complaint.
As first reported by The Washington Post, Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson found the complaint credible and designated it a matter of "urgent concern." That's a legal finding requiring notification of congressional oversight committees. But acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire has refused to provide that information to lawmakers.
It's important to note the context here.
Earlier this month, the Justice Department launched an antitrust investigation of four automakers after they reached agreement with the state of California to maintain higher fuel-efficiency standards than the federal government requires. It can be no coincidence that Trump has long been at war with that state.
At roughly the same time, officials at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reportedly were threatened with termination for contradicting Trump's claim - he tried to prove it by marking a map with a Sharpie - that Alabama was menaced by a killer storm.
Now here's the acting DNI throwing his body between Trump and accountability. We are seeing the credibility of the federal government mangled in service to this guy's fragile ego. How weak the guardrails of democracy turn out to be. Even this one - a government of, by and for the people is looking suspiciously like a government of, by and for Trump.
But where guardrails fail, things crash and fall apart. Something to remember as we wait out the long years until next November.
We were told our institutions would save us. They'll be lucky if they can save themselves.

5 questions to ask yourself next time you face tough choice

Texto completo: Give the 5x5 Model a test drive on your next difficult decision.
You've got a tough decision to make, yet conflicting interests and perspectives can render you frozen from taking decisive action. We've all been there.
Having observed how the most successful people evaluate their options and then make a thoughtful decision, here's a framework that may be helpful when you're trying to make a choice in the face of ambiguity. Essentially, you ask five questions around the impact of your decision, in five different time horizons. I call it The 5x5 Model:
5 minutes – How will you feel in the moment, as the decision is made and communicated? Sometimes the worst decisions feel the best in the near-term.
5 hours – A few hours later, will you still be on an achievement high or will regret start to seep in?
5 weeks – Now that you've started to either enjoy results or deal with consequences, are you still feeling great about this decision or wishing you took a different route?
5 years – Looking back at the decision five years out, do you think you'll be cleaning up from the mess or will you be grateful you made the tough call earlier since it set you in motion for greatness?
50 years – Now long in the past, will you be proud of the decision or ashamed? Did the decision represent your broader calling and represent your most important values? Will you be proud to tell your grandkids about the decision? If you're gone, will you be happy to be remembered for your choice?
Apply it to your Twinkie habit.
This simple framework can serve as a powerful model to help you land in the right place. As an example, let's think about eating a box of Twinkies:
5 minutes – Yum! True euphoric pleasure sucking down those highly-processed treats.
5 hours – Now that the taste has worn off and you've suffered a sugar crash, you're probably wishing you made a different choice.
5 months – The enjoyment is long gone, but the extra weight you've put on makes you shake your head with regret. You invest in a larger pair of jeans.
5 years – That box of Twinkies — and the subsequent boxes you consumed — led to lingering health issues. You're now dealing with Type 2 diabetes and not performing to your full capacity.
50 years – Your Twinkie habit led to an untimely death. Your kids miss you.
While an over-the-top example to be sure, the Twinkie questions let you see how clear the right decision becomes. Of course, we're typically dealing with far less obvious choices, but the same framework can help lead you to optimal decisions, and optimal results.
Give the 5x5 Model a test drive on your next difficult decision.
Hopefully it will guide you to a place of sustainable success, rather than the momentary pleasures that temptations provide. The grounded joy of doing the right thing will far surpass the short-lived sugar high of a bad decision.

Texto completo: Cancer White Out Gala organizers took a page from the South Hampton, New York crowd when they asked partygoers to wear white Aug. 24 at East Ridge Country Club. (Those of you who take the Sunday New York Times have seen the photos.)
The gala for some 300, was presented by American Cancer Society and premier sponsors Harvey Subaru, Willis-Knighton Health System and International Paper.
The club was packed to the gills.
There was so much to do that veteran socials hardly had time to chat, but chat they did. At times, it was difficult to get these partygoers quiet for an announcement. Even luminary LSU Health Shreveport Chancellor Dr. G.E. Ghali — who speaks softly, but means business when he has an announcement to make — had a difficult time commanding order when he was trying to raise money for the "Fund the Mission Initiative."
There was plenty to do:
Silent Auction, which included glittery items like an art piece byArtist Laura Watts, Sweet Caroline's trendy calendars, three totes from Paper Tulip.
Photo Booth where subjects hammed it up all evening.
Bountiful buffet.
Live Auction.
Heads & Tails Drawing.
Let's not forget the "Champions of Hope," individuals in Northwest Louisiana who distinguish themselves in the fight against cancer, said the program.
The Champions: Chancellor Ghali, Dr. Julie Broadwell, Dr. Aaron Burgin, Molly Fleming,
Kristin Gardner, Chancellor Ghali, Dr. Cooper Heard, Martha Marak, Juanita Rodriguez, Dr. Anil Veluvolu, Dr. Greg Wellman — who was a cancer patient when he was in college.
Party notes: Putting the fundraiser together: Event co-chairs Kristin Gardner, Kelly Guilbert, Ann Harvey and committee members: Dr. Joyce Feagin, Katie Kilpatrick, Donna Lacour, Daphne Terzia, Jeri Thompson ... Quotable: When prostate cancer survivor Johnny Benson was asked how he dealt with cancer, he answered simply, "One day at a time."
Benson was featured on the last page of the program in an ad sponsored
by wkhs.com/cancer ... attorney and champion for hope, Kristin Thomas is a three-time cancer survivor who was diagnosed at ages 5, 15 and 38.
... A "wow" to Northwest Louisiana Food Bank Chief Martha Marak, also a cancer survivor. She has given food to 76,000 people in need through distribution of 11.7 million pounds of food and supplies over a seven parish area.
... To remember the evening by, guests picked up a Swag Bag filled with sunscreen donated by Dermatology & Skin Surgery as they walked out the door.

Trump Pressed Ukraine’s Leader as Giuliani Pushed for Biden Inquiry

Texto completo: Washington • President Donald Trump repeatedly pressed his Ukrainian counterpart in a call to talk with his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who had been urging the government in Kyiv for months to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his family, according to people briefed on the call.
Trump’s desire for a Ukrainian investigation of Biden, a leading candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, is part of the secret whistleblower complaint that is said to be about Trump and at least in part about his dealings with Ukraine, according to two people familiar with the matter.
The new revelations add to new scrutiny about Trump’s dealings with the Ukrainian government. He has made no secret of his desire for Kyiv to investigate the Bidens, repeatedly raising it publicly.
But questions have emerged about whether Trump’s push for an inquiry into the Bidens was behind a weeks long White House hold on military aid for Ukraine. The United States suspended the military aid to Ukraine in early July, according to a former American official.
Trump did not discuss the aid in the July 25 call with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy of Ukraine, and Kyiv did not learn of the suspension until August, according to people familiar with the call. The Wall Street Journal first reported details of it.
Trump dismissed earlier on Friday as a “partisan” attack the whistleblower complaint said to involve his dealings with Ukraine amid mounting questions about his interactions with the country’s new government.
“It’s a ridiculous story. It’s a partisan whistleblower,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office, though he also acknowledged he did not know the person’s identity. “They shouldn’t even have information.”
When asked whether he had brought up Biden during the call with Zelenskiy, Trump waved away the question but added, “Someone ought to look into Joe Biden.”
Biden said on Friday that the allegations that he or his son did anything wrong in Ukraine are baseless.
“Not one single outlet has given any credibility to his assertion,” Biden told reporters after a campaign event in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. He said he had no more comment, but added: “The president should start to be president.”
The existence of the complaint, submitted by a member of the intelligence community to its inspector general, emerged late last week and exploded into the open late on Wednesday when The Washington Post reported that it concerned Trump. The administration has not shared the complaint with Congress, as is generally required by law, angering Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi offered a sharp warning to the Trump administration on Friday, saying in a statement that the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, was violating the law by refusing to disclose the complaint to Congress.
“If the president has done what has been alleged, then he is stepping into a dangerous minefield with serious repercussions for his administration and our democracy,” she said in a statement.
After the Ukraine link emerged in news reports late Thursday, Giuliani shed more light on it in a rambling CNN appearance, where he first denied, then admitted, to asking the government in Kyiv to investigate the Bidens.
Giuliani has spearheaded a push for such an inquiry. He met with Zelenskiy’s emissaries this summer in hopes of encouraging his government to ramp up investigations into two matters regarding the Biden family: the question of any overlap with Biden’s diplomatic dealings with Ukraine, as well as the details of his son’s involvement in a gas company there.
Giuliani has said he was acting on his own, though his comments on Thursday seemed to draw a closer connection to Trump. “A President telling a Pres-elect of a well known corrupt country he better investigate corruption that affects US is doing his job,” Giuliani wrote on Twitter shortly after his appearance on CNN asserting the same thought.
Trump and Zelenskiy will meet next week on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, a senior administration official confirmed after Zelenskiy’s office announced the meeting on Friday.
In recent weeks, congressional aides and administration officials who work on Ukraine issues had become concerned that the White House was delaying the military assistance package for Kyiv, according to people involved in an effort to free up the assistance.
Three Democratic House committee chairmen have requested the transcript of the president’s July call with Zelenskiy from the State Department and the White House as part of an investigation into whether Trump and Giuliani were misappropriating the U.S. foreign policy apparatus for political gain.
Vice President Mike Pence, who recently met with Zelenskiy in Poland, denied bringing up Giuliani’s efforts to investigate Biden in their conversations, but said Trump was still making the decision on “the latest tranche of financial support.”
Trump also sought to allay concerns about his dealings with other foreign leaders. Part of the whistleblower’s complaint deals with an unspecified commitment he made to an unnamed foreign leader, a person familiar with it has said. Trump also said Friday that he did not know the leader in question.
“I had a great conversation with numerous people, numerous leaders, and I always look for the conversation that’s going to help the United States the most,” he said. Sitting alongside Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia, who had just arrived for a state visit, Trump called his communications with other leaders “always appropriate.”

Texto completo: The campaign against Brett Kavanaugh hasn’t required the formation of any super PACs. It hasn’t required the hiring of any dumpster-diving private detectives (so far as we know). It hasn’t even really required any elected Democratic officials.
<img class="size-medium wp-image-2599038" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/Rich-Lowry-Color-300x293.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="293" />
The campaign has been carried out by an elite media — and two of its most prestigious properties, The New York Times and The New Yorker — that prides itself on its standards and its Olympian status.
During his confirmation hearings, The New Yorker first published an allegation by Deborah Ramirez that Kavanaugh exposed himself at a party at Yale when they were both students. Ramirez spent almost a week “assessing her memories” before making the charge, and told friends that she wasn’t sure it was him. No eyewitness places Kavanaugh in the room.
It was in support of The New Yorker story that shouldn’t have been published that The New York Times issued forth with its own piece over the weekend that also shouldn’t have been published, an excerpt from a new anti-Kavanaugh book by two Times reporters. The essay floated the allegation that he exposed himself to another woman at another Yale party, but left out that the woman’s friends say she doesn’t recall the incident (she declined to be interviewed).
Here, we have one flimsy, uncorroborated story in the Times being advanced to buttress another flimsy, uncorroborated story in The New Yorker, which, in its turn, was supposed to lend credence to Christine Blasey Ford’s original flimsy, uncorroborated story.
Kavanaugh’s enemies believe that layering on dubious allegations somehow makes each one more credible, whereas it only speaks to their own desperation.
Belatedly, the Times amended the essay and appended an editor’s note alerting readers that a key — no, the key — piece of information about the alleged victim had been left out of the original version.
Surely, if a piece had causally smeared anyone with whom the Times has a natural affinity — say, Rachel Maddow or Ruth Bader Ginsburg — there would have editorial due diligence before publishing it. But Kavanaugh, as a privileged white male who might vote against Roe v. Wade, is a hate figure who is presumed guilty, even of an offense that it turns out his alleged victim isn’t accusing him of.
The larger point of the Times book excerpt is that Kavanaugh was privileged and Deborah Ramirez was not, so of course he must have thoughtlessly done something rotten to her at Yale.
As for Roe, Christine Blasey Ford’s lawyer, Debra Katz, made it explicit. “He will always have an asterisk next to his name,” Katz explained in remarks claiming moral victory from the Senate hearings on Kavanaugh. “When he takes a scalpel to Roe v. Wade, we will know who he is, we know his character, and we know what motivates him.”
In other words, the talking point is all cued up if Kavanaugh votes against Roe: He is a misogynist showing his disdain for women yet again.
Top Democrats understand the play. They immediately began calling for Kavanaugh’s impeachment over the weekend. “His place on the court,” according to Kamala Harris, “is an insult to the pursuit of justice.” Top-tier presidential contenders Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren joined the calls, as did a number of the single-digit candidates. No one revised and extended their remarks after the update by the Times, because this has nothing to do with evidence or fairness.
In part, the left is working the referee — by essentially asking the ref when he stopped beating his wife. If Kavanaugh never votes to overturn or erode Roe, at least the volume of the vitriol against him will diminish. If he does, the full fury of the left, mustering all the levers of its cultural power high and low, will be directed at him. Pro-abortion forces surely want Kavanaugh aware of this whenever he is hearing any abortion-related cases.
The anti-Kavanaugh campaign could be just beginning.

Texto completo: Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham announced a plan Wednesday that would make New Mexico the second state to offer full college tuition to state residents.
The governor announced her plan at the state's Higher Education Summit at Central New Mexico Community College in Albuquerque. The proposal is for a "last dollar" program covering 100 percent of undergraduate tuition and fees not paid for by federal grants or the New Mexico Lottery Scholarship.
Branded the New Mexico Opportunity Scholarship, the plan is estimated to benefit 55,000 New Mexico students at all 29 public higher education institutions in the state, beginning in the fall of 2020.
The scholarship, applicable to two- and four-year institutions, would be administered by the New Mexico Higher Education Department and available for New Mexico residents with a high school diploma or equivalency. A minimum grade-point average of 2.5 would be a requirement of the scholarship.
In a statement, Lujan Grisham called it "a game-changer for New Mexico" and said it would culminate in "improved outcomes for New Mexico workers and families and parents (and) a better trained and better compensated workforce."
Ultimately, her proposal would require approval in the state legislature.
Role of oil and gas industry The New York Times broke news of the governor's proposal Wednesday morning, stating that the governor "plans to use climbing revenues from oil production to pay for much of the costs" of the scholarship.
New Mexico Oil and Gas Association Executive Director Ryan Flynn issued a statement following the announcement.
"Big, bold ideas like this are the type the transformational opportunities New Mexico now has because of the success and growth of the oil and natural gas industry," Flynn said. "This is a great example of how the Governor can leverage increased oil and natural gas production to the benefit of all New Mexicans regardless of where they live, work, or go to school. Our state has enjoyed two consecutive billion-dollar budget surpluses on the strength oil and natural gas, and we're committed to continuing our role as the economic foundation of New Mexico while safely and responsibly producing the energy we need."
Flynn pointed to an industry study predicting the industry could attract $174 billion in infrastructure investments in the Permian Basin through 2030.
Presently, a boom in production and recent discovery of more supply in the Permian Basic has boosted general fund revenue fiscal year far exceeding the state's current $7 billion budget.
Executives of oil and gas companies attending an annual energy summit in Carlsbad last week expressed confidence in long-term production in the region.
However, prior to an upturn in revenue from the oil and gas industry in 2018, sagging tax revenues from the oil and gas sector in 2016 led to deep cuts in public K-12 education.
'It requires a commitment of priorities' In attendance at the higher education summit was Western New Mexico University President Joseph Shepard, who said he first heard rumors of the governor's proposal on Tuesday and likened it to the Apollo mission.
Her announcement to the summit did not include details, he said, but presented an objective Shepard likened to President John F. Kennedy's 1961 challenge to place an astronaut safely on the moon within that decade.
Lujan Grisham herself has frequently described her ambition for improving education in New Mexico as a "moonshot."
Shepard acknowledged the need to assess consistent revenue streams supporting the program.
"It requires a commitment of priorities — the moonshot, so to speak," Shepard said when reached by phone in Albuquerque. "Often we say, 'we don't have the budget for it,' but budget is about how we allocate resources."
He also said, to those who criticize New Mexico's economy for being overly reliant on revenue from the oil and gas industry, that increasing affordable access to higher education was essential for diversifying the state's economy.
Shepard said the plan's next step will be the New Mexico Higher Education Advisory Committee, which includes state cabinet secretaries for higher education, the department of workforce solutions, finance and administration, economic development, and the director of the legislative finance committee, or delegates.
Tribal colleges included in proposal The governor's office confirmed Wednesday that the tuition proposal would include New Mexico's four tribal colleges: Navajo Technical University in Crownpoint, Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute in Albuquerque, Institute of American Indian Arts in Santa Fe and the Crownpoint and Shiprock campuses of Diné College.
Diné College President Charles "Monty" Roessel hailed the proposal, which follows legislation earlier this year opening lottery scholarships to students at tribal colleges in New Mexico.
"I think it's a great plan and I give the governor a lot of credit," Roessel said, adding, "I think it's a wonderful opportunity for all Native Americans."
Roessel was also in attendance at the summit.
A gift to Texas and Arizona? Gavin Clarkson, who taught at New Mexico State University's college of business prior to serving in the Trump Administration and is currently a Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate, criticized the proposal.
"Unfortunately, making public colleges free for even the wealthiest of families will be a big boon to workforce development — in Texas and Arizona," Clarkson said in a statement. "It does nothing to address the lack of high-quality jobs that would keep our college graduates here in New Mexico."
Clarkson added, "If we're going to subsidize higher education, we owe it to both students and taxpayers to target those resources towards empowering citizens with the kind of skills that will actually add value to New Mexico's economy."
Preparing for a 21st-century economy New Mexico State University Chancellor Dan Arvizu was also in attendance at Wednesday's summit.
In a statement, Arvizu wrote, "No matter what socioeconomic background our students arrive from, attaining a degree positions them to earn higher salaries, to live healthier lives and to achieve greater successes than someone without a degree. In turn, this helps their families and lifts the communities where they live. We are eager to see where this endeavor can lead our state. Right now, we are assessing what implications this announcement may have for the entire NMSU system."
Workforce Solutions Secretary Bill McCamley called the governor's proposal "brave" yet essential for helping new generations of New Mexico workers. He said that students who continue their education beyond secondary school with minimal student debt will have more options to explore job opportunities or establish themselves as entrepreneurs.
"Since 2008 and the great recession, over 95 percent of the new jobs that have been created in the country require more than a high school degree," McCamley said. "We're not just talking about bachelor's degrees, we're talking about associate's degrees and industry-specific certificates. The point of it is, you need more than a high school degree to make it in a 21st-century economy and that's why the governor's proposal is so important."

Texto completo: A postcard to Trump
I'm sending a postcard to President Trump, along with a taped-on section of a New York Times article about his attack-mode for California regarding auto emissions.
Why not lower auto emissions? Some of us are families with offspring going into the future, and we'd like it to be a livable planet.
Here's what I wrote: “The amount of time (ours and yours) you waste being vengeful and petty, you could work with both parties on mending our aging infrastructure – bridges, gas pipelines, sewer systems, etc.”
That fit on the postcard. That all fits in with how a good president would spend his time and energy. Don't I wish.

A Mystic's Work Is Cast in a Brilliant Light

Texto completo: George Gurdjieff arranged traditional chants and dances as piano miniatures. Now a fuller instrumentation is returning.
The traditional ethnic hymns, chants and dances that the Armenian mystic George Ivanovich Gurdjieff collected around the turn of the 20th century, and later transcribed with the help of the Russian composer Thomas de Hartmann, are among the most entrancing works ever written for piano. Many are simple: a slender melodic line, curled here and there into arabesques, above a prayer-bead string of repeated notes in the bass. Each piece is brief -- the length of a pop song -- and powerfully hypnotic.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
And yet the last thing Gurdjieff wanted was to put listeners in a trance. The worldview of this enigmatic seeker, who died in Paris in 1949 -- The New York Times said he was 83, but he may have been over a decade younger -- was that too many people went about their lives like automatons. They needed to bring their emotional, physical and mental intelligences into balance, and wake up.
This month, a group of Armenian musicians will present concerts in Chicago (Sept. 25), New York (Sept. 27) and Pasadena, Calif. (Sept. 29), that cast Gurdjieff's music in a bold new light. By playing his works on the traditional instruments of their regions of origin, juxtaposed with piano versions, the Gurdjieff Ensemble offers listeners a chance to hear the music in a way that is ethnically specific, and in jolting bright color.
Levon Eskenian, who founded the ensemble and arranged the music, spoke in a Skype interview about the work that went into identifying the musical background of each piano miniature. In his youth, Gurdjieff had traveled throughout the Caucasus, Middle East and North Africa collecting melodies: shepherd tunes and songs for plowing, liturgical chants and funerary rites.
"These are real pieces that passed through Gurdjieff," said Mr. Eskenian. "Music for work, for different rituals, for mourning. You can still find some of them transmitted orally in certain places."
One reason the piano pieces sound so concentrated and pure is that they are the result of a double process of sublimation. First they were filtered through Gurdjieff's memory, then through de Hartmann's transcriptions. A 2011 recording on the ECM label gives a flavor of how the music is altered through Mr. Eskenian's reverse transcriptions. A Kurdish shepherd melody takes on new wildness when it's played with gusty exuberance on a ney (a Middle Eastern flute). Dances spin to life with the addition of nervy frame drums.
The undisputed star of the ensemble, though, is the duduk, a reed instrument with a malleable sound that can be porous and fragile or full-throated and uncannily human-sounding. In his transcriptions Mr. Eskenian uses it for mystical chants, as well as for the emotionally raw number called "Assyrian Women Mourners."
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Mr. Eskenian thinks that Gurdjieff chose the piano as the repository for his music collection for practical reasons. But in the course of his research, Mr. Eskenian came across a document from later in Gurdjieff's life, when he lived and taught in Paris, that speaks of plans for a performance on traditional instruments.
"At one of his concerts it was announced that the following year they would perform the music of Gurdjieff on 40 instruments that he had collected on his journeys," said Mr. Eskenian, adding that the project never materialized. But he saw it as a sign that Gurdjieff himself intended to reconnect the melodies to the colors with which he had first heard them.
Doing justice to the geographic specificity of Gurdjieff's music also led to an unusual recording project by the pianist Frederic Chiu. In a phone interview, Mr. Chiu said he first encountered Gurdjieff through his writings, before becoming fascinated by the works for piano.
Reconciling the natural limitations of the piano's fixed pitches with the rich variety of tuning systems that underlie Middle Eastern music became an obsession. "It's not so much that this music came out of this particular region," Mr. Chiu said. "Rather, there was a purity to it that pushed me to explore temperaments" -- tunings -- "something I had never even been sensitive to until that point."
With the help of an expert in Arabic music, Mr. Chiu identified particular Gurdjieff melodies as, for example, Egyptian or Syrian, and created custom tunings for each. This means that certain key intervals, like fifths, ring out with crystalline clarity.
Mr. Chiu has more recently performed this program on a Yamaha TransAcoustic piano, which connects the instrument's natural soundboard to a digital processor. This new technology allows him to create the illusion that the piano changes tuning for each piece in the concert.
On his 2016 album, "Hymns and Dervishes," Mr. Chiu juxtaposes melodies inflected with Eastern and Western tunings in a way that echoes Mr. Eskenian's efforts to highlight the ethnic diversity of the Gurdjieff canon. "I wanted to point out that even within the Gurdjieff work there is a meeting of cultures," Mr. Chiu said.
He added that his play with the intonation of the normally fixed piano was one way to stop the listener from mindlessly blissing out. "It's constantly changing the ground underneath you," he said. "It's like walking on those shoes that have the rounded sole: you're never able to just stay there and relax."

Texto completo: At the rate things are going, citizens will need a scorecard to identify the targets of impeachment on Capitol Hill

Congressional Democrats continue to be at odds with each other over the subject of impeachment.

But they've expanded the debate. Once limited to disputes over the political wisdom of impeaching President Donald Trump, now they're fussing at each other whether and how to impeach new U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.

Kavanaugh, a member of the court for less than a year now, has been a target of impeachment talk since his confirmation, the consequence of his critics' characterizations of him as a serial rapist. Evidence to support those claims was, to say the least, unpersuasive.

But recent reporting from the New York Times -- shoddy and incomplete -- has put the issue back on the front page, leading to a new round of calls for impeachment by such party luminaries as presidential candidates U.S. Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris and party firebrands like U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ayanna Pressley.

But not everyone in the Democratic Party establishment is happy with what they're seeing as a new trend in governing the country.

That includes U.S. Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., who said his Democratic congressional colleagues need to "get real."

"We've got to get beyond this 'impeachment is the answer to every problem.' It's not realistic. If that's how we are identified in Congress, as the impeachment Congress, we run the risk that people will feel we're ignoring the issues that mean a lot to them as families," he said.

Durbin may or may not be correct that the dual proposals to impeach Trump and Kavanaugh are politically unwise, but he knows it's not smart to be seen as being at odds with fellow party members. So he, cleverly but not persuasively, blamed Republicans for the latest talk of impeaching Kavanaugh.

"We're now getting pushed into the impeachment corner by the Republicans every chance they get," Durbin said.

Don't bother trying to analyze the thinking behind Durbin's assertion. He's just trying to establish common ground with the Democrats whom he's warning off impeachment.

Durbin is not the only senior Democrat concerned about his party's impeachment agenda.

The usually talkative U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer told reporters he would address the Kavanaugh issue at some future time.

"That's all I'm saying. Which is nothing. I'm saying nothing on Kavanaugh," he said.

Impeachment, of course, is a cumbersome process that, theoretically at least, involves allegations of "high crimes and misdemeanors" against alleged wrongdoers.

In the real world, of course, grounds for impeachment are whatever the U.S. House and Senate say they are. Still, grounds for impeaching a federal judge or a president can't just be conjured out of thin air because there are political consequences for pursuing ill-conceived removal efforts.

Republicans pursued an impeachment investigation and trial of former President Bill Clinton, and they paid for their actions at the polls. Now House Judiciary Committee Democrats are going after Trump, even while House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is discouraging that effort and, so far at least, refusing to even comment on the effort to get Kavanaugh.

The Democrats' frustration is clear and, to a certain degree, understandable. Embittered over Hillary Clinton's 2016 loss to Trump, they're confronted with a president whose policies and personality they abhor.

But those are political problems that must be met with political solutions, not half-baked impeachment inquiries that are doomed to fail.

There's an election next year that can be the answer to all the Democrats' problems.

All they have to do is win. They'd be well advised to redirect their energy to achieving that goal rather than launching multiple politically hazardous impeachment probes.

Texto completo: Headnote ATONING FOR HISTORY
By the time Phillips Brooks arrived at the Virginia Theological Seminary in 1856, the institution was thriving. Founded more than three decades earlier in the Sunday school room of a church in Alexandria, Virginia, the seminary now sat on a 62-acre estate with lush meadows and glorious views of the Washington Monument.
School officials saw the transformation as a sign of divine blessings. But Brooks, a seminarian who would go on to become the bishop of his home state of Massachusetts, saw more than the hand of God at work.
"There are crowds of slaves about here," wrote Brooks in one of a series of letters describing life at the school, the first Episcopal seminary in the South. "It is one of the best places to see the sad effects of slavery on the white population, degrading and unmanning them."
This month, more than a century after the last enslaved people labored on campus, the seminary's leaders announced plans to atone for that history. They are creating a $1.7 million reparations fund, becoming one of the first U.S. institutions to allocate money specifically for the descendants of the enslaved. The fund will also provide financial support for Black seminarians and Black worshippers who experienced discrimination on campus.
"We need to come to terms with a past that has an ugly side, a wicked side," the Rev. Ian S. Markham, the seminary's dean and president, said in an interview.
"When you're talking about something as heinous as slavery, there's no amount really that can actually satisfy that sin," Markham said. "It's just too enormous. But we're going to do the hard work, recognizing that our past is full of sin and grace."
The move places the Southern seminary at the forefront of a growing number of universities and religious institutions striving to make amends for their involvement in America's system of involuntary servitude. And it comes as some groups move beyond apologies, considering actual financial compensation to descendants.
Last year, the Catholic sisters of the Society of the Sacred Heart created a reparations fund to finance scholarships for African Americans in Grand Coteau, Louisiana, where the nuns had owned about 150 Black people.
This spring, students at Georgetown University, a Jesuit institution, voted to create a fund, financed by student fees, to benefit the descendants of the 272 people who were sold in 1838 to help keep the college afloat. (The plan has yet to receive approval from Georgetown's board of trustees.)
The Jesuits, who founded and ran Georgetown and organized the 1838 slave sale, are currently in talks with descendants of the people they once owned. Those descendants are seeking $1 billion for a foundation that would finance educational, health, housing and other needs.
In a statement, Timothy P. Kesicki, president of the Jesuit Conference of Canada and the United States, said the Jesuits and Georgetown officials "have been constructively engaged in discussing the descendants' vision for a pathway forward."
The decision by Virginia Theological Seminary moves the debate over reparations - which in recent months has bubbled up in presidential campaigns and in the halls of Congress - from the theoretical to a reality.
"It's important because the conversation about institutional obligations to the descendants of the enslaved typically gets confined to a discussion of research and fact-finding," said Craig Steven Wilder, a historian at MIT who has written extensively about universities and their ties to slavery.
"It's the religious institutions that have started to lay out a path from there toward restorative justice," Wilder added. "It's much harder for religious institutions to be silent on the moral implications of their own history."
The fund at the Virginia Theological Seminary will be administered by the Rev. Joseph Thompson, the director of the Office of Multicultural Ministries. The institution plans to spend about $70,000 each year.
The seminary hopes to identify descendants of the enslaved laborers who worked on campus and seminarians who experienced discrimination at the school. Officials plan to discuss their needs and to offer financial assistance, officials said. "Everything is on the table," Markham said.
Officials also hope to support local churches with historical ties to the seminary and African-American alumni, especially Black Episcopal clergy and those working in Black congregations.
Markham said the decision to create the fund had touched off "a lively debate" within the seminary's community, where it has been discussed by members of the board, faculty and alumni.
"People had a lot of questions to ask," Thompson added. "There are obvious logistical challenges and obvious philosophical questions. I'm very excited to tackle those questions with the dean's task force."
Seminary officials plan to begin charting the way forward by digging into the past. They plan to pore over archival records to try to unearth the names and stories of the enslaved men and women who toiled on campus. Several of the institution's founders were slaveholders, including Francis Scott Key, who wrote the lyrics to "The Star-Spangled Banner." Census records indicate that at least five faculty members owned Black people as well, according to the Rev. Joseph M. Constant, the author of "No Turning Back: The Black Presence at Virginia Theological Seminary."
But most of the enslaved people on campus were rented from local plantations, including from Mount Vernon, George Washington's estate. Enslaved laborers are believed to have built several buildings on campus, including Aspinwall Hall, which currently houses the seminary's administrative offices, said Christopher Pote, the seminary's archivist.
The sight of so many enslaved men and women on campus in the 1850s astonished Brooks, the young seminarian from Massachusetts.
"All the servants are slaves," Brooks wrote to his father in 1856. And students who tried to minister to the enslaved encountered threats and resistance.
One Northern student, he wrote, held a meeting once a week for the enslaved people at the seminary, but had been told to give it up, "or he will have to suffer."
"Another who has preached some in the neighborhood has been informed that there was tar and feather ready for him if he went far from the seminary," Brooks continued. "And in general they have been given to understand that their tongues were tied and they were anything but free. A pretty style of life, isn't it?"

Texto completo: The recent fiasco at The New York Times, which last weekend published the latest uncorroborated sexual-assault accusation against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, was a monument to hearsay and a travesty of journalistic ethics.
The story, since modified to include crucial information, was an adapted excerpt from a book — "The Education of Brett Kavanaugh," written by two Times’ staff writers, Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly. In it, the authors reported allegations by a Yale classmate that Kavanaugh was at a "drunken dorm party" where "friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student."
Setting aside the logistics of such a feat, more eye-popping was the omission from the original Times’ piece that the alleged victim refused to be interviewed for the book — and, according to friends, doesn’t remember any such incident.
Such an oversight is inexcusable.
The Times added these details to the story after they were flagged by The Federalist’s Mollie Hemingway, who had an advance copy of the book. The Times’ writers, who said that the details had been in the excerpt’s initial draft, made media rounds Monday and Tuesday to explain the omission and essentially blamed editors, who, they said, "in the haste" of trying to close out production, had deleted the reference.
The facts that the alleged victim refused to be interviewed by the authors and apparently told friends that she doesn’t recall any such incident amount to the very definition of a non-story. For the record, The Washington Post learned of the accusation last year but declined to publish it because the alleged witnesses weren’t identified and the woman said to be involved refused to comment.
Indeed, the authors’ only sources for the claim were two unnamed officials who spoke to Washington attorney Max Stier, who last year apparently told the FBI and various senators that he witnessed the alleged incident. But Stier refused to talk to the Times’ writers himself.
Some Democratic contenders for the presidency immediately called for Kavanaugh’s impeachment. They include Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Sen. Kamala Harris, former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg.
But let’s rewind the reel a bit. With apologies to my grandmothers, the reason The Times’ writers likely included the penis-in-hand accusation at all is because it added context to the accusations by both Deborah Ramirez, who alleged last year that she experienced sexual misconduct by Kavanaugh at another boozy Yale party, and Christine Blasey Ford.
Ramirez, for her part, initially wasn’t quite sure of events. She has admitted to time lapses and also to having been drunk, but told The New Yorker and the Times writers that she remembers brushing away a penis thrust in her face, allegedly by Kavanaugh.
If these stories are true, then Kavanaugh could have been a creepy, perhaps monstrous, drunk in his youth. But all we have to go by is alleged victims who also were drinking at the time and comments from former classmates, who may also have been inebriated, some of whom corroborate the Ramirez accusation and others who dispute it. The Times’ writers reported finding seven people who they say corroborated Ramirez’s story, but much of what they documented were second- and third-hand reports, things overheard and, yes, Ramirez’s mother, to whom she apparently said "Something happened at Yale."
Not exactly a wrap for justice.
The truth is, Kavanaugh has been the target of a media siege since his name was announced for consideration for the high court. Ramirez’s story was first reported by The New Yorker just days before Ford’s congressional testimony, which, frankly, was flimsy at best. None of the other four people Ford named as attending the high school party where she claimed Kavanaugh groped her recalled any such gathering. One of them, a close friend and the only other female, Leland Keyser, not only doesn’t remember the party — but says she’s never even met Kavanaugh.
What’s all too clear is that America’s privileged youth had a serious drinking problem in the early 1980s; and boozy memories from high school and young adulthood are unreliable. Far more troubling is that several presidential candidates seemingly would impeach a Supreme Court justice on nothing more than hearsay — and impeachable journalism.

Striking workers remind us that they saved GM

Texto completo: During the debate over whether the federal government should save the American auto industry in late 2008, a driver rammed into my old Saturn in a late-night accident while it was parked in front of my house. Fortunately, no one was hurt, but I needed a new car.
I strongly supported the rescue effort, so I felt an obligation to look to a Detroit-based car company organized by the United Auto Workers union for a replacement. I got a Chevy Malibu — my kids called it “Dad’s Boo” — and remain happy that I did.
In organizing what critics called the “bailout” of GM and Chrysler, President Obama was defying popular sentiment. Yet what was in many ways the most radical step he took to revive an American economy in free fall turned out to be one of his most politically beneficial initiatives.
Witness GM’s $35 billion in North American profits over the last three years. The taxpayers got most of their money back and, by certain measures, even turned a modest profit off the government’s investment. Either way, a catastrophe was averted. It wasn’t just two big companies that were saved. So were suppliers whose collapse would have devastated the Midwest.
My support for the bailout was rooted in practical economic concerns: Our economy was teetering and could not afford the damage an auto-sector implosion would inflict. But my passion for it came from a concern for the lives of the workers involved and a lifelong respect for the UAW.
Unions get knocked for being unconcerned about the health of the companies they organize. The UAW showed how untrue this is. It made sweeping concessions to management to persuade federal officials to undertake the investment of public money — and to keep the companies alive.
Among other gripes is the tiered wage system that Neal Boudette described well in The New York Times: “Workers hired before 2007 make about $31 an hour, and can retire with a lifelong pension. Those hired after them (now more than a third of the work force) start at about $17 an hour and can work their way up to about $29 an hour over eight years. They also have to rely on 401(k) retirement accounts instead of pensions. In addition, GM uses temporary workers (about 7% of the staff) who earn about $15 an hour, and do not have vision or dental benefits.”
The rank-and-file don’t like the idea of people doing the same labor at radically different pay levels. And then there are the plant closures that have slashed 14,000 North American jobs, as well as the announcement that the Chevy Blazer would be built in Mexico.
Symbolically and substantively, the closure earlier this year of the legendary GM plant in Lordstown, Ohio, that had produced Chevy Cruzes was an especially heavy blow — and it flew in the face of President Trump’s promise in a 2017 speech in nearby Youngstown that factory jobs are “all coming back. They’re all coming back.”
The cliché is singularly appropriate in this case: The struggle for employment, pay and benefits in the auto industry is where the rubber meets the road in our too often very abstract discussion of the challenges facing American wage earners in an economy undergoing rapid transformation. The battle at GM is a fight that unions and workers cannot afford to lose.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - A whistleblower complaint aimed at President Donald Trump by an intelligence official has set off another struggle between Congress and the executive branch.
The New York Times and the Washington Post, citing people familiar with the matter, reported Thursday night that the complaint centers on Ukraine.
The complaint involved communications with a foreign leader and a "promise" that Mr. Trump made, which prompted a U.S. intelligence official who had worked at the White House to go to the inspector general of the intelligence community, two former U.S. officials said.
Two and a half weeks before the complaint was filed, Mr. Trump spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, a comedian and political newcomer who was elected in a landslide in May.
That call is already under investigation by House Democrats who are examining whether Mr. Trump and his attorney Rudy Giuliani sought to manipulate the Ukrainian government into helping Mr. Trump's re-election campaign. Lawmakers have demanded a full transcript and a list of participants on the call.
Mr. Trump has denied doing anything improper. In a tweet Thursday morning, the president wrote, "Virtually anytime I speak on the phone to a foreign leader, I understand that there may be many people listening from various U.S. agencies, not to mention those from the other country itself."
"Knowing all of this, is anybody dumb enough to believe that I would say something inappropriate with a foreign leader while on such a potentially 'heavily populated' call," Mr. Trump wrote.
The Democrats' investigation was launched earlier this month, prior to revelations that a U.S. intelligence official, who previously worked in the White House, had lodged a complaint with the inspector general for the intelligence community. The Washington Post first reported on Wednesday that the complaint had to do with a "promise" that Mr. Trump made when communicating with a foreign leader.
On Thursday, the inspector general testified behind closed doors to members of the House Intelligence Committee about the whistleblower's complaint.
Over the course of three hours, Michael Atkinson repeatedly declined to discuss with members the content of the complaint, saying he was not authorized to do so.
He and the members spent much of their time discussing the process Mr. Atkinson followed, the statute governing his investigation of the complaint, and the nature of an "urgent concern" that he believed it represented, according to a person familiar with the briefing, who, like others, spoke on condition of anonymity.
"He was being excruciatingly careful about the language he used," the person said.

Frivolous dance can't hide Sean Spicer's past sycophancy national viewpoint

Texto completo: Earlier this week, Sean Spicer, Donald Trump's short-term press secretary with a long-term habit of sycophancy, made his debut on ABC's "Dancing with the Stars."
This was the premiere episode of the reality show's 28th season. Spicer showed up wearing white pants and shoes and a shiny neon green V-neck shirt with layers of ruffles to adorn both his cleavage and his arms. He looked ridiculous, but he was so jolly and jovial, you understand. "Brave," the reliably right-wing Mike Huckabee said on Twitter.
Spicer served as Trump's first press secretary for all of seven months. He kicked off his tenure by snarling at journalists for failing to repeat the president's lies about the size of his inauguration crowd. Spicer boasted that it was "the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period, both in person and around the globe."
As countless journalists noted, a time-lapse video produced by PBS showed otherwise. The National Mall was never full at any stage during that day, in stark contrast to Barack Obama's 2009 inauguration.
Eventually, Spicer said he regretted defending the indefensible that day. He has also expressed regret for an April 2017 press briefing, in which he discussed Syrian President Bashar Assad's use of chemical weapons to attack civilians, and attempted to push back on comparisons to Adolf Hitler.
"We didn't use chemical weapons in World War II," he said. "You had someone as despicable as Hitler who didn't even sink to using chemical weapons."
And so there we were, in 2017, having to contradict the press secretary for the president of the United States and remind readers that Hitler did, indeed, use chemical gas agents to kill more than 6 million Jews and other prisoners in concentration camps - not "concentration centers," as Spicer called them that day - during the Holocaust.
But hey, he's in ruffles now! Giving lots of paid speeches, and consulting, too. And in January, the Newport Daily News reported that Spicer had bought a summer home for nearly $800,000 in Rhode Island.
Most notably, Spicer is saying not one negative word about the man he helped to become the most dangerous man ever to be president of the United States.
As Annie Karni wrote for The New York Times, "Mr. Spicer, more than any other staff member in the revolving door that is President Trump's West Wing, has become an avatar for the reputational sacrifice and ritual humiliation that come with trying to remain in Mr. Trump's good graces while also seeking mainstream acceptance."
That "mainstream acceptance" is where we, the American public, come in.
What do we think of all this?
Before his televised appearance, Spicer tweeted: "Clearly the judges aren't going to be with me. Let's send a message to #Hollywood that those of us who stand for #Christ won't be discounted."
Right-wing so-called Christians regularly try to wield God as a weapon, but I've never before seen Jesus cast as cha-cha-cha Christ.
Spicer later deleted that tweet.
His Facebook post, in part, later read: "What. A. Night. Playing the bongos to the Spice Girls, while wearing a low cut ruffled lime green shirt check every box I had for getting out of my comfort zone. I had a blast!"
There are many ways Spicer could choose to get out of his "comfort zone."
He could publicly apologize, over and over, for the harm he helped to inflict on this country. He could use his celebrity to raise money for food banks, to feed the hungry, or take up the cause of diaper banks, to clothe babes in poverty. He could raise money to house the homeless, from sea to shining sea.
Instead, Spicer chose to shimmy on a national television stage to fuel an apparently bottomless need for money and attention. Spicer thinks that we - you and I - should find this spectacle hilarious.
"I was wearing a lime green shirt and playing the bongos," Spicer said in the wake of withering criticism. "If you weren't laughing, then you have a problem."
There are times when we have to remind ourselves that an unwillingness to laugh does not mean we have lost our sense of humor.
This would be one of those times.

Texto completo: New York Yankees pitcher Domingo Germán has been placed on administrative leave due to the MLB's domestic violence policy, the league announced Thursday.
MLB announced that it will undergo an investigation into Germán, but did not specifically say what his alleged actions are. The specifics of the incident were not announced as the league investigates the situation.
Bob Klapisch of the New York Times reported Thursday afternoon on social media that the incident with Germán involved his girlfriend and occurred between late Monday night and Tuesday morning.
The Yankees released a statement on Thursday in response to MLB's decision.
"We fully support all measures being undertaken by the commissioner's office pursuant to the policy of domestic violence. We support this policy which reinforces that domestic violence has no place in our society and cannot be tolerated. We have followed the lead of Major League Baseball and will continue to provide our complete cooperation throughout the investigative process. We reserve any further comment until the investigation reaches its conclusion. All questions pertaining to this matter should be directed to the office of the commissioner."
Yankees manager Aaron Boone told reporters Thursday afternoon that he learned of Germán's placement on the ride to Yankee Stadium.
"I heard some of the whispers and what not, but this is a Major League Baseball investigation and issue, so we are just trying to be as cooperative as we can while this goes on," Boone said.
It remains a mystery as to whether the Yankees were aware of a pending move by the league regarding Germán. The 27-year-old appeared in Wednesday's 3-2 loss to the Los Angeles Angels, tossing 21/3 scoreless innings in relief. Germán is 18-4 with a 4.03 ERA in 143 innings this season.
"It was vague to me," Boone said about hearing of the incident. Boone said he was not sure he knew if Germán was aware before pitching on Wednesday.
According to Boone, players were not informed of the move by the league before it was announced to the public. When Boone was asked if he knew anything before Wednesday's game, the manager said he could not comment further on an active league investigation.
"It's a Major League issue and we are kind of in a stand down mode," Boone said.
Boone and general manager Brian Cashman will address the team before Thursday night's game regarding the incident.
"I haven't thought of exactly what I'll say," Boone said. "Obviously, this is fresh. I'll get up there and talk as a group and as a family and speak from the heart."
With the move to place Germán on administrative leave, the Yankees brought up right-handed pitcher Michael King to the active roster. Under the administrative leave, Germán cannot have contact with the team while the matter is being investigated.

Two Mainers, N.H. man charged with exceeding herring quota Alleged quota violations happened at a time when regulators are trying to rebuild herring stock.

Texto completo: The owner and operator of a Rockland herring boat, one of his crew and a local wholesale seafood dealer are facing charges of exceeding their quota for the popular lobster bait at a time when fishing regulators are trying to rebuild the stock.
Glenn Robbins, a 72-year-old third-generation fisherman from Eliot, is charged with exceeding the weekly limit of 160,000 pounds of herring and trying to hide it from the Maine Department of Marine Resources by failing to file accurate landings reports.
"These violations are nothing short of a blatant disregard of the rules," said DMR Commissioner Patrick Keliher. "Mr. Robbins has attended many herring management meetings over the years to speak to the need to protect this industry from overfishing. ... This is disappointing, to say the least."
The 104-foot Western Sea sails out of Rockland. The seiner can hold up to 300,000 pounds of herring at a time, caught using two nets that encircle a school and scooping them up. Robbins used to own a trawler, but gave it up and has spoken out against them, saying they were depleting the stock.
"They're on the bottom of the food chain," Robbins told The New York Times in 2012 in a story about efforts to stop midwater trawling. "Everything eats the herring -- the whales, the mammals, the birds. If you don't have a good stock of herring, nothing else is going to stick around."
Another operator of the Western Sea, 42-year-old Ethan Chase of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, was cited for failure to properly notify DMR before landing and for exceeding the weekly harvest limit in September by over 110,000 pounds, all of which was seized by the Marine Patrol.
Maine herring regulations require vessels like the Western Sea to send an email to DMR three hours before landing to identify themselves and their total catch so the state can confirm the landings. This is how Maine makes sure that its fleet has not exceeded regional fishing quotas.
The Marine Patrol found Western Sea failed to warn DMR twice, and both times exceeded its weekly limit.
DMR also cited wholesale seafood dealer Dustin Reed, owner of New Moon Fisheries in Friendship, for failure to report the herring that he bought from Robbins and for conducting the transaction without a herring dealer permit.
The three are facing fines of up to $100 per violation, but the bigger penalty could be losing their right to fish and buy or sell fish. Keliher has the authority to suspend licenses for failure to comply with reporting requirements and exceeding fishing quotas.
Robbins said he doesn't think the citation is fair and is working with the state to resolve it, The Associated Press reported. Phone calls to numbers listed in the other two men's names were not returned, according to the AP.
A failure to crack down on violators could hurt Maine's chances at lobbying for a bigger herring quota with the regional fishing regulators that monitor the stock and set state-by-state landing limits. Such agencies look at state compliance when evaluating state quota requests.
The New England Fishery Management Council voted last year to set the 2019 herring quota at 32.1 million pounds - about 78 million pounds less than what the East Coast herring fleet was permitted to catch in 2018 - to help the population recover from a record-low number of juvenile herring.
Maine's $485 million-a-year lobster industry relies on the availability of affordable bait to lure shedding lobsters into their traps. Those who fish out of smaller ports worry about the availability of herring, a traditional favorite among lobstermen, and what a shortage could mean for bait prices.
The Maine Lobstermen's Association has predicted a 50 million-pound bait shortage in 2019, but cold weather forced a late start to the lobster season and state approval of new kinds of bait that could serve as a herring alternative have helped to avert a full-blown bait crisis.

Restiveness in Pakistani-Held Kashmir, Too

Texto completo: MUZAFFARABAD, Kashmir -- In Pakistan-controlled Azad Jammu and Kashmir, the simple fact of the region's name -- with azad meaning free -- is a declaration that Kashmiris here enjoy a liberty denied to their kin across the border, in the Indian-held portion of the disputed territory.
But even in Pakistan-held Kashmir, the message has been clear, residents say: No talk of independence will be allowed.
As an Indian crackdown on the other side of Kashmir has led to massive civil unrest and new calls for a Kashmir free from either India or Pakistan, local activists and officials say a parallel security operation is being pushed inside Pakistan.
Pakistan has long prided itself on being a champion for Kashmiris, who are predominantly Muslim. And the government has chastised India for suppressing calls for freedom in the portion of Kashmir that New Delhi controls.
But New York Times journalists who were granted rare access to Azad Jammu and Kashmir in recent days found a toughening Pakistani security response to a growing independence movement here.
Residents say the upwelling is rooted in fears that their ability to reunify has been slowly slipping away ever since India increased its control of the divided territory and Pakistan did little to stop it other than to offer negotiations that India refused.
The Pakistani crackdown also has another focus, locals say: As outrage over India's move to end Kashmiri autonomy last month has galvanized militants, Pakistani officials fear they could face international sanctions if they don't rein in the armed groups.
On both sides of the border, Kashmiris are expressing frustration that no one is on their side.
"Both countries have gone to war over Kashmir. But Kashmiris have never had a voice in any of these disputes," said Abdul Hakeem Kashmiri, a prominent journalist in Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistani-held Kashmir.
"We love the Pakistani Army and the Pakistani people, but we have our own culture. And people know what the unspoken red line is: independence," Mr. Kashmiri said.
Pro-independence demonstrations that once attracted dozens of protesters are now attracting thousands, residents say. In one case this month, some 5,000 Kashmiris tried to march to the Indian border in Poonch district in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, local police officials said. Protesters charged at Pakistani security officers while chanting, "We want freedom on this side and we want freedom on the other side," and "Foreign oppressors, leave us alone."
Police batons cracked into the protesters, halting their advance and leading to scuffles that left 18 demonstrators and seven Pakistani police officers wounded, officials said. The protests were barely covered in Pakistani media, and mobile phone and internet were cut off for awhile in the area. One military general dismissed the demonstrators as "Indian agents."
Despite appeals from the political leadership of Pakistan-held Kashmir to stop marching to the border area, Kashmiris say they plan to press on. They have called for massive protests on the border with India on Saturday and in early October that are expected to be the biggest demonstrations yet.
"The independence struggle on both sides of the border is being suppressed," said Anam Zakaria, the author of "Between the Great Divide: A Journey Into Pakistan-Administered Kashmir."
"There is a frustration that they have been on the front line of the conflict and are pawns in this greater game between India and Pakistan," she said.
Last month, India stripped the autonomy from the portion of Kashmir it holds and strengthened New Delhi's hold on the territory, detaining local politicians and activists and imposing a curfew and communications blockade that has entered its second month.
The protests are channeling civilian anger at the "line of control," the de facto border that splits Kashmir between India and Pakistan, slicing through valleys dotted with wildflowers and pine trees, down the middle of rivers and through entire towns.
Sheep graze over the heavily mined boundary. Shepherds accidentally cross it, oblivious to its contours, only to be shelled by Indian or Pakistani soldiers, or detained.
The line demarcates the point where, in 1947, Indian forces repelled invading Pashtun tribal fighters that Pakistan drew from its border area with Afghanistan -- the beginning of a longstanding Pakistani strategy to use militant proxies to weaken its neighboring rivals.
Originally, the line of control was meant to be temporary, with plans for a referendum that would allow Kashmiris to choose whether to join India or Pakistan. That vote never happened, and now, after decades of fighting, many Kashmiris fear that the temporary boundary will become a hard border, dividing the territory permanently.
"Kashmiris are trying to take their fate in their own hands. We realize that we can only rely on ourselves," said Haris Qadeer, a young Kashmiri who joined the protests and whose newspaper in Muzaffarabad was shut down in 2017 for its pro-independence stance.
"The line of control is what separates us, it is what makes us refugees in our own country," Mr. Qadeer said.
The police force used against protesters this month was a "preventive measure," said the president of Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Masood Khan, saying that the police response was restrained compared with that used by Indian forces on the other side of the line, who he said at times open fire on protesters trying to cross the border, resulting in serious injuries.
"There is a high degree of tolerance for dissent. There is an overwhelming pro-Pakistan sentiment in Azad Kashmir and Indian-occupied Kashmir," Mr. Khan added.
But Kashmiri nationalists are forbidden in government. Elected officials like Mr. Khan must sign a declaration before they can run for office stating that they "believe in the ideology of Pakistan" and in Kashmir's eventually accession to become a formal part of that country.
Some here say that Pakistan's response is also rooted in the fear that militants the Pakistani security forces once mobilized to fight India in Kashmir are gearing up again right as Pakistan faces the threat of international sanctions if it does not crack down on terrorist groups.
One former Kashmiri militant said he was angry at what he saw as a hypocritical betrayal by Pakistani officials, who recently shut down the border after pushing various militants to cross it in the 1990s.
The militant, who spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal by the authorities, said Pakistan's military had "polluted" the Kashmiri cause by using the issue as a rallying cry for various terrorist groups in Pakistan to fight India, including Lashkar-e-Taiba, which took part in later attacks against India's parliament in 2001 and in Mumbai in 2008.
"We were freedom fighters, made up from the Kashmiri people. But then Pakistan pushed groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba on our movement. People began to confuse our struggle for freedom with a desire for terrorism," the former militant said.
Under heavy international pressure to cut links to militants, Pakistan is squeezing the jihadists who once operated freely in Muzaffarabad city, a nerve center for anti-Indian groups, locals say.
In Muzaffarabad, the local office of Hizbul Mujahedeen, a leading faction in the deadly insurgency that wracked Indian-held Kashmir in the 1990s, has been shuttered by officials since May.
"Jihad had once become a way of living," said Manzoor Gilani, the former chief justice of Azad Jammu and Kashmir.
Now, "not every Tom, Dick and Harry can stand up and say they will go for jihad," Mr. Gilani added. "The jihadists are now styled as terrorists. They served the interests of Pakistan at one time, but now Pakistan feels it was a bad way of doing business."
But with India moving unilaterally to finalize its grip on Kashmir, some residents say Pakistan has chosen the worst time to shift gears.
Abdul Rashid Turabi, the former head of Jamaat-e-Islami, believed to be the political arm of the militants Hizbul Mujahedeen, insisted that his group still hoped for peace. "That and dialogue are the priorities," he said in an interview.
But he added that time was running out for a diplomatic solution to the crisism, and that many here were unwilling to hold back.
"Narendra Modi is driving people to jihad, not me," he said, referring to India's prime minister.
Other residents were less restrained.
"The only solution is war," said Muhammad Arshad Abbasi, a shopkeeper in Chakothi, one of the last border towns before the line of control. "It has been 70 years, and what has talking with India achieved? There is no way other than jihad."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The House on Thursday approved a short-term spending bill that would stave off a government shutdown until just before Thanksgiving, allowing lawmakers additional time to resolve disputes over annual spending legislation without a funding lapse.
The spending bill would extend funding through Nov. 21 not only for all federal government departments and agencies, but also for a number of health care and community programs, including the National Flood Insurance Program and the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program.
But its success in the House, by a 301-to-123 vote, is only a temporary salve to the bitter feuds that are standing in the way of a broader agreement over federal spending for next year. The Senate, in the midst of drafting and debating its own yearlong funding bills, has struggled to break through partisan spats over spending on President Trump's promised wall at the southwestern border.
The bill passed on Thursday, said Representative Nita M. Lowey, Democrat of New York and the chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee, "will provide families, businesses and communities with budget certainty while we negotiate long-term funding."
The Senate is expected to pass the measure before funding lapses on Oct. 1, giving senators an additional two months -- until just before Congress takes a weeklong Thanksgiving break -- to pass a dozen spending bills, reconcile them with the House's legislation and secure the president's signature.
While congressional leaders and the White House reached agreement in July over nearly $ 1.4 trillion for defense and domestic programs, 12 annual bills are necessary to outline how that money will be divided among agencies, programs and departments. The House this year passed 10 of those bills, but at different funding levels than in the budget agreement.
But those bills cannot be reconciled until the Senate passes its own versions.
Senate Democrats have raised objections to how the Republican majority set funding levels for some of the bills, and provisions that would allow for more money to be set aside for barriers and fencing. Backed by their House counterparts, they have also objected to the administration's demand that Congress replace $ 3.6 billion that was diverted from military construction projects to wall construction.
"We do not support diverting taxpayer dollars to build an ineffective and controversial wall along our southern border," a group of Senate Democrats wrote in a letter this week, urging for a more bipartisan process. "Especially when those funds are stolen from our military and important investments for American families, such as college affordability, and our fight against the opioid crisis."
Republicans, for their part, have pushed back on some amendments that they say are "poison pills," legislative jargon for partisan provisions that could imperil the legislation on the Senate floor. And they have accused Democrats of violating the terms of the budget agreement, which barred such policy riders.
"Our Democratic friends turned on a dime, reneged on the bipartisan agreement, and began demanding exactly the kinds of new poison pills and partisan policy changes that we all promised to omit," said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader. "It's not about the money. It's not about compromising and getting to 'yes.' It's about not wanting to take 'yes' for an answer."
The gridlock over the measures funding the military, military construction and labor and health programs led to the failure of a procedural vote on Wednesday that would have allowed the Senate to vote on some of the legislation.
Still haunted by the 35-day government shutdown that ended earlier this year, lawmakers are eager to avoid another funding lapse. But the acrimony is such that some lawmakers have already begun to raise the prospect of a full-year stopgap spending bill if agreement cannot be found.
"That's what you might wind up with if we don't get past a standoff," Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama and the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, told reporters on Wednesday. "I think we're talking to each other, but I don't know if either one's listening."
Some of the bills, including the measures that would fund energy, agriculture, housing and transportation agencies and departments, among others, have advanced out of the Senate Appropriations Committee on unanimous votes of support, giving lawmakers optimism that at least some of the must-pass legislation will reach the president's desk.
Mr. McConnell on Thursday also endorsed a $ 250 million grant in one of those bills that would help states fortify their election systems, calling it "exactly the kind of positive outcome that is possible when we stop posturing for the press."
The stopgap legislation approved on Thursday would also replenish a program under the Commodity Credit Corporation, which has been providing aid to farmers affected by Mr. Trump's trade war. But Democrats successfully included language requiring Sonny Perdue, the agriculture secretary, to submit an itemized list of payments made by the program and projections for future payments by next year.
Lawmakers also agreed to extend a full match in federal Medicaid funds for United States territories, another sticking point for negotiators.
The measure would also increase the amount of money for the Secret Service, to accommodate protection for the 2020 presidential candidates; add funds to carry out the 2020 census; and expand the number of Sept. 11 emergency workers who can enroll in the World Trade Center Health Program.

Terence Blanchard to Add Met Opera to His Credits

Texto completo: The company is making plans to bring Terence Blanchard's "Fire Shut Up in My Bones" to New York.
In its 136-year history, the Metropolitan Opera has never staged an opera by a black composer. But that will finally change: The company said on Thursday that it would present "Fire Shut Up in My Bones," by the composer and jazz trumpeter Terence Blanchard, in a coming season.
"He's a brilliant composer," Peter Gelb, the Met's general manager, said in a telephone interview.
Mr. Gelb made the announcement as the Met prepares to open its season on Monday with a new production of the Gershwins' "Porgy and Bess." The "Porgy" staging has brought renewed attention to the fact that the most-performed opera about the African-American experience was written by an all-white creative team, and has also served as a reminder of the historical dearth of opportunities for opera composers of color.
Mr. Gelb said that he had been in talks for months with Opera Theater of St. Louis, which gave the premiere of "Fire Shut Up in My Bones" in June, about bringing its production to New York. The director in St. Louis was James Robinson, who also staged the Met's new "Porgy."
"I wish my father was alive," Mr. Blanchard said in a telephone interview. "He was an avid opera fanatic."
"Fire Shut Up in My Bones" is based on a memoir by Charles Blow, an Opinion columnist for The New York Times, with a libretto by the writer and director Kasi Lemmons. In his review in The Times, Anthony Tommasini praised it as "subtly powerful."
"Vocal lines flow from lyrical wistfulness to snappy declamations; dense big-band sonorities in the orchestra segue into lighter passages backed by a jazz rhythm section," Mr. Tommasini wrote. "And there are rousing evocations of gospel choruses at church, blues and, during a fraternity party, a rhythmic chorus of spoken words, finger snapping and dance steps."
Many details remain to be worked out, including whether the Met will present the work at its 3,800-seat opera house at Lincoln Center, or as part of its new initiative to collaborate with other presenters, such as the Brooklyn Academy of Music and the Public Theater. But Mr. Gelb said that it could come to New York as soon as the 2021-22 season, with support from the Ford Foundation, and that the Met's music director, Yannick Nézet-Séguin, would conduct it.
Mr. Gelb and Mr. Nézet-Séguin have been working to bring more contemporary -- and diverse -- voices to the Met. Last year the company announced that for the first time it was commissioning operas by women -- a Missy Mazzoli work based on George Saunders's novel "Lincoln in the Bardo," and a Jeanine Tesori opera, "Grounded," based on a George Brant play. In its history the Met has performed just two operas by female composers: Kaija Saariaho's "L'Amour de Loin," in 2016, and Ethel M. Smyth's "Der Wald," in 1903, both of which were originally produced elsewhere.
"Hopefully," Mr. Gelb said, "there will be many more African-American composers whose work we feature."

Texto completo: TAOS -- Close friends, acquaintances and employees of 51-year-old Gregg Steele, the man accused of killing popular Taos coffee shop owner Patrick Larkin, said Steele often seemed to be teetering between boiling resentments and physical violence.
According to an arrest warrant affidavit charging Steele with second-degree murder and three other felonies connected to the Larkin's death, he confessed to crossing that threshold late last month, when he told his landlord he had shot and killed Larkin, 63, in the early morning hours of Aug. 27 in Llano Quemado.
The landlord, who said he had rented to Steele property adjacent to Larkin's over the summer, told his attorney Steele had admitted to shooting Larkin twice with a handgun, the affidavit said. Steele then confessed to loading Larkin's body into a truck, driving it around Taos for hours before disposing of it, and then hiding the murder weapon and a .22-caliber rifle he had stolen from Larkin, according to the affidavit.
New Mexico State Police found a goat mauled to death in Larkin's yard the morning he went missing. A day later, they found Larkin's body hidden in a bush a mile and a half from his home on Cuchilla Road. Larkin had two gunshot wounds -- one to the knee and another to the chest. An autopsy performed by the New Mexico Office of the Medical Investigator later recovered a .45-caliber bullet from his body.
After seizing Steele's pickup and obtaining a warrant to search it, the affidavit said, agents also found blood matching a sample of Larkin's DNA in the bed of the vehicle and on the driver's side door.
Early in the investigation, as agents canvassed the surrounding area to speak with neighbors, they found Steele was the only resident who wasn't home and would not answer phone calls. During their interviews, the affidavit said, they learned Steele's dogs were known to harass goats Larkin had been raising on his property.
As part of the investigation, state police agents interviewed several other people in Taos County who knew Steele and said he could be dangerous. Employees said Steele had told them about prior crimes he had committed in California and said he had expressed a desire to "burn down houses of those he perceived to have wronged him," according to the affidavit.
A friend in Questa said Steele had asked him to provide an alibi for him to say he was away from the Llano Quemado area around the time of Larkin's death, according to the affidavit.
An ex-fiancée said she had a recording of Steele talking about wanting to murder an ex-girlfriend and bury her body in the woods.
"In interviews with nearly all of Mr. Steele's friends, and associates, multiple agents were advised that Mr. Steele was unhinged and had a propensity for violence, " the affidavit said.
Steele has been known to go by a number of aliases, including Greg, Gregory and Stirling.
A 1996 article by George Johnson of the New York Times said a man named "Gregory A. Steele" from Taos was one of two people who turned themselves in after starting an illegal campfire near Bandelier National Monument that sparked a major wildfire. Authorities have not confirmed whether the man charged in that case is the suspect in Larkin's death.
The 8th Judicial District Attorney's Office has filed a motion to hold Steele without bond. A hearing on the motion will be held in state District Court in Taos, though a date has not been set.

Texto completo: I am 71 years old, and our family has had a Salt Lake Tribune at our morning door for all of those years and more.
I recognize that coverage of the LDS Church is important to the predominant culture. However, as expressed in the Sept. 16 letter from Janel Green VanDenBerghe, the persistent and dogmatic coverage of the LDS Church news, at the expense of national and international news has become too much for us.
So it is with a sad goodbye that I will be canceling my subscription today and going with The New York Times. Hopefully someday in the future The Tribune will once again truly become “Utah’s independent voice.”

Texto completo: As part of Constitution Week, Middle Tennessee State University hosted a panel on suffrage Tuesday afternoon where speakers tackled the history of voting rights.
Panelists included state Rep. London Lamar (D-Memphis), women's suffrage scholar Marjorie Spruill and New York Times opinion writer Margaret Renkl as the moderator. The panelists unpacked the suffrage movement, barriers voters face today and Tennessee's role in passing the 19th Amendment, which secured women the right to vote.
The journey to enfranchising voters began at the 1848 Seneca Falls Convention where voting rights became a prominent cause for the women's movement. By ruling that individual states could determine the fate of women voters, the Supreme Court sparked a national crusade to secure women's right to the ballot, Spruill said.
Southern states were most hostile to the cause, but it was Tennessee's vote that passed the amendment. Now part of political lore, Harry T. Burn, a young legislator, initially opposed suffragists. When it came time to vote, Burn, wearing a red rose signalling his opposition, waffled on his decision. His mother, Febb, had penned a letter imploring him to vote in favor of the suffragists.
He did.
'When women run, women win' At 28 years old, Lamar is the state's youngest legislator. Hailing from Memphis, she joined her local Democratic Party at 23 and ran for election in 2014 and was defeated.
But she didn't give up.
"I wanted a seat at the decision-making table," Lamar said. "When women run, women win."
And she did, securing a majority of voter support in the 2018 election. She now represents the 91st House District in Memphis.
Sometimes women don't support the movement Suffragists were "young, hip women" demanding control of their destinies, Spruill said.
But there were dissenters. Some women didn't believe they needed a vote to sway politics and weren't supportive of the cause. They thought they could make a difference on the sidelines by encouraging men to consider women's interest.
Politics was considered a corrupt, vile and sometimes violent field, the researcher said, and the evils of government were considered something that could easily spoil women. Enfranchising women was seen as ushering in corruption. If women were allowed to vote, men argued, they would become disillusioned in their role as homemakers and might push for more control in the public sphere.
What happened then isn't dissimilar to what's happening today with the issue of reproductive rights and women's autonomy, Lamar said.
The representative, a supporter of women's health and reproductive rights, said some women don't support other women's autonomy because it "messes up what they're doing."
"I'm not trying to take away from (your life), but don't try to take away from mine," Lamar said.
She said conservative women often don't see eye-to-eye with her due to different upbringings, making it difficult to find common ground, but they often agree when it comes to education and children's issues.
To move forward, we must know the past Although steps have been made to engage voters, equal measures are being made to disenfranchise them, Lamar said.
"We are still fighting for equality today," she said of black voters.
Tennessee ranks low on both voter turnout and registration. The Equity Alliance, a nonprofit based in Nashville, encourages people of color to vote. They registered thousands of voters in the 2018 election.
Legislation was later passed that allowed the state to fine groups that submit 100 or more incomplete voter registration forms. Additionally, if groups enroll 100 or more voters without completing mandated training, they can face steep penalities.
However, a federal judge in Nashville blocked the law and called it a "punitive regulatory scheme."
"Racism is still very real and it's still very systemic," Lamar said.
To combat this, and to encourage voter participation, she's working with other representatives to give college students easier access to polling locations. She's co-sponsoring legislation that, if passed, would declare Tennessee public universities with 8,000 or more students as early voting sites.
"We're seeing particularly in the southern states, although not exclusively, and particularly against people of color, these efforts at voter suppression, which means of course, we need to involve all of you and all of us in a new suffrage movement, because that's what it's going to take to save our democracy," Spruill said.

Texto completo: Why residents oppose drug treatment center
As an educator in the Itasca community for the past 40 years and and a resident for the last 32, I have to say that I was disappointed with Kristen McQueary's Sept. 17 column ("Would you support an opioid addiction treatment center in your neighborhood?"). As I've taught my students for years, when doing a research paper, it's important that you get your facts straight and that you see multiple sides of an issue.
McQueary ignored those provisos. Yes, the proposed Haymarket Center site is not in a residential area, but it is a quarter mile from our local library, our swimming pool and our nature center. Secondly, while DuPage County may have an opioid crisis, Itasca does not. As near as I can tell, we had one opioid death last year. Compare that with the numbers coming out of places like Naperville, and you can see where the real crisis is. Thirdly, if McQueary had interviewed any of the residents opposed to this site, she would have found that, rather than a massive case of NIMBY (not in my backyard), we have legitimate concerns about how our small town resources are supposed to support a 200-bed facility that would roughly increase our town's population by close to 2% with new residents who will possibly have a greater need for ambulance and police services.
Finally, if she came to our small town, she would see that the Holiday Inn where Haymarket wants to place its facility is at Irving Park Road and Interstate 290, with access to Illinois Route 390 and Interstate 355 nearby. Why does Haymarket want its facility here? We are ideally located for patients and their families to get here from all over DuPage County. But we are also ideally located for patients and families from Chicago, Elgin and Aurora, places with significantly more serious drug problems.
If this facility is built here, we will lose the $250,000 in taxes the Holiday Inn generates and will have to expand our police and ambulance services. A city the size of Naperville could absorb the loss of that tax revenue with a simultaneous expansion of first responder services. Itasca cannot.
-- Steven Fischer, Itasca

Hit job on Justice Brett Kavanaugh
Apparently, Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin missed The New York Times correction to its hit job on Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh ("This is the Brett Kavanaugh mess we feared," Sept. 17-19). Based on the Times piece, she thundered, further investigation of Kavanaugh is warranted. But the Times was compelled to acknowledge -- reluctantly, I'm sure -- in a subsequent version that the woman supposedly victimized by Kavanaugh decades ago declined to be interviewed and, according to friends, said she does not recall the incident of Kavanaugh exposing himself at a party. Can we have a crime with no victim?
That's right -- the supposed victim of Kavanaugh's behavior herself cannot recall the alleged exposure of the justice's genitals. The piece cited only a witness to verify the authenticity of the event. Yet, the Times chose to not cite a reason why this critical detail was omitted from the original article. In an Associated Press story on the matter printed in the Tribune, John McCormack of the conservative National Review correctly declared the omission of the reason for not mentioning the woman's lack of recollection of the incident to be "journalistic malpractice."
I personally believe the Times intentionally omitted the detail that the alleged victim did not remember the incident because mentioning it would've rendered the explosive and doubtless fallacious charge to be without merit. Times editors reason that their almost exclusively liberal readership will accept distortions in the name of shaming conservatives. No one should therefore be surprised when the Times and other liberal media outlets, including Rubin's employer, falsify information to advance a political narrative. That being said, can we render President Trump's "fake news" charges to be specious and bogus?
-- Frank Fisher, Chicago

Senate needs to protect elections
Democracy means free, safe, honest elections. The Senate has an obligation to our constitution and government to protect our elections. If they do nothing to protect and ensure honest elections, then maybe we should look into the complicity as treason.
-- Susan Friedman, Chicago

A year later, Kavanaugh still divides public opinion

Texto completo: Vicki Schmidt and Suzanne Lindberg remember the day Brett Kavanaugh became a Supreme Court Justice like it was yesterday.
But how the Wisconsin women remember the events leading to his confirmation a year ago are starkly different.
As President Donald Trump's nominee to replace retired Justice Anthony Kennedy, Kavanaugh's confirmation was cruising for a vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee only to be rocked by allegations of sexual assault made by psychology professor Christine Blasey Ford.
Outrage blew up across the political spectrum in the heightened climate of the #MeToo movement, protests flooded outside of the hearings and emotional testimonies were given by Ford followed by Kavanaugh, who forcefully denied any wrongdoing.
The events surrounding Kavanaugh's ascension to the Supreme Court manifested an already divided nation with protests lasting for weeks after the Senate narrowly voted 50–48 to confirm Kavanaugh, who was sworn in as the court's 114th Justice on Oct. 6, 2018.
Schmidt of Oshkosh remembers the time as a low point for women's credibility.
"I am still unhappy with the results and feel that Kavanaugh's confirmation only reinforced the idea that women are not to be believed," Schmidt said. "It really horrifies me to a certain degree that we would be willing to treat women like that who are coming forward with those kind of stories."
Lindberg of De Pere had a vastly different viewpoint, saying it was a political smear campaign against an innocent man.
"I have never witnessed such a totally corrupt group that would have no limits on the lack of morals and decency that I observed during the hearings," Lindberg said. "Watching the needless suffering of his family (is) forever cemented in my mind."
Earlier this week, the New York Times published new information about sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh reigniting the feud about him. Several 2020 Democratic presidential candidates have called for his impeachment from the Supreme Court. Trump and several prominent Republicans came to Kavanaugh's defense.
The newspaper later ran an update to the story saying the alleged victim in the story said she did not recall the events described and refused to be interviewed.
The Women's March plans to hold a protest against Kavanaugh on the one year anniversary of his confirmation.
In the aftermath of Kavanaugh's confirmation, studies show public opinion of the Supreme Court dropped. The Pew Research Center found partisan views of the court have reached its widest gap in more than two decades.
An unscientific survey by The Post-Crescent and USA TODAY NETWORK–Wisconsin asked people how they feel about Kavanaugh's confirmation process a year out. It generated more than 400 responses from across the country.
The survey showed an even split between those who support Kavanaugh and those who oppose him.
Yet a majority shared concerns about the Supreme Court becoming too politicized in a heightened climate of partisan politics.
"Kavanaugh may or may not vote the way I would like him to, but that is beside the point," said Steve Hermes of Kimberly. "His confirmation destroyed forever the integrity of the process and thus, the integrity of an unbiased, honorable Supreme Court."
Battle heightened worries about high court's independence Ed Skerke of Neenah said the hearings made him change his personal political views and he's lost faith in the Republican Party for sticking by Kavanaugh.
"I would consider myself an independent with conservative leaning up until the Kavanaugh hearing," Skerke said. "I was so disgusted by what I saw during the hearing. The Republican Party will have to work very hard to get my vote."
Roger Vander Logt of Manitowoc County said despite being a Democrat, he was offended by the way Kavanaugh and his family were treated in the midst of the allegations.
"I will never, ever support people that do that to another human being and his or her family," Vander Logt said. "I'll never vote for another Democrat ever."
Ryan Owens, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said putting the court on party lines threatens its legitimacy.
"These hyper-partisan confirmation battles we have these days certainly are not good for the court (and) for peoples' perceptions of the court," Owens said.
Unlike other political institutions, the Supreme Court functions as an independent branch of government. With nine justices on the court appointed for life, it acts as the final arbiter of the law through interpretation of the Constitution.
Owens said when members of Congress and the president attack the court, it undermines its independence and that it's dangerous for presidential candidates to promise to appoint certain types of judges.
"Judging is supremely different than regular politicking and I think when our politicians dumb it down to us vs. them dynamic, that does the court a disservice and frankly, it does the rule of law in this country a disservice," Owens said.
Many women struck by Kavanaugh's confirmation In the wake of the allegations against Kavanaugh, women across the country took to social media platforms, revisiting their own experiences with sexual harassment and assault, and using hashtags like #WhyIdidntreport to support Ford. Following Ford's allegations claiming the judge had sexually assaulted her when they were both in high school, two other women accused Kavanaugh of misconduct.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation interviewed nine people and found "no corroboration of the allegations" of sexual misconduct against him.
Jane Hayes of Oshkosh said she wished an investigation into Kavanaugh's past went further than it had and called his confirmation an "insult to women everywhere."
"An appointment to the Supreme Court is for life, and should be treated more seriously than this," Hayes said.
Schmidt said she felt Ford was treated unfairly in her testimony and her own personal experiences helped her empathize with her.
"Anybody that has been a victim of sexual assault at any point at their lives and I can tell you this from my personal experience as well, it never goes away. It's there with you forever," Schmidt said. "For her to be willing to come to Washington and speak in front of the Judiciary Committee, I thought she was very brave to do so and just thought she was very poorly received."
Many women also stood by Kavanaugh and worried about what the #MeToo climate could mean for their sons and husbands.
A letter in defense of Kavanaugh's character rejecting the allegations was signed by 65 women who knew him and sent to the Senate Judiciary Committee almost immediately after the first accusation came to light.
Janice Huguet of Green Bay said the debacle reminded her of Justice Clarence Thomas's confirmation who was accused of sexual harassment by Anita Hill in 1991.
"Disgraceful on many levels," Huguet said. "The Democrats had a mob mentality to persecute for political partisanship that any parent that has a son should be frightened of."
Cynthia Koffman of Eden, who supports Kavanaugh, noted that the justice has made hiring women on his staff a priority.
"I'm even happier that he is on the court especially since he is the first ever to have an all-female staff," Koffman said.
Where the Supreme Court stands today Alongside Kavanaugh and Thomas, members of the Supreme Court include Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Samuel Alito, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Neil Gorsuch. It has a 5–4 conservative majority.
This year, the court struck down the Trump administration's plan to ask a citizenship question in the 2020 census and ruled that partisan gerrymandering of congressional districts can't be limited by federal courts, both of which fell along ideological lines.
Owens said Roberts acts as the median justice in the current court, but as a 5–4 conservative court, he doesn't expect it to function very differently than it did with Kennedy. Kavanaugh has also been more moderate than expected in his first year on the court.
"He's joined with the liberals in some cases, he's joined with the conservatives in others, but he hasn't pushed doctrine far to the right or anything at this point," Owens said. "A lot of folks, they get on the court their first year, they're a little bit quieter."
The structure of the court has also been talked about on the 2020 campaign trail with some Democratic candidates saying they would be open to expanding the number of justices on the court or proposing term limits on judges.
Whether the future of the court will play a role for voters in 2020, Owens thinks the election will more likely act as a referendum on Trump's presidency than on the makeup of the court.
"I'd say it's probably not going to be the key factor but we'll see what happens," he said.

They, themself: Merriam-Webster adds nonbinary pronouns to dictionary. Also added: vacay, deep state

Resumen: The latest edition of the Merriam-Webster dictionary adds terms such as "they" and "themself" as singular pronouns.

Texto completo: The next time someone expresses a preference for a plural pronoun, the dictionary will be there to provide support.
As the notion of gender fluidity becomes more prevalent, nonbinary pronouns have emerged as an option for those who don’t want to be identified strictly as male or female.
The Merriam-Webster dictionary recognizes that usage by incorporating “they" and “themself" in references to “a single person whose gender identity is nonbinary. "
Those are among 533 new words and meanings in the dictionary’s latest update, released Tuesday, including terms such as “dad joke" and “vacay. "
Singer Sam Smith is among those who have said publicly they identify themselves as nonbinary and have opted for the pronouns “they" and “them. "
For those who may find that jarring, Merriam-Webster senior editor Emily Brewster pointed out the word “they’’ has been used commonly for centuries in the singular form as an indefinite pronoun. For example: “If someone doesn’t like it, they can leave. ’’
“In more recent years, we have this nonbinary ‘they,’ which is now appearing in carefully edited text," Brewster told USA TODAY. “It’s appearing in The New York Times. It is being chosen by people and mentioned in articles with some frequency. It’s simply not a usage that can be ignored anymore. "
Previous additions: Dictionary. com adds words: Smexy, womyn, yaldi and birb – but what do they mean?
Nonbinary terms make up a small portion of the interesting additions to the dictionary. The folks at Merriam-Webster highlighted entries in several other areas, including:
Sports and games
Pickleball: A newly popular court sport played with short-handled paddles and a perforated plastic ball.
Escape room: A game in which participants confined to a room or an enclosed setting are given a set amount of time to find a way to escape.
In April, the dictionary added the popular term “garbage time," referring to “the final moments or minutes of a game in which one side has an insurmountable lead. "
Pop culture
Stinger: A short scene that appears during or after the closing credits of a movie.
Coulrophobia: An abnormal fear of clowns.
Politics and law
Deep state: An alleged secret governmental network operating extra-legally.
Red flag law: A law that allows courts to prevent people who show signs of being a danger to themselves or others from having access to firearms.
Singer's words: Sam Smith says he is 'nonbinary, genderqueer,' describes 'war within'
Abbreviated terms such as “vacay" for vacation, “sesh" for session and “inspo" for inspiration also found their way into this latest edition of the M-W dictionary.
“We are always (striving) to reflect the established language," Brewster said. “There’s always been the criticism that we are too permissive, but it was scandalous in 1961 that we entered the word ‘finalize,’ and no one really blinks much of an eye at that anymore. "

Texto completo: From her cramped seat in the middle of the Piper Cherokee six-seater plane, Georgia River Network executive director Rena Sticker pointed out the blond peat in the Okefenokee's glistening water below, the charred tree trunks from an epic fire and the expanse of wilderness uncluttered by buildings, roads or electrical lines.
Just about two miles east of the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge, the plane flew over a seam of higher ground called Trail Ridge where Twin Pines Mineral LLC wants to mine for titanium and zircon. Georgia River Network isn't opposed to all mining, she said, but it is opposed to this mine.
"It's location, location, location," Stricker said ahead of a flight with volunteer pilot Allen Nodorft of Southwings to survey the mining site. "It is right next to the Okefenokee, and Trail Ridge is part of the Okefenokee."
Twin Pines applied for a permit with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to move forward with the mining. The public comment period for the permit was scheduled to end Thursday.
More study requested
The Okefenokee, with 630 square miles of unique habitat, it is the largest wildlife refuge east of the Mississippi. Stricker and many of the refuge's 600,000 annual visitors consider it a national treasure. One that is defined by its water.
"Digging a big mine on Trail Ridge, which holds water in the swamp, and digging that mine lower than the level of the swamp itself, will change the swamp hydrology such that the water from the swamp would go toward that big hole," she said. "When that happens, then you're lowering the water table."
The Georgia Conservancy voiced similar concerns in its comments filed with the corps Aug. 29.
"One-third of the mining site drains to streams that discharge to the Okefenokee, one of Georgia's most precious ecological sites and an internationally-recognized treasure. The Okefenokee's 438,000-acre biodiverse ecosystem is home to the headwaters of two notable rivers, the Suwannee and the St. Marys, and contains nearly 353,981 acres of federally-designated wilderness. Stephen C. Foster State Park, located within the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge, was recently designated a Gold-tier International Dark Sky Park," wrote Savannah-based Charles McMillan III, the conservancy's natural resource director. "Trail Ridge plays a significant role in the hydrogeology of this area of Georgia; this saturated, low sand ridge acts as a sill for the eastern side of the vast Okefenokee Swamp."
He also noted that the mining site drains to the blackwater St. Marys River, home to several endangered species.
Twin Pines hydrogeologist Robert Holt, owner of Holt Hydrogeology and a professor at the University of Mississippi, said at the
company's open house information session in St. George last month that the company has studied the hydrogeology of the area with 500 bore holes and 86 small diameter wells that monitor water levels. The data tells him the company can mine without harming the water flow in the Okefenokee.
Twin Pines plans to fill in the pit as it goes along, digging a trench that's 100 feet wide, 500 feet long and 20-50 feet deep and advancing about 100 feet per day. It'll move lawnmower-fashion across the 1,268-acre site.
"You're filling stuff back in; that allows the water levels behind it to recover," Holt said.
The mining won't connect the Okefenokee waters to those in the St. Marys River, he said, because the mining will maintain the natural divide that keeps the water on the west side of the ridge running toward the Okefenokee and that on the east side running east.
But the company's detailed hydrogeology data, including a three-dimensional computer model Holt is building, is not part of the permit application. Georgia River Network and the Georgia Conservancy, among other groups, are asking the corps for a more thorough analysis of the possible effects than is currently planned.
"(T)he application still lacks essential information from the applicant," McMillan wrote to conclude the conservancy's comment. "The Okefenokee Swamp is a unique ecosystem, and Trail Ridge is an integral element."
Separate from the corps' permit, Twin Pines is also applying for a water withdrawal permit from the Georgia Environmental Protection Division.
Company president Steve Ingle downplayed the amount of groundwater the company would need for what he calls a "dry mining" operation. But the application submitted July 24 requests 4.32 million gallons per day average use from the Floridan aquifer, a major source of drinking water from Florida to South Carolina. That's more than is currently pulled from all other users combined in Charlton County.
"Our springs are failing," said Jim Tatum, historian and board member for Our Sante Fe River, who accompanied Stricker on the aerial tour. "Our aquifer is dropping. We're headed the wrong way. We have to drop our water usage."
Previous proposal and current mines
This isn't the first Okefenokee mining controversy. The DuPont Co. proposed mining on Trail Ridge in the late 1990s but backed off the idea after government and public outcry against it.
"You can study this, you can write all the documents in the world," then Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt told the New York Times, "but they are not going to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that there will be no impact."
DuPont eventually abandoned plans to mine titanium and in 2003 the company donated all 16,000 acres to the Conservation Fund, which in 2005 transferred nearly 7,000 acres to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as an addition to Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge.
Dupont's efforts are still fresh in the minds of many Okefenokee advocates.
"I know 20 years ago the Fish & Wildlife Service said that the impacts could be deep and permanent and unrecoverable and I don't know why that would have changed now," Stricker said. "I don't think the technology is so different and I think that the threat is so big that there are just some places you don't need to mine. You can mine titanium elsewhere. This is our Okefenokee and it's so close."
From the air, Stricker pointed out another mine already operating in the area. It's Southern Ionics Mission South site.
"To me the biggest difference is they're not on Trail Ridge and they're 10 miles away from the swamp," Stricker said. "And they're not digging down below the water level of the Satilla River."
Another difference is that Southern Ionics avoided wetlands, impacting only 20 acres of wetlands out of 501 acres identified on its site. By contrast, Twin Pines is proposing to mine 522 acres of wetlands in this first phase of mining.
"Southern Ionics has done a really good job," Stricker said. "I'm not against mining; I'm just for protecting the Okefenokee."

Ocasio-Cortez backs Newman's newest bid

Texto completo: Freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the face of the leftward progressive push among Democrats in Congress, has endorsed Marie Newman's primary challenge to veteran Southwest Side and suburban Rep. Dan Lipinski.
"Marie Newman is a textbook example of one of the ways that we could be better as a party -- to come from a deep blue seat and to be championing all the issues we need to be championing," Ocasio-Cortez said in announcing the endorsement in The New York Times on Tuesday.
"The fact that a deep blue seat is advocating for many parts of the Republican agenda is extremely problematic. We're not talking about a swing state that is being forced to take tough votes," the New York Democrat said.
Newman ran against Lipinski in the March 2018 Democratic primary but lost by 2.2 percentage points, or 2,145 votes out of 95,205 votes cast. She announced her bid for a rematch against Lipinski, a social conservative who opposes abortion rights, on April 16. Lipinski has represented the 3rd Congressional District for eight terms.
The group promoting Ocasio-Cortez's endorsement, Justice Democrats, announced earlier this month that Newman had received the backing of Democratic presidential contender and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren.
Lipinski said Ocasio-Cortez's endorsement of Newman made it clear that his challenger was "an extreme candidate who is completely out of step with the voters" in the district.
"The Democratic Party - and our country -- cannot afford an obstructionist 'Tea Party of the Left' when we need to focus on winning this next election and passing policies that will truly help working families and all who are struggling in America today," Lipinski said.
Newman on Tuesday said she was "thrilled" by Ocasio-Cortez's support.
"Her unwavering dedication to fighting for social, climate and economic justice is a true inspiration," Newman said. "I look forward to working with congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez and other Progressive Caucus members in Congress to fight for policies that make life safer and more affordable for people in my district."
Alexandra Rojas, executive director of Justice Democrats, said Newman was the first member of the progressive group to receive the backing of Ocasio-Cortez.
"The momentum is growing in our movement to make the Democratic Party fight for solutions as big as the problems we face and create a party of voters, not corporate donors," Rojas said.
Rojas also cited the internal conflict within the Democratic Party and its Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee over its support of incumbents over primary challengers and problems it has created for candidates such as Newman in trying to recruit campaign staff.
Justice Democrats said Newman supports Medicare for All, the Green New Deal, and reproductive and immigrant rights. She was endorsed by Justice Democrats in her first run in 2018.
Founded by some of the former staff of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign, Justice Democrats recruited Ocasio-Cortez to run for Congress and endorsed new Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts in 2018. The four have collectively become known as "the squad."

Public divide still evident when it comes to Kavanaugh

Texto completo: Vicki Schmidt and Suzanne Lindberg remember the day Brett Kavanaugh became a Supreme Court Justice like it was yesterday.
But how the Wisconsin women remember the events leading to his confirmation a year ago are starkly different.
As President Donald Trump's nominee to replace retired Justice Anthony Kennedy, Kavanaugh's confirmation was cruising for a vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee only to be rocked by allegations of sexual assault made by psychology professor Christine Blasey Ford.
Outrage blew up across the political spectrum in the heightened climate of the #MeToo movement, protests flooded outside of the hearings and emotional testimonies were given by Ford followed by Kavanaugh, who forcefully denied any wrongdoing.
The events surrounding Kavanaugh's ascension to the Supreme Court manifested an already divided nation with protests lasting for weeks after the Senate narrowly voted 50–48 to confirm Kavanaugh, who was sworn in as the court's 114th Justice on Oct. 6, 2018.
Schmidt of Oshkosh remembers the time as a low point for women's credibility.
"I am still unhappy with the results and feel that Kavanaugh's confirmation only reinforced the idea that women are not to be believed," Schmidt said. "It really horrifies me to a certain degree that we would be willing to treat women like that who are coming forward with those kind of stories."
Lindberg of De Pere had a vastly different viewpoint, saying it was a political smear campaign against an innocent man.
"I have never witnessed such a totally corrupt group that would have no limits on the lack of morals and decency that I observed during the hearings," Lindberg said. "Watching the needless suffering of his family (is) forever cemented in my mind."
Earlier this week, the New York Times published new information about sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh reigniting the feud about him. Several 2020 Democratic presidential candidates have called for his impeachment from the Supreme Court. Trump and several prominent Republicans came to Kavanaugh's defense.
The newspaper later ran an update to the story saying the alleged victim in the story said she did not recall the events described and refused to be interviewed.
The Women's March plans to hold a protest against Kavanaugh on the one year anniversary of his confirmation.
In the aftermath of Kavanaugh's confirmation, studies show public opinion of the Supreme Court dropped. The Pew Research Center found partisan views of the court have reached its widest gap in more than two decades.
An unscientific survey by The Post-Crescent and USA TODAY NETWORK–Wisconsin asked people how they feel about Kavanaugh's confirmation process a year out. It generated more than 400 responses from across the country.
The survey showed an even split between those who support Kavanaugh and those who oppose him.
Yet a majority shared concerns about the Supreme Court becoming too politicized in a heightened climate of partisan politics.
"Kavanaugh may or may not vote the way I would like him to, but that is beside the point," said Steve Hermes of Kimberly. "His confirmation destroyed forever the integrity of the process and thus, the integrity of an unbiased, honorable Supreme Court."
Battle heightened worries about high court's independence Ed Skerke of Neenah said the hearings made him change his personal political views and he's lost faith in the Republican Party for sticking by Kavanaugh.
"I would consider myself an independent with conservative leaning up until the Kavanaugh hearing," Skerke said. "I was so disgusted by what I saw during the hearing. The Republican Party will have to work very hard to get my vote."
Roger Vander Logt of Manitowoc County said despite being a Democrat, he was offended by the way Kavanaugh and his family were treated in the midst of the allegations.
"I will never, ever support people that do that to another human being and his or her family," Vander Logt said. "I'll never vote for another Democrat ever."
Ryan Owens, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said putting the court on party lines threatens its legitimacy.
"These hyper-partisan confirmation battles we have these days certainly are not good for the court (and) for peoples' perceptions of the court," Owens said.
Unlike other political institutions, the Supreme Court functions as an independent branch of government. With nine justices on the court appointed for life, it acts as the final arbiter of the law through interpretation of the Constitution.
Owens said when members of Congress and the president attack the court, it undermines its independence and that it's dangerous for presidential candidates to promise to appoint certain types of judges.
"Judging is supremely different than regular politicking and I think when our politicians dumb it down to us vs. them dynamic, that does the court a disservice and frankly, it does the rule of law in this country a disservice," Owens said.
Many women struck by Kavanaugh's confirmation In the wake of the allegations against Kavanaugh, women across the country took to social media platforms, revisiting their own experiences with sexual harassment and assault, and using hashtags like #WhyIdidntreport to support Ford. Following Ford's allegations claiming the judge had sexually assaulted her when they were both in high school, two other women accused Kavanaugh of misconduct.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation interviewed nine people and found "no corroboration of the allegations" of sexual misconduct against him.
Jane Hayes of Oshkosh said she wished an investigation into Kavanaugh's past went further than it had and called his confirmation an "insult to women everywhere."
"An appointment to the Supreme Court is for life, and should be treated more seriously than this," Hayes said.
Schmidt said she felt Ford was treated unfairly in her testimony and her own personal experiences helped her empathize with her.
"Anybody that has been a victim of sexual assault at any point at their lives and I can tell you this from my personal experience as well, it never goes away. It's there with you forever," Schmidt said. "For her to be willing to come to Washington and speak in front of the Judiciary Committee, I thought she was very brave to do so and just thought she was very poorly received."
Many women also stood by Kavanaugh and worried about what the #MeToo climate could mean for their sons and husbands.
A letter in defense of Kavanaugh's character rejecting the allegations was signed by 65 women who knew him and sent to the Senate Judiciary Committee almost immediately after the first accusation came to light.
Janice Huguet of Green Bay said the debacle reminded her of Justice Clarence Thomas's confirmation who was accused of sexual harassment by Anita Hill in 1991.
"Disgraceful on many levels," Huguet said. "The Democrats had a mob mentality to persecute for political partisanship that any parent that has a son should be frightened of."
Cynthia Koffman of Eden, who supports Kavanaugh, noted that the justice has made hiring women on his staff a priority.
"I'm even happier that he is on the court especially since he is the first ever to have an all-female staff," Koffman said.
Where the Supreme Court stands today Alongside Kavanaugh and Thomas, members of the Supreme Court include Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Samuel Alito, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Neil Gorsuch. It has a 5–4 conservative majority.
This year, the court struck down the Trump administration's plan to ask a citizenship question in the 2020 census and ruled that partisan gerrymandering of congressional districts can't be limited by federal courts, both of which fell along ideological lines.
Owens said Roberts acts as the median justice in the current court, but as a 5–4 conservative court, he doesn't expect it to function very differently than it did with Kennedy. Kavanaugh has also been more moderate than expected in his first year on the court.
"He's joined with the liberals in some cases, he's joined with the conservatives in others, but he hasn't pushed doctrine far to the right or anything at this point," Owens said. "A lot of folks, they get on the court their first year, they're a little bit quieter."
The structure of the court has also been talked about on the 2020 campaign trail with some Democratic candidates saying they would be open to expanding the number of justices on the court or proposing term limits on judges.
Whether the future of the court will play a role for voters in 2020, Owens thinks the election will more likely act as a referendum on Trump's presidency than on the makeup of the court.
"I'd say it's probably not going to be the key factor but we'll see what happens," he said.

Texto completo: They knew.
In his most recent letter about the unfolding scandal over MIT's relationship­ with Jeffrey Epstein, university president Rafael Reif said officials had “limited facts" about the late financier's crimes when the institution­ began accepting gifts from him in 2012.
But really, how could MIT not have known the following?
■ That Epstein in a controversial deal with Florida prosecutors pled guilty in 2008 to two charges of soliciting a prostitute, including one involving a minor.
■ That by the time Epstein was released from prison in 2009, after serving 13 months, more than a dozen civil lawsuits had been filed by women who alleged they were molested by him when they were underage. Some victims were as young as 14.
■ That Epstein had to register in New York in 2011as the highest-level sex offender.
All of this information was readily available — from the pages of the Palm Beach Post to The New York Times. You don't need a degree from MIT to figure out how bad Epstein was. You could have just Googled him.
Of course, they knew.
No matter how Reif wants to spin it today, university officials knew that it would be a PR nightmare if word ever­ got out that Epstein was a regular donor to the MIT Media Lab. That was clear from a bombshell report in The New Yorker that exposed the secrecy and how former Media Lab director Joi Ito worked to keep Epstein's money hidden by marking donations anonymous.
The Globe's Deirdre Fernandes later reported that Ito had hardly acted alone; top Massachusetts Institute of Technology officials worked closely with Ito to ensure ­Epstein's gifts didn't draw attention.
Ito began courting the multimillionaire in 2013, raising about $525,000 via Epstein's foundations and perhaps millions more by using his connections.
Ito resigned on Sept. 7.
Epstein also donated money to MIT professor Seth Lloyd in 2012, and Reif signed the thank-you letter.
They knew, but still didn't care.
“You don't have to think hard about whether you want any connection to Jeffrey Epstein," said Wendy Murphy, an attorney who teaches sexual violence law at New England Law Boston and is a former sex crimes and child abuse prosecutor. “What kind of child prostitution is OK with MIT's list of values?"
In his letter last week, Reif wrote that senior members of his team were aware of Epstein's gifts starting in 2013 and raised concerns.
“They knew in general terms about Epstein's history — that he had been convicted and had served a sentence and that Joi believed that he had stopped his criminal behavior," Reif wrote. “They accepted Joi's assessment of the situation. Of course, they did not know what we all know about Epstein now."
Here's the thing about people convicted of sex crimes: They have to register as sex offenders because there's a high risk they will re-offend.
Reif went on to reveal that Epstein gifts were discussed “at at least one of MIT's regular senior team meetings, and I was present."
So why didn't he say something, do something, then?
The truth is what we know about Epstein today is what we knew about him in 2008 and 2009. We knew the FBI and others investigated him for sex trafficking of minors and that he was able to negotiate a sweetheart deal on lesser charges.
“There is nothing new now. It's all the same allegations, everything," said Florida attorney Spencer Kuvin, who represented three of Epstein's victims, including a 14-year-old who was ordered to strip naked and perform a sex act.
What is different is the same allegations are taking on new meaning in the post-me-too era. In 2018, some victims began to come forward to tell their stories to Miami Herald reporter Julie K. Brown, who spent a year re-examining Epstein's case. A federal judge ruled in February that Epstein's original agreement with prosecutors violated the Crime Victims' Right Act by not informing his victims about the deal ahead of time. Authorities began to once again interview potential Epstein victims from the 2000s.
In July, the US attorney in New York charged Epstein with sex trafficking of minors. At his court hearing, one of Epstein's lawyers called the new allegations “ancient stuff" and a “redo" by the government.
The 66-year-old Epstein was being held in a federal facility in Manhattan when he was found dead in August. His death has been ruled a suicide by hanging.
“I am aware that we could and should have asked more questions about Jeffrey Epstein and about his interactions with Joi," Reif wrote. “We did not see through the limited facts we had, and we did not take time to understand the gravity of Epstein's offenses or the harm to his young victims. I take responsibility for those errors."
MIT has hired the law firm Goodwin Procter to investigate the university's ties to Epstein. Last week's letter was Reif's fourth to the campus in less than a month. Reif in his first letter offered “a profound and humble apology" to Epstein's victims. He committed to raising an amount equal to the funds MIT had received from Epstein, money that would be donated to a charity that will benefit his victims or other victims of sexual abuse.
It will now be up to the school's board to determine whether saying sorry is enough. Ultimately, how Reif handles the Epstein donations and its fallout reflects how the university values women.
At any organization, the culture is set from the top. The infection that started in the Media Lab has now spread to another lab after visiting MIT computer scientist Richard Stallman asserted in an e-mail to colleagues last week that one of Epstein's underage victims had presented herself as “entirely willing" to have sex.
Stallman resigned on Monday.
Who should be next?

Texto completo: The James Beard Foundation is shaking up its restaurant award regions, carving the country into new territories to better reflect shifts in population and dining.
The changes, which the national culinary organization planned to announce on Tuesday, reflect growth in the number of restaurants outside traditional food powerhouses like New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco that meet the foundation's standards, said Mitchell Davis, its chief strategy officer.
The group will now give out awards in 12 regions instead of 10, allowing it to add 40 new restaurants, bars and chefs to a lengthy list of semifinalists that has already topped 400. A committee of 20 food writers, editors and producers is charged with sifting through thousands of recommendations from regional judges, industry professionals and the public to create the semifinal list.
"It's more reactive to the reality of what the country is right now," Mr. Davis said. "At one time in America, there weren't 40 restaurants you wanted to shine the light on."
California, Texas and New York will be separated from nearby states and become stand-alone regions. The idea, Mr. Davis said, is to treat those states as culturally distinct districts. The move also improves the odds for restaurants and chefs in states that have been overshadowed, he said.
New York City, which has been its own region since the awards began in 1991, will become part of the New York State region. Previously, all parts of the state outside the city were in the Northeast region, which included the six New England states.
Mr. Davis said the changes were prompted by data that show new competition and better restaurants in some metropolitan centers, most notably in Texas. That state had been part of the Southwest region, which included Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico, Utah and Oklahoma.
"Austin gets to fight with Dallas, which couldn't be more different than Houston, and all of that makes a dynamic, meaningful region," he said.
Although the foundation's inner workings don't mean much to people who take notice only in May, when the winners are announced, the restaurant industry follows the nominations with all the passion of members in a fantasy-football league.
The organization is bracing for complaints from chefs who think their states, too, should be stand-alone regions. It has already heard rumblings from the Great Lakes region, which takes in a huge swath: Illinois, Michigan, Ohio and Indiana.
"Some places in that category might feel overshadowed by Chicago, but if we make Illinois its own region, then it's just Chicago competing against Chicago," Mr. Davis said. "A collection of great restaurants can't be the reason to create a region. There has to be some meaningful competition."
In other changes, some states in the former West and Northwest regions will be combined into a new Northwest and Pacific region made up of Alaska, Washington, Oregon and Hawaii. The remaining states from the former Northwest region -- Idaho, Montana and Wyoming -- will join Colorado and Utah in the new Mountain region.
The Southwest region will now include Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada and Oklahoma. (Nevada had been in the West region.)
The changes are driven in part by hard numbers, but also by a desire to create a certain cultural cohesiveness, which Mr. Davis said is harder to measure. "We are not Italy and we are not China, which are filled with distinct culinary styles and regions," Mr. Davis said.
Last year, the foundation made a seismic shift by creating a new set of criteria for judges, asking them to consider a restaurant's values -- whether it promoted diversity, sustainability, equality, respect and transparency.
The result, in May, was a list of nominees and winners that looked radically different. A record number of women chefs were honored, and for the first time, barbecue restaurants, noodle shops and fancier restaurants with a global outlook were contenders in what had been largely a sea of expensive Eurocentric restaurants.
And in a nod to the #MeToo movement, some notable chefs and restaurants were left off the list in 2018, including the Hearth & Hound, a new Los Angeles restaurant from the chef April Bloomfield and her partner, Ken Friedman. A New York Times report in 2017 cited several women who said Mr. Friedman had sexually harassed them and allowed such harassment to flourish at the partners' Spotted Pig restaurant in New York. The Hearth & Hound has since closed.
The foundation is doing more fact-checking when it receives reports about the behavior of chefs at restaurants under consideration, said Bill Addison, the Los Angeles Times restaurant critic, who heads the foundation's restaurant-and-chef subcommittee. Similarly, judges who supply names to the panel will continue to be encouraged to follow the 2018 guidelines, he said.
"We hope that the judges consider restaurants they put forth holistically, and that includes more than just the food and atmosphere," Mr. Addison said.
The foundation may adjust the list of regions in the coming years, he added. "This process is an evolution. If it needs correction, then we'll make corrections."

Cheap flights can be found, but examine the fine print

Texto completo: Turbulence in the budget airline industry continues to be expected. But for savvy leisure travelers looking for international flights, there are more ups than downs right now.
First, the downs. Norwegian Air threw a wrench into cheap trans-Atlantic flight options this summer by announcing the cancellation of six routes between Ireland and North America. The decision, effective Sunday, was blamed on the worldwide grounding of the Boeing 737 Max after two deadly crashes involving the aircraft. According to a news release, 18 of the discount carrier's fleet were affected, making the Ireland routes "no longer commercially viable."
Earlier this year another budget airline, WOW Air, went bankrupt. (An American company, USAerospace Associates, recently purchased its assets and will attempt to relaunch the airline, initially as a freight-only carrier.)
And yet, "it's the golden age of cheap flights," said Scott Keyes, who by his estimation has visited 48 countries. He co-founded Scott's Cheap Flights, a travel site that alerts members when deals pop up.
"We regularly find $300 round-trip flights to Europe, which did not exist five years ago," Keyes, 32, said.
The Barcelona-based carrier Level, for instance, recently showed flight deals on its website from Newark, New Jersey, to Paris on select dates in October for $149 one way. Round-trip from Boston to Barcelona featured a promotional price of $350. The 2-year-old, low-cost brand is owned by International Airlines Group and flights are mostly operated by Iberia.
More major airlines are getting in on the act. Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) recently introduced SAS Go fares for travel to Europe. In August, the company ran a sale on round-trip routes from several cities in the United States to Copenhagen, Helsinki, Oslo and Stockholm for under $400. A recent search showed a low-price calendar with dates listing flights in November from Newark to Oslo for $340 round trip, a meal included.
Depending on the airline, return flights are sometimes pricier, an extra $30 or more. Ancillary fees are where it can really add up on no-frills carriers.
Concerning luggage, read the fine print on weight restrictions and maximum dimensions. One personal item and a carry-on bag might be included in the price, but in some cases can't weigh more than 8 kilograms (about 17½ pounds). With economy fares, a checked bag can cost upward of $40 to $60 and double that if you pay at the airport.
Also expect charges for seat selection, headsets, pillows, food and water. Print out your boarding passes since there can be a charge for that, too. And don't expect a refund if you have to cancel your flight.
Eurowings, a subsidiary of Lufthansa, is headquartered in Cologne, Germany, and currently flies from Germany to airports in Newark, New York City, Miami, Fort Myers, Florida, and Las Vegas. A recent search on its website turned up a oneway basic fare in November from Newark to Diisseldorf, Germany, for $229.99. In December, Miami to Dresden, Germany, is advertised for $267.55 one way. Next summer, the Lufthansa Group is expanding its long-haul routes. Phoenix and Anchorage will connect with Frankfurt, Germany's largest hub. Seattle, Detroit and Orlando, Florida, will have bargain flights to Munich.
Another budget-conscious airline greasing the wheels on the runways for overseas flights is JetBlue, which plans in 2021 to usher in multiple daily connections between New York City, Boston and London. More European destinations are likely. A news release in June announced that the company had purchased 13 fuel-efficient Airbus A321XLR aircraft to expand trans-Atlantic options.
And while Norwegian Air is retreating on its routes across the Atlantic, the company recently filed a request to operate flights between the United States and Argentina.
Low-cost trans-Pacific travel via AirAsia X is expanding as well. "A bit of a beachhead is forming in Hawaii, and we've seen flights from Honolulu to Osaka for $199 round-trip," said Keyes of Scott's Cheap Flights. Jetstar, a subsidiary of Qantas, is flying between Honolulu and Sydney for as low as $286 round-trip, he said.
Interested in heading to Latin America? Sample fares on Interjet, a Mexican airline, recently included New York City to Mexico City from $129 one way, and Dallas to Lima from $177 one way.
To compete with budget carriers, Delta, American and United have their own stripped-down fares. American Airlines recently offered an economy fare from John F. Kennedy International Airport to Barcelona for $307 round-trip in October. It had a long layover in Helsinki on the return flight, but frugal travelers might be willing to make sacrifices for a price like that.
When booking your flight
* The main money hack is to book as far ahead as possible.
* Comparison shopping on Kayak, Google Flights, Expedia and other sites tend to yield similar results since they pull from the same data sources.
* Besides Scott's Cheap Flights, Gary Leff's travel blog, View From the Wing, is another valuable resource for deals and news.
* Budget airlines don't always fly to certain destinations daily, so if you miss your flight, or if it's canceled, it can be a disaster. Stranded passengers may not be accommodated on allied airlines as they would be on legacy carriers.

Texto completo: Noises are more likely to damage your hearing if they are 85 decibels and last a few hours, or 100 decibels and last at least 14 minutes. A motorcycle engine running is about 95 decibels; a very loud radio and loud entertainment venues, like concerts, are about 105-110 decibels, says the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Steve Terrell, in his Roundhouse Roundup ("Hey Taos, we need more music, not less," Sept. 8), criticized the Friends of Kit Carson Park in Taos who protested the loudness of the three-day Meow Wolf Taos Vortex festival. Decibel levels for the Taos Vortex concert were not to exceed 100 at their peak, according to the Taos News ("Town proposes changes for Kit Carson concerts," Sept. 2). That means it is likely, if the decibel level was 100 or more, that everyone inside the park suffered some sort of hearing loss if they were there for more than 14 minutes.
This issue has nothing to do with a particular style of music nor is it of no concern to young folks. This is a public health issue. I hope the city invests in cases of free earplugs for the attendees in 2020. As for Terrell's "Hey Taos, we need more music, not less," I can only say that I hope he does not lose his hearing in happy, oblivious attendance at such events.

Cheating is wrong
The Santa Fe New Mexican published the New York Times article ("Essays for hire," Sept. 9). Cheating to get into college -- and while in college -- is not only unethical and illegal, it is a practice that carries over into corporate and political life at every turn in the road.
Examples abound in daily news reports of the latest scandals and corrupt practices, whether it's Purdue Pharma with opioids, Jeffrey Epstein and friends trafficking sex, or political officials using their offices for personal and financial gain.
Our kids are getting the message that cheating is OK and that the mistake is getting caught. Work that is presented as one's own and is really counterfeit is the same as phony $50 bills. Colleges are stepping up ways to combat this kind of subterfuge, and we should be doing the same in other arenas at the local, state and national levels.

Giving thanks
I am writing this letter to show my gratitude to the Santa Fe Police Department for responding to a recent death in the family. Officers were professional and compassionate in this tragic situation. During these days when police officers are often being criticized, I give them two thumbs up for their service and dedication.

Keep Santa Fe beautiful
Being born and raised in New Mexico, I have experienced the fiestas of our surrounding communities. Over time, they have evolved into what they are today. We celebrate our culture with pride. One thing that was most noticeable before and after the Historical/Hysterical parade of Fiesta de Santa Fe was the trash left behind on the side of the roads from the observers. The route has been the same for years. How about the city of Santa Fe supply trash receptacles along the route? Or better yet, we can pick up after ourselves. It's not the city's entire responsibility to pick up after us. Keep Santa Fe beautiful!

Pure and simple
Donald Trump preaches hate and division. He is a pathological liar. He turns away refugees and hurricane survivors at our borders. Jesus Christ taught us to love our neighbors; to help those in need and provide refuge to those who are in need of it. Therefore, if you are a Trump supporter, please do not call yourself a Christian. Conversely, if you are a Christian, how can you be a Trump supporter?

Leland Keyser's denial is even more damning than you think

Texto completo: The most important witness to Christine Blasey Ford's assault allegation against Justice Brett Kavanaugh has always been her childhood friend, Leland Keyser. The only other girl at the 1982 (or thereabouts) party, Keyser previously maintained what every other supposed attendee named by Ford had said — she had no recollection of such a party ever happening.
But the new book, The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation, doesn't just undermine the credibility of Ford's allegation by quoting Keyser outright denying the plausibility of such an assault happening. It undermines Ford because the details revealed about the night of the party by Ford herself do not add up.
One of the questionable, but not disqualifying, aspects of Ford's allegation was that the house party at the center of her story was some miles away from her family home. In an era without Lyft or Uber, and in a residential area likely without taxi cabs, a persistent question has been how Ford got to and from the party. Today, Ford thinks that Keyser drove her both ways.
“[Christine] suspects she ended up there because Ingham (Keyser) was in contact with [Mark] Judge, and that Ingham probably drove her there, since she already had her license and often gave Christine a ride," New York Times reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly write in the book. "The house was located somewhere between the Columbia club and the Blasey home, in Potomac; Christine cannot remember a more specific location."
After the alleged assault, during which she says Kavanaugh seized and mounted her on a bed while friend Mark Judge watched, Ford says she hid in the bathroom after escaping the locked bedroom. Then, Pogrebin and Kelly say that Ford "suspects that she grabbed Ingham, who probably drove her home. The details of that hasty departure are no longer clear.”
It's theoretically possible that some 30 years later, you wouldn't remember driving your friend home from a random high school party. But there are two confounding factors.
First, Keyser, who has always maintained having no recollection of a party with the named people or place, was dating Judge that summer. It seems highly unlikely that you couldn't at least confirm that you attended a party with your good friend and boyfriend, especially seeing as how the house very likely belonged to Judge's family. Second, if so many pivotal logistics of that night hinge on Keyser, then her assertion that she doesn't have "any confidence in the story" is all the more damning.
The denials of the other boys at the party were never strongly exculpatory for Kavanaugh. For friends to protect one of their own in cases of assault would not be uncommon, and seeing as all the other named attendees of the party attended Georgetown Prep with Kavanaugh, one might expect that that they'd lie or willfully forget on his behalf.
But Keyser is Ford's close personal friend, a Democratic partisan, and the person most likely to remember the sheer existence of such a party. That she outright denies it and doubts such a thing could even have happened creates a gaping inconsistency in Ford's story.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – One of Sen. Susan Collins' prominent challengers is slamming the Maine Republican for her vote in 2018 to confirm Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh following a new sexual misconduct allegation against him that surfaced over the weekend.
And in a statement provided to USA TODAY Monday evening, a spokesperson for Collins hit back against the recent reporting by the New York Times that has led to the blowback against Collins, saying "The news stories today are not adding anything to what has already been reported" and adding that "The only new part of the story was an alleged incident . . . but this is an accusation that lacks an accuser. "
Sara Gideon, speaker of the Maine House of Representatives, took to Twitter Sunday to criticize Collins' decision last year and to fundraise following the new revelation. Collins, a Republican, is up for re-election in 2020.
"I’m tired of hoping that Susan Collins does the right thing when she has shown time and time again that she puts Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell ahead of Mainers," Gideon wrote in a tweet.
The New York Times published an essay Saturday evening with new information about a prior claim of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh that also included evidence supporting a previously unreported claim.
Kavanaugh has repeatedly denied sexual misconduct and sexual assault allegations against him. President Donald Trump and a number of Republicans have come to Kavanaugh's defense since the recent publication of the essay by the Times.
The essay is an adaptation from a forthcoming book about Kavanaugh written by two Times reporters. Collins spokesperson Annie Clark raised doubts about the book in a statement provided to USA TODAY Monday.
"The news stories today are not adding anything to what has already been reported. In fact, the NYT's own review of the book says that, 'In the end they [the authors] turn up no smoking gun, no secret confession, no friend who comes forth to say Kavanaugh was lying all this time,'" Clark said.
Clark continued: "The only new part of the story was an alleged incident reported by former Clinton aide Max Stier -- but this is an accusation that lacks an accuser. In fact, the New York Times corrected its own story to note that not only did the student in question not recall any such incident, she also declined to be interviewed for the book. "
And the president has aggressively come to Kavanaugh's defense, also suggesting doubts about the Times' reporting. "Brett Kavanaugh should start suing people for libel, or the Justice Department should come to his rescue," Trump wrote in a tweet Sunday. "The lies being told about him are unbelievable. "
And Trump tweeted again Monday. "The one who is actually being assaulted is Justice Kavanaugh," Trump posted. "Assaulted by lies and Fake News! This is all about the LameStream Media working with their partner, the Dems. "

Since the essay's publication, some Democrats have called for Kavanaugh to be impeached.
More: Democrats are calling for Brett Kavanaugh to be impeached. How would that work?
Gideon, a Democrat, has repeatedly criticized Collins for voting to confirm Kavanaugh. Gideon is a part of a handful of challengers who announced they were going to run against Collins due to her decision to vote for Kavanaugh.
Ahead of Kavanaugh's confirmation vote last year, Collins gave a nearly 45-minute speech on the Senate floor detailing why she decided to support his nomination to the Supreme Court. Prior to that, it was unclear whether Collins would support Kavanaugh's confirmation.
More: Democratic presidential candidates want Kavanaugh impeached after newly surfaced sexual misconduct accusation
Several weeks ago, Collins said that she was that 'sad' that her vote for Kavanaugh may have cost her voters in next year's election.
“Have I lost some votes because of my decision to support Justice Kavanaugh? Yes, I have,” she said in an interview with Politico. “And I’m sad about that because I explained in great depth my decision-making. ”

Texto completo: Sen. Bernie Sanders says he supports "any appropriate constitutional mechanism" to hold Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh "accountable."
Sanders stopped short of using the term "impeachment" in his post on Twitter, which followed the publication of a story about Kavanaugh's Yale University days in The New York Times on Saturday.
The New York Times article, adapted from a new book about Kavanaugh by Times reporters, says the reporters were able to corroborate claims that Kavanaugh pulled down his pants at a Yale party and "thrust his penis" at a female classmate, Deborah Ramirez. Kavanaugh has denied Ramirez's claims, and the allegation was brushed aside by some Democrats during Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings because it had not been investigated.
The article also raises a new, separate allegation about Kavanaugh with his pants down at a different party, where "his friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student." The female student declined to be interviewed, the Times wrote in an addendum to the article, and her friends say she does not recall the incident.
As he prepared for a break from campaigning, Sanders wrote on Twitter that Kavanaugh "likely lied to Congress" and should be held "accountable." Sanders canceled campaign events in South Carolina early this week to rest his hoarse voice, according to the Associated Press.

Democrats and China; The tariffs may be here for a while.

Texto completo: A new Morning Consult poll conducted after last Thursday's Democratic presidential debate finds that former Vice President Joe Biden remains the favorite. Among Democratic primary voters nationwide, 32% support Mr. Biden, while 20% back Sen. Bernie Sanders and 18% favor Sen. Elizabeth Warren. What should concern the Chinese dictatorship is that while they all criticize the manner in which Donald Trump is confronting Beijing, they are all endorsing a hard line on China trade.
This isn't the only reason Chinese dictator Xi Jinping might want to make economic peace with the U.S. now. Worldwide, the Chinese currency isn't winning many new fans. And the news at home isn't so hot either, notes the Journal:
Economic activity in China cooled further in August, testing Beijing's tolerance for slower growth as it seeks to ease trade tensions with the U.S.
Softness was visible last month in nearly every aspect of the Chinese economy, with industrial output and retail sales data pointing to sluggish demand and low confidence among businesses and consumers. Economists had been expecting economic activity to have recovered a little from July, when it fell to its lowest level in more than a decade.
At last week's debate, ABC's George Stephanopoulos couldn't find anyone willing to say they would remove the Trump China tariffs upon taking office in 2021. And some candidates suggested they'd go beyond tariffs and block access to U.S. consumers if certain demands are not met. Said Sen. Warren:
Everybody wants access to the American market. That means that we have the capacity to say right here in America, you want to come sell goods to American consumers? Then you got to raise your standards. You've got to raise your labor standards. You've got to raise your environmental standards, so our companies can compete on a level playing field. We can use trade not to undermine American workers and not to undermine American farms and not to undermine small businesses in this country. We can use trade to help build a stronger economy.
Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders made similar remarks, and other candidates talked about using the Trump tariffs as leverage to seek concessions.
Mr. Xi has a strong incentive to cut a deal, and so does Mr. Trump. The latest RealClearPolitics average of polls shows that Mr. Trump's approval rating on the economy is now below 50%.

The 'Benevolent Dictator' Who Created a Unique Sound
"Ric Ocasek, the idiosyncratic singer and guitarist for the Cars and hitmaking album producer, died on Sunday in his New York City apartment. He was 75," writes Kory Grow in Rolling Stone. "Ocasek established himself as a stoic frontman with a sense of humor and melodrama on songs like ' My Best Friend's Girl ,' 'You're All I've Got Tonight,' and 'Good Times Roll'," says Mr. Grow, adding: "Ocasek wrote all the songs and acted as a benevolent dictator."
Jon Pareles writes in the New York Times that Mr. Ocasek and the Cars "merged a vision of romance, danger and nocturnal intrigue."
Chris Warner, a proud Massachusetts native, reports that Bostonians will always claim Mr. Ocasek as their own even though he grew up in Baltimore. The Cars came together in Boston and released their debut album in 1978, which Mr. Warner pegs as the musical start of the 1980s. He appreciates Mr. Ocasek's gift for understatement: "If you read a song title like 'Good Times Roll,' you'd expect a bouncy pop tune with an excited lead vocal. But here, instead of a 'let's party!' vibe, it's more low-key. Let it happen. Go with it."
Last year Marc Myers of the Journal interviewed members of the band about its beginnings:
David Robinson: We came up with lists of names. On my list was "The Cars." It was easy to remember and it wasn't pegged to a specific decade or sound. The name was meaningless and conjured up nothing, which was perfect.
Ric liked the name. The Cars was at the beginning of the alphabet, which was great in record stores. It also was easy to spell and impossible to forget. Funny thing is I didn't even own a car at the time...
The band leader explained the creation of an early hit:
Ric Ocasek: Shortly after David joined us, I was down in my basement writing songs. One of them was "My Best Friend's Girl."
Nothing in that song happened to me personally. I just figured having a girlfriend stolen was probably something that happened to a lot of people.
I wrote the words and music at the same time: "You're always dancing down the street / with your suede blue eyes / And every new boy that you meet / he doesn't know the real surprise."
The "suede blue eyes" line was a play on Carl Perkins's "Blue Suede Shoes."
... As for the last lines—"And when you bite your lip / it's some reaction to love"—they were an emotional gesture. I was reading a lot of poets then.
At some point, I realized my lyrics didn't include the words "My Best Friend's Girl." So I pulled out the lyrics someone had typed up and added a chorus in the margin in pen: "She's my best friend's girl / she's my best friend's girl / but she used to be mine."
...If my best friend had stolen my girl, I might have been hurt but I wouldn't have been out for revenge. It's not me. That's why the lyrics are observational and not bitter.
Among people who grew up listening to the Cars, Ocasek inspires no bitterness, only gratitude.

True-Life 'Hustlers' Who Stripped Wallets Bare

Texto completo: New Yorkers love a scandal.
And in 2014, a cause célèbre about a criminal ring of women who drugged men and stole their money dominated tabloid headlines for months.
"Hustlers," a movie about that scandal starring Jennifer Lopez and Cardi B, will hit theaters on Friday. It is based on a 2015 New York magazine story about the women and their exploits. But long before that, the case was a subject of fascination among New York's news media, largely because it seemed so improbable.
[Read The New York Times review of "Hustlers."]
It started when a strip club sued a cardiologist.
"'I was drugged': Doctor refuses to pay $ 135K strip club bill," blared a headline in The New York Post on April 22, 2014. That doctor, Zyad Younan, a cardiologist who lived in New Jersey, was sued by Scores, a strip club in Chelsea, which accused him of not paying $ 135,000 charged to his American Express card. The lawsuit said that the doctor spent tens of thousands of dollars in late 2013 on tips for dancers and room rentals during several visits to the club.
Dr. Younan claimed that he was either drugged or not there. Scores said it had videotape of him with several women. "This happens every once in awhile," a representative for Scores told The Post. "People get out of control with their credit cards."
Even by tabloid standards, the story seemed fantastical. The next day, The New York Daily News followed, with more salacious details from more unnamed sources.
But the tabloids were onto something. Two months later, The New York Times reported about an indictment unsealed in State Supreme Court in Manhattan detailing the episode and more. It recounted accusations of a criminal ring of women who, according to the indictment, drugged men, brought them to strip clubs and racked up bills on their credit cards.
Investigators from the Drug Enforcement Administration and the New York Police Department arrested four women -- Samantha Barbash, Roselyn Keo, Karina Pascucci and Marsi Rosen -- in the scheme. The women were accused of taking $ 200,000 from the men, which included Dr. Younan, as well as a banker, a hedge fund executive and a real estate lawyer.
According to the indictment, the women would flirt with men in upscale bars, exchange telephone numbers and arrange to meet a few days later at a restaurant or bar, where they would slip tranquilizers and narcotics into the men's drinks. Once the men were woozy, the women would bring them to Scores or Roadhouse Gentlemen's Club in Queens, and rack up tens of thousands of dollars in tips and dance money, it said.
Prosecutors said the women also received cash from the clubs to bring the men in. But the men could not recall having been there. In October 2014, The Daily News reported that two of the women had been offered plea deals.
Nothing was decided then, though. Instead, it would take more than a year, or longer in some cases, for the women to reach agreements with prosecutors. In October 2015, Ms. Rosen and Ms. Pascucci, who helped bring men to Scores, pleaded guilty to grand larceny and conspiracy. The syndicated show "Crime Watch Daily" aired an interview with Ms. Pascucci, who said she was given five years' probation and 16 weekends in Rikers Island.
In December 2015, all four women were interviewed by Jessica Pressler for New York magazine in what most consider the definitive account of the crimes.
"Here's a modern Robin Hood story for you," read the story's headline. "A few strippers who stole from the (mostly) rich, (usually) disgusting, (in their minds) pathetic men and gave to, well, themselves." In the story, Ms. Pressler explored the ambition and hardscrabble lives of the four women.
She explained, too, how they got caught.
One man taped a conversation with one of the women, who confessed to drugging him. The man gave the tape to the New York City police. Ms. Pressler described, too, the impact of the scheme on the victims. One of them, Fred, was fired from his job because the women charged his corporate credit card. He got a new job but was fired again, she wrote, after his name was reported to an agency that tracked white-collar crime.
Ms. Rosen and Ms. Pascucci were sentenced in 2016. (Ms. Rosen was given the same sentence as Ms. Pascucci.) Ms. Barbash would later be given five years' probation, according to news reports.
Ms. Keo was given no jail time and is touting a memoir, "The Sophisticated Hustler," on her website. Ms. Barbash is writing one, too, according to her Instagram account. An excerpt was recently published in The New York Post.

Texto completo: These 18 years - long and unbelievable - have blunted memories and raised a host of children who never knew Sept. 11, 2001. That's how time works, of course, but changed worlds have pivot points that bear witnessing.
Two new books have won praise as histories to teach us, and to remind us, of that day's crystalline beauty - and horror.
"The Only Plane in the Sky" by Garrett M. Graff (Avid Reader, 483 pp.). From interviews he and other journalists and historians conducted, Graff offers what reviewer Tunku Varadarajan calls "a priceless civic gift": the stories of people who experienced and survived 9/11. "The book is refreshingly free from editorializing, ideology and ululation. It gives us instead poignant, often distressing, vignettes and impressions of the day and its aftermath," he writes. "On page after page, a reader will encounter words that startle, or make him angry, or heartbroken, or queasy." Varadarajan calls this volume "remarkable" and "spare."
"Fall and Rise: The Story of 9/11" by Mitchell Zuckoff, a former reporter with The Boston Globe (Harper, 589 pp.). "A monumental complement" to Graff's book. Zuckoff's "descriptions of the hijacks - the turmoil on board the planes, the crashing of the aircraft, the destruction of the towers, the rescues, the death, the subsequent anguish - are superb in their tautness and tension," with extraordinary accounts of some who survived, and others who did not. (Wall Street Journal)
Events: Beth Macy will be in Norfolk for this year's Catherine Brinkley Memorial Lecture series at the Slover Library; its theme this season is resilience. On Thursday she'll discuss "Dopesick: Dealers, Doctors and the Drug Company that Addicted America." Macy, a former Roanoke Times reporter, also wrote "Factory Man" and "Truevine." 5:30 to 7:30 p.m. 235 E. Plume St., downtown Norfolk. 757-431-7491. Admission free. Reserve seats at SloverLibrary.com/Brinkley.
We erred. Dylan Meconis, author of "Queen of the Sea" - highlighted in our Bookworms column for young readers on Sept. 1 - is a woman.

New and recent
Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch's book, "A Republic,
If You Can Keep It" (Crown Forum, 323 pp.). The title echoes a statement by Benjamin Franklin about the type of government the founders would seek. This earnest and idealistic collection of essays, articles, speeches and past opinions sets out Gorsuch's views on the role of judges, the importance of civility and ethics, and the right - and wrong - way to decide cases (he believes the justices should rely on the "original meaning" of the words in the Constitution and in federal laws). (L.A. Times, Washington Post)
"Audience of One: Donald Trump, Television, and the Fracturing of America" by James Poniewozik, television critic for The New York Times (Liveright, 304 pp.). Poniewozik analyzed the connections between the evolution of American TV and Trump's ascendancy, studying 14 seasons of "The
Apprentice" and Trump's TV interviews and other appearances. He says he was frustrated by news coverage of Trump's candidacy and election that described him as a "real estate mogul" or a "longtime businessman." Trump wasn't truly a billionaire, but he played the role well enough to be one in the public's mind. "Being a TV star," Poniewozik says, is "the main thing about him." (Washington Post)
Also: "Our Dogs, Ourselves: The Story of a Singular Bond" by Alexandra Horowitz ... "Buzz, Sting, Bite: Why We Need Insects" by Anne Sverdrup-Thygeson ... "Because Internet: Understanding the New Rules of Language" by Gretchen
McCulloch ... Salman Rushdie's "Quichotte," Don Quixote's tale reworked for a modern America in which fact and fiction play each other.

Horse Racing's Tough Year Keeps Getting Tougher

Texto completo: Horse owners, trainers and racetrack executives are supposed to take care of their athletes, equine and human. When they do not, both are at risk. As we saw earlier this year, 30 horses had to be euthanized after sustaining devastating injuries at Santa Anita Park in Southern California. Their riders, fortunately, were not seriously injured.
And regulatory agencies are supposed to protect the public, in the case of horse racing by "ensuring the integrity, viability and safety" of the industry, according to the California Horse Racing Board's mission statement.
It is a hard job that requires a certain steadfastness in the face of public pressure. Sometimes that will is there, sometimes not.
On the first Saturday in May at Churchill Downs, three Kentucky racing officials faced a test of their charge.
With tens of millions of dollars in the balance and a national television audience on the edge of its seat for close to 22 minutes, they did the unthinkable. They disqualified Maximum Security, a colt that appeared to all the world to be the easy winner of the 145th running of the Kentucky Derby.
Maximum Security, however, had jumped a puddle on the rain-soaked track turning for home and almost knocked over a rival, while slowing the momentum of a couple of others. The disqualification deprived the owner, trainer and jockey of their first Derby victory.
But it was a clear foul and the officials followed the rules. They made the second-place horse, a long shot named Country House, the winner, albeit with an asterisk next to his name.
In April 2018, the trainer Bob Baffert faced a crucial situation with a horse named Justify: The colt had to finish first or second in the Santa Anita Derby to qualify for the Kentucky Derby a month later.
Justify prevailed, then failed a drug test for the banned substance scopolamine. The rule on the books at the time required that Justify be disqualified, forfeiting both the prize money and entry into the Derby, the first Triple Crown race.
With nobody looking, California racing officials spent four months investigating the failed test, long enough for Justify to not only compete in the Derby, but also win it, along with the Preakness and Belmont Stakes. In August, after Justify's breeding rights had been sold for $ 60 million, the California board -- whose chairman at the time, Chuck Winner, had employed Baffert as his trainer -- disposed of the inquiry altogether behind closed doors. It happened in an executive session, an approach the board's executive director had not followed once before during his five-and-a-half-year term.
California officials did not follow their own rules, which should disappoint and dismay anyone who loves the sport of horse racing and values fair play. Justify is the 13th Triple Crown champion. Whether there is an asterisk next to his name is something horse racing fans will have to decide.
The California board's maneuvering came to light after The New York Times reported on Wednesday how a lack of transparency allowed the failed test to be kept from the public.
In a letter to The Times released on social media, Baffert's attorney, W. Craig Robertson III, said that Justify's positive test for the banned substance scopolamine had been the result of "environmental contamination." He ate jimson weed, was the explanation given.
Robertson offered no evidence of contamination; nor did California regulators when offered the opportunity to respond to The Times before the publication of the article.
In a written statement, the board's executive director, Rick Baedeker, said that during its investigation, scientists retested samples from other horses at Santa Anita and found trace amounts of the drug in a handful of samples -- not enough to prompt a positive result, but enough to allow the board to seriously consider that Justify and the other horses might have eaten some contaminated feed. He said that the trainers of those horses were never notified that there might be a problem.
With the news media demanding answers, Dr. Rick Arthur, the California board's equine medical director, went to a racing industry publication, The Blood-Horse, to explain why his science had led him and the board to look past the failed test.
He said the presence of an additional chemical in Justify's biological sample suggested that the scopolamine had to have come from the ingestion of jimson weed rather than a pharmaceutical, and he said many experts have decided scopolamine doesn't really help anyway. In other words, just trust them.
There is this, though: The quantity of the drug found in Justify suggested that it was not the result of feed or bedding contamination and that it was intended to enhance performance, according to Dr. Rick Sams, who ran the drug lab for the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission from 2011 to 2018. Dr. Sams said scopolamine can have performance-enhancing benefits. Dr. Arthur did not explain why there might have been so much more scopolamine in Justify than in the other horses.
No matter which authority one trusts, there is an interesting detail about how this situation was handled. Human athletes who fail drug tests are responsible for whatever substances are found in their systems, regardless of how they got there, because whether or not the athletes intended to, they were competing with an advantage. They also are responsible for attempting to clear their names once they test positive.
In Justify's case, he was found to have an illegal substance in his system, and then the people who administered the test took it upon themselves to spend four months trying to clear Justify of wrongdoing.
The handling of the case prompts a question for some: What else have California officials made disappear and for whom?
Mick Ruis, the owner and trainer of the Santa Anita Derby runner-up, Bolt d'Oro, wonders that. He is considering a lawsuit against the board. Justify earned $ 600,000 for the victory, while Bolt d'Oro earned $ 200,000 as the runner-up.
Ruis said the California board had protected Justify's trainer, Bob Baffert, a two-time Triple Crown winner and a Hall of Famer.
"The rule was there," Ruis told The Louisville Courier-Journal. "It's just real disappointing how we have different sets of rules for different people there in Santa Anita. The horse tested positive. Why didn't anybody know about it until now?"
It is an excellent question, especially since doping investigations are often handled in a far more public fashion.
After this year of years for racing, with the industry shrinking and tracks everywhere struggling to find enough horses to fill their racing cards, racing executives and regulators are under pressure to step up their game.
Ruis would not be the first to call for greater transparency. It might have allowed Justify, a talented horse, an unquestioned legacy.

Texto completo: There's James Dean, perfect hair and a smirk - cigarette in one hand, "The Complete Poetical Works of James Whitcomb Riley" in the other. Audrey Hepburn, a classics connoisseur, is cross-legged on a shag carpet, eyes fixed on the open book in front of her. And Orson Welles is supine, smoking a pipe and focused on a weathered copy of "A History of Technology, Vol. III: From the Renaissance to the Industrial Revolution."
Stars, they're just like us! Provided you consume your reading material while draped in a silk robe and posed seductively.
In "The Hollywood Book Club," photo archivist Steven Rea curates 55 photographs of classic film stars "with literature (or not) in their hands - or on their laps, or in the general vicinity." The full-page images - candid pictures, publicity shots and production stills - are black-and-white, and they're stunning: Rita Hayworth and Ginger Rogers are otherworldly; 25-year-old Marlon Brando's gaze is so smoldering, one worries about the flammable book he's holding. Each photo is accompanied by just a few lines of text, a simplicity that keeps the focus where it belongs: on the images.
Rea groups the photos into categories, including the stars luxuriating in their personal libraries; reading to their kids; studying source material for film interpretations; and passing time on set.
An eclectic taste in reading is apparently timeless: Sammy Davis Jr. relaxed with a paperback edition of Lloyd C. Douglas's biblical epic "The Robe," and Lauren Bacall perused a pictorial history of 20th-century conflict. John Cassavetes and Gena Rowlands read "Baby Animals," a picture book by Garth Williams, to their son, Nick, who grew up to be an actor and a director.
Some stars used books as props: In a photo from the 1971 film "Pretty Maids All in a Row," Angie Dickinson studied the "Illustrated Book of Love," a guide to sexual positions. And three Ziegfeld Follies girls - Mary Jane Halsey, Diana Cook and Edna Callahan - balanced titles from the MGM library on top of their well-styled heads.
Others were notably voracious readers. In a 1951 photo, Marilyn Monroe was curled up on a sofa bed, wearing a silk bathrobe and sultry expression while reading "The Poetry and Prose of Heinrich Heine," an 874-page collection. Books were stacked on every nearby surface, too - Ernest Hemingway's "The Sun Also Rises," Leo Tolstoy's "War and Peace," John Steinbeck's "Tortilla Flats."
In another photo, Bette Davis, outfitted in stylish riding gear, read a book concealed by a dust jacket. (There's an ad for a 1930s spiritual movement on the back: "Explore Your Mind!" is visible in bold print.) Davis's reading habits became the subject of national attention in 1938, when the New York Times reported that her husband wanted a divorce because she read "to an unnecessary degree." Her fellow stars, one imagines, would have disagreed.
"The Hollywood Book Club" is a striking collectible, a delight for bibliophiles and cinephiles. The glitz and glamour are palpable, and the photos Rea selected awaken a nostalgia for those golden years of the silver screen. Assume your best movie-star pose, and savor the book on your velvet chaise, leveling its pages with your sauciest gaze. One never knows when a camera is lurking nearby.

Texto completo: The Lancaster County Democratic Party is getting national attention for booking former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe as the annual fall banquet speaker next weekend.
McCabe will arrive in Lancaster County on the heels of several days of intense speculation about whether the fired top official will be criminally indicted.
The county Democratic party’s choice for speaker has garnered national headlines for bringing McCabe to Pennsylvania, a state that voted for Trump in the 2016 presidential election. It also caught the attention from conservatives, including a top member of Trump’s reelection campaign.

Tweet:
CNN Contributor Andrew McCabe will headline a Democrat Party fundraiser in Pennsylvania on September 21. Interesting decision by the party, betting that he won't be criminally charged sometime in the next 2.5 weeks.https://t.co/vYrwdNgbdk
— Matt Wolking (Text TRUMP to 88022) (@MattWolking) September 4, 2019
------------
“Interesting decision by the party, betting that he won’t be criminally charged sometime in the next 2.5 weeks,” tweeted Matt Wolking, the Trump campaign’s deputy director of communications for rapid response.
McCabe, a counterterrorism expert, was fired from the Trump Administration in 2018 for lying to investigators about a leak he authorized during the 2016 presidential election. He was a main fixation for Trump, according to former FBI Director James Comey’s leaked memos, Vanity Fair reported.
The national reaction to bringing McCabe to Lancaster left Lancaster County Democratic Committee Chairwoman JoAnn Hentz “quite amazed,” she said.
“I was surprised that it got any attention beyond Lancaster County,” Hentz added. “We’re never out there trying to be controversial.”
Federal prosecutors recommended McCabe be criminally charged on Thursday, the Associated Press reported. Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen rejected an appeal by McCabe’s attorneys that was denied, which clears the way for federal officials to impanel a grand jury.
By Friday, McCabe’s lawyers asked federal prosecutors whether a secret grand jury already had refused to indict him, which would signal the the federal government is having trouble making a case against him, the New York Times reported.
Hentz and the local Democratic committee aren’t concerned McCabe will get indicted before he comes to Lancaster. Until then, they’ll look forward to their evening with him. Plus, there is a clause in his contract covering if McCabe is unable to complete his agreed-upon speech, she said.
“At this point, [the Trump Administration] already fired him,” Hentz said. “I’m not even sure what the purpose of this question of an indictment would be.”
McCabe will headline the banquet on Saturday, Sept. 21 starting at 6 p.m. at the Lancaster Marriott Hotel. Tickets are $80 per person.
Approximately 500 people have already purchased tickets for the event, Hentz said.
The Republican Committee of Lancaster County will release its fall banquet speaker in the coming weeks, its chair Kirk Radanovic wrote in an email. The banquet is set for mid-October.
McCabe, a CNN contributor, is set to speak about his more than 20 years at the FBI and “the new and emerging battlegrounds... that our nation will face,” according to a release.
“When we spoke with him on the phone, he really emphasized the idea of service and how he feels he and his peers at the FBI are servants of the country,” Hentz said. “Obviously, seeing some of the right wing comments, perhaps they won’t agree with that.”
The county Democratic party wanted to bring McCabe because of his experience with cyber-security concerns, especially during the 2016 election, Hentz said.
McCabe’s book “The Threat: How the FBI Protects America in the Age of Terror and Trump,” is a New York Times No. 1 bestseller. McCabe will sign copies of the book after his speech.
Previous speakers for the local Democratic committee’s fall banquet include Democratic National Committee chairwoman Donna Brazile and Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist Eugene Robinson.

Texto completo: COLUMBUS, Ohio — The Democratic National Committee says the party’s October presidential debate will take place at a small university in Ohio. The fourth debate, which will be hosted by CNN and The New York Times, is to be held at Otterbein University in Westerville, in central Ohio.The debate will take place Oct. 15 and possibly the next night if additional candidates qualify based on polling numbers. Otterbein is a private liberal arts college with enrollment of around 2,400. The city of Westerville was long known as the home of the Anti-Saloon League, which led the fight for Prohibition. Today the Columbus suburb regularly tops lists of desirable residential communities, with Money Magazine twice naming it as one of the country’s best places to live.

Texto completo: Please produce but don't publish yet. thA number of low-polling 2020 Democrats are adopting the use of bad language in a bid to gain media attention and propel themselves to relevancy.
Beto O'Rourke began dropping a number of F-bombs when speaking about issues like gun violence around the time his campaign began a relaunch after he failed to gain any traction in polls.
“Members of the press, what the f--k?!” O'Rourke asked in August following the El Paso, Texas, shooting. That was followed up with another F-word-laden tirade. “We’re averaging about 300 mass shootings a year. No other country comes close. So, yes, this is f--ked up," he said. O'Rourke then later explained he was just "being honest" and wished to "shock the conscience of the country."
In April, O'Rourke promised to cease using foul language, although he was faring much better in the polls then.
"I'm not a fan. Swearing makes people sit up and pay attention to the context. If it doesn't enhance the message, it's a negative," Democratic strategist Scott Ferson told the Washington Examiner. "I'm not sure it's a vote-getter, there are more articulate ways to show you really hate guns," he said, before adding that he thought O'Rourke's language came across as desperate.
In March, O'Rourke acknowledged that swearing could turn off some voters, even if it did attract more media attention. "I don't intend on using that word going forward," he told a voter in Madison, Wisconsin. He soon changed his mind.
Latest polls show O'Rourke's Democratic support ranging from zero to 4%. A RealClearPolitics average has him at 2.3%, behind candidates like entrepreneur Andrew Yang at 2.5%, who said "ass" during the the June Democratic debates, and Sen. Cory Booker who quoted President Trump's "shit hole" comment during the July debates.
Front-runners, such as Joe Biden and Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, have largely refrained from using profanity on the stump, although the former vice president has made repeated references to his "big f--king deal" comment about the Affordable Care Act when campaigning throughout the country.
Others, like Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, have boasted about their use of foul language. His campaign had no problem sharing a press release titled, “Governor Bullock on The Daily Show: I’ve Actually Had to Get Shit Done." Even the mild-mannered Midwesterners Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg have both said "damn" during a debate.
Julián Castro said "bullshit" twice during his appearance on HBO's Real Time with Bill Maher, while Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan called on Republicans to "get their shit together."
Before she declared her candidacy, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard labeled the president "Saudi Arabia's bitch" over his decision not to punish the leader of the Gulf nation over the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
In advance of her now-ended 2020 run, candidate New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand told a group of activists that "if we are not helping people, we should go the f--k home" in June 2017. She later pledged to give up swearing for Lent the following year, although she added that the president's behavior made it a lot harder.
In the House, freshman Rep. Rashida Tlaib told supporters at a bar in Washington that she and her colleagues are "gonna impeach the motherf--ker," referring to Trump. She later apologized for causing a "distraction."
Political strategists say much of the potty-mouths of various Democrats can be attributed to the behavior of the current White House occupant. Trump, they say, set a whole new standard for what was deemed publicly acceptable — and even gave Democrats the idea that such language can come across as relatable.
Of course, foul language by high-powered officials predates Trump, even President Barack Obama's White House had a notorious sailor-mouthed chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel. During his tenure, the former mayor of Chicago reportedly lobbed F-bombs at others, so much so that he even donned a nameplate that read "Undersecretary of Go (F-Bomb) Yourself.”
Presidents Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon were notoriously foul-mouthed in private while Vice President Dick Cheney once told Sen. Pat Leahy of Vermont to "go f--k yourself," and President George W. Bush described a New York Times reporter as a "major league asshole."

Ex-MSNBC host accuses network of overhyping Russia collusion narrative

Texto completo: Former MSNBC host Krystal Ball said on HBO's Real Time with Bill Maher Friday night that she believes her former network has done more to hurt the progressive cause than help it throughout President Trump's time in office.
"Do you feel networks like MSNBC ... help or hurt progressive causes?" host Bill Maher asked Ball on the show.
"Overall, I think MSNBC in the Trump era has done real damage to the Left, and I’ll tell you why," Ball began to say.
"Damage?" Maher interrupted with surprise.
"And I say that with love," Ball continued. "I mean these are my former colleagues, friends. I mean, look, the Russia story and what happened there was important. But it was not all-important. And they went so far into the realm of conspiracy theorizing, I mean, they had Jonathan Chait on."
Maher cut off Ball again, saying the Russia story "was a conspiracy."
"They had Jonathan Chait on to talk about how Trump may have been a Russian plant since 1987," Ball continued.
"He may have been," Maher said.
"This is ridiculous, OK," Ball said. "This is way out from what journalistic facts said, and it’s to the exclusion of other stories that people actually care about."
iFrame Object
She noted several other prominent issues unfolding at the time and accused MSNBC of not focusing enough attention on them because the network was tuned into "one thing." She said MSNBC intensified expectations about former special counsel Robert Mueller's report to such a degree that many people thought it was not as big of a deal when the report was actually released.
New York Times opinion writer Bari Weiss agreed with Ball's assertion, saying the hype surrounding the report meant "anything short of a pee tape was nothing."
Maher alleged that the person who “shit the bed” was Robert Mueller, and the audience roared with applause.

Marty Walsh has problems

Texto completo: Mayor Marty Walsh has problems right now — the kind that could deny him a third term, if he seeks one.
The last time an incumbent Boston mayor lost a bid for reelection was in 1949, when James Michael Curley went down to John Hynes after spending five months in prison for mail fraud. Even then, it was close.
It seemed like Boston would always be a city where the mayor got to keep his job for as long as he wanted. But we might, just might, be headed into a new era here.
Walsh has had a brutal couple of months. In August, two of his aides were convicted of extortion and conspiracy to commit extortion for trying to strong-arm music festival organizers into hiring union labor. Those prosecutions pale compared to the gobsmacking news, three weeks ago, of a bribery scandal centered on the city's Zoning Board of Appeals. On Thursday, former Boston Planning and Development Agency official John Lynch pled guilty in federal court to accepting a $50,000 bribe from a developer to lobby a board member for approval on a South Boston condo project.
More shoes seem likely to drop; the feds don't tend to stop at one small fry crook. And Walsh has ordered an independent inquiry. The mayor hasn't been implicated. But two people close to him have stepped aside. Buddy Christopher, an architect who worked on the condo project, and a trusted aide who has been close with Walsh for decades, is taking an unpaid leave while investigations are underway. And Craig Galvin — a longtime Walsh supporter who hosted a fund-raiser for him in 2015, and whom the mayor appointed to the ZBA — has resigned his post.
It looks awful. And even if it's not as awful as it looks, the prosecutions won't help a mayor who strains to avoid seeming like a vestige of an old Boston where connections are all.
As the 2018 primaries showed, many Boston voters want to move on from that culture, and their voice is increasingly powerful.Then-City Councilor Ayanna Pressley's victory over incumbent congressman Mike Capuano revealed new electoral strength in the center of the city — in Roxbury, Dorchester, and Jamaica Plain — more diverse, left-leaning neighborhoods compared to traditional voter powerhouses like South Boston and West Roxbury. We're also seeing the rise of voters who worry more about bike lanes and better policing than about potholes.
Nobody seems to be scared of Walsh the way they were of his predecessor, Tom Menino. That's a good thing for the city. It's also a good thing for those who might want Walsh's job. City Councilor Michelle Wu, who won't yet say whether she'll run against him in 2021, has run rings around the mayor on transportation, an issue that is consistently among voters' top priorities. She also called for ZBA business to be suspended in the wake of the bribery scandal. Council President Andrea Campbell, also a possible challenger, called for the appointment of a city inspector general to root out corruption, a clear shot across Walsh's bow.
Now, 2021 is a long way off. And Walsh is hugely popular: A WBUR/MassINC poll in June revealed a 70 percent approval rating among Boston residents surveyed. We don't yet know if recent events, or a credible challenger, will dent that goodwill.
And it's not clear whether Walsh himself wants to test it. A few weeks ago, the mayor told The New York Times that he would consider running for the Senate if incumbent Ed Markey decided to bow out.
“This idea of being elected and thinking it's your seat until you leave, that game has changed," Walsh said.
After 20 years of Menino, who embodied the job and seemed incapable of imagining a life beyond it, the notion that a mayor might think like this is profoundly disorienting.
Of course, Walsh may have no choice. Either way, it's clear we're headed for a new day.

Make gazpacho to use late-summer veggies

Texto completo: Today, I decided to try a recipe for "really the best gazpacho ever" shared a while ago by a reader.
My reason for trying it today was that I harvested a basket of ripe tomatoes with spots or cracks and had to do something with them, and quick.
So I cut bad parts off and plugged in my blender. I blended the tomatoes with red onion, cucumber, a Hungarian pepper from my garden, a bit of sherry vinegar, garlic, salt and a decent amount of olive oil. The recipe called for straining afterwards, but you know what? I had a big bowl of it straight from the blender, sans straining. Addictively good.
You could do either, leave as is or strain for an elegant presentation.
Now truth be told, I have a packed file of gazpacho recipes. This one, though, is my newest fave. A smooth Spanish style gazpacho, easy and so fast.
The bonus? It uses those late summer, less than perfect, dead ripe veggies.
Make this gazpacho! Let me know how you like it, OK?

Rita's garlic crostini Serve alongside the gazpacho.
Rub a clove of garlic on thick baguette slices. Drizzle with olive oil.
Sprinkle with shredded Manchego, Parmesan, or leave plain.
Run under broiler.
Late summer gazpacho aka best gazpacho Originally from Julia Moskin, New York Times. Here's my adaptation. As always, go to taste.
Ingredients
A good 2 pounds red or combo of ripe tomatoes, cored and chunked up — I used red, yellow, and grape
1 Cubanelle or sweet banana pepper or about half of a sweet bell, seeded and chunked. I used a sweet Hungarian banana pepper
1 cucumber, about 8" long, peeled and chunked
1/3 to 1/2 cup red or mild onion, chunked (careful, here, you can always add more but you can't take away...).
1 nice teaspoon garlic/1 large clove
1 tablespoon sherry vinegar
Salt — I used 11/2 teaspoons
1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil or to taste, plus extra to drizzle
Instructions
Put everything but vinegar, salt and oil in blender and blend on high until very smooth. With motor running, add vinegar and salt.
Slowly pour in oil and blend until everything is emulsified and again, smooth. It will be the thickness of salad dressing. If a bit watery, add a little more oil until it's creamy the way you like it.
Now you can either strain it all through strainer or food mill, making sure you press hard on solids, or leave as is, or just strain some of it.
For a silky smooth soup, you should strain it all.
Chill about 6 hours or overnight.
To serve:
Adjust seasonings. If too thick, add a bit of ice water.
Serve with drizzle of oil.
Serve as appetizer or first course in shot or small glasses or as an entre in a bowl.
Try my garlic crostini alongside.
Substitute for sherry vinegar
Try red wine vinegar with maybe a tad of sugar, since sherry vinegar has a sweeter flavor profile.

Texto completo: Let’s suspend reality for a nanosecond.
Let’s say that a horse can test positive as soon as he crosses the finish line, and the trainer has no recourse to call for a second test, and the results can flash on the board right then and there.
Justify wins and then is disqualified at the 2018 Santa Anita Derby on April 7, 2018.
Since Justify had only run two races previously, trainer Bob Baffert has to scramble to find a race that allows enough points to qualify for the Kentucky Derby on May 5.
That doesn’t work, and Justify has to wait until the Preakness. He’s able to run there because only eight horses have entered a field that can stretch to 14. He wins the Preakness, then the Belmont.
The stud fees for Justify still don’t project high enough for his many owners. So he returns in 2019. He wins the Pegasus at Gulfstream Park, and he runs away with the Pacific Classic at Del Mar.
By now Justify has built the renown that lures the civilian fan into the seats. In a triumphant return, he dominates the Breeders’ Cup Classic at Santa Anita and is carried into the barn, amid rose petals and trumpets, to denote his early retirement.
But reality is the enemy of thoroughbred racing, as we know. This week brought an asterisk to Justify’s Triple Crown run that can’t be erased from the procreation station, unfairly or not.
The New York Times reported on Wednesday that Justify tested positive for scopolamine, which reduces motion sickness in human beings, after he won the Santa Anita Derby by three lengths. The machinery of drug testing did not allow a positive test to return before the Kentucky Derby. Therefore, Justify ran and won and did not test positive there. The same was true of the Preakness and the Belmont Stakes.
No one at Churchill Downs knew of the test, but a track spokesman said Justify and the others were tested prior to the race. Baffert, as is his right, asked for another test, and when those results were positive, the California Horse Racing Board basically tabled the issue, and the public never knew until the news was fit to print.
The Times quoted Dr. Rick Sams, the director of LGC Science, a drug testing lab in Lexington, Ky. Sams said that Justify had 300 nanograms per milliliter of scopolamine in his system, five times the legal limit. Such a reading, Sams said, could make Justify’s breathing more efficient and therefore enhance his performance.
Never mind that Justify somehow went unbeaten without this surfeit of nanograms.
The CHRB decided that Justify took in scopolamine through Jimson weed, which sometimes gets into the feed or the straw. It decided Justify did not get the drug through Buscopan, which trainers sometimes use to fend off colic.
Horses in three other barns also ingested scopolamine during this period. Dr. Rick Arthur, the CHRB’s equine medical director, found that Justify and those others had atropine in their system. Buscopan does not contain both atropine and scopolamine, but Jimson weed does.
That means Justify likely suffered “environmental contamination,” similar to Canelo Alvarez’s suspension for eating steroid-riddled steaks. That prompted what the French might call a “spectacle de matieres fecales” in boxing. It dissipated, too.
The CHRB has not disqualified a horse for scopolamine in 12 years. In 1994 five trainers were fined, including Mark Hennig, whose Lady Blessington won the Buena Vista Handicap. An administrative law judge rescinded those fines, but the disqualifications and the forfeiture of the purse stood.
What’s a nanogram? It’s a billionth of a gram. We get numbed by the billions that are thrown around. If one were to log a billion miles by following the equator, one would encircle the earth 40,000 times. If one traveled from the Earth to Saturn when they are closest together, one would have to travel 256 million more miles to reach a billion.
It’s difficult to accept that 240 more billionths of a gram would decide a horse race.
But it’s easier to understand why people think Baffert, the face or at least the hair of the sport, is being coddled.
One rule should pass immediately: No California Horse Racing Board member should have any business connection with anyone in the sport, the way Madeline Auerbach owns a horse with Stronach Group COO Tim Ritvo, the way Chuck Winner had an interest in horses Baffert trained. You don’t need test results for that. It’s California government. Divestiture is the least it should demand.
That would help the sport get from beyond repair to beyond reproach. Granted, it sometimes seems a billion-mile trip.

Texto completo: Let’s suspend reality for a nanosecond.
Let’s say that a horse can test positive as soon as he crosses the finish line, and the trainer has no recourse to call for a second test, and the results can flash on the board right then and there.
Justify wins and then is disqualified at the 2018 Santa Anita Derby on April 7, 2018.
Since Justify had only run two races previously, trainer Bob Baffert has to scramble to find a race that allows enough points to qualify for the Kentucky Derby on May 5.
That doesn’t work, and Justify has to wait until the Preakness. He’s able to run there because only eight horses have entered a field that can stretch to 14. He wins the Preakness, then the Belmont.
The stud fees for Justify still don’t project high enough for his many owners. So he returns in 2019. He wins the Pegasus at Gulfstream Park, and he runs away with the Pacific Classic at Del Mar.
By now Justify has built the renown that lures the civilian fan into the seats. In a triumphant return, he dominates the Breeders’ Cup Classic at Santa Anita and is carried into the barn, amid rose petals and trumpets, to denote his early retirement.
But reality is the enemy of thoroughbred racing, as we know. This week brought an asterisk to Justify’s Triple Crown run that can’t be erased from the procreation station, unfairly or not.
The New York Times reported on Wednesday that Justify tested positive for scopolamine, which reduces motion sickness in human beings, after he won the Santa Anita Derby by three lengths. The machinery of drug testing did not allow a positive test to return before the Kentucky Derby. Therefore, Justify ran and won and did not test positive there. The same was true of the Preakness and the Belmont Stakes.
No one at Churchill Downs knew of the test, but a track spokesman said Justify and the others were tested prior to the race. Baffert, as is his right, asked for another test, and when those results were positive, the California Horse Racing Board basically tabled the issue, and the public never knew until the news was fit to print.

David Brooks: The meritocracy is ripping America apart

Texto completo: There are at least two kinds of meritocracy in America right now. Exclusive meritocracy exists at the super-elite universities and at the industries that draw the bulk of their employees from them — Wall Street, Big Law, medicine and tech. And then there is the more open meritocracy that exists almost everywhere else.
In the exclusive meritocracy, prestige is defined by how many people you can reject. The elite universities reject 85% to 95% of their applicants. Those accepted spend much of their lives living in neighborhoods and attending conferences where it is phenomenally expensive or hard to get in. Whether it’s the resort town you vacation in or the private school you send your kids to, exclusivity is the pervasive ethos. The more the exclusivity, the thicker will be the coating of PC progressivism to show that we’re all good people.
People in this caste work phenomenally hard to build their wealth. As Daniel Markovits notes in his powerful new book, “The Meritocracy Trap,” between 1979 and 2006, the percentage of workers in the top quintile of earners who work more than 50 hours a week nearly doubled.
People in this caste are super-skilled and productive. There are more than 70 law firms, Markovits notes, that generate more than $1 million in annual profit per partner. When Instagram was bought by Facebook for $1 billion, it had only 13 full-time employees.
A few years ago, people in this elite professional caste seized on research by Thomas Piketty, who argued that rising inequality is caused by the shift in income away from labor and toward capital. The investors are to blame! But, Markovits argues, roughly 75% of the increase in the top 1% of earnings is caused by shifts in income within labor. These highly educated professionals attract vast earnings while everybody else gets left behind. A cardiologist used to earn four times as much as a nurse; now it’s seven times as much.
Parents in the exclusive meritocracy raise their kids to be fit fighters within it. Markovits calculates how much affluent parents invest on their kids’ human capital, over and above what middle-class parents can afford to invest. He concludes that affluent parents invest $10 million more per child . The resulting highly honed, high-performing young people are amazing — and endure the stresses you’d expect. At the best law school in the country, Yale, 70% of the students say they experience mental health challenges.
You don’t have to travel far to get outside the exclusive meritocracy. For example, last spring I spent a few days at Arizona State University, which is led by Michael Crow. ASU defines itself not by how many people it can exclude but by how many it can include. The need for higher education is greater than ever, so ASU has rapidly expanded to meet that need. Between 2013 and 2018, undergraduate enrollment rose by 45%. Between 2009 and 2018, the number of engineering students grew to 22,400 from about 6,400.
ASU has done it by increasing its reach into those who are underserved. The number of first-generation students has more than quadrupled since 2002.
Everything is on a mass scale. ASU’s honors college alone is bigger than Stanford’s entire undergraduate enrollment.
The quality has risen along with the size. Research expenditures double every six to eight years, and a number of academic departments are nationally recognized as among the best for the quality of their research.
The atmosphere is much more democratic and accessible to all. Faculty members are treated less as scholars within rarefied disciplines and more as interdisciplinary intellectual entrepreneurs. The goal is immediate social impact as much as expanding knowledge, so, for example, ASU’s Watts College of Public Service & Community Solutions is enmeshed with local residents to transform a Phoenix neighborhood.
Starbucks pays for eligible employees to attend ASU online. Many of the graduates I met had dropped out of three or four colleges before finally being able to get a degree at ASU. It’s an open place, where they can move up.
Similarly, last week I was in Wichita to observe the Kansas Leadership Center. The center teaches people how to create social change and hopes to saturate the state with better leaders. But the center doesn’t focus on traditional “leaders.” Its mantra is: “Leadership is an activity, not a position. Anyone can lead, anytime, anywhere.” The atmosphere is one of radical inclusion. The enrollees I met included business leaders, teachers, line workers and people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.
The center equips people at every level of society with organizational skills — for example, to understand when it is necessary to turn up the heat to force change, and when it is necessary to turn down the heat to encourage reconciliation.
People in both the exclusive and open meritocracies focus intensely on increasing skills. But it’s jarring to move from one culture to the other because the values are so different. The exclusive meritocracy is spinning out of control. If the country doesn’t radically expand its institutions and open access to its bounty, the U.S. will continue to rip apart.

Texto completo: Two-thirds of Americans
A recent Gallup poll found that two-thirds of Americans believe the government knows more about aliens and UFOs than it leads people to believe.
That number is down from almost 20 years ago, when 71 percent of Americans said they believed the government knew more about UFOs and aliens than it revealed. The demographics of these groups were the same in both 1996 and 2019; they tended to be younger, not college educated, and live in the western part of the United States.

Texto completo: A lawyer for Bob Baffert says the Hall of Fame trainer did not intentionally give 2018 Triple Crown winning horse Justify a banned substance that caused a positive test prior to last year's Kentucky Derby.
Attorney W. Craig Robertson released a statement defending Baffert after the New York Times reported Wednesday that Justify tested positive for Scopolamine in spring 2018. Robertson contends the substance came from contaminated food and that the California Horse Racing Board did the correct thing by not pursuing a lengthy investigation.
Justify tested positive after winning the Santa Anita Derby in California in April 2018 but was allowed to run in the Kentucky Derby a month later. Robertson writes that Justify passed "any and all drug tests" in Kentucky, Maryland and New York while racing in those states on the way to becoming the 13th Triple Crown winner in history.
Three horses died during the first two days of Belmont Park's fall season, mirroring the start and end of the summer meet at Saratoga Race Course.

OBJ: Players were told to hurt him
BEREA, Ohio - Odell Beckham Jr. says former Browns defensive coordinator Gregg Williams instructed his players to "take me out" of a preseason game in 2017.
The Pro Bowl wide receiver sustained an ankle injury when Cleveland's Briean Boddy-Calhoun cut his legs out while he was with the New York Giants. Beckham said current Cleveland players told him that Williams instructed them to "take me out of the game, and it's preseason."
Beckham also accused Williams, who was Cleveland's interim coach last year and now defensive coordinator of the New York Jets, of teaching "cheap shots and dirty hits."
The Browns visit the Jets on Monday night.
Williams was suspended by the NFL for one season for his role in the infamous "Bountygate" scandal in which the New Orleans Saints were found to have operated a bounty system where players were paid bonuses for hard hits and deliberately injuring players.
Five former Cavs nominated for hall
CANTON, Ohio - First-time eligible candidates Troy Polamalu and Patrick Willis and five former University of Virginia players are among 122 modern-era nominees for the Pro Football Hall of Fame's class of 2020.
Joining the Steelers' hard-hitting safety and 49ers bone-crunching linebacker for consideration are linemen Justin Smith and John Abraham, and linebacker Lance Briggs. The other two in their initial year of eligibility are receiver Reggie Wayne and running back Maurice Jones-Drew.
Finalists from 2019 who did not get enough support to be among the five modern-era players selected are receiver Isaac Bruce; running back Edgerrin James; offensive linemen Alan Faneca, Tony Boselli and Steve Hutchinson; defensive lineman Richard Seymour; and safeties John Lynch and Steve Atwater.
The nominees include 63 offensive players, 43 defensive players and 16 special teamers.
Thomas Jones, who starred at U.Va. from 1996-99, joins James Farrior and twins Tiki and Ronde Barber, who all played for the Cavaliers from 1993-96, on the ballot. Chris Warren, who transferred from U.Va. to Ferrum in the late '80s, was also nominated, along with James Madison product Gary Clark and Lafayette High grad Mel Gray.
The class of 2020 will be selected in Feb. 1, 2020, the day before the Super Bowl.
New York Jets coach Adam Gase said second-year quarterback Sam Darnold has mononucleosis and will miss at least the game against the Cleveland Browns on Monday night and that running back Le'Veon Bell didn't practice Thursday and was scheduled to undergo an MRI due to shoulder soreness.
The NFL suspended Buffalo Bills rookie linebacker Tyrel Dodson for six games as a result of an alleged altercation with his girlfriend at a nightclub in Scottsdale, Ariz.

Johnson returns to NBA after BIG3
DETROIT - Joe Johnson agreed to a one-year deal with the Detroit Pistons, the Free Press confirmed.
The team had room to add a player because forward Michael Beasley never signed a contract with the Pistons, according to a source with knowledge of the situation. The Free Press reported in August that Beasley and the Pistons were "working toward" a deal.
Johnson, 38, won the BIG3's MVP award this season, leading his team to a championship. He led the league with 21.9 points per game and 3.9 assists per game.

Semenya finally gets 2011 worlds gold
JOHANNESBURG - Caster Semenya is getting her gold medal from the 2011 world championships after Russian runner Maria Savinova was stripped of the title for doping.
South Africa's track federation says it will receive the medal from the IAAF on Semenya's behalf at the world championships in Doha, Qatar, this month. Semenya won't be present for any ceremony in Doha after she was barred from defending her latest 800-meter world title because she has refused to follow new IAAF rules that require her to medically reduce her natural testosterone level to be allowed to compete.
Her second legal appeal against the rules is still being considered by the Swiss supreme court.

Texto completo: The Sanctuary Church near downtown Fort Lauderdale wears its heart on a flagpole by the side of Federal Highway, a flapping declaration that should not seem so provocative, "Love wins."
As we've seen in a week of a remarkable gathering and fundraising across South Florida for those displaced and nearly destroyed by Hurricane Dorian, it does. Much of this work continues to be done by folks who have come of age after 9-11, a tragedy that revealed our vestigial instinct to come together, unconditionally, to rebuild.
In recent years we have gotten more efficient in mobilizing hearts and minds in response to misfortune, both natural and man-made, in cities that for a time are represented in hashtags. Of course, this impulse is not defined by local or national borders. In the Bahamas, especially, we are reminded that as a species we want to help neighbors in distress. We need to help. These hashtags are part of a continuum. We are #HumanStrong.
Tunnel of love
Now in its eighth year in downtown Fort Lauderdale, the Stephen Siller Tunnel to Towers 5K Run & Walk returns to Huizenga Park 7:30-9:30 a.m. Saturday. A fundraiser for military and first responders injured or killed in the line of duty, the event is one of many taking place this week around the world to honor the memory of its namesake, a New York firefighter who was on his way home from a shift on Sept. 11, 2001, when the call came in that the World Trade Center was on fire. Siller turned around and, in his turnout gear, ran through the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel to the Twin Towers and immortality.
Fort Lauderdale's is one of the few runs that includes the emotional scene of firefighters weighed down by heavy protective gear running through a tunnel as Siller did. Registration is open through Friday and costs $35, ages 13-17 $20, ages 12 and younger $10, military and first responders $25. Visit Crowdrise.com/T2TFortLauderdale2019 , Facebook.com/T2TFtLauderdale or Tunnel2Towers.org.
Then, breakfast
Just across the river, Tarpon River Brewing Co. will host a T2T after-party breakfast beginning at 8 a.m., Saturday with 20 percent of the proceeds going to the Tunnel to Towers Foundation. Visit Facebook.com/TarponRiverBrewing.
Weekend movie
It's been a while since I've read a more memorably intriguing review than the one the New York Times' Manohla Dargis gave to "Give Me Liberty," beginning a weeklong run at Savor Cinema in Fort Lauderdale on Friday. For information on showtimes and tickets, visit FLIFF.com.
Directed by newcomer Kirill Mikhanovsky, a Russian immigrant who once drove a medical transport van for people with disabilities in Milwaukee, "Give Me Liberty" stars nonprofessional actors Chris Galust, as the driver of a medical transport van in Milwaukee, and Lauren Spencer, who, like the character she plays, has A.L.S. Much of the action takes place in a white-knuckle ride through the city as the always-behind Vic (Galust) hurries his passengers to their appointments, including Tracy (Spencer), with whom Vic settles into a tenderly building relationship.
Dargis called it "a jolt of a movie, at once kinetic and controlled. It's an anarchic deadpan comedy that evolves into a romance just around the time the story explodes. ... With its contrasting modes and moods, it pushes and pulls you, rocking you back and forth like one of the van's swaying passengers, creating an agreeable uncertainty. ... Mikhanovsky proves to be a virtuoso of chaos. When he plunges you into the churn it's as if he were saying, 'Isn't this mess we call life glorious?' "
Weekend laughs
From the Wayans family of comedians and actors, Shawn Wayans (the good looking one), star of "White Chicks" and "Scary Movie" (OK, the other good looking one), will do four shows Friday-Saturday at the Miami Improv in Doral. Tickets cost $30 (two-drink minimum). As you might expect, the $40 VIP tickets are gone. Visit MiamiImprov.com.
Sounds good
Steve Rullman's thoughtfully programmed survey of indie-rock experimentation, Bumblefest 2019, returns to downtown West Palm Beach on Friday and Saturday, with 36 bands on six stages. They include slinky, '60s dumpster divers the Blank Tapes, West Coast dreamer Worn-tin, groovy L.A. vocalist Winter and Brooklyn synth duo the Fantastic Plastics. Also worth your time are two recently formed South Florida supergroups that demand repeated listening, the Darling Fire and All the V Words. Bumblefest takes place on stages at Kismet Vintage, Respectable Street (inside and outside), Voltaire,Hullabaloo and Subculture Coffee. Advance tickets cost $25 for a two-day pass, $15 for a single day. Single-day tickets will cost $20 at the gate. For the band schedule and more information, visit Bumblefest.com.
Date night
Beach House Pompano will throw a '90s party 7 p.m.-to-close on Saturday, with DJ Misha and specials on drinks, which you may need. This was the decade that gave us a lot of Madonna hits, Ricky Martin's "Livin' La Vida Loca" and Montell Jordan's timeless "This Is How We Do It," but also Meatloaf's "I'd Do Anything for Love," Los Del Rio's "Macarena" and a lot of Mariah Carey hits. Visit BeachHousePompano.com.
Isbell in Pembroke Pines
A sentence I am happily surprised to write: Grammy winner Jason Isbell and the 400 Unit are bringing their tour to the Charles F. Dodge City Center in Pembroke Pines. Tickets for the Jan. 28 show go on sale 10 a.m. Friday at all Ticketmaster outlets, including Ticketmaster.com and by calling 800-745-3000. Hayes Carll will open the show.
Ticket window
Country singer Chris Young brings his made-for-Coral-Sky sing-along "Raised On Country" (all together now, "I was raised on Merle, raised on Willie, got my honky-tonk attitude from Joe Diffie") to the West Palm Beach shed on Saturday, joined by Chris Janson (all together now, "I'm getting' them good vibes, I'm livin' this good life) and LoCash. There are $20 tickets available at LiveNation.com.
Latin crossover star J Balvin - "Mi Gente" with Beyoncé, Cardi B's "I Like It," and "You Stay" by DJ Khaled, with Meek Mill, Lil Baby and Jeremih - brings his Arcoíris Tour to Miami's AmericanAirlines Arena 8 p.m. Saturday, with tickets available, starting at $35.95, at Ticketmaster.com.
The '80s reggae favorites UB40, featuring Ali Campbell and Astro, bring their 40th Anniversary Tour: A Real Labour of Love, with special guest Shaggy, to Mizner Park Amphitheater in Boca Raton 6:30 p.m. Sunday. Tickets cost $29 at MyBoca.us.
Punk survivors Bad Religion, with special guest Emily Davis and the Murder Police, are at Revolution Live in Fort Lauderdale 7 p.m. Tuesday. Tickets start at $29.50 at JoinTheRevolution.net.
You can still get tickets (starting at $35) for the Who 7:30 p.m. Sept. 20 at the BB&T Center in Sunrise, at Ticketmaster.com.

★★½
RAISE HELL: THE LIFE & TIMES OF MOLLY IVINS
Directed by Janice Engel. Written by Engel and Monique Zavistovski.
At Kendall Square.
93 minutes. Unrated (as PG-13: smokin', drinkin', cussin', lots and lots of cussin')
In person, Molly Ivins wasn't quite larger than life, even if she was 6 feet tall. “It really does make a difference if you tower over your editor," we hear her say in Janice Engel's lively documentary, “Raise Hell: The Life & Times of Molly Ivins." Her persona, though, sure was larger than life: brash, funny, smart, colorful. Newspaper columnists tend not to get documentaries made about them, but newspaper columnists tend not to be anything like Ivins. At the height of her popularity, in the late '80s and '90s, her column ran in upward of 400 newspapers; and she cut an even wider swathe, thanks to frequent television appearances and best-selling books like “Molly Ivins Can't Say That, Can She?" (1993) and “You Got to Dance With Them What Brung You" (1998).
There's no breed quite like the Texas liberal, and Ivins was the species at its most spectacular. Knowing you're doomed to defeat, as any sensible Texas liberal does, can be wonderfully liberating. “Have a good time when you're fighting for freedom," Ivins once said. “We don't always win, and it might be the only good time you have." In that advice, shrewdness meets sad experience, with the wisdom it bespeaks is anything but sad.
“Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose," or so Kris Kristofferson (of the Brownsville, Texas, Kristoffersons) would have us believe. Those words were most famously sung by Janis Joplin (of the Port Arthur, Texas, Joplins). Ivins was something like a cross between Kristofferson and Joplin: part good old boy (distaff division); part full-throated, tangle-haired star. Giving no quarter, she expected none in return.
More important, she clearly had so much fun doing it. Ivins was three parts comedian to two parts avenging angel. As ratios go, that one's hard to beat. What's the classic gunslinger line, “Smile when you say that, pardner"? When Ivins said something — when she wrote something, too — she didn't just smile, she grinned.
The documentary would seem to labor under a severe handicap: its subject's absence. Ivins died in 2007, of cancer. Only 62, she had packed an awful lot of living into those six decades. That presumed disadvantage turns out not to be an issue. When Ivins was alive, she was really, really alive; and there's so much footage of her being interviewed and giving speeches that she is very much a living presence in the film. She lights it up, not unlike how she lit up the printed page.
Along with the many film clips of Ivins, we hear from family, friends, colleagues. There's also the occasional here-for-name-value celebrity. Fellow Texan Dan Rather has something to add. MSNBC's Rachel Maddow doesn't.
Engel efficiently takes us along the path of Ivins's life and career: growing up in pre-civil rights Houston, starting at The Houston Chronicle after college, moving on to The Minneapolis Tribune, then co-editing The Texas Observer (where she found her voice and hit her stride). The New York Times, Ivins's next employer, did its best to quiet that voice — no one could silence it. Back in Texas, she found her true calling, as a columnist, first at The Dallas Times Herald, then The Fort Worth Star-Telegram.
So much of Ivins's impact in the documentary has to do with her voice. It's an aural marvel, the product of Texas drawl, years of smoking, and the self-awareness of a born performer. You might describe the specific timbre as honeyed jalapeno with whiskey notes (in life, her preferred beverages were beer and wine). Ivins wrote the way she spoke, and even the various Texas malefactors and nincompoops she pilloried found themselves liking her — or most of them did, anyway.
Among the many interesting things to be learned from “Raise Hell" is what a peculiar sort of Texan Ivins was. In that peculiarity, she was, perhaps, not unlike her great nemesis George W. Bush, whom she famously dubbed “Shrub." Dubya was the son of a president and went to Phillips Andover and Yale. Ivins was the daughter of the president of Tenneco and went to Smith (as had her mother and grandmother) and studied for a year in Paris at the Institute of Political Science.
At odd moments, Ivins's person peeks out from behind the persona: her unhappy childhood and adolescence, a fundamental loneliness and apartness made all the more acute by her gregariousness, a capacity for self-destructiveness of which the most obvious sign was her alcoholism (she did stop drinking several years before her death). What's stimulating and fun about “Raise Hell" is quite stimulating and fun. But the more smitten you become with its subject — and it's hard not to be — the more you feel there's something missing or that what isn't missing is yet too thin. “I didn't fit in at Smith," she says at one point, “but I didn't fit in anywhere, so that wasn't such an unusual experience." There's a sense in which Ivins doesn't quite fit in the documentary either — or rather what fits in is great, but what doesn't fit in (emotionally, personally) — gets left out, and that matters a lot.

Chief Executives Join Hands to Demand Action on Guns

Texto completo: In a direct and urgent call to address gun violence in America, the chief executives of some of the nation's best-known companies sent a letter to Senate leaders on Thursday, urging an expansion of background checks to all firearms sales and stronger "red flag" laws.
"Doing nothing about America's gun violence crisis is simply unacceptable and it is time to stand with the American public on gun safety," the heads of nearly 150 companies, including Levi Strauss, Twitter and Uber, say in the letter, which was shared with The New York Times.
The letter -- which urges the Republican-controlled Senate to enact bills already introduced in the Democrat-led House of Representatives -- is the most concerted effort by the business community to enter the gun debate, one of the most polarizing issues in the nation and one that was long considered off limits.
The debate and the decision to sign -- or not sign -- are a case study in how chief executives must weigh their own views and the political risks to their businesses.
"To a certain extent, these C.E.O.s are putting their businesses on the line here, given how politically charged this is," said Chip Bergh, chief executive of Levi Strauss, a company whose denim jeans have long been a symbol of America. Mr. Bergh spent the last several days trying to cajole his peers into joining him and gun control advocates like Everytown, which is funded in part by Michael Bloomberg. "Business leaders are not afraid to get engaged now," he added. "C.E.O.s are wired to take action on things that are going to impact their business and gun violence is impacting everybody's business now."
Mr. Bergh said he was encouraged by the conversations. "The tide is turning," he said, citing a spate of recent polls that show a majority of Americans in both parties support background checks and red flag laws. "People were starting to be much more open-minded," he said, even when the discussion didn't conclude with a signature.
Yet he is also bracing for a backlash. "This has been spun by the N.R.A. as we're trying to repeal the Second Amendment," Mr. Bergh said. "Nothing is further from the truth."
The movement has gained momentum since last month, when a shooting at a Walmart store in El Paso killed 22 people. A day later, nine people were shot and killed in Dayton, Ohio.
"Gun violence in America is not inevitable; it's preventable," the business leaders wrote. "We need our lawmakers to support common-sense gun laws that could prevent tragedies like these."
In addition to the expanded background checks, they are pressing the government to let federal courts issue temporary orders keeping guns out of the hands of people considered at risk of violence, under what is known as a red-flag law.
On Thursday after the executives released their letter, Business Roundtable, which had been reluctant to enter the gun debate, called on Congress and the Trump administration "to come together and enact bipartisan, common-sense legislation to address this epidemic." Visa joined with the group, saying that a "string of mass shootings in America has brought unimaginable sadness and a feeling of hopelessness to many in our communities."
A week ago, Walmart, the largest retailer and employer in the country, wrote its own letter to Congress, pushing for a debate over reauthorizing an assault weapons ban. It also announced that it was removing certain ammunition and guns from its shelves and would discourage "open carry" in its stores. Other retailers followed suit by changing their open-carry policies, including Kroger, CVS, Walgreens and the Wegmans grocery chain.
The letter signers on Thursday include the leaders of Airbnb, the Gap, Pinterest, Lyft, the Brookfield Property Group and Royal Caribbean.
Missing from the list, however, are some of America's biggest financial and technology companies, including Apple, Facebook, Google, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, some of which debated internally whether to sign the letter.
Two companies that signed may raise eyebrows in Washington: Thrive Capital, whose founder, Joshua Kushner, is the brother of Jared Kushner, President Trump's son-in-law, and Bain Capital, the private equity firm co-founded by Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah.
The letter is the latest example of the business community's stepping into a sensitive political area -- sometimes reluctantly -- during the Trump presidency. Business leaders have criticized Mr. Trump's immigration policy and his response to the white supremacist violence in Charlottesville, Va. On guns, the president has on several occasions offered support for stronger firearms policies before stepping away.
Some of the letter signers plan to lobby lawmakers in Washington, but it is unclear how much money, if any, the companies may devote to this issue.
Some executives signed on without hesitation. Others mulled it, often creating a raucous debate inside their offices and among their boards of directors, only to decide that the political risk was too high. More than a half-dozen executives spoke about their deliberations on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of conversations.
Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook did not sign, although he told colleagues and peers that he agreed with stricter background checks, two people involved in the conversation said. With Facebook under federal scrutiny -- and contending with a drumbeat of criticism from Republicans who contend that the company's platform silences conservative voices -- Mr. Zuckerberg has decided that activism on this issue would only intensify the spotlight on the company, these people said. Others inside Facebook made the case that it was a moral responsibility to press for more responsible gun sales laws.
Similar concerns were raised by the leadership at Google, whose YouTube unit was the site of a shooting last year. Google recently announced an internal policy that would make it hard for the company to consider signing the letter. That policy includes this line: "Our primary responsibility is to do the work we've each been hired to do, not to spend working time on debates about non-work topics."
Uber's chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, signed. His company's policy bans guns from its vehicles, either for drivers or passengers. Lyft, Uber's main rival, signed as well.
Several executives said one of the biggest practical worries was whether taking such a stance would lead to in-store confrontations with angry customers carrying guns. Would they be putting their employees in danger or even just in an uncomfortable discussion about a divisive issue?
Even banks like Citigroup and Bank of America, which both publicly distanced themselves from gunmakers this year by ending lending and banking relationships with manufacturers, declined to sign the letter. After they made their positions public this year, the banks were rebuked by Republican lawmakers. Louisiana passed a law preventing the banks from working on bond offerings for the state.
"I personally believe the policies of these banks are an infringement on the rights of Louisiana citizens," the state's treasurer, John Schroder, said at the time. "No one can convince me that keeping these two banks in this competitive process is worth giving up our rights."
For better or worse, business leaders are increasingly carving out positions on social issues. It's not new -- and the Hobby Lobby fight against the contraceptive provision of the Affordable Care Act shows us that such positioning does not confine itself to progressive causes -- but it is growing.
In some cases, those maneuvers have happened out of necessity, as when top executives could not count on a strong response from Washington after the killing of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi. That touched off a flurry of calls between some of the country's top finance executives about how to handle a conference being hosted by Saudi Arabia, whose crown prince had been implicated in Mr. Khashoggi's disappearance.
But over the last three years, businesses have become engaged on social issues like immigration, climate change and race in a way that would have been unfathomable a decade ago. On Thursday, businesses turned to the problem of gun violence.
The letter suggested that background checks on all gun sales were a "common-sense solution with overwhelming public support." A number of polls have put backing for such policies above 90 percent.
The market is demanding action -- and businesses are listening.
145 C.E.O.s signed a letter to the Senate urging it act to curb gun violence. But missing are some of America's biggest tech and financial companies, including Apple, Facebook and JPMorgan Chase.

Texto completo: Roughly six minutes into Apple's annual keynote presentation on Tuesday, I watched with grim fascination as a video game executive guided a digital frog across a bathroom floor in order to carefully avoid scraps of rogue toilet paper, while a second executive provided breathless color commentary.
"Whoa, what is that?" Executive Two whooped. "Is that a giant baby wearing sunglasses?! He's making quite a mess!" (It was a giant baby; he was being quite messy).
The tightly choreographed scene was a demo of an iPad reboot of the classic "Frogger" game, which Apple was teasing as an example of its new arcade gaming platform. It was also a tidy example of just how peculiar and out of touch the company's product unveilings have become. And why Apple needs to put an end to its 90-plus minute advertising spectacles.
The evolution of the Apple keynote is understandable. Apple is a global company that changed computing by putting little ones in all our pockets. Their new phones are big deals by virtue of the fact that they've sold more than 2.2 billion iOS devices since their debut in 2007. iPhones changed how we communicate with one another and seek information; they've addicted us, tethering us to our jobs and helping us feel both attached to and alienated from one another. So it makes sense that we pay attention when the company dreams up a new iteration. Plus, they're exceedingly shiny and the cameras can turn any point-and-click amateur taking photos of their goofy dog (me!) into Annie Leibovitz.
But what started as a Steve Jobs TED talk has become a parody -- a decadent pageant of Palo Alto executives, clothed in their finest Dad Casual, reading ad copy as lead-ins for vaguely sexual jump-cut videos of brushed aluminum under nightclub lighting. The events are exhausting love letters to consumerism complete with rounds of applause from the laptop-lit faces of the tech blogging audience when executives mention that you (yes you!) can hold the future in your hands for just $ 24.95 per month or $ 599 with trade-in.
The entire event is at odds with our current moment -- one in which inequality, economic precarity and populist frustration have infiltrated our politics and reshaped our relationships with once-adored tech companies. But it's not just the tech backlash. When the world feels increasingly volatile and fragile, it feels a little obscene to gather to worship a $ 1,000 phone. Serving journalists pastries topped with gold leaf doesn't do much to help either.
[As technology advances, will it continue to blur the lines between public and private? Sign up for Charlie Warzel's limited-run newsletter to explore what's at stake and what you can do about it.]Apple, for its part, has chosen not to read the room, and so the discordant moments accumulate. While employees at Microsoft and Amazon organize walkouts over their companies' contributions to carbon emissions, Apple executives are adding applause lines touting that the iPad's case is made of 100 percent recycled aluminum -- a fact that tech journalists rightly note "means essentially nothing." And, as Motherboard's Jason Koebler reminds us, "making a new iPhone is an incredibly destructive endeavor."
The Pleasantville cheery, sanitized tone of the keynote clashes with Apple's position as a global tech behemoth. Given the pressures of looming tariffs and trade wars, the event seemed, as the journalist Lauren Goode tweeted, "eerily calm. Like parents throwing a super chill birthday party for the kids when the marriage has gone haywire."
Likewise, there's some cognitive whiplash to this month's reports (and Apple's problematic initial response) that a major iPhone vulnerability targeted the Uighurs, the persecuted Muslim ethnic minority group, and watching Apple executives onstage days later gleefully trying to make to make slow-motion selfies -- "slofies," according to Apple branding -- a thing.
As a luxury brand, Apple's been accused of being out of touch in keynotes before. My former colleague Katie Notopoulos skewered the company in 2016 for appealing to the prototypical "40-something dad who just wants to FaceTime his adorable children while he's on a business trip, and also find a local pourover coffee shop while he's in town." She dubbed this marketing amalgam, "Apple Man," noting that the needs of this test audience often came at the expense of making the product more affordable or adding features aimed at the millions of loyal customers who don't worship at the altar of inbox zero.
To its credit, Apple has taken steps to address a good deal of this criticism. Its keynotes now feature more women and people of color, and Apple has designed many more accessibility features (some life-changing) for users with different needs.
But even more inclusive products can't fix the problem with recent Apple keynotes: The company's flagship product -- the iPhone -- no longer feels like a piece of the future dropped from into the hands of mere mortals. It feels like, well, a phone, a commodity. And so the whole thing seems gratuitous, self-serving and, most importantly, quite removed from the very fraught relationship most of us have with our phones.
That's part of why the keynotes need to end. Losing them doesn't mean that the new technology isn't impressively engineered (machine learning cameras!) or that Apple has failed. It's probably the opposite. The iPhone set out to change everything, and it did. Mr. Jobs famously pitched Apple products with the line, "It just works." He's right. It does. And we live with the effects -- the good and the very bad -- every day. There's no more need for the song and dance -- or Lewis and Clarking a digital frog across a bathroom floor.

To save a ban on gay conversion therapy, New York will repeal it

Texto completo: New York • Nearly two years ago, the New York City Council celebrated when it passed a far-reaching ban on conversion therapy, a discredited practice to change a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity.
On Thursday, Corey Johnson, the gay, HIV-positive speaker of the council, said that the council would act swiftly to repeal the ban.
The move is a gambit designed to neutralize a federal lawsuit filed against the city by a conservative Christian legal organization; if the case were to be heard by the Supreme Court, advocates for the LGBT community fear that the panel could issue a ruling that could severely damage attempts to ban or curtail conversion therapy.
This is not the first time New York City officials have sought to change a regulation to avoid a Supreme Court challenge. In July, the Police Department amended a regulation that had limited residents from transporting their guns outside their homes, after the Supreme Court had agreed to hear a case challenging the city rule.
Supporters of repealing the conversion therapy ban said that it is a regrettable but necessary step given the Supreme Court’s conservative makeup under the Trump administration.
“Obviously I didn’t want to repeal this. I don’t want to be someone who is giving in to these right-wing groups,” Johnson said in an interview. “But the Supreme Court has become conservative; the 2nd Circuit, which oversees New York, has become more conservative.”
Johnson was to introduce a bill Thursday to repeal the ban; once the full council approves the measure and Mayor Bill de Blasio signs it, the city would then be governed by a less restrictive state law, which applies only to minors.
“We think this is the most responsible, prudent course,” Johnson said.
The city’s law, passed in December 2017, was sponsored by Melissa Mark-Viverito, then the council speaker. It prohibited consumers from being charged “for services intended to change a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity,” and created a $1,000 fine for each violation.
In January, the Alliance Defending Freedom, an Arizona-based group, filed a lawsuit challenging the law on the grounds that it violated free speech, suggesting that the measure was “the first in the nation to censor speech” between counselors and adult patients.
“This law was a textbook violation of free speech and the right of individuals to pursue the lives and identities they want to exercise,” said Roger Brooks, a senior lawyer for the group, which says its mission is to defend religious freedom.
“We went in with confidence that the courts would agree with us,” he said. “This move by the city suggests that on mature consideration, they think that would be the outcome as well.”
Medical professional organizations have long denounced the practice of conversion therapy. The American Psychological Association found in a 2009 report that the practice does not work and that “individuals experienced harm” from the therapy. The therapy is also predicated on the false notion that LGBT sexual orientation is a mental disorder.
Individuals who are “distressed by their sexual orientation” said that they benefit “when offered interventions that emphasize acceptance, support and recognition of important values and concerns,” according to the report.
Eighteen states, the District of Columbia and more than 50 municipalities have passed conversion therapy bans for minors, according to the National Center for Lesbian Rights. That still has not stopped the therapy from happening.
The Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law estimates that almost 700,000 LGBT adults ages 18-59 have received conversion therapy, including 359,000 who received the therapy as adolescents.
“I’m heartened that the City Council pulled back a statute that could undermine efforts nationally to end conversion therapy because it might be viewed as overly broad,” said state Sen. Brad Hoylman, D-Manhattan and the state’s only openly gay senator. He sponsored the state law that would govern the city in the absence of a city-specific ban; it bars mental health professionals from seeking to shift the sexual orientation or gender identity of minors.
“The legal climate is less favorable at the federal level for the LGBTQ community,” he added. “We crafted the law specifically to pass a legal challenge because we knew this was an area that anti-LGBT legal forces were exploring.”
The city and state’s consumer fraud laws will still allow adults who feel duped by the therapy to seek recompense, said Shannon Minter, legal director for the National Center for Lesbian Rights.
“Now that the state has passed its law, the New York City law does not create any new rights that don’t exist. Having to defend that lawsuit is a completely unnecessary distraction,” Minter said. “We know there is relentless hostility against protecting LGBT people.”
Brooks said that Alliance Defending Freedom has not decided whether to challenge the New York state law. Similar conversion therapy bans for minors are being challenged in Maryland and Florida, but have already withstood challenges in California, the first state in the country to pass an anti-conversion law, and in New Jersey, Minter said.
“Conversion therapy is the ultimate form of rejection and the cause of many suicides among the LGBTQ community,” said Mathew Shurka, founder and strategist of Born Perfect, a group seeking to outlaw conversion therapy.
Shurka, 31, who is gay, underwent conversion therapy for five years, starting as a teenager growing up in New York City. He said his main goal is to protect others, specifically young people, from experiencing what he did.
Mark-Viverito, who is running for Congress, also endorsed the measure to kill her own legislation.
“I was very proud at the time, because we were doing something out of the box and we were aggressive,” Mark-Viverito said. “But understanding the climate we are in today, I’m not interested in putting anyone’s rights in jeopardy or weakening our power as a city.”

REPORT: JUSTIFY FAILED '18 DRUG TEST; HORSE RACING

Texto completo: The New York Times says Justify won the 2018 Triple Crown after a failed post-race drug test at a California track that could have kept the horse out of the Kentucky Derby.
The newspaper reported Wednesday that Bob Baffert- trained Justify tested positive for the drug scopolamine after winning the Santa Anita Derby, one of the final prep races for the Kentucky Derby. Justify went on to win the Derby and took the Preakness and Belmont Stakes to complete the Triple Crown.
The Times said instead of a speedy disqualification, the California Horse Racing Board took more than a month to confirm the results. The newspaper also reported that instead of filing a public complaint, the board made decisions behind closed doors as it moved to drop the case and lighten the penalty for horses found to have scopolamine in their systems.
The newspaper said test results, emails and internal memorandums show how California regulators waited nearly three weeks, until the Kentucky Derby was only nine days away, to notify Baffert of the positive test. Then, two months after the Belmont victory, the board disposed of the inquiry altogether during a closed-door executive session.

COLLEGES
Pankowski nominated for award
Nearly six months after her playing career ended at the University of Wisconsin, Annie Pankowski continues to earn accolades.
Pankowski, who captained the women's hockey team to the 2019 NCAA title, was revealed Tuesday as one of 30 finalists for the NCAA Woman of the Year award.
She also was a finalist for the Patty Kazmaier Award as Division I women's hockey's top player and for the Hockey Humanitarian Award as the college game's finest citizen.
The Laguna Hills, California, native was awarded the Big Ten Medal of Honor for athletics and scholastic achievement.
She's only the second Woman of the Year award finalist from UW. Sara Bauer, also a women's hockey standout, made the list in 2007.
"Fair pay"bill: Athletes at California colleges could hire agents and sign endorsement deals under a bill the state Legislature sent to the governor, setting up a potential confrontation with the NCAA that could jeopardize the athletic futures of powerhouse programs like USC, UCLA and Stanford.
Gov. Gavin Newsom has not said whether he will sign the bill. But the NCAA Board Of Governors is already urging him not to, warning that if he does California colleges and universities would eventually be banned from NCAA competitions because of their "unfair recruiting advantage."
"It would erase the critical distinction between college and professional athletics," the Board of Governors said in a letter to Newsom. "These outcomes are untenable and would negatively impact more than 24,000 California student-athletes across three divisions."
WIAC
Commissioner to retire next year
The Wisconsin Intercollegiate Athletic Conference announced commissioner Gary Karner will retire effective August 14, 2020, after what will be a 24-year tenure.
Dr. Karner was named commissioner in June 1996 following eight years as a member of the NCAA national office staff and will retire as the longest serving commissioner in conference history. Karner has served as an adjunct faculty member at both UW and Edgewood College and on the board of directors of the Wisconsin Sports Development Corporation and Special Olympics Wisconsin.

Texto completo: This week the New York Times reported that 2018 Triple Crown winner Justify failed a post-race drug test after the Santa Anita Derby that could have kept the colt out of the Kentucky Derby.
Horse racing needs another controversy like Dodgers fans need a third World Series disappointment, yet here we are again. Less than two weeks removed from a historic Del Mar meet in terms of safety that helped restore some sanity in California, the sport is left with yet another black eye.
Why?
Because factions like the California Horse Racing Board, the Stronach Group and others can’t seem to grasp the concept that transparency is the only way to go. Deals and decisions made behind closed doors, whether right or wrong, oftentimes blow up in the decision makers’ faces. This is one of those instances.
Here’s what we know about the Justify saga:
— The New York Times reported Justify tested positive for a drug called scopolamine one day after winning the Santa Anita Derby on April 6. The story alleges the CHRB did not inform trainer Bob Baffert of the positive test until nine days before the Kentucky Derby. A second test on May 1, at the request of Baffert, also came up positive.
— Joe Drape, who wrote the Times article, said the CHRB let the matter drag on until after Justify swept the Triple Crown. He reported the CHRB did not file a public complaint per usual protocol and instead made a series of decisions behind closed doors as it moved to drop the case in its entirety after the Belmont Stakes on June 8. Later, the CHRB amended its rules on scopolamine positives.
— On Thursday, Churchill Downs tweeted that “until media reports surfaced Wednesday night, neither Churchill Downs nor the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission had knowledge of any potential tests that may have emanated from California in advance of the 2018 Kentucky Derby.”
— Churchill Downs maintained “we do know that all pre- and post-race tests for the 2018 Kentucky Derby participants came back clean, including Justify.” The race track also noted, “in advance of our race each year, the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission conducts pre-race out-of-competition testing for every Kentucky Derby starter and all starters’ results were clean.” It added that all post-race tests for “a myriad of banned substances” were clean.
— Baffert, in a statement Thursday, claimed he had no influence on any decisions made by the CHRB, saying, “I unequivocally reject any implication that scopolamine was ever intentionally administered to Justify, or any of my horses. Test results indicating trace amounts of the drug were undoubtedly the result of environmental contamination caused by the presence of jimson weed in feed, a naturally growing substance in areas where hay and straw are produced in California.” Baffert added: “Justify is one of the finest horses I’ve had the privilege of training and by any standard is one of the greatest of all time. I am proud to stand by his record, and my own.”
— Baffert’s lawyer, Kentucky-based Craig Robertson III, called Drape’s reporting “defamatory.” He also said in a letter addressed to Drape that his article was “long on sensationalism” and “short on facts.” Robertson said: “No trainer would ever intentionally administer scopolamine to a horse. It has a depressant effect and would do anything but enhance the performance of a horse.”
— Chuck Winner, whose five-year reign as chairman of the CHRB expired recently, released this comment Thursday afternoon: “It is most unfortunate that the correct decision by the CHRB to not pursue action due to what was clearly a case of environmental contamination has been badly mischaracterized. All possible tests and procedures and investigations were followed by the CHRB Equine Medical Director and senior staff, which led to the overwhelming evidence that Justify, along with six other horses in four different barns at Santa Anita, ingested scopolamine from jimson weed which was present in the hay that had been delivered to the barns. Furthermore, under ARCI guidelines, scopolamine is a class 4c substance, which would not trigger disqualification or redistribution of a purse.”
Winner went on to say: “The whole premise of the story is false on its face … California law mandates that test results must remain confidential unless and until a complaint is filed, and a complaint can only be filed at the end of an investigative process. It would have been a complete miscarriage of justice for the CHRB to have taken action against Justify or Baffert.”
The CHRB dropped the ball here. It should have informed both Churchill Downs and the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission about Justify’s positive test. Seeing as though it normally takes 60-90 days for a drug positive to be resolved, it’s highly questionable whether Justify would have been denied a spot in the Kentucky Derby. We’ll never know.
There are so many questions left unanswered in this mess:
— What is the effect of scopolamine on a horse?
Dr. Rick Arthur, equine medical director of the CHRB, echoed Robertson’s thoughts and scoffed at the suggestion in an interview with the Thoroughbred Daily News that the drug helped Justify during his Triple Crown run.
“Jimson weed is a weed we see in California not infrequently,” he said. “This is not a case of someone drugging a horse. This is a case of a horse poisoning. The source of it is a poisonous plant.”
Arthur also defended his and CHRB executive director Rick Baedeker’s decision to put the case to rest.
“The Board, on my and the executive director’s recommendation, made the correct, appropriate and the gutsy decision to dismiss the case,” he told TDN.
But in Drape’s story, he quotes Dr. Rick Sams, who ran the drug lab for the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission from 2011 to 2018, as saying “the drug can act as a bronchodilator to clear a horse’s airway and optimize a horse’s heart rate, making the horse more efficient.” Sams added that the 300 nanograms per milliliter was excessive, and he suggested the drug was intended to enhance performance. Said Sams: “I think it has to come from intentional intervention.”
So who’s right here?
Because of horse racing’s non-transparent nature, we’ll never know what Baffert’s intentions were. We’ll never know why the CHRB acted as it did. Would Justify have been as brilliant during his historic run without scopolamine? Because of that non-transparency, Justify’s Triple Crown will forever carry a huge asterisk.
So there you have it, what should stand as one of horse racing’s shining moments now has a huge black stain on it. Telling the truth from the beginning could have avoided this mess. But then, we’re talking about horse racing.
Wonder if any owner will ever name a horse “Transparency.”

Texto completo: FOXBOROUGH, Mass. - Patriots receiver Antonio Brown practiced with the team for the first time on Wednesday, a day after his former trainer filed a civil lawsuit in Florida accusing him of sexually assaulting her on three occasions.
Before the practice session, Belichick declined to answer numerous questions about Brown, including his status for Sunday's game at Miami. He deferred to the Patriots' statement late Tuesday in which they said they were aware of the lawsuit and "take these allegations very seriously."
"Antonio and his representatives have made statements, so I'm not going to be expanding on any of those," Belichick said. "They are what they are. We've looked into the situation. We're taking it very seriously all the way through the organization. I'm sure there are questions, but I'm not going to enter into a discussion about that."
Brown has denied the allegations. Darren Heitner, a lawyer representing Brown, told The Associated Press his client plans to countersue. The NFL has declined to comment but will be opening an investigation into the matter.
Bears waive Abdullah, sign Holtz
LAKE FOREST, Ill. - The Chicago Bears have waived defensive end Abdullah Anderson and signed former Washington Redskins tight end J.P. Holtz.
Holtz, an undrafted free agent from Pittsburgh, had played 14 snaps on special teams in the Redskins' first game but did not have a reception. He was waived Tuesday.
The Bears were without tight end Trey Burton in their season-opening 10-3 loss to the Green Bay Packers because of a groin strain. Burton practiced only on a limited basis Wednesday, after practicing on a limited basis last week.
Anderson was on the Bears' practice squad last season and had been one of six defensive linemen on the 53-man roster.
Steelers champion Davis dead at 75
PITTSBURGH - Sam Davis, the guard who helped the Pittsburgh Steelers win four Super Bowls in the 1970s, has died. He was 75.
Davis was found dead Tuesday at New Life Personal Care in McKeesport southeast of Pittsburgh. Davis, who suffered from dementia and was legally blind, had been reported missing from the facility earlier in the day. There was no evidence of foul play.
Davis played 168 games with the Steelers from 1967-79, helping pave the way for Hall of Fame running back Franco Harris and protecting Hall of Fame quarterback Terry Bradshaw during Pittsburgh's run atop the NFL in the 1970s. Davis started in all four of the team's' Super Bowl victories in the 1970s.
Girlfriend of Browns player killed
CLEVELAND - The girlfriend of Browns defensive end Chris Smith was killed in a roadside accident that happened after his car spun out on the highway.
The team said Petara Cordero, died when she was struck by an oncoming car on I-90 West at around 2a.m. Wednesday. Cordero was a passenger in Smith's Lamborghini, which had a tire malfunction and he struck the median wall.
Cordero exited the vehicle and was standing on the road's shoulder when a car driven by a 47-year-old woman smashed into the passenger side of Smith's car.
Ex-NFL player Mallett arrested for DWI
SPRINGDALE, Ark. - Former University of Arkansas, University of Michigan and NFL quarterback Ryan Mallett has been arrested in northwest Arkansas on suspicion of driving while intoxicated.
Springdale police Lt. Jeff Taylor says 31-year-old Ryan Mallett was arrested Tuesday following a two-vehicle collision. Taylor did not immediately return a phone call Wednesday from The Associated Press seeking details on the crash, and police department records do not indicate whether Mallett is represented by an attorney.
Chargers' Henry placed on IR
COSTA MESA, Calif. - Los Angeles Chargers tight end Hunter Henry will be placed on injured reserve because of a knee injury.
Henry fractured the upper part of his left tibia during Sunday's 30-24 overtime win over the Indianapolis Colts. He was injured during the second half but returned to the game and played in overtime. He had four receptions for 60 yards, including a 17-yard catch in overtime.
49ers Bosa misses practice
YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio - Rookie defensive end Nick Bosa is not practicing as the San Francisco 49ers began three days of workouts at Youngstown State. The No. 2 overall pick from Ohio State missed the entire preseason with a high ankle sprain, but played 39 total snaps and had a sack Sunday in San Francisco's 31-17 win at Tampa Bay.
San Francisco is spending the week in the Mahoning Valley - instead of flying cross country from Florida - before its game on Sunday at Cincinnati.
Jets' Enunwa out for season
FLORHAM PARK, N.J. - Quincy Enunwa's season is over after his second neck injury in just over two years. The New York Jets wide receiver was hurt Sunday in the season-opening loss to Buffalo and told the team's medical staff Monday that he wasn't feeling right physically and had several tests.
HORSE RACING
Triple Crown winner reportedly failed drug test before Kentucky Derby
NEW YORK - The New York Times says Justify won the 2018 Triple Crown after a failed postrace drug test at a California track that could have kept the horse out of the Kentucky Derby.
The newspaper reported Wednesday that Bob Baffert-trained Justify tested positive for the drug scopolamine after winning the Santa Anita Derby, one of the final prep races for the Kentucky Derby. Justify went on to win the Derby and took the Preakness and Belmont stakes to complete the Triple Crown.
The Times said instead of a speedy disqualification, the California Horse Racing Board took more than a month to confirm the results. The newspaper also reported that instead of filing a public complaint, the board made decisions behind closed doors as it moved to drop the case and lighten the penalty for horses found to have scopolamine in their systems.

Looking at the campaign through Sanford’s looking glass

Resumen: The disgraced former South Carolina governor and congressman announced Sunday that he’s running against Donald Trump for the 2020 Republican nomination. The narrative-shmarrative is that Sanford is an old-school Republican whose concerns are focused on a strong, bootstrap economy and, well, that’s about it so far. Sanford’s well-reasoned concerns about the unfathomable debt, his low-key, soft-spoken style and his cool Southern manner might have made him a terrific presidential candidate in another time, especially alongside his tough, accomplished wife and central-casting sons.

Texto completo: CHARLESTON, S.C. — Once upon a time, Mark Sanford might have been a contender, but there’s too much water under the bridges that stretch from this city of steeples to his erstwhile home on Sullivan’s Island.
The disgraced former South Carolina governor and congressman announced Sunday that he’s running against Donald Trump for the 2020 Republican nomination. The third challenger to toss his hat into the wishing well of magical thinking, Sanford says he plans to talk about the skyrocketing debt, tariffs, trade and tone. Perfect. That’ll ignite the crowds and knock the grand poobah of pomp and propaganda off his game.
You can just see it: The boyish Sanford — an itinerant stranger in his own strange land — going toe to toe with the swamp-menacing Trump. It would be worth the price of a ticket. Trump’s other two GOP opponents, former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld and former Illinois Rep. Joe Walsh, may as well grab one while they last.
Nevertheless, the buzz does what buzz does. In the days following Sanford’s announcement and a series of cable-TV appearances, you’d have thought the former governor were the deus ex machina of the GOP. Recent commentary from conservatives has been dripping with so much honey you don’t know whether to build a hive or kill the drones.
The narrative-shmarrative is that Sanford is an old-school Republican whose concerns are focused on a strong, bootstrap economy and, well, that’s about it so far. Also, BIG HEADLINE, he believes in climate change and legal immigration because, what life form other than Trump’s most fervent supporters doesn’t?
Further to Sanford’s coronation as GOP savior, according to Republican strategist Liz Mair writing Monday in The New York Times, he’s a bigger threat to Trump than his co-challengers because he was never a "Never Trumper." Unlike Walsh and Weld — a strong law firm name if things go awry, as surely they will — Sanford appears to be uninterested in making the race all about Trump, even though Trump’s anti-endorsement in 2018 led to Sanford’s congressional primary defeat.
Plus, wrote Mair, Sanford is more "nuanced." Perhaps she was thinking of the subtle differences between Argentina and the Appalachian Trail, where in 2009 the then-governor Sanford told everyone through a spokesperson that he’d be hiking for a few days but instead found himself in South America with his mistress?
Mair insists that the tryst that ended Sanford’s governorship, as well as his marriage, was "the least-scandalous scandal in modern political history" because, after all, he only had an "extramarital affair because he fell in love and got engaged to the woman."
This confection would be news to South Carolinians who were appalled by his deceit and repulsed by his weepy news conference to confess his sins. Such a cavalier dismissal of a family betrayal would also be news to ex-wife Jenny Sanford, who wrote a book, "Staying True" about it.
It is absolutely true that Sanford, 59, is a time-tested conservative on budgetary matters, as my Washington Post colleague Jennifer Rubin argued under the banner headline "Mark Sanford might be the Republicans’ last chance." No one can accuse him of being a fake conservative, she wrote.
Indeed, not. As governor, Sanford was such a budget cruncher that he brought two baby pigs, one under each arm, to the statehouse to make his point about — get it? — pork.
It is quite possible that most or many Americans don’t care what Sanford did in his personal life, but the nicknamed "Luv Guv’s" philandering meanderings were public matters by virtue of two facts: The highest-ranking official of the state lied about his whereabouts and was unreachable. He simply slipped the reins of government and followed his passion, which was concerned with "issues" having nothing to do with matters of state.
It’s not the economy, it’s character. Only someone as despicable as Donald Trump could make a man like Mark Sanford palatable. Sanford’s well-reasoned concerns about the unfathomable debt, his low-key, soft-spoken style and his cool Southern manner might have made him a terrific presidential candidate in another time, especially alongside his tough, accomplished wife and central-casting sons. But that time has passed.

Texto completo: One of the greatest runs in horse racing history may have been tainted.
According to a report from The New York Times, Triple Crown-winning thoroughbred Justify failed a drug test in the weeks leading up to Kentucky Derby 144 but was still allowed to race in all three events, winning the Derby, Preakness Stakes and the Belmont Stakes en route to the crown jewel of horse racing.
The test, which was taken on April 7, 2018, after the colt won the Santa Anita Derby, in California should have triggered an automatic disqualification from the Derby under the current rules. The first notice of the positive test was sent on April 18.
The California Horse Racing Board took months to confirm the results of the test and made several decisions in secret to drop the case and soften the penalty for any horse with the substance, scopolamine, that was found to have been in Justify's system, according to the story.
Justify's trainer, Bob Baffert, was notified of the positive test on April 26, 2018, and asked, per his due process, that an independent laboratory test another sample. It was sent out on May 1, 2018, four days before the Derby, and confirmed on May 8.
The board was notified of the second positive test of scopolamine, a substance that can be used "to clear a horse's airway and optimize its heart rate" according to the report. The amount of the substance, which also can be found in jimson weed and sometimes can be ingested by horses while feeding on hay, was excessive.
The story states that reviewed documents did not reveal any evidence "of pressure or tampering by Justify's owners. Horse racing, however, is uniquely insular."
By the time the extended process concluded, Justify had won the Triple Crown.
Justify won the Derby by 2 1/2 lengths over Good Magic with a time of 2:04.20 with jockey Mike Smith aboard.

Texto completo: How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Joseph Plambeck, deputy technology editor in New York, discussed the tech he's using.
What tech tools do you use to keep on top of the nonstop flow of tech news?
If anyone has an elegant solution for this, please let me know. I rely on a mishmash of email, news apps, mobile notifications and Twitter.
First thing in the morning, I check email on my creaky iPhone to see what happened overnight in Asia and Europe and whether colleagues in those places need me to weigh in or pitch in on anything. Then I do a quick scan of the apps for our largest competitors, like The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post and Bloomberg. I don't read everything, but I look for breaking news that we need to jump on right away in my area of coverage, which means I'm looking a lot at the tech industry and politics.
There is a lot less order to the madness for the rest of the day. I rely heavily on the reporters I work with to tip me off to things happening on their beats. I have also signed up to get alerts, either by email or as pop-up notifications on my phone, from news organizations and newsmakers. And I scan many news sites.
I look at Twitter for news, too. But because I rarely feel better about life after I log on there, and because it takes a lot of effort to separate the valuable stuff from the nonsense, I try to limit my time there. I quit tweeting a long time ago. It was a great decision.
You edit reporters who are spread across the United States and also internationally, in London and elsewhere. What tech is indispensable for that?
Phone calls are amazing things. There is a lot that gets misconstrued in written messages. So when possible, especially on important breaking news, I try to touch base by phone with the reporters. I lean hard on many other bat signals, too -- emails, text messages on multiple services, Slack messages and Google chat messages. It's not hard to find me.
We're also working collaboratively more often, meaning that reporters in places as far apart as London, Washington and San Francisco sometimes write stories together. We used to turn to Google Docs in those situations, because multiple people can work in a file at the same time, no matter their location. That meant I had to move the story into our internal publishing system when the story was ready. Now our publishing system has similar collaboration, which is great.
How has the tech story changed since you have been a tech editor?
It is astonishing how much has changed in the five or so years that I've been focusing on tech. We're not only covering the biggest business story, we're covering one of the biggest stories, period. Tech has changed -- and continues to change -- just about everything.
Five years ago, I think many of us covering tech knew this was happening. The rest of the world is realizing it now as well. I think that is driving a lot of the backlash to the tech industry in Washington and beyond. People see many changes happening around them, maybe in their pocketbook, office or government. And they are wondering whether we have a grip on where this is all heading.
You edit a lot of Amazon stories and you live near a Whole Foods, which Amazon now owns. Discuss.
Well, I certainly can attest that the avocados at Whole Foods are cheaper now.
It's interesting to watch up close what is happening to the store after Amazon bought Whole Foods. I'm frankly surprised it hasn't changed a lot more. You can see Amazon bleed into the store more each month, but most of the changes are baby steps.
Next I hope Amazon takes a leap and tackles the horrible checkout lines. Whatever algorithm they use for that needs to be rewritten from scratch.
Are you a Prime member?
I am, and I like to think our family gets its money's worth. In addition to Whole Foods, where we get a discount as a Prime member, we do some shopping on Amazon.com. Our children use Amazon Music through our Echo device. And I sometimes zone out with a show on Prime Video.
It's not that we decided to be an Amazon family. It has just crept up on us.
Outside of work, what tech do you love to use?
I try to use as little as possible. Few things please me more than looking at my iPhone's Screen Time app on Sunday night and seeing that I've been on the phone for less than an hour that day. While it is rare, that has happened.
I appreciate most the technology that is years old now. Google Maps may have saved my marriage. And FaceTime and similar services blow me away. My family recently visited relatives in Florida without me, and my older son called me regularly on FaceTime, sometimes while he was in the middle of a fun outdoor activity. It was great to see his smiles in real time.
I'm really impressed with the technology going into cars, too. We have a thoroughly conventional and midpriced car, a Mazda CX-5. Yet it has some nice safety tech, like automatic emergency braking and blind spot and lane departure warnings. The adaptive cruise control, which keeps our car a set distance from the one in front of us, makes long drives a little more bearable. It also gets O.K. gas mileage. I'm glad we don't need to wait for carmakers to perfect an affordable self-driving electric car before we see some of the benefits.
What is your kids' relationship with technology?
Our boys are almost 6 and 4, and my wife and I try hard to limit their screen time. We don't always succeed. And because we have another little guy on the way, I fear we'll start losing even more often.
We do pretty well keeping them off devices and with limited TV during the week, especially when school is in session. But we are a little flexible on the weekends, and especially when we travel. They each have an Amazon Kindle Fire tablet that we pull out for long road trips and flights. And the 6-year-old loves -- loves! -- to play baseball and basketball games on an old Nintendo Wii. His younger brother isn't far behind.
Thankfully, they both enjoy real sports even more, so we turn those devices off and play in real life as much as possible. I've been nursing a sore shoulder most Mondays this summer from throwing batting practice all weekend.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: Justify won the 2018 Triple Crown after a failed postrace drug test at a California track that could have kept the horse out of the Kentucky Derby, the New York Times reported. The newspaper reported Wednesday that Bob Baffert -trained Justify tested positive for the drug scopolamine after winning the Santa Anita Derby, one of the final prep races for the Kentucky Derby. Justify went on to win the Derby and took the Preakness and Belmont Stakes to complete the Triple Crown. The Times said instead of a speedy disqualification, the California Horse Racing Board took more than a month to confirm the results. The newspaper also reported that instead of filing a public complaint, the board made decisions behind closed doors as it moved to drop the case and lighten the penalty for horses found to have scopolamine in their systems.
Soccer
Delamea ban rescinded
New England Revolution defender Antonio Delamea had his one-game suspension and accompanying fine for a red card rescinded on Wednesday. Delamea is now eligible to play in the Revolution's game Saturday against Orlando City SC as they try to clinch a playoff berth for the first time since 2015. Delamea appeared to make a clean tackle on New York City FC's Valentin Castellanos last week but was issued a red card after a video review. The Revolution launched an appeal and were confident they would win.
Golf
McIlroy voted top player
Rory McIlroy beat out Brooks Koepka for PGA Tour player of the year in a vote by the players. It was the third time McIlroy won the Jack Nicklaus Award, and the first time without having won a major. McIlroy won three times this season, including The Players Championship and the Tour Championship to capture the FedEx Cup and its $15 million prize. He also had a tour-best 14 top 10s and finished out of the top 20 only four times in the 19 tournaments he played. Koepka, who won the PGA of America's player of the year based on points, was seen as the favorite for the tour's award. He also won three times, led the FedEx Cup in the regular season, and won the money title by nearly $2 million over McIlroy. Koepka won his second straight PGA Championship, was runner-up at the Masters and the US Open, and tied for fourth in the British Open.
Basketball
Jones on All-WNBA team
Jonquel Jones of the Connecticut Sun was named to the AP All-WNBA first team along with the Washington Mystics' Elena Delle Donne , the Phoenix Mercury center Brittney Griner , Los Angeles Sparks' Chelsea Gray and Courtney Vandersloot of the Chicago Sky. No Sun made the second team. Delle Donne was named the AP WNBA player of the year. She is the first WNBA player to shoot over 50% from the field (51.5), 40% from behind the 3-point line (43%) and 90% from the foul line (97.4%). Former UConn star Napheesa Collier edged Arike Ogunbowale for rookie of the year honors. Minnesota's rookie received eight of the votes; Ogunbowale the other six. Mystics coach-general manager Mike Thibault earned coach of the year. The WNBA playoffs start Wednesday . . . Twenty-eight counterfeit NBA championship rings were seized by federal authorities at Los Angeles International Airport. US Customs and Border Protection says Wednesday that the rings were in a wooden box shipped from China with a final destination in Arizona. Investigators suspect the intent was to sell the phony rings as a collection. No arrests were immediately announced. Officials say if the rings were real, the collection could be worth more than $550,000.
Miscellany
Wild re-sign Fiala
The Minnesota Wild re-signed left wing Kevin Fiala to a two-year, $6 million contract, two days before the team's first practice of training camp. The forward was drafted by Nashville with the 11th overall pick in the first round in 2014 and was acquired by the Wild in a trade at the deadline last season . . . Wednesday night's game between the Tigers and New York Yankees in Detroit was postponed because of bad weather and rescheduled as part of a doubleheader to start at 1:10 p.m. Thursday . . . California lawmakers approved a bill to let athletes at the state's colleges and universities take money from advertisers in defiance of NCAA rules. The Senate passed the bill 39-0, a few days after it got an endorsement from LeBron James . Governor Gavin Newsom has not said whether he'll sign it. The NCAA Board of Governors sent a letter to Newsom saying the bill would eventually stop California schools from participating in NCAA competitions.
Major League Baseball shattered the record for most home runs in a season. Jonathan Villar of the Baltimore Orioles connected for the 6,106th homer. That topped the mark of 6,105 set in 2017. There are plenty more to come, too — the record was broken with 18 days left in the regular season . . .

FOOTBALL
Raiders' Abram out for season
Oakland Raiders rookie safety Johnathan Abram will be placed on injured reserve after suffering a season-ending injury to his shoulder in the season opener.
Abram was injured in the first half Monday night against the Denver Broncos. He finished the game but will undergo surgery Thursday.
"It's a big loss. No question it's a big loss," coach Jon Gruden said. "We'll hope to get John back. We'll keep him around here, let him learn the defense and we'll consider this a redshirt year for him. But he made some big plays to help us win a game and he's a big part of our future."

New York Jets wide receiver Quincy Enunwa's season is over after his second neck injury in just over two years. ... New England Patriots receiver Antonio Brown practiced with the team for the first time a day after his former trainer filed a civil lawsuit in Florida accusing him of sexually assaulting her on three occasions. Before practice, coach Bill Belichick declined to answer numerous questions about Brown, including his status for Sunday's game at Miami. ... Sam Davis, the guard who helped the Pittsburgh Steelers win four Super Bowls in the 1970s, has died. He was 75.

ETC.
Delle Donne top WNBA player
Elena Delle Donne put together a historic season in Washington and has been named the Associated Press WNBA player of the year.
Delle Donne helped the Mystics finish with the best record in the league and the top overall seed in the playoffs.
Mystics coach Mike Thibault was voted the AP coach of the year.
Napheesa Collier edged Arike Ogunbowale for rookie-of-the-year honors. Minnesota's rookie received eight of the votes; Ogunbowale the other six.
Delle Donne also headlined the AP All-WNBA team. She was joined by Brittney Griner of Phoenix, Chelsea Gray of the Sparks, Courtney Vandersloot of Chicago and Jonquel Jones of Connecticut. The second team includes Seattle's Natasha Howard, the Sparks' Nneka Ogwumike, Las Vegas' Liz Cambage, Chicago's Diamond DeShields and Phoenix's DeWanna Bonner.

Former Los Angeles Windward and UCLA star Jordin Canada scored a career-high 26 points and the defending WNBA champion Seattle Storm beat the seventh-seeded Minnesota Lynx 84-74 in a first-round, winner-take-all playoff game. With Jewell Loyd adding 22 points, the No. 6 Storm, who play at the third-seeded Sparks on Sunday in the single-elimination second round, got 48 points out of their backcourt. ... DeShields scored 25 points and the fifth-seeded Chicago Sky used a dominating second half for a 105-76 win over the eighth-seeded Phoenix Mercury in a first-round, winner-take-all WNBA playoff game. The Sky play at fourth-seeded Las Vegas on Sunday.

Rory McIlroy is the PGA Tour player of the year, and even he was a little surprised. In a vote of the players, who presumably gave as much weight to the whole season as the four biggest weeks, McIlroy won the Jack Nicklaus Award over Brooks Koepka. It was the third time McIlroy won the award, and the first time without having won a major.

A Los Angeles City Council ad hoc committee agreed to extend the deadline for negotiations with local organizers regarding key issues for the 2028 Summer Olympics.
City officials and LA 2028 have been hammering out details for a memorandum of understanding that will outline their respective responsibilities when it comes to staging the Games, which are estimated to cost $6.9 billion.
Though the talks have been extended for six more months, Council President Herb Wesson warned: "I don't want us to get behind on this issue."

The Minnesota Wild re-signed left wing Kevin Fiala to a two-year, $6-million contract. ... The Boston Bruins signed coach Bruce Cassidy to a multiyear contract extension, a reward for leading the team to the Stanley Cup Final in only his second full season on the bench. Terms of the extension were not disclosed.

Texto completo: Five guest soloists - soprano Laquita Mitchell, mezzo-soprano Melody Wilson, tenor Noah Stewart, baritone Malcom Marrieweather and bass Dashon Burton - will join the Columbus Symphony Chorus, CSO Music Director Rossen Milanov and the musicians of the Columbus Symphony for The American Festival Oct. 11-12 at 7:30 p.m. at the Ohio Theatre, 39 E. State St.
Laquita Mitchell consistently earns acclaim in eminent opera companies throughout North America and Europe. Already in her young career, she has led performances with the Los Angeles Opera, San Francisco Opera, Houston Grand Opera, Lyric Opera of Chicago, New York City Opera, Washington National Opera, and Opera Comique in Paris, among many others. In her compelling debut as Bess in "Porgy and Bess" with the San Francisco Opera, Opera News said "Soprano Laquita Mitchell, in her first outing as Bess, dazzled the SFO [San Francisco Opera] audience with her purity of tone and vivid theatrical presence."
Melody Wilson is steadily gaining recognition as a rising young artist in the U.S. and in Europe. She is a five-time recipient of the Jessye Norman Fellowship and a winner of the Gabriela Benackova Competition in Prague (2016) and the International Czech and Slovak Competition (2009). She also won second place at both the Irma M. Cooper International Voice Competition (2014) and the Annapolis Vocal Competition (2012). She received awards from the Austrian American Society of Delaware and was one of the winners of the Kennett Symphony Orchestra Voice Young Artist Competition.
Lauded for his distinctive timbre and presence, Stewart has become one of opera's most sought-after international performers. He is especially recognized for his portrayals in the romantic Italian and French repertory and is a frequent guest artist with major opera companies and concert halls around the world. Notable orchestral appearances include the Birmingham Symphony Orchestra (UK), Scottish Symphony Orchestra, Royal Philhamonic Orchestra, Manchester Philharmonic, Gulbenkian Symphony Orchestra, Boston Symphony Orchestra, John Wilson Orchestra, Ulster Orchestra, Berkeley Symphony, and San Francisco Chorale. Stewart has performed on three BBC Proms concerts, been named a BBC Music Ambassador, and made his broadcasting debut at "The Cardiff Singer of the World" on the BBC.
Malcolm Merriweather is music director of New York City's The Dessoff Choirs, known for their performances of great choral works from the pre-Baroque era through the 21st century. He is also an assistant professor, director of choral studies, and voice department coordinator at Brooklyn College of the City University of New York, artist-in-residence at Union Theological Seminary, and the artistic director of "Voices of Haiti," a 60-member children's choir in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, operated by the Andrea Bocelli Foundation. Merriweather has also been featured as a soloist with the Boston Symphony Orchestra, The Dessoff Choirs, the New York Choral Society, and Bach Vespers Choir and Orchestra at Holy Trinity Lutheran Church in New York City. He has premiered contemporary solo works by Eve Beglarian, John Liberatore, Ju Ri Seo, Douglas Fisk, and James Adler and been a fellowship recipient at the Norfolk Chamber Music Festival and at the Tanglewood Music Center.
Praised for his "nobility and rich tone," (The New York Times) and his "enormous, thrilling voice seemingly capable ... [of] raising the dead," (Wall Street Journal), bass-baritone Dashon Burton has established a worldwide career in opera, recital, and in many works with orchestra. In key elements of his repertoire - Bach's St. John and St. Matthew Passions and the B minor Mass, Mendelssohn's "Elijah," Beethoven 9, the Brahms Requiem, Handel's Messiah, and Mozart's Requiem - Dashon is a frequent guest with ensembles such as Philharmonia Baroque, the Handel and Haydn Society, and Boston Baroque; the Carmel and Bethlehem Bach Choir Festivals; and the symphony orchestras of Baltimore, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Indianapolis, Kansas City, New Jersey, Oregon, the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic, and the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra.

Kamala Harris’ criminal justice reform plan can’t be trusted

Texto completo: “I know the system from the inside out, so trust me when I say we have a problem with mass incarceration in America. Trust me when I say we have a problem with accountability. Trust me when I say we have to take the profit out of criminal justice.” These are the words of presidential candidate Kamala Harris in an interview with the New York Times on her recently-unveiled criminal justice plan. She asks voters to put their faith in her because of her experience, but it’s her experience that shows voters exactly why they should think twice about that.
Harris’s new plan begins with an introduction that attempts once more to paint the self-portrait she’s persistently pushed throughout her campaign: one of a reform-minded prosecutor who “has seen firsthand the fundamental flaws of the system.” She’s seen them alright—and personally contributed to them. As Tulsi Gabbard aptly noted in the last debate, Harris was far from a reformer during her prosecutor days. In fact, she was notoriously tough on crime.
But she’s apparently had a pretty recent change of heart.
In her new plan, Harris proposes ending the war on drugs, claiming marijuana legalization is the first step toward that. It’s an excellent proposition and fairly mainstream among the Democratic candidates, but it’s certainly not something that Harris has always stood by.
Historically, she opposed the legalization of marijuana, and as a San Francisco District Attorney, she oversaw hundreds of marijuana convictions. Although she may not have been directly involved in the convictions, she had immense power to direct her attorneys which marijuana cases to prosecute, and what punishments to pursue. Yet, despite how sorry she is for all of the lives she’s had a part in ruining during her tenure as lead prosecutor, she’s done nothing to help those particular people.
Among her plans, too, we find a proposed effort to expunge marijuana-related criminal records and create a grant program from marijuana sales tax to help those most adversely affected by the drug war. Sure, these policies are noble, but they’re not a total ceasefire in the drug war by any means. After all, this is where Harris’s plan here falls flat. Aside from legalizing marijuana, she supports reducing the sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine. That’s a change that is certainly important, but, in terms of drug reform, it’s low-hanging fruit.
Proposing pre- arrest diversion programs, legalizing safe injection sites, descheduling drugs and loosening academic study restrictions are all strong policies that would help end the drug war. But she didn’t make any of those suggestions.
As a San Francisco District Attorney, Harris opposed the use of drug courts for those charged with drug related crimes—another action which is not cohesive with ending the drug war which she now supports. Drug courts are great, because they’re set up to provide an alternative sentencing route for individuals so they can be connected with the resources and treatment they need, rather than sticking them straight into prison.
But as Reason Magazine reports, Harris complained that people “learned how to manipulate the system by simply claiming to be addicts.” She proposed barring individuals from drug court if they had ever sold any quantity of drugs in the past—even if they needed addiction help. This means prison time for low-level drug offenders who, somehow, she’s had a wild change of mind about.
That same goes for her stance of the cash bail system. Money bail disproportionately harms low- income individuals, because they can’t afford to buy their way out of pretrial incarceration the way the wealthy can. They remain in jail—sometimes for months on end—until they can find a way to post bail or until their court date comes around.
Though Harris has sponsored legislation to end cash bail, this fight may dwindle when she becomes president. She previously supported hiking the rates of cash bail, but, of course, this is the exact opposite of what she’s saying now.
Sure, Harris’s criminal justice plan has a lot of good proposals. It even calls for accountability by granting the U.S. Department of Justice explicit authority to conduct investigations into prosecutorial offices that commit misconduct.
It’s a bold policy that stands among many other needed reforms outlined found in her plan. But none of this changes the fact that she spent so many years of her life locking people up for the things she’s claiming to be dovish on now. And that’s when she wasn’t trying to become president.
Harris has been caught lying for political gain before, so what’s stopping her from doing it again—especially if it could win her the Oval Office?
For the sake of those who spent years of their lives sitting in prisons because of her terrible policies, it’s a question worth seriously considering.

Historical context is no excuse for founders’ failure on slavery -BYLN-

Resumen: Conservative reaction to The New York Times’ "1619 Project" — an attempt to tell the story of slavery and its lasting effect on American political, economic and social structures — has been both disappointing and instructive. In 1776, the year independence was declared, Presbyterian pastor Samuel Hopkins wrote "A Dialogue Concerning the Slavery of the Africans," which he dedicated to the Continental Congress. Denied the blessings of liberty, African Americans became the instruments by which the promise of liberty was broadly achieved.

Texto completo: Conservative reaction to The New York Times’ "1619 Project" — an attempt to tell the story of slavery and its lasting effect on American political, economic and social structures — has been both disappointing and instructive.
I am not referring here to thinkers (the term is employed loosely) who consciously embrace a philosophy of white supremacy. Though resurgent and repellent, they do not constitute the mainstream of conservative thinking on race.
I am thinking instead of conservative writers who argue that the 1619 Project is a prime example of leftist ideological overreach — that its (mainly African American) authors see the country entirely through the prism of its sins and intend to "delegitimize" the American experiment. In making this case, some conservatives have offered excuses — or at least mitigations — for the moral failures of the founders on matters of race.
The institution of slavery, we are assured, was historically ubiquitous. The global slave trade, we are reminded, involved not just Americans but Arabs and black Africans. Other countries, we are told, took more slaves than America, treated them worse and liberated them later. The attempt here is to defend the honor of the American experiment by denying the uniqueness of its hypocrisy on slavery. In one way or another, all these arguments ask us to consider the inadequacies of the founders within the context of their times.
But to deny the uniqueness of American guilt on slavery is also to deny the uniqueness of its aspirations. Americans are required to have ambiguous feelings about many of the country’s founders precisely because of the moral ideals the founders engraved in American life. The height of their ambitions is also the measure of their hypocrisy. It should unsettle us that the author of the Declaration of Independence built a way of life entirely dependent on human bondage.
This leads to an unavoidably complex form of patriotism. We properly venerate not the founders, but the standards they raised and often failed to meet. This is their primary achievement: They put into place an ideological structure that harshly judged their own practice and drove American democracy to achievements beyond the limits of their vision.
In the mid to late 18th century, there was plenty of compelling moral thinking on the issue of slavery.
In 1759, Quaker Anthony Benezet wrote "Observations on the Enslaving, Importing and Purchasing of Negroes," which presented eyewitness accounts of the cruelties of the slave trade. Benezet called slavery "inconsistent with the gospel of Christ, contrary to natural justice and the common feelings of humanity, and productive of infinite calamities to many thousand families, nay to many nations, and consequently offensive to God the father of all mankind."
In 1776, the year independence was declared, Presbyterian pastor Samuel Hopkins wrote "A Dialogue Concerning the Slavery of the Africans," which he dedicated to the Continental Congress. Hopkins urged his readers to "behold the sons of liberty oppressing and tyrannizing over many thousands of poor blacks who have as good a claim to liberty as themselves."
In 1778, another minister, Jacob Green, pointed out the discrediting inconsistency of a country that was dedicated to liberty and yet tolerant of slavery: "What foreign nation can believe that we who so loudly complain of Britain’s attempts to oppress and enslave us, are, at the same time, voluntarily holding multitudes of fellow creatures in abject slavery…?"
America’s founders stand accused by the best, most humane standards of their own time. When Jefferson wrote about natural rights on his mountaintop prison for black people, many of his contemporaries knew he was, on this issue, a total hypocrite.
America’s story is not one of initial purity and eventual decay. It is the story of a radical principle — the principle of human equality — introduced into a deeply unjust society. That principle was carried forward by oppressed people who understood it better than many of the nation’s founders. Denied the blessings of liberty, African Americans became the instruments by which the promise of liberty was broadly achieved. The victims of America’s moral blindness became carriers of the American ideal.
This story is not simple to tell. But it is miraculous in its own way. And it is good reason to be proud of America.

Texto completo: Patriots wide receiver Antonio Brown has been accused of rape by a former trainer.
Britney Taylor says Brown sexually assaulted her on three occasions, according to a lawsuit filed Tuesday in the Southern District of Florida.
Brown has denied the allegations. Darren Heitner, a lawyer representing Brown, says it was "a consensual personal relationship."
The New York Times first reported about the lawsuit.
Messages were left seeking comment from the Patriots and the NFL.
Brown was released by the Raiders last week after clashing with the team throughout training camp. He agreed to a contract with the Patriots on Saturday, but didn't play in the Super Bowl champions' season-opening win against the Steelers on Sunday night.
Watch it: Odell Beckham Jr.'s taking a stand against the NFL on his lavish wrist wear.
Beckham said that he intends to keep wearing his $190,000 Richard Mille watch that he had on during Sunday's season opener against the Titans. The showy wide receiver believes the league has made an issue out of his jewelry only because it's him.
A league spokesman had said there's no rule prohibiting players from wearing jewelry. However there is a policy "prohibiting hard objects."
Jets get WR Thomas: The Jets acquired wide receiver Demaryius Thomas from the Patriots for a 2021 sixth-round draft pick, according to reports.
Thomas, 31, a four-time Pro Bowler, played for Jets coach Adam Gase from 2010-14 when Gase was wide receivers coach and then offense coordinator with the Broncos.
Also, the Jets waived Kaare Vedvik two days after he missed an extra point and 45-yard field goal in a one-point loss to the Bills and signed Sam Ficken as his replacement.
And defensive tackle Nathan Shepherd was suspended six games by the league for violating its performance-enhancing drug policy.
Extra points: The Texans signed C Nick Martin to a three-year, $33 million extension through the 2022 season. ... The Buccaneers signed S Andrew Adams. Terms of the deal weren't available.

Lisa Bloom volunteered to become Aunt Lydia

Texto completo: "She Said," a new book detailing the astonishing behind-the-scenes of the New York Times's bombshell Harvey Weinstein exposé, is an instant classic of investigative journalism. If your jaw dropped at the newspaper's original allegations against the predatory movie mogul, prepare for it to hit the floor as authors Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey recount how they uncovered the story: secret meetings, harrowing phone calls, private text exchanges with A-list actresses agonizing over whether to go on the record. Ashley Judd plays the stoic warrior; Gwyneth Paltrow, the circumspect liaison who tries to help the reporters find other sources.
Throughout, Weinstein plays a cartoonishly sinister villain surrounded by cartoonishly devious enablers. No surprise there. But another, more surprising villain emerges, one whose participation in the scandal feels less like a crime than a cutting betrayal.
Six months before the Times began its investigation into Weinstein, Lisa Bloom, a civil rights attorney known for representing female assault victims and the daughter of famed feminist lawyer Gloria Allred, wedged herself in the producer's corner. Her role, she proposed in a startling private memo, would be to use her insider knowledge of victimology to attack Weinstein's victims.
Regarding Rose McGowan, an early accuser, Bloom told Weinstein, "I feel equipped to help you against the Roses of the world, because I have represented so many of them." She suggested a "counterops online campaign to push back and call her out as a pathological liar." She educated Weinstein on "reputation management," and encouraged him to stage preemptive television interviews, wherein he would invoke his deceased mother and claim that her passing had caused him to "evolve" on women's issues.
What possible motive could Lisa Bloom have had for undermining the values she had publicly championed for so many years?
The last paragraph of her memo gave up the game: "Would you please connect me with David Boies so I can get retained?"
Bloom's initial payment for assisting the man who would become the reviled symbol for the unchecked abuse of power was $50,000.
I read "She Said" the day after I read "The Testaments," Margaret Atwood's rabidly anticipated sequel to "The Handmaid's Tale." Both were officially released Tuesday but otherwise share little in common. And yet . . .
"The Testaments" is told from the perspective of multiple "Aunts" - cattle-prod-wielding enforcers tasked with keeping the female population of Gilead under control. In "The Handmaid's Tale," the narration was provided by a woman forced into sexual servitude, who presented the Aunts as religious fanatics committed to a patriarchal theocracy as the path to salvation.
But in "The Testaments," the Aunts' motivation is more complex. Before the revolution that brought Gilead to power, one character had previously been employed as a judge and an advocate for women. Her opposition to the new regime lasts only a few weeks into her own mistreatment, at which point she's approached by an official with a job proposal: She can use her prior feminist experience to help manipulate women in the new world order.
Doing so means jettisoning everything she's ever fought for, but it comes with a heck of a benefits package: power, security and becoming one of the few women still legally allowed to read.
Is Gilead awful? Yes. Is it easier for Aunt Lydia to navigate her new life from a position of relative power within the awfulness? You bet.
A surprising percentage of my inbox is consumed by readers who want to debate sexist systems by pointing out the women working within those systems. How could Alabama's restrictive abortion legislation be anti-woman when it was signed into law by a female governor? How could President Trump's administration have a problem with women when he had hired Kellyanne Conway and Sarah Sanders into such prominent positions?
Sanders obliquely made this point in a recent interview. "What I always find interesting is 99 percent of the people who come over to say something negative, and to attack you, are women," she told Fox News. "And I find that very startling from a group of people that claim to be the champions of women empowerment."
Her argument seemed to be that she, personally, was a woman, and she, personally, was empowered, and thus, jeez , leave her alone.
I get exhausted by discussions focused on bad men and good women. Or by the argument that a certain cause must be pro-woman because some women are supporting it. There were female anti-suffrage activists, after all - many of them wealthy white society matrons who feared that winning the vote for all women would water down the unofficial power they'd scraped together for themselves.
Was pre-19th Amendment America an oppressive time for most women? Yes. Was the arrangement still pretty okay for some women, who wanted to make sure they stayed on top? You bet.
It's not anti-woman to criticize individual women whose work makes life worse for the majority of women.
The most horrible thing about Lisa Bloom's memo to Harvey Weinstein wasn't the advice it offered. An experienced male crisis manager could have come up with a similarly odious battle plan.
The most horrible thing was the life experience she brought to writing it. She knew, intimately, how women were treated in the court system and the public eye. She knew how accusers can be portrayed as crazy - "increasingly unglued," was the phrase she used when detailing how they would frame Rose McGowan for the general public. Lisa Bloom knew everything that would happen to Weinstein's victims if they executed her plan, and she wrote that memo anyway.
She has since apologized, calling her involvement a "colossal mistake." She has vowed to make her law practice 100 percent victim-focused. She sounds truly sorry.
But while I was reading "She Said," I couldn't stop marveling over how much Bloom seemed to relish her role as Harvey Weinstein's adviser. How heady all that power must have seemed. "As a women's rights advocate, I have been blunt with Harvey and he has listened to me," she proposed as one public statement. In the next sentence, she mentioned a movie project Weinstein was going to help her get made.
It's funny how some women talk about "women's rights," when what they really mean is, "me."

Looks like CNN has botched another major Russia 'scoop'

Texto completo: It looks like CNN has bungled another Russia scoop. Shocking, I know.
The network claimed Monday that the U.S. government “extracted [a] top spy from inside Russia in 2017,” a decision that CNN alleges was driven “in part, by concerns that President Donald Trump and his administration repeatedly mishandled classified intelligence and could contribute to exposing the covert source as a spy.”
CNN's reporting stresses the extraction took place in 2017 shortly after the president “discussed highly classified intelligence with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and then-Russian Ambassador to the U.S. Sergey Kislyak. The intelligence, concerning ISIS in Syria, had been provided by Israel.” The network alleges further that "the removal happened at a time of wide concern in the intelligence community about mishandling of intelligence by Trump and his administration.”
The implication is clear: Because of incidents like his 2017 meeting with Lavrov and Kislyak, Trump compromised a high-level CIA asset, costing the American intelligence community an invaluable informant embedded deep within the Russian government. That is certainly the takeaway CNN’s readers got from Monday's report, which was authored by chief national security correspondent and former Obama administration official Jim Sciutto.
However, follow-up reporting from the New York Times and the Washington Post suggests the cable network both omitted and botched key, thesis-altering details in its original scoop. Namely, the Times alleges the CIA's efforts to extract the informant date back to 2016, before Trump was even sworn in as president. The Times claims also that the American press, not the Trump administration, was responsible for compromising the informant's cover.
The Times reports:
As American officials began to realize that Russia was trying to sabotage the 2016 presidential election, the informant became one of the C.I.A.’s most important — and highly protected — assets. But when intelligence officials revealed the severity of Russia’s election interference with unusual detail later that year, the news media picked up on details about the C.I.A.’s Kremlin sources. C.I.A. officials worried about safety made the arduous decision in late 2016 to offer to extract the source from Russia. The situation grew more tense when the informant at first refused, citing family concerns — prompting consternation at C.I.A. headquarters and sowing doubts among some American counterintelligence officials about the informant’s trustworthiness. But the C.I.A. pressed again months later after more media inquiries. This time, the informant agreed.
The Washington Post flatly contradicts CNN’s story, stating that Trump’s 2017 disclosure of classified information to Lavrov and Kislyak “was not the reason for the decision to remove the CIA asset.” It never made sense anyway that a high-level, covert source in Russia would have been compromised by intelligence gathered by Israeli officials. The Times similarly contradicts CNN's characterization of events, reporting that, "former intelligence officials said there was no public evidence that Mr. Trump directly endangered the source, and other current American officials insisted that media scrutiny of the agency’s sources alone was the impetus for the extraction.
We are a long way off now from CNN’s original framing of the story, which suggested the Trump administration’s mishandling of classified information in 2017 prompted the hasty and deadly necessary extraction of a key Russian informant.
Sciutto, for his part, is standing by his story.
“Given NYT has now made details on Russian spy public, I can now report additional info we had withheld. Asset had direct access to Vladimir Putin, including the remarkable ability to take photos of presidential documents, and had served U.S. for more than a decade,” he tweeted Monday evening.
He added, “Asset had risen to the highest levels of Russia’s national security infrastructure. U.S. offered extraction months earlier during Obama administration, but asset refused. Asset’s information was crucial to [intelligence community’s] assessment that Putin had directed election interference to favor Trump.”
Curiously enough, neither the original nor the updated version of Sciutto’s article makes any mention of the CIA reportedly offering to extract the Russian asset in 2016, during the Obama administration.
What readers are left with is this: two reports from two competing newsrooms throwing cold water on what appears to be a very misleading CNN scoop. Basically, choose whom you want to believe. But considering the national press’ unflattering track record of covering Russia in the Trump era, it is also possible that everyone is wrong. Hell, the supposed asset may not even be real. Fool me once, and all that.

Embarassing: Newsrooms all ran with junk study purportedly showing Trump rallies cause hate crimes

Texto completo: Several major newsrooms owe their readers a retraction.
Media outlets fell over each other this year to promote a study purportedly showing that counties that hosted Trump 2016 campaign rallies later experienced a 226% increase in hate crimes.
The study has been thoroughly debunked this week, leaving several news organizations with egg on their face. As it turns out, uncritically parroting the findings of an unpublished study that conforms perfectly to specific political biases is apparently a dangerous gamble for ostensibly serious news organizations.
“Assaults Increased When Cities Hosted Trump Rallies, Study Finds,” the New York Times reported on March 16.
A March 22 Washington Post analysis article written by the study's authors claimed in its headline, “Counties that hosted a 2016 Trump rally saw a 226 percent increase in hate crimes.”
Later, after a gunman on Aug. 3 murdered 22 people in El Paso, Texas, some newsrooms sought to blame the mass casualty event on the president, citing specifically the hate crime study.
“Why Trump can't lead the war against white supremacy,” read the headline to a CNN article that cited the Post’s March 22 report.
A few days later, on Aug. 7, the Associated Press published a story titled, “Trump words linked to more hate crime? Some experts think so.” Like every other story mentioned in the above, it claimed a study had found that “counties that hosted a 2016 Trump campaign rally saw a 226% increase in reported hate incidents over comparable counties that did not host such a rally.”
The only problem with these reports is that the cited study is trash. That's the finding of an article published this week by Reason magazine.
“Using the same data and statistical procedures … we replicated their study's headline result,” write contributing authors and Harvard University Ph.D. candidates Matthew Lilley and Brian Wheaton. “Since we did not have access to the original paper's data and code, this involved collecting each of the variables mentioned in the original paper, and then independently performing the same analysis. Wherever possible, we copied the decisions that are mentioned in the original paper. Our headline results were very close to those reported in the original paper.”
They add, “Using additional data we collected, we also analyzed the effect of Hillary Clinton's campaign rallies using the identical statistical framework. The ostensible finding: Clinton rallies contribute to an even greater increase in hate incidents than Trump rallies.”
This raises the obvious question: If Trump’s rhetoric and style caused a spike in hate crimes in counties that hosted his rallies, as the original study would have us believe, then what explains Lilley and Wheaton's findings that Clinton rallies created an even greater spike in hate incidents? Are we to believe the former secretary of state was even more incendiary than the Queens businessman? Certainly not. As it turns out, you do not need to answer the question. Wheaton and Lilley kept digging into the data. If you can believe it, it actually gets worse for the original study’s authors.
Lilley and Wheaton write:
Both of these results rely on comparing counties with rallies to other counties without them. This produces a glaring problem. Politicians tend to hold political rallies near where large numbers of people live. And in places with more people, the raw number of crimes is generally mechanically higher. Simply put, no one should be surprised that Orange County, California (population 3.19 million) was home to both more reported hate incidents (5) and Trump rallies (2) than Orange County, Indiana (population 19,840, which had zero of each).
In even plainer terms, the supposed effects of Trump and Clinton's rallies go to basically zero when you account for county population, political scientist and FiveThirtyEight contributor Matt Grossman helpfully notes.
Lilley and Wheaton conclude:
Nor is it sensible to interpret that one of these differences (hate crimes) is caused by the other (political rallies). Indeed, adding a simple statistical control for county population to the original analysis causes the estimated effect of Trump rallies on reported hate incidents to become statistically indistinguishable from zero.
The hate crime study is flat wrong, as even the most basic scrutiny shows. Yet the nation’s largest and most powerful newsrooms ran with its supposed conclusions anyway. The least they can do now is retract their flawed stories. But I am not going to hold my breath.

Texto completo: BOSTON —
New England Patriots wide receiver Antonio Brown has been accused of three separate incidents of sexual assault and rape, according to a lawsuit obtained by WFXT.
The lawsuit filed Tuesday in Florida accuses Brown of raping his former trainer Britney Taylor in three separate incidents, two in June 2017 and another in May 2018.
According to the lawsuit, Brown "sexually assaulted Ms. Taylor twice while they were together for training sessions. First, Brown exposed himself and kissed Ms. Taylor without her consent."
The lawsuit goes on to say "Later that month, Brown, while positioned behind Ms. Taylor, began masturbating near her without her knowledge and ejaculated on her back." The suit says Brown allegedly bragged about the incident in "astonishingly profane and angry text messages."
Taylor then cut off her working relationship with Brown, the lawsuit states, but began speaking with him again months later after he contacted her to apologize.
Then on May 20, 2018, according to the lawsuit, Brown forced Taylor onto a bed, pushed her face into the mattress and forcibly raped her. She tried to resist him, shouting "no" and "stop" but he allegedly refused.
A statement for Brown released Tuesday says he "denies each and every allegation in the lawsuit. He will pursue all legal remedies to not only clear his name, but to also protect other professional athletes against false accusations."

In a statement to the New York Times, Taylor says "As a rape victim of Antonio Brown, deciding to speak out has been an incredibly difficult decision. I have found strength in my faith, my family, and from the accounts of other survivors of sexual assault.”
In the statement, Taylor said she would cooperate with the N.F.L. in an investigation.
Brown became a Patriot on Monday after being released by the Oakland Raiders.

Texto completo: Political tribalism keeps getting worse. The demand for unthinking and uncompromising loyalty keeps getting louder. Individuals or institutions that try to maintain a sense of fairness and balance, that don’t want to choose sides in our Uncivil War, are branded as weak-kneed, fainthearted heretics. Two recent events highlight this dangerous development. First, Fox News was excoriated by President Donald Trump for daring to interview a Democratic Party official. And second, The New York Times was lambasted by liberal critics for a headline that was not, in their view, sufficiently critical of the president’s racist rants.
The parallels, of course, are imprecise. Trump has been eviscerating the press as a campaign strategy for years. But the similarities are still striking.
The president and his leftist critics share an instinct for intolerance: a deep disdain for anyone who strays from the party line, a demand for purity combined with a towering self-righteousness. You have to be on the Red Team or the Blue Team, a Loyalist or a Resister. Both sides fundamentally misunderstand the role of impartial and independent journalists. We belong to no tribe, root for no team. And if that sounds musty and old-fashioned, well, so does the Constitution, which not only protects a free press but defines it as essential to a healthy democracy.
Over on the left, the latest brouhaha was trigged by a Times headline over a story about a Trump speech that read, "Trump Urges Unity vs. Racism." The words were technically accurate, but not nuanced or skeptical enough, and Times editors acknowledged the problem and changed it after the first edition. But that was not nearly enough to quell the bombastic blowback.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted that the headline served as "a reminder of how white supremacy is aided by — and often relies upon — the cowardice of mainstream institutions."
Dan Pfeiffer, a senior adviser to President Obama, told Politico: "A vast swath of Democratic voters are pretty angry at the media. They see a racist liar in the White House, and a media too afraid to call him a racist or a liar."
At a meeting of New York Times staffers, one told editor Dean Baquet that the paper was "actively misleading" readers by being too soft on Trump. But Baquet, hit back. "Our readers and some of our staff cheer us when we take on Donald Trump, but they jeer at us when we take on Joe Biden," he told the staff meeting. "They sometimes want us to pretend that he was not elected president, but he was elected president. And our job is to figure out why, and how, and to hold the administration to account. If you’re independent, that’s what you do."
Baquet told CNN that there is a "generational divide" in the newsroom, and the meeting made clear there’s a racial one as well, with reporters of color among the loudest critics of their own bosses. But Baquet — the first African American editor of the Times — is determined to resist their pressure. "Our role is not to be the leader of the resistance," he insists.
We believe deeply in the traditions that Cavuto and Baquet are defending. No news organization is perfect, but at their best, they don’t work for the right or the left — for Trump or his rivals, for the Reds or the Blues. They are not Loyalists or Resisters.
They are simply journalists — fact-finders, truth-tellers — and more valuable than ever.

Texto completo: Travel and exploration website Atlas Obscura has built its brand by shining a light on little-known things. Now, the company is looking to up that wattage with a major investment from home-sharing juggernaut Airbnb Inc.
Airbnb is leading a $20 million Series B funding round into the Brooklyn-based media and experiences company. Atlas Obscura said it plans to use the money to vastly expand its trips and local experience offerings, which the company says make up more than half its business.
As part of the deal, Airbnb will offer users the ability to book Atlas Obscura trips and events through Airbnb's site and mobile app, alongside its traditional accommodation offering, for which Airbnb will take a cut.
"The main purpose of the investment is really to take advantage of the popularity of our trips and local experiences and partner with Airbnb to really expand that business and tap into their global audience," said David Plotz, Atlas Obscura's chief executive.
Airbnb has been rapidly expanding its experience offerings, from 500 in 12 cities in 2016 to 40,000 in more than 1,000 cities today, the company said.
"As we grow, it's important that we maintain unique, high quality supply," Airbnb said. "With Atlas Obscura specializing in unusual and obscure travel destinations, this relationship continues to build on our intention to offer something more authentic and less mass-produced."
Neither company would disclose Atlas Obscura's valuation nor would they say how much Airbnb was investing. Airbnb is being joined in the round by previous investors, A+E Networks and venture-capital firm New Atlantic Ventures.
Atlas Obscura has raised $12 million previously in three rounds, most recently $7.5 million in a round led by A+E in 2017. Other investors include New York Times Co., New Atlantic Ventures, former DoubleClick Chief Executive Kevin Ryan, Business Insider co-founder Henry Blodget and Bustle Digital Group founder Bryan Goldberg.
The site launched in 2009, built around a mix of stories about odd corners of the globe and user-generated listings of curious places and events, such as "26 of the World's Most Astounding Abandoned Resorts," or "17 Places to Hunt for Aliens Besides Area 51."
Initially its business model relied primarily on advertising and sponsored content. The company has published two books, with a third one, "Gastro Obscura," due next year.
The site drew 4.3 million unique visitors in July, up 17% from a year earlier, according to Comscore Inc.
In recent years, the company began developing highly specialized events around the arcane subjects of some of its stories. Offerings include lessons in octopus taxidermy in Los Angeles for $200 or an afternoon of pinball wizardry in College Park, Md., for $8. It now hosts approximately 500 such events a year in seven cities in the U.S. With the investment, Atlas Obscura plans to expand to offering hundreds of events a month in dozens of cities in the U.S. and abroad.
In 2016, the site added more involved trips including travel and hotel bookings to its menu, starting with three that year and expanding to 80 this year, the company said. Journeys include trips to the Amazon, the Florida Everglades and Uganda.
"What we have is a very powerful brand that is not dependent on the traditional lines of revenue that digital media has depended on," Mr. Plotz said. "Because of our deep connection with our community, we are trusted to be a travel partner and there are all these opportunities and people are hungry for them."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The White House delayed a package of military assistance to the new government in Ukraine, and has yet to schedule a White House meeting for its new president. After abruptly pulling the previous American ambassador out of Kiev when conservatives questioned her political loyalty, President Trump has yet to nominate a successor.
Behind the scenes, Mr. Trump has told aides that he sees Ukraine as corrupt and suggested that he harbored a grudge from what he saw as that nation's support for Hillary Clinton in 2016.
At a time when foreign policy experts and Mr. Trump's aides say strong support from the United States is especially important to Ukraine in its effort to fight corruption and stop further encroachment by Russia, Mr. Trump has left Ukrainians and some of his own allies uncertain about the degree of his commitment to the government of the newly elected president, Volodymyr Zelensky, according to interviews with people in both countries.
The diplomatic strains come on top of concerns about efforts by Mr. Trump's personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, to press Mr. Zelensky's government to pursue investigations into two matters that date from the previous government and could be politically beneficial to Mr. Trump.
One relates to involvement in Ukraine by former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his family. The other relates to accusations that Ukrainian government officials improperly aided Mrs. Clinton by seeking to sabotage Mr. Trump's 2016 campaign.
On Monday, three House committees announced that they were opening a wide-ranging investigation into whether Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani were misappropriating the American foreign policy apparatus for political ends.
In letters to the State Department and the White House, the chairmen of the House Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight Committees asserted that it would be "a staggering abuse of power, a boon to Moscow and a betrayal of the public trust" if Mr. Trump was withholding the military assistance to "improperly pressure the Ukrainian government to assist the president's bid for re-election."
Across Washington's foreign policy community, there is broad optimism that Mr. Zelensky's government has a chance to finally put an end to twin scourges that have plagued Ukraine, a close American ally -- corruption from inside and Russian incursions from the east.
Publicly, Mr. Trump's administration has suggested that the hiccups in Ukrainian relations are more related to bureaucracy and logistics than to politics.
In private, though, the president has been more adversarial, declaring in May that all Ukrainian politicians are "corrupt," and that the Ukrainian government "tried to take me down," according to people familiar with an Oval Office briefing delivered by a United States government delegation that had recently returned from attending Mr. Zelensky's inauguration in Kiev. The delegation had been impressed by Mr. Zelensky, and had encouraged Mr. Trump to assist the new government.
The White House did not respond to questions about the meeting.
Vice President Mike Pence denied last week that the delay in releasing military assistance was in any way related to Mr. Giuliani's efforts to convince the Ukrainians to investigate matters related to the family of Mr. Biden, who is the early front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination.
But, after a meeting with Mr. Zelensky on the sidelines of a commemoration of the outbreak of World War II, Mr. Pence said he and Mr. Trump "have great concerns about issues of corruption." Without detailing those concerns, Mr. Pence linked them to the military assistance, telling reporters "to invest additional taxpayer in Ukraine, the president wants to be assured that those resources are truly making their way to the kind of investments that will contribute to security and stability in Ukraine."
Mr. Zelensky's office did not immediately respond to questions emailed after business hours in Kiev.
But Senator Christopher S. Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat who serves on the Foreign Relations Committee and met with Mr. Zelensky last week, said the Ukrainian president, a political neophyte who had been a comedian before winning the presidency, seemed confused about why the assistance was being withheld.
"The first question President Zelensky asked us was whether we knew anything about the security aid," Mr. Murphy said. "There seems to be very little understanding from anyone in the government as to why the aid has been withheld or what they need to do in order to get it released."
Mr. Murphy said he urged Mr. Zelensky not to heed the requests from Mr. Giuliani, warning that to do so could threaten bipartisan support for Ukraine in Washington, which Mr. Murphy called Ukraine's "most important asset."
It would be "disastrous for long-term U.S.-Ukraine relations," Mr. Murphy said, if Mr. Zelensky were seen as basing prosecutorial decisions on pressure from Mr. Trump's political allies.
Mr. Murphy rejected the suggestion that his advice to Mr. Zelensky constituted meddling in Ukrainian affairs similar to Mr. Giuliani's efforts, which he had previously called "private foreign policy engagement" and into which he had sought an investigation.
"If there are investigations that influence American politics one way or another, but the foundations of those investigations are based upon facts rather than political requests, I think that's legitimate," Mr. Murphy said.
Mr. Giuliani on Monday welcomed the congressional investigation, asserting that he was acting "at the request of the State Department and with the assistance of the State Department" -- a reference to communications with an aide to Mr. Zelensky that were brokered partly by Kurt D. Volker, the United States envoy to settlement talks in Ukraine's war with Russia.
The Ukrainian aide, Andriy Yermak, a close ally of Mr. Zelensky, has said that it was not clear to him whether Mr. Giuliani was representing Mr. Trump in their talks.
But Mr. Giuliani said he was acting only as Mr. Trump's private lawyer in those talks, during which he urged Mr. Yermak to pursue investigations.
"If I didn't do it, I wouldn't be a good lawyer, I wouldn't be defending him," Mr. Giuliani said. "The Ukrainian government is uniquely situated to dig up facts that would vindicate my client."
Mr. Giuliani has requested an inquiry into documents released during the 2016 campaign reflecting payments earmarked to Paul Manafort for earlier work in Ukraine. Mr. Manafort went on to become Mr. Trump's campaign chairman, but when The New York Times published a report including excerpts from the documents, it led to Mr. Manafort's resignation from the campaign. He has since pleaded guilty to charges brought by the special counsel related to his work in Ukraine, and is serving a seven-and-a-half-year prison sentence.
Mr. Giuliani has questioned the authenticity of the documents, and suggested that an investigation into them could undermine the special counsel's investigation. He has also called for an investigation into the overlap between Mr. Biden's diplomacy in Ukraine and his son's involvement in a gas company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch.
Mr. Trump has suggested that he would like Attorney General William P. Barr to look into both matters.
In their letters to the White House and the State Department, the chairmen of the three House committees sought records related to the Biden and Manafort matters, and warned against linking the military assistance to the push for investigations of the matters.
Representative Adam B. Schiff, a California Democrat who is the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, said in a statement that "whether or not this improper pressure is made explicitly, it cannot be lost on a country desperate for American military assistance that the president of the United States wants its government's help in his re-election campaign in the form of damaging information on his political opponent."

Federal election vacancies are a cause for concern

Texto completo: The United States is headed into what promises to be among the most contentious and expensive campaign cycles in modern history — with foreign and domestic actors eager to make mischief — without the chief elections cop on the beat.
Sure, presidents are busy people, but in the interest of safeguarding democracy, President Trump needs to move a neglected item toward the top of his to-do list: put forward nominees to fill the vacancies at the Federal Election Commission — and push the Senate to confirm them.
The vice chairman of the FEC, Matthew Petersen, announced he was stepping down as of Saturday. Along with two pre-existing vacancies, this will shrink what should be a six-member board to three members — one short of the quorum required to hold meetings and perform many basic functions.
The agency’s chairwoman, Ellen Weintraub, offered assurances that her team “will still be able to shine a strong spotlight on the finances of the 2020 campaign.” Staff members will continue to post campaigns’ disclosure forms, accept complaints and fulfill other administrative duties.
But, without four commissioners, the agency’s regulation and enforcement of campaign finance laws — already badly compromised — will largely grind to a halt. The board will no longer have the ability to open new investigations. It will not be able to rule on whether laws have been broken, much less what penalties to impose. It will not be able to adopt new safeguards, such as to improve the transparency of online political advertising. Somewhere in Russia, the trolls responsible for the social-media chicanery of 2016 are smiling.
The harsh truth is that the commission has been a model of dysfunction for over a decade. Among the problems: Squabbling between Republican and Democratic commissioners increasingly results in gridlock over enforcing laws; funding has long been stagnant; and poor staff morale has created a critical “brain drain.” The Center for Public Integrity has described the agency as “rotting from the inside out.”
That is an argument for reforming this vital agency, not letting it die.
Even in its denuded state, the F.E.C. could occasionally get the job done. This spring, it levied fines totaling $940,000 in a case involving a Chinese-owned corporation that had illegally funneled $1.3 million through an American subsidiary into a political action committee supporting Jeb Bush’s 2016 presidential candidacy. The action not only held the involved parties accountable, it also sent a message that “there are rules, and they will be enforced,” said Trevor Potter, a former commission chairman and the president of the Campaign Legal Center, the watchdog group that filed the complaint.
The president should never have let the situation reach this point. One Democratic seat has been vacant since 2017, a Republican seat since 2018. Mr. Trump has named only one nominee, Trey Trainor — a Republican whose nomination in September 2017 has been effectively ignored by the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell. It’s unsurprising that keeping the election panel well staffed is not among Mr. McConnell’s priorities. His antipathy toward campaign-finance regulation is legendary. To kick-start this process, Mr. Trump will need to apply a bit of pressure — and he will need to work with Senate Democrats and submit more than one nomination.
Why? The way commissioners typically get confirmed is for the president, in consultation with congressional leaders, to refer nominees in pairs, one from each party. This reduces the incentive for either team to stonewall. Mr. Trump’s sending up a lone name was considered posturing, and no one seriously expected Mr. McConnell to act. The White House must huddle with lawmakers to find nominees whom everyone can live with, and the confirmations need to be fast-tracked.
The president could submit up to six nominations. On top of the vacancies, the terms of the three remaining commissioners have expired, though the members can stay on until their successors are confirmed. But at the very least the vacancies should be filled so that America’s elections monitor can get back to work.
As Mr. Potter warned, “Non-action here is an invitation to more foreign interference in elections.”

Texto completo: I’m still stuck on Sharpie-gate. Sorry. But, so is Donald Trump.
On Sunday, Sept. 1, as Hurricane Dorian approached, Trump tweeted:
“In addition to Florida — South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama, will most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated.”
He repeated the erroneous assertion during a FEMA briefing that day, saying: “And, I will say, the states — and it may get a little piece of a great place: It’s called Alabama. And Alabama could even be in for at least some very strong winds and something more than that, it could be.”
The problem: Alabama as a target had been eliminated days earlier as scientists refined their models and projections with more up-to-date information.
The president had either made an honest mistake (that happens) or he hadn’t kept track of more current briefings (that shouldn’t happen) or both. But, whatever the case, it was easy to fix by simply admitting the error.
Admitting error isn’t the Trumpian way. In Trump’s word view, admitting fault, no matter how small, exposes a frailty. In all things, one must deny, deny, deny, and do so strongly.
But correcting the error was not beyond the National Weather Service’s Birmingham, Alabama, office, indeed it was their duty. They tweeted that day: “Alabama will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian. We repeat, no impacts from Hurricane #Dorian will be felt across Alabama. The system will remain too far east. #alwx”
This was prudent. People make very real decisions about how to keep families safe, whether to keep businesses open and whether to keep government agencies running, based on storm predictions. Trump’s error, in the abstract, could have been small, but failure to correct it could have had far-reaching implications, costly ones and possibly even deadly ones.
This set up a familiar fight for Trump: Him, his ego and his fallacies on one side, and truth, science and proper processes on the other.
Trump doesn’t see the truth as rigid, absolute and unassailable. For Trump, truth is like Play-Doh: You can shape it however you want, squash it, or ignore it all together. It is a thing to be toyed with.
So, he sought to reshape it, turning what may well have been an honest mistake into an absolute lie. He sought to make his Alabama hurricane predictions real.
In a bit of farcical head-scratchery, he presented a map in the Oval Office, on which the track of the hurricane had been altered to include Alabama. It appeared that the additional line had been drawn on the map with a Sharpie.
In another stunning development, not only did the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration contradict the Birmingham office and support Trump’s erroneous claim, on Saturday The Washington Post reported that “a top NOAA official warned its staff against contradicting the president.”
The mutilated map, for me, was just too much. I had a deep, visceral reaction to the map, one born of a career worth of experience. Before I was a writer, I was in charge of the graphics department at The New York Times, and I was the art director of National Geographic magazine.
Both roles put me in charge of each institution’s cartography divisions, the one at the Times being one of the most important mapping units in all of journalism, and the one at National Geographic being one of the most important in the world.
Not being a trained cartographer myself, I learned quite a bit from those who were. Perhaps most importantly was how seriously they took their craft. There was a near-religious devotion to its accuracy and precision.
Because of this unyielding commitment to accuracy, I believe cartography enjoys an enviable position of credibility and confidence among the people who see it. If you see it mapped, you believe.
That is precisely what you want the case to be, particularly in natural disasters. This cartography should be devoid of any attempt to deceive. Its only agenda should be to inform and enlighten.
That’s what made Trump’s marked-on map such a blasphemy: It attacked, on a fundamental level, truth, science and public trust. It wasn’t just a defacement of a public document, it was a defilement of a sacred trust.
Also, if you’re going to alter the map, is it too much to ask you to show some effort? But, I guess slapdash and tacky is the brand. I rescind the question.
The next time river waters rise, or wildfires rage, or hurricanes menace, will there be a kernel of doubt in some people’s heads, a seed sown by the president himself?
This is what becomes of a society governed by a man who has no regard for truth: The truth doesn’t survive without injury. And what price society will pay for conservatives watching in snide amusement as common truth is decimated is yet to be known.
They are too busy reveling in the fact that liberals find Trump’s behavior maddening, a fact that they find titillating.
This should be partisan. Maps shouldn’t be made to lie, not even for a president.

Texto completo: Tom Steyer, the billionaire and former hedge fund investor turned impeachment activist, became the 11th Democratic presidential candidate to qualify for the October debates on Sunday after a new poll showed him with 2 percent support in Nevada.
To make the cut, candidates must procure donations from 130,000 people and earn 2 percent support in four qualifying polls. Mr. Steyer fell one poll short of qualifying for the third Democratic debate in Houston this week. But the Democratic National Committee's rules allow polls to carry over and count toward qualification for the fourth set of debates.
With three qualifying polls already under his belt and the fourth published Sunday, Mr. Steyer has now secured a spot in the debates next month, scheduled for Oct. 15 and possibly Oct. 16, in a location to be announced in Ohio.
"We are thrilled that Tom will be able to share his vision -- of how together we can fix our broken political system -- with the American public," his campaign manager, Heather Hargreaves, said in a statement on Sunday.
[Who's in? Who's out? Keep up with the 2020 field with our candidate tracker .]
Only 10 candidates earned enough support to appear in this week's debate, and they will all appear on a single stage on Thursday night. But with 11 candidates now qualified for the October event, the D.N.C. may split that debate across two nights, as it did for the first two sets of debates in June and July. The committee has not yet indicated whether it will do so.
Mr. Steyer opened his campaign two months ago and has since spent millions of dollars on internet and television ads that have helped him attract donors and make a dent in the polls relatively quickly, though some of his rivals have accused him of buying his way into the race.
The new poll that propelled Mr. Steyer into the October debate was one of several surveys of key early voting states released by CBS and YouGov on Sunday morning. The poll of 624 registered Democrats in Nevada had Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont narrowly in the lead there, with 29 percent support. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was next, with 27 percent, and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts had 18 percent. The poll was conducted Aug. 28-Sept. 4 and had a margin of error of about 5 percentage points.
In qualifying for the fourth set of debates, Mr. Steyer joins 10 other candidates who have already done so: Mr. Biden; Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey; Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind.; Julián Castro, the former housing secretary; Senator Kamala Harris of California; Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; former Representative Beto O'Rourke of Texas; Mr. Sanders; Ms. Warren; and the entrepreneur Andrew Yang.
A New York Times analysis of donor and polling data shows that Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii has met the donor threshold for qualification and is within two polls of meeting the polling criteria for the October debates. An ABC News/Washington Post national poll published Sunday showed Ms. Gabbard with 1 percent support among Democratic-leaning adults, short of the 2 percent needed.
The self-help author Marianne Williamson has also crossed the 130,000-donor threshold, but needs three more qualifying polls to earn a spot on the October debate stage. She received 0 percent support in the CBS/YouGov polls of early states, and less than half a percentage point of support in the ABC/Washington Post poll.
No other candidate in the 20-person field has reached the donor threshold or received 2 percent support in any qualifying polls. Candidates who have struggled to meet the D.N.C.'s debate criteria have been griping about it for months, and their complaints have intensified as the committee has tightened the requirements to qualify for debates.
At the D.N.C.'s summer meeting last month, Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, who is not particularly close to qualifying, blasted the committee's process for winnowing the debate field.
"We're rewarding celebrity candidates with millions of Twitter followers, billionaires who buy their way onto the debate stage and candidates who have been running for president for years," he said. "These rules have created exactly the wrong outcomes and they will not help us beat Donald Trump."
In recent weeks, as it became clear that they would not qualify for the debate this week, some candidates like Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and John Hickenlooper, the former Colorado governor, exited the race.
And last week, Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York said that it would be "tough to conceive" of continuing his campaign if he failed to qualify for the Democratic debate in October.
Candidates have until Oct. 1 to meet the donor and polling thresholds to qualify for the debate later in the month.

Stacey Abrams' project takes aim at suppression

Texto completo: The 2018 midterm elections shined a light on the impact of the U.S. Supreme Court's gutting of the Voting Rights Act in Shelby County v. Holder and the discriminatory state voting laws passed in its wake. The election was marred by problems related to discriminatory voter ID requirements, racial gerrymanders and racially-biased voter purges, while voters also faced long lines, closed polling places, malfunctioning voting machines, and voter intimidation.
Voter suppression was a factor in the narrow losses by Democratic gubernatorial candidates Stacey Abrams in Georgia and Andrew Gillum in Florida as well as in Beto O'Rourke's U.S. Senate run in Texas.
Abrams, for example, lost to Republican Brian Kemp by a margin of 50.2 to 48.8 percent - just about 55,000 votes. Abrams and voting rights advocates pointed to voter suppression tactics deployed by Kemp, who, as secretary of state overseeing the election, led the effort to restrict the influence of the African American voting bloc. He was accused of reducing the number of polling machines and improperly purging voter registrations in a way that disproportionately affected black residents. Of the 53,000 voters purged from the rolls by Kemp's office, for example, 70 percent were black.
In a brief address on election night, Abrams refused to concede and condemned Kemp's targeting of African Americans. "To watch an elected official, who claims to represent the people in the state, baldly pin his hopes for election on the suppression of the people's democratic right to vote has been truly appalling," Abrams said.
Because of the enthusiasm her candidacy inspired in Georgia and elsewhere, Abrams was seen as a potential Democratic presidential candidate. But instead, she's launched Fair Fight 2020, a new multistate effort to combat voter suppression in next year's election. "My mission is to make certain that no one has to go through in 2020 what we went through in 2018," Abrams said in a speech announcing the initiative at a gathering of the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades in Las Vegas.
The new initiative takes its name from Fair Fight Action, the voting rights group Abrams formed last year after her election loss. Fair Fight Action is currently suing the Georgia secretary of state's office, asking federal courts to address voting policies that the group says are discriminatory and unconstitutional.
Abrams' new initiative will expand beyond Georgia to target 20 states, including battleground states in the Southeast and Midwest and three states with gubernatorial races this year: Kentucky, Louisiana and Mississippi. It will invest up to $5 million in voter protection operations in those states.
In the months leading up to the election, Fair Fight 2020 will train staff members in battleground states to help repair inaccurate voter rolls, deal with the shortages of voting machines and provisional ballots, and adopt standardized rules around counting absentee ballots. They will also work to increase participation in the 2020 census, which determines congressional apportionment as well as funding for a wide range of services.
"She's creating an apparatus to fight voter suppression across the country, a prize that's essential to a fair and functioning democracy," Melanye Price, a political scientist at Prairie View A&M of Texas, wrote in a recent New York Times op-ed.
Abrams' focus on voter protection grows out of her understanding of the role of voter suppression in preventing action on other critical matters. In a recent interview with ABC's This Week, Abrams said combating voter suppression was "fundamental to tackling issues," including the economy, gun control, and the climate crisis. "The ability to vote is how you tackle climate change," she said. "We can't have climate change legislation simply by wishing it."
Abrams' emphasis on state government is critical since the Shelby decision weakened the federal government's ability to protect communities of color from voter suppression and shifted the fight to the state level. Given Southern states' rapidly diversifying electorate, Abrams' work to empower voters at the state level could ultimately reshape the region's electoral landscape and create a pathway to victory for Democrats at all levels of government.
Meanwhile, though Abrams took herself out of the running for president in 2020, she said she is open to serve as a vice presidential running mate for the eventual nominee. "I would be honored to be considered," she told the Washington Post.

Herrera Beutler stands by trade war

Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler
A few days after President Donald Trump imposed a new 15 percent tariff on many Chinese goods, U.S. Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler, R-Battle Ground, said Congress should give the president room to resolve the trade war on his own.
“I'm not totally sure where the president is going to go from this point. So I'm watching to see what I can do to mitigate the impacts,” Herrera Beutler said in an interview Wednesday.
“If it bleeds into next year, I don't think we're going to get the deal we hope we can get out of China,” she added. “I think he needs to work fast, and I think we need to give him a latitude to do that.”
Trump has complained that previous trade policies were unfair to U.S. interests and said that the Chinese government has manipulated its currency and tolerated theft of U.S. intellectual property.
On Sept. 1, Trump placed a new tariff on a range of consumer goods, escalating the existing trade war he started 18 months ago. In turn, Beijing retaliated by increasing tariffs on $75 billion worth of American products.
The current tariff on Chinese imports averages 21.2 percent, The New York Times reported, up from 3.1 percent at the start of 2017.
“I'm obviously concerned about the impacts to people at home. Washington state is the most trade-dependent state in the union, and Southwest Washington is one of the most trade-impacted (regions) in the state. It's a huge deal for us,” Herrera Beutler said.
Hit hard at home
Business at the Port of Vancouver revolves around two main products: soybeans and copper ore. As Alex Strogen, the port's chief commercial officer, told The Columbian recently: “Everything else is a rounding error.” Historically, China has been the port's largest market for both commodities.
The value of exports from Vancouver always swings widely from month to month, especially for soybeans, which are a seasonal crop. But since Trump first imposed tariffs on China in March 2018, the lows have dropped lower.
Three times in the last year — October 2018, December 2018 and May 2019 — the value of exports from the Port of Vancouver to China have bottomed out at less than $500,000. Prior to this year, the value of Vancouver-China exports hadn't dropped that low in more than a decade. Even slogging through the Great Recession, the monthly value of exports to China dipped below $1 million only twice, in August 2009 and January 2012.
On average, the monthly value of exports from the Port of Vancouver to China in 2017 was $77.7 million. By 2018, that figure had plummeted to $40.06 million.
The outlook hasn't been entirely bleak. There are other markets for soybeans, Strogen told The Columbian.
In 2017, 96 percent of the product went to China, compared with 26 percent in 2018. Focusing on China alone makes the situation look worse than it is — between 2017 and 2018, the port's total soybean output dropped less dramatically, from 1.3 million metric tons to 1 million metric tons. Now, routes from the port are more diverse, with many ships headed to Europe and Africa.
Copper ore, too, has found other markets in Europe and Asia.
But the situation remains volatile, and the latest tariffs mark an escalation of a trade war that's grown increasingly punitive between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. Just before enacting the latest tariffs, Trump called his Beijing counterpart an “enemy.”
In conversations with port leaders in Washington's 3rd Congressional District — including the ocean terminal ports of Vancouver, Kalama and Longview — Herrera Beutler said she's heard stakeholders say they are eager for the situation to be resolved.
“They've expressed that there's concern, and they don't want to be the sacrifice on the altar of getting this trade war fixed. But most of them have also acknowledged to me their recognition that China has been a very unfair actor,” Herrera Beutler said.
What can Congress do?
The Constitution gives Congress the power “to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises, to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States,” an authority that includes controlling tariffs imposed on imports.
But the executive branch can use a few different avenues to establish tariffs without congressional approval, and Trump used Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. It gives the secretary of commerce the power to investigate the impact of imports on national security, and the president the power to adjust tariffs according to the secretary's findings.
Conceivably, Congress could limit that power by excluding certain countries and products from tariff eligibility. That's an option on the table, but Herrera Beutler said she feels it would be premature to use it.
“We don't always have to agree with an administration, but we do have the constitutional (control over) the budget. As we get into the season next year, we can look at what our options might be,” Herrera Beutler said. “I don't want to get into that yet. I want to try to protect this space for the president to use his authority to bring this to a close, for our benefit.”
The congresswoman also said that she agrees with the Trump administration's willingness to punish China for unfair trade practices, and for the country's theft of intellectual property belonging to companies in the U.S.
“At some point, the country had to stand up for itself with regards to China's infractions,” Herrera Beutler said.
“There's no way out of this that's not going to impact us in Southwest Washington,” she conclude

Texto completo: Get ready, couch potatoes.

This fall's TV season is more cross-your-fingers-and-hope-for-the-best than viewers would like -- but the highs have a chance to soar.

Several anthologies, including Ryan Murphy's Netflix debut, may be the standouts of the season. But the schedule, packed with big names, is also littered with flimsy plots. Still, the beauty of TV is the surprises, not the predictable successes.

We're here to help, and have weeded through the lineup to help you figure out what's worth your time. Here are the new shows you should watch, give a try and avoid.

WATCH

• "Unbelievable" (premieres Sept. 13 on Netflix)

If it's not too traumatizing to watch, and for some it may be, this could be a defining story of the #MeToo movement. "Unbelievable" is a miniseries based on the ProPublica article about a teen (Kaitlyn Dever) accused of lying about her rape and the two female detectives (Merritt Wever and Toni Collette) who believe her.

• "A Little Late with Lilly Singh" (premieres Sept. 16 at 1:35 a.m. on NBC)

While the small screen is saturated with talks shows, Lilly Singh is doing something special. The Indian-Canadian YouTube star with almost 15 million subscribers will become the only woman to host a late-night talk show on one of the four major networks when she takes over for Carson Daly.

• "Prodigal Son" (premieres Sept. 23 at 9 p.m. on Fox)

In 2019 alone, Michael Sheen has played, to delightful results, a lawyer inspired by Roy Cohn on "The Good

Fight" and a literal angel on "Good Omens," so the logical next step, of course, is a serial killer nicknamed The Surgeon. Everything about it is absurd: the serial killer's son (Tom Payne) who hunts serial killers and the ex-wife (Bellamy Young) who drowns her past in pills. Not to mention a truly bizarre and remarkable cast of surrounding characters.

• "The Politician" (premieres Sept. 27 on Netflix)

Ryan Murphy, the co-creator behind "Glee," "American Horror Story" and much more, pulled out all the stops for his first show at Netflix, and that's saying a lot. In true Murphy fashion, he's compiled a who's who of Hollywood stars -- including Gwyneth Paltrow, Jessica Lange, Zoey Deutch, Lucy Boynton, Bette Midler, Judith Light, Dylan McDermott and January Jones -- for a show about an entitled California high school student (Ben Platt) and his rise in politics. Murphy might be the busiest man on the West Coast these days, but he hasn't gotten it wrong in a long time.

• "Modern Love" (premieres Oct. 18 on Amazon Video)

Anthologies are having a wildly successful run, thanks in large part to the aforementioned Murphy, which brings us to "Modern Love," based on the New York Times' weekly column about, well, modern love. As is often the case with anthologies, the cast will carry it, and it's made up of Tina Fey, Anne Hathaway, John Slattery, Brandon Victor Dixon, Cristin Milioti, Andrew Scott, John Gallagher Jr. and pretty much everyone Murphy hasn't already cast.

• "The Mandalorian" (premieres Tuesday, Nov. 12 on Disney+)

Sure, we may be culturally obligated to support all "Star Wars" content but there's no way Disney+ is launching an entire streaming service with a less-than-perfect series. Jon Favreau moves over from Marvel to write and produce the story of a Mandalorian gunfighter (Pedro Pascal) a few years before "Return of the Jedi."

• "The Morning Show" (premieres this fall on Apple TV+)

It may be a little inside baseball, but there's an inherent interest in who decides what we see on TV during our morning Cheerios and how they decide it. Of course, it helps when Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon and Steve Carell are the ones breaking the news. Early trailers for the comedy-drama less-than-subtly hint at a #MeToo ousting for Carell, but it's not quite clear if that's just a jumping off point. Best-case scenario is that this is a less-pretentious version of "The Newsroom."

• "The Gilded Age" (premieres in 2019 on HBO)

We don't even have a cast for "The Gilded Age" yet, let alone a trailer to go off of, but Julian Fellowes' "Downton Abbey" follow-up, about 1885 New York and the racial, financial and gender gaps that come with that time and that place, is full of promise. But can we get a trailer at some point please?

TRY

• "Emergence" (premieres Sept. 24 at 10 p.m. on ABC)

Allison Tolman deserves better than the credit she gets for being such a great actress and she also probably deserves better than "Emergence," about a Long Island police chief who takes in a child after an accident of which she has no recollection. Like "Manifest" last season, this'll be all about how long the writers can drag out the mystery.

• "Perfect Harmony" (premieres Sept. 26 at 8:30 p.m. on NBC)

The line between fun and cheesy is awfully thin and this Bradley Whitford/Anna Camp musical comedy series about a grumpy, Ivy League music professor and a small-town church choir could easily go either way. The songs will probably make or break it.

• "Evil" (premieres Sept. 26 at 10 p.m. on CBS)

Robert and Michelle King are among the most underrated showrunners on TV (seriously, "The Good Wife" and "The Good Fight" are great, but please watch the canceled "BrainDead" too). Supernatural drama "Evil" revolves around a clinical psychologist (Katja Herbers), a priest-in-training (Mike Colter) and a contractor (Aasif Mandvi) investigating religious occurrences (miracles, demonic possessions) and could be fascinating. It also could just end up being a less fun version of "The X-Files."

• "Almost Family" (premieres Oct. 2 at 9 p.m. on Fox)

Even if you're not a lawyer, you have to realize that using your own sperm at your fertility clinic crosses some ethical boundaries (it's also probably super illegal). But Leon Bechley (Timothy Hutton) somehow either didn't know or didn't care and now his daughter (Brittany Snow) is stuck with almost 100 new siblings, including Roxy (Emily Osment) and Edie (Megalyn Echikunwoke) in this drama.

AVOID

• "Bob Hearts Abishola" (premieres Sept. 23 at 8:30 p.m. on CBS)

It's a little hard to believe that, in 2019, Chuck Lorre is putting out a sitcom based entirely on the premise that a mediocre middle-aged white man (Billy Gardell) could have a crush on an immigrant (Folake Olowofoyeku), but here we are. What about that exactly is funny? It's almost certainly not worth finding out. And hey, while you're here, please don't put emojis in show titles, like the actual heart shape that's officially used in the show's title. We are way too old for that.

• "Stumptown" (premieres Sept. 25 at 10 p.m. on ABC)

Honestly, truly, how many tough private investigator shows do we need? It's like Mad Libs: (proper noun), a former (job title), moves to (city with a lot of rain) and becomes a private investigator so (he/she) can support (his/her) (family member). This time it's Cobie Smulders, Marine veteran, Portland, brother. Been there, been bored by that.

• "Carol's Second Act" (premieres Sept. 26 at 9:30 p.m. on CBS)

Carol (Patricia Heaton) has fulfilled her duties as a wife and mother and now she gets to be a doctor like she always wanted because women can't actually be a wife, mother and doctor at the same time. So now we're left with a bunch of jokes about the aforementioned Carol being old and, well, that seems to be about it.

• "Bless the Harts" (premieres Sept. 29 at 8:30 p.m. on Fox)

It's yet another animated show about a family being poor and white. The cast is great -- Kristen Wiig, Maya Rudolph, Jillian Bell and Ike Barinholtz are all lending their voices as series regulars and Mary Steenburgen is set to have a recurring role -- but just go watch "King of the Hill" at this point. Or literally any of Fox's other animated sitcoms. They have enough.

New Maui exhibit showcases artists at their barricades

Texto completo: An artist with a message might want to encrypt it to keep it from the wrong hands. The five invited printmakers and a needle worker showcased in “Art & Activism: An Exhibition About Change” spell out their agendas boldly, demanding a world more righteous, sustainable and spiritual than the one we know.
The remarkable exhibition hangs at the Maui Arts & Cultural Center’s Schaefer International Gallery through Oct. 31; it’s a Maui exclusive. There’s lots to think about and there’s lots to see.
For drums and trumpets, the prize-winner is the mammoth three-part “American Procession,” by Sandow Birk and Elyse Pignolet from Los Angeles, printed from carved woodblocks in graphic black on gold.
The central panel, postcard- shaped, jumbles together battered symbols of lost national glory: a triumphal arch in ruins, smokestacks belching poison, Liberty’s uplifted torch rolling in the dust. The Capitol appears as a prop for a carnival float, flat, with nothing behind it.
The panoramic side panels, more than five times as wide as they are tall, show generations of change agents on the march. From the left come generations of social progressives, Abraham Lincoln, Gertrude Stein and Martin Luther King Jr. prominent among them. From the right come armies of oppression, our 45th president crowing from a chair held high above the heads of his sympathizers, a Confederate flag waving before him. Slaves led in chains bring up the rear.
Partisan? Bet your bottom dollar it’s partisan. For extra credit, take the time it takes — and it will take time — to study Birk’s two king-size, single-panel allegories on American ideals as yet unkept. Here’s political cartooning in the great tradition of Hogarth, Gillray, Nash and Goya. “In God We Trust.”
Of Hawaiian ancestry, Kanani Miyamoto of Portland, Ore., calls out Paul Gauguin’s “colonial gaze,” sharing her outrage at an entry from his journal that reads, “All (the young women and girls) wish to be taken, literally, brutally taken, without a single word.”
But suppose Gauguin is just the messenger here. As a lone alien with nothing much to his name but his paint box, what power could he wield over the practices of the natives? And haven’t generations of art lovers, in Polynesia and around the world, seen in his island women celebrations of their inviolate mana?
No one has a stranglehold on truth; Miyamoto sees the history her way and chooses her battles accordingly. Gauguin turns up over and over in her prints as a vile little tick with a human head — no match for her stern, heroically scaled wahine with flowers in their hair.
Mixed-media “tableaux” from Orly Cogan of New York examine evolving female types and stereotypes from the vantage point of a white, middle-age, middle-class feminist with the killer instincts of an X-rated, late-night stand-up comic. Cogan’s vast cast of icons, mostly stitched by hand on old-time printed textiles, includes the “notorious” Ruth Bader Ginsburg, DC Comics’ Wonder Woman, the smoldering Frida Kahlo and an anonymous young nude with chestnut hair now seen pushing a vacuum, now indulging in a Hostess CupCake.
The two remaining installations speak more quietly. From the calls of local birds captured by the microphone and visualized on paper in black and white, Maui artist Abigail Romanchak has assembled a fresco documenting extinctions and progressive decline. The spectrograms resemble sheet music in notation we can’t decipher for symphonies of nature we are on the verge of losing forever. Audio from the field, available on headphones, underscores the sense of tragedy.
Finally, beyond an entrance a child might walk through, though an adult must crawl, Paul Mullowney of San Francisco has papered an impromptu Zen chapel with his prints of calligraphic characters, Noh masks, and Buddhist saints praying in the lotus position, some of those saints reduced to skeletons under a sky that rains fire upon them.
Of the artist’s messages, Mullowney’s may be at once the most private and the most radical. Want to change the world? Start with yourself. Work from within.

Sashaying Their Way Through Youth

Texto completo: "I'm excited!" screamed Desmond Napoles, a 12-year-old drag star who performs as Desmond is Amazing, punctuating his enthusiasm with mild profanity. His eyes darted to his phone. Then he backtracked. "Don't put that in. Don't put that in." He would soon be grounded from Snapchat by his mother for what she called "sass."
Desmond and his mother would still make it to the object of Desmond's excitement: DragCon, the convention hosted by RuPaul in New York City in early September. It would be Desmond's third year in a row. He isn't a different person in drag so much as a more outgoing version of himself, he said. "I'm always fierce, fabulous and not playing video games," he said. "I'm being AH-MA-zing."
From an early age Desmond was theatrical, said Wendy Napoles, his mother. There were dresses fashioned out of household items like recycled cardboard, ribbons, towels, Bubble Wrap. Once, she said, at a mall food court, Katy Perry's "Firework" came on and he broke into an impromptu dance routine.
Desmond pegs his start in the world of drag to 2015, when videos of him vogueing at the New York Pride parade went viral; at one point, a high kick sent a flip-flop soaring over the crowd. Next came gigs channeling Gwen Stefani and David Bowie, along with runway shows for Gypsy Sport and the Blonds.
"Other moms are a soccer moms," Ms. Napoles said. "They take their kids to practice, to games, they cheer for their kids. That's how I see myself with drag."
Keegan, a.k.a. Kween Keekee, is a 9-year-old drag queen. (The New York Times agreed to not use the family's last name, to protect their privacy.) "Our goal has never been to make K famous," said his mother, Megan. "We allow Instagram to be a public account as we don't feel we need to be pressured to hide our child, and because we think his story could help other kids."
When Keegan announced he wanted to do drag, one difficulty his mother encountered was that her family didn't know where to start. So she took to Instagram to find a high-school-age babysitter who does drag. She also connected with Keegan's drag mentors: adult queens who today help with costumes (mostly sparkly) and makeup.
The 'Drag Race' Generation
As recently as the 1970s, when dressing as another gender could lead to arrest on charges of vagrancy or "perversion" in many jurisdictions, drag was an adults-only affair, relegated to underground spaces and rich in sexual innuendo.
But as gay culture has gained mainstream acceptance, the number and variety of locations where drag is welcome have grown. G-rated story hours are now offered at public libraries. Kids -- and parents intent on raising them outside of traditional gender norms -- are keen to perform.
"This is the first generation that was truly raised on 'Drag Race,"' said Robin Johnson, a photographer, who founded Dragutante, an 18-and-under runway show in Denver. When her son, a 14-year-old who in drag is known as Ophelia Peaches, was in elementary school, they would watch "RuPaul's Drag Race" together, for "the gowns, the pageantry, the acting, the drama." It was "like Disney princesses," she said.
Ms. Johnson estimated that there are more than a hundred kids doing drag around the United States, based on outreach to Dragutante and to Ophelia. Some have public social media platforms and are on their way to careers.
Desmond, with 180,000 followers on Instagram, has the largest online presence, followed by Lactatia, a 10-year-old in Montreal. CJ Duron, 12, whose mother is the author of "Raising My Rainbow," recently appeared in a Sephora Pride campaign; although he is not a "drag kid," he is inspired by the art form, Ms. Duron said.
Mothers run most of these accounts. (Despite the binary-shattering implications of this scene, drag moms far outnumber drag dads.)
The job consists largely of filtering comments. An active subset of the internet sees kids in drag not as "the future of America," as RuPaul has said of Desmond, but "socially accepted child abuse," in the words of Elizabeth Johnston, a vlogger who "daily tackles the left on abortion, feminism, & gender insanity," according to her social media bios.
Her network also helped call for the cancellation of several drag queen story hours at local libraries. Among their criticisms are that exposure to drag sexualizes children and leads to confusion around gender roles.
Nina West, a queen who appeared on "Drag Race" and who has often performed for kids, said that while drag is a form of gender protest, it is not inherently sexual. "Drag is the larger than life representation of a character," she said.
At drag queen story hours at a library, she often reads the book "Red: A Crayon's Story." In it, a red crayon discovers it is wrapped in the wrong label, and was really blue all along.
In her music video "Drag Is Magic," she performs in front of a group of kids dressed as police officers, pirates and princesses. "Colorful. Bright. Loud. Big! Those are things that kids respond to," she said. "Who's to say what Barney is?"
Parenting Today
Laura Edwards-Leeper, a clinical psychologist in Oregon who works with queer and trans kids, said that experimenting with gender expression isn't necessarily linked to being queer or trans. "It's normal at basically any age for boys to dress up as princesses and girls in male superhero outfits," she said.
What's changed is parenting. "When there's no judgment, kids are more likely to feel free to explore," Dr. Edwards-Leeper said.
"We had a kid who was a drag queen one year and a drag king the next," Robin Johnson said. "We have had four hyperqueens, or girls doing drag."
Esai, a.k.a. E! the Dragnificent, 14, has been "been doing drag since before she knew she was," according to her mother, Andrea Varela, who produces burlesque shows. "There were always lots of rhinestones and boas and costumes around. It was a very colorful environment." A few years after she started doing drag, Esai came out as trans. She now identifies as female.
What's Next?
In one way, the debate over drag kids mirrors one in drag as a whole: How mainstream can the art form become before it loses its subversive power?
"By opening their thriving subculture to children out of a misguided sense of 'inclusivity,' gay men risk losing a space for their expression at all -- or alternatively, opening their subculture to Disneyfication," the writer Kevan Copeland, a 38-year-old gay man in Toronto, wrote in a post on Medium.
But at least for now, kids are drag's least commercialized niche. Desmond is Amazing has the most followers out of any drag kid. So far, his family has spent far more money than they have made, according to Ms. Napoles.
"I truly think 10 percent of his followers are there to watch every move he makes because they hate him," Ms. Napoles said. In January a talk radio host reported Desmond's family to Child Protective Services after he performed at 3 Dollar Bill, a queer bar.
Desmond has since pulled back on performing, though he will attend DragCon. Even there, among fans, he is not particularly looking forward to the crowds. When fans yell his name and swarm him for hugs, "it makes me anxious," he said. He dreams of being an ornithologist when he grows up, he said, or a roller-coaster engineer.
Keegan, three years younger than Desmond, is less aware of judgments of the outside world. When his mother was growing up in the 1980s, she dressed like a tomboy and felt ostracized, she said. So when her two sons were in preschool and wanted to wear pink and take dance lessons, she was careful not to discourage them. (These days, her older son is intent on "making sure people know he's a boy," she said.)
When he was wearing his favorite pair of glitter shoes at school recently, Keegan recalled, a classmate said: "Those are girls' shoes."
"'I know why you're saying that,"' Keegan said. "'It's because you're jealous of me."'

Texto completo: TALLAHASSEE  Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody has joined seven other states and the District of Columbia in investigating Facebook for possible antitrust violations.

The news came in a Friday morning news release from New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is leading the bipartisan investigation into the social media giant.

The attorneys general are investigating Facebooks dominance in the industry and the potential anti-competitive conduct stemming from that dominance, James said in a statement.

Even the largest social media platform in the world must follow the law and respect consumers, James statement said. I am proud to be leading a bipartisan coalition of attorneys general in investigating whether Facebook has stifled competition and put users at risk. We will use every investigative tool at our disposal to determine whether Facebooks actions may have endangered consumer data, reduced the quality of consumers choices, or increased the price of advertising.

James said the attorneys general of Florida, Colorado, Iowa, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee and the District of Columbia were assisting the investigation.

A spokeswoman for Moody confirmed the office has joined the inves

tigation, but declined to elaborate on the offices involvement.

As it is pending and ongoing, we will not provide further comment at this time, spokeswoman Lauren Schenone said.

According to the New York Times, Will Castleberry, Facebooks vice president of state and local policy, said in a statement that the company will work constructively with state attorneys general, and we welcome a conversation with policymakers about the competitive environment in which we operate.

Facebook, the worlds largest social media company, has been subject to increased scrutiny by the media and federal authorities since the 2016 election, when the site was manipulated by Russians trying to sow conflict among Americans.

The company, which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp, was also found to have given away information on more than 50 million users, which was used by the company Cambridge Analytica to target voters in the leadup to the 2016 election.

That disclosure led to Facebook being hit with a $5 billion fine by the Federal Trade Commission in July for violating consumers privacy, by far the largest fine for privacy violations. In addition, Facebook confirmed in its July quarterly report that its facing a separate anti-trust investigation by the Federal Trade Commission as well as added scrutiny from a U.S. Department of Justice antitrust review of market-leading online platforms.

The investigation into Facebook is just one of potentially multiple antitrust investigations into the nations largest tech companies.

More than three dozen attorneys general are investigating Google for similar antitrust violations, according to the Wall Street Journal.

That bipartisan probe, led by the Texas attorney general, is expected to be announced Monday in Washington, according to the Journal. Its unclear whether Florida is one of those states.

Google told the paper that it was cooperating with the probe.

So far, mounting pressure from regulators has not diminished Facebooks overall performance. Facebook shares were down about 2 percent by Friday. The day the $5 billion fine was announced, Facebooks market value rose more than the cost of the penalty, which represents 9 percent of the companys 2018 revenue.

Texto completo: The annual Philadelphia Fringe Festival opened Thursday night - 18 days with 158 different shows, not counting an ever-changing roster of late-right performances. What began here 23 years ago in OId City as a small-scale version of the mother of all Fringes in Edinburgh, Scotland, has grown into a year-round operation headed by Fringe Arts, the overseer of the festival.
The Philly Fringe, as most people refer to it, is an eclectic mix of theater, dance, music, circus, film and visual art - plus digital shows you don't even have to leave your seat to attend Ten productions this year are curated by Fringe-Arts - either commissioned or brought in from other cities. (And countries, too: this year, Argentina, Belgium and Mexico.) The other 148 shows are a free-for-all from independent producers who find their own venues around the region, leaving FringeArts to take care of the box office and some of the marketing.
The Fringe is for audiences open to risks - and in fact, the festival has helped to foster brave audiences in the Philadelphia region, where many professional companies now stage and commission new plays or musicals as part of their seasons. Those works mostly go through a process of readings and workshops; new work in the independently produced Philly Fringe is a grab bag of just about anything, and it may have been written only last month.
That's a big part of the excitement that drew about 33,500 people to the festival last year and has attracted audiences ever since its inaugural year. The shows tend to be short and ticket prices, affordable - they generally range from $10 to $50, and mostly at the low end. So if you see something that misfires, it's no big deal. If you see something that wows you, you'll catch the real excitement and surprise of the Fringe.
Each festival night around 10:30, the Fringe turns into a scene when people from the shows and from the audience mingle at inside and outside bars at the FringeArts building, Race Street at Columbus Boulevard. This year, the city's Bearded Ladies Cabaret will host "Late Night Snacks," a full lineup of performers in a refitted East Passyunk industrial space on Percy Street. And each night, there's an independently produced pop-up, "Free Fringe Philly Cabaret" on Tenth Street.
So, how to begin navigating the festival? It can appear daunting. In fact, it's not. Leaping through the festival guide online (and in print at stores around town) is a simple way to make choices - the 10 curated FringeArts shows are well described, the rest of them not so much. But you'll get an idea what you're getting into.
Here's a tip for jumping into the fray at the last minute, no guidebook in hand. Go to the FringeArts site and scroll down your screen. You'll see a list of days on the left side (including days after the festival when some shows still fun). Click on the day you want to go and survey all the shows. Each has a red box: 'Read More." Click on that to see the description FringeArts has of the show. Once you've made a decision, you can reserve tickets.
Here's a rundown of all the shows curated by FringeArts and a selection of the festival's independently produced shows. Click on the title of any of the following shows to call up the FringeArts page for that show, with dates, times, prices and running times.
Superterranean: Philadelphia's pioneering Pig Iron Theatre Company teams with Tony Award-winning designer Mimi Lien for a show about the impersonal infrastructure that makes a city viable, and our relationship to it. There's no particular city here, just big structures and nine contemplative performers relating to their surroundings. This show will probably have box-office buzz - Pig Iron usually does.
The B-Side: From the much-admired Wooster Group in New York, this show's description is in its bulky subtitle: "Negro Folklore from Texas Sate Prisons, a Record Album Interpretation." Voices of three live performers blend with those on an album of work songs and spirituals recorded at Texas prison farms in 1964, when those places were segregated. In between the tracks, the cast reads the record's liner notes and talks about Bruce Jackson, the folklorist behind the recording. The New York Times called the production, which played off-Broadway, "extraordinary."
�umbal: FringeArts received a William Penn Foundation grant to produce free work in public spaces - last year, about 200 people performed a choreographed dance at the Art Museum steps, and this year, Mexican choreographer Mariana Arteaga will turn 60 everyday Philadelphians into dance artists. She subtitles the dance, "Nomadic Choreography for Inhabitants." It's in South Philly, at Mifflin Square Park.
Is This A Room?: True story: A former linguist with the Air Force, 25-year-old Reality Winner, leaked information about Russian interference in the last presidential election. The FBI knocked on her door one day and began questioning her in a discussion that moved her one way and another, through a variety of emotions. She was ultimately sentenced to jail for the leak, and there she remains. The transcript of that FBI encounter was released by-the government. Tina Satter, artistic leader of the New York group Half Straddle, creates a verbatim staging of the event, every urn and ah in place.
Cartography: This piece of documentary-style theater explores the global refugee crisis in a highly personal way: Five actors, all refugees (from El Salvador, Lebanon, South Africa, Syria and Rwanda), recount their physical and personal journeys. The idea came from New York-based theater artist Kaneza Schaal and author Christopher Myers; they traveled to Munich in 2016, when about 30,000 refugees were arriving each day, and heard many of their stories. FringeArts is billing this as an all-ages show.
There: In The Light of the Darkness and the Self and the Other: Rosa Barba, a visual artist from Italy who now lives in Germany and whose work appears internationally (three times as part of the Venice Biennale), teams with Wilma Theater leader Blanka Zizka to create a stage work from Etel Adnan's book-length prose poem of the same name. Adnan, a painter (also in the Venice Biennale) and writer, quests for self-discovery in this work, for which Barba has redesigned the interior of the Wilma. Zizka uses her HotHouse Company of Wilma actors to perform the show.
Fase: This dance - four movements to the music of minimalist composer Steve Reich - premiered in 1982 and put choreographer Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker on the contemporary-dance map. She brings her dance company, Rosa, to the Fringe with a pair of dancers performing three duets and a solo. The tiny movement variations mirror Reich's sound, and - begin to evolve.
Un Poyo Rojo: Two guys turn on real-time local radio in a locker room, then "redesign this dance on the fly" to suit the station's programming, says FringeArts chief Nick Stuccio. "It's a fun farce on male competitiveness." The performers' physical communication mixes mime, acrobatic, martial arts, and more. The show's been playing for a decade around the world, after it premiered in sold-out theaters in Argentina, where it was created. Reviewers say it makes them laugh out loud.
Pursuit of Happiness: Nature Theater of Oklahoma's Pavol Liska and Kelly Copper team with the Slovenian dance troupe EN-KNAP Group for what Stuccio calls "a romp - that's the only way to describe it." The name of the piece offers a hint to its underlying question: Just what is that very American notion, the pursuit of happiness? The first part is set in a Western saloon, where things get crazy. The second part is told by a dancer as he moves about the cast and relates his adventures in Iraq.
Let Me Die: This theatrical survey of the great death scenes of opera is presented with Opera Philadelphia as part of its Festival 019. It's from singer-writer-musician Joseph Keckler, who performs the piece "with the style of a rock star, the three-plus-octave voice of a classically trained bass-baritone, and a keen comic sensibility," according to the show's press information. He melds major death scenes with his own music and narrative.

Trump administration considers a drastic cut in refugees allowed to enter the U.S.

Texto completo: Washington • The White House is considering a plan that would effectively bar refugees from most parts of the world from resettling in the United States by cutting back the decades-old program that admits tens of thousands of people each year who are fleeing war, persecution and famine, according to current and former administration officials.
In meetings over the past several weeks, one top administration official has proposed zeroing out the program altogether, while leaving the president with the ability to admit refugees in an emergency. Another option that top officials are weighing would cut refugee admissions by half or more, to 10,000 to 15,000 people, but reserve most of those spots for refugees from a few hand-picked countries or groups with special status, such as Iraqis and Afghans who work alongside American troops, diplomats and intelligence operatives abroad.
Both options would all but end the United States’ status as a leader in accepting refugees from around the world.
The issue is expected to come to a head on Tuesday, when the White House plans to convene a high-level meeting in the Situation Room to discuss at what number President Donald Trump should set the annual, presidentially determined ceiling on refugee admissions for the coming year.
“At a time when the number of refugees is at the highest level in recorded history, the United States has abandoned world leadership in resettling vulnerable people in need of protection,” said Eric Schwartz, the president of Refugees International. “The result is a world that is less compassionate and less able to deal with future humanitarian challenges.”
For two years, Stephen Miller, Trump’s top immigration adviser, has used his considerable influence in the West Wing to reduce the refugee ceiling to its lowest levels in history, capping the program at 30,000 this year. That is a more than 70% cut from its level when President Barack Obama left office.
The move has been part of Trump’s broader effort to reduce the number of immigrants from entering the United States both legally and illegally, including numerous restrictions on asylum-seekers, who, like refugees, are fleeing from persecution but cross into the United States over the border with Mexico or Canada.
Now, Miller and allies from the White House whom he placed at the departments of State and Homeland Security are pushing aggressively to shrink the program even further, according to one senior official involved in the discussions and several former officials briefed on them, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to detail the private deliberations.
White House officials did not respond to a request for comment.
John Zadrozny, a top official at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, has argued for simply lowering the ceiling to zero, a stance that was first reported by Politico. Others have suggested providing “carveouts” for certain countries or populations, such as the Iraqis and Afghans, whose work on behalf of the American government put both them and their families at risk, making them eligible for special status to come to the United States through the refugee program.
Advocates of the nearly 40-year-old refugee program inside and outside the administration fear that approach would effectively starve the program, making it impossible to resettle even those narrow populations. The advocacy groups say the fate of the program increasingly hinges on an unlikely figure: Mark Esper, the secretary of defense.
Barely two months into his job as Pentagon chief, Esper, a former lobbyist and defense contracting executive, is the newest voice at the table in the annual debate over how many refugees to admit. But while Esper’s predecessor, Jim Mattis, had taken up the refugee cause with an almost missionary zeal, repeatedly declining to embrace large cuts because of the potential effect he said they would have on American military interests around the world, Esper’s position on the issue is unknown.
The senior military leadership at the Defense Department has been urgently pressing Esper to follow his predecessor’s example and be an advocate for the refugee program, according to people familiar with the conversations in the Pentagon.
But current and former senior military officials said the defense secretary had not disclosed to them whether he would fight for higher refugee admissions at the White House meeting next week. One former general described Esper as in a “foxhole defilade” position, a military term for the infantry’s effort to remain shielded or concealed from enemy fire.
A senior Defense Department official said that Esper had not decided what his recommendation would be for the refugee program this year. As a result, an intense effort is underway by a powerful group of retired generals and humanitarian aid groups to persuade Esper to pick up where Mattis left off.
In a letter to Trump on Wednesday, some of the nation’s most distinguished retired military officers implored the president to reconsider the cuts, taking up the national security argument that Mattis made when he was at the Pentagon. They called the refugee program a “critical lifeline” to people who help U.S. troops, diplomats and intelligence officials abroad, and warned that cutting it off risked greater instability and conflict.
“We urge you to protect this vital program and ensure that the refugee admissions goal is robust, in line with decadeslong precedent, and commensurate with today’s urgent global needs,” wrote the military brass, including Adm. William McRaven, the former commander of U.S. Special Operations; Gen. Martin Dempsey, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; and Lt. Gen. Mark P. Hertling, the former commanding general of Army forces in Europe.
They said even the current ceiling of 30,000 is “leaving thousands in harm’s way.”
Gen. Joseph Votel, who retired this year after overseeing the U.S. military’s command that runs operations in the Middle East, also signed the letter. In an interview, he noted that the flows of refugees leaving war-torn countries like Syria is one of the driving forces of instability in the region.
“We don’t do anything alone,” Votel said of U.S. military operations overseas, which is regularly helped by Iraqi nationals who become persecuted refugees. “This is not just the price we pay but an obligation.”
Mattis privately made the same arguments in 2018 and 2019 as he tried to fight back efforts by Miller to cut the refugee cap, which had already been reduced to 50,000 by Trump’s travel ban executive order.
Joined by then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Nikki Haley, the United Nations ambassador at the time, Mattis succeeded in keeping the cap at 45,000 for 2018. The next year, Miller tried to persuade Mattis to support a lower number by promising to ensure the program for the Iraqi and Afghans would not be affected. But Mattis refused and pushed for the program to remain at 45,000 refugees. But with Tillerson gone, Miller succeeded in convincing the president to drop the ceiling to 30,000.
In his announcement last year, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo argued that because of a recent surge of asylum-seekers at the southwestern border, there was less of a need for the United States to accept refugees from abroad.
“This year’s refugee ceiling reflects the substantial increase in the number of individuals seeking asylum in our country, leading to a massive backlog of outstanding asylum cases and greater public expense,” Pompeo said at the time.
Now, a year later, Miller and his allies have repeatedly made that same argument in urging that the number go even lower.
Barbara Strack, who retired last year as chief of the Refugee Affairs Division at the federal Citizenship and Immigration Services, said the United States used to be a model for other countries by accepting refugees from all over the globe. After the U.S. began accepting Bhutanese refugees from Nepal, she said, other countries followed suit.
“Very often, that leadership matters,” she said. “That is something that is just lost in terms of who the United States is in the world and how other governments see us.”

Texto completo: MARYSVILLE, Ohio -- For people in the market for an automobile largely built by hand and not robots, a few options come to mind. There are Rolls-Royce and Bentley, certainly. Or consider a $ 250,000 Ferrari made in the north of Italy, or maybe a $ 250,000 McLaren from the south of England.
Or possibly, as of this summer, a $ 50,000 Acura born in central Ohio.
In Marysville, at American Honda's Performance Manufacturing Center, "hand built" may overstate what's unfolding on the assembly line. But a special PMC edition of the 2020 Acura TLX sports sedan is being built alongside its rich relation, the $ 160,000 NSX sports car.
Automation figures in, of course. But, philosophically, at least, the robots are taking a back seat to the work being done by a small army of real people.
The Performance Manufacturing Center is not your churn-'em-out car mill. One may even mistake it for a hospital: white floors, white walls, white coats worn by the "associates," an air of clinical neutrality and virtually no clutter.
All the better to show off the brilliant Valencia Red gloss of the TLX's custom paint job (the one color available for the special edition).
On any given weekday, six of the PMC edition cars may leave here for dealerships, compared with the 180 mass-produced TLX models that might originate at another Acura plant.
Those cars, which start at $ 34,000 for a base model, cost less in part because they don't have many of the trim and premium features -- full leather, a surround-view camera system, heated steering wheel, 10-speaker audio and more -- that are standard on the special edition, which also ditches the standard four-cylinder motor in favor of the six.
Once 360 of the special-edition TLX cars have shipped this model year, the Performance Manufacturing Center will turn its attention to completing orders for a limited run of the 2020 MDX sport-utility vehicle. After that, well, Acura is mum.
"We knew we would use the processes here beyond the NSX when PMC opened in 2013," said Andrew Quillin, a spokesman for Acura. "We're not saying what comes next. That's the fun part of small-batch manufacturing: It gives us liberties to play around."
At the Performance Manufacturing Center, progress is measured not in millimeters but in tenths of millimeters. During a visit by a reporter and photographer for The New York Times in late July, Tony Thompson, a manufacturing technician, opened and closed the front passenger door of a TLX a dozen times until there was just enough overhang on the rear edge to avoid wind noise at high speed.
Between each action, he slightly adjusted the latch and striker plate. "Got to be perfect," said Mr. Thompson, a Honda employee for 30 years and one of about 100 handpicked "M.T.s" at the plant.
Henry Ford, while he might applaud the fact that these special Acuras come in only one shade, most likely wouldn't recognize the fine-tuning that happens at the plant. At the front end of a car, Jayme Cummins shuttles among bins of hardware to create the fascia, aligning the LED headlights above the bumper and measuring the hood panel gaps -- the spaces between the sheet metal parts -- for any deviations.
At the engine-mounting station, the car bodies are suspended and a platform raises the engine. Technicians first turn the mounting bolts by hand into the subframe, then use sophisticated torque wrenches to tighten them. Patience is required.
Unlike any version of the TLX sedan, the high-end NSX is built at this factory on an aluminum space frame. In that case, "if you run a bolt into the aluminum very fast, the bolt and the aluminum get too hot and will almost weld," said Jeff Britton, the assembly unit manager at the Performance Manufacturing Center. "Not good."
The TLX's 290-horsepower V-6 engine comes from an automated assembly system at a plant in Anna, Ohio (although the NSX twin-turbo unit is assembled by humans there).
Henry Ford might also appreciate that the electronic torque wrenches measure how much twist is applied to each bolt and store the information on a computer. "We keep those torque specs on file for every car that's built here," Mr. Britton said.
It may take up to five days to complete a TLX, from the time the shell, or so-called body in white, is delivered from a nearby facility to the rollout into an indoor holding pen for pickup by trailers. Some of that time is to allow for paint curing.
In fact, painting the PMC-edition cars is a science of sorts. The body is first dunked into a variety of cleaning and rinse baths. "Before the color is even applied, the bodies go through three ovens," said Keith Bullock, a paint technician. "It's 12 minutes for dehydration, 32 minutes to bake and cooling for seven minutes."
After that, the shell shuttles into the painting booths and the waiting arms of robots, which apply three separate coats of color and clear finish. Later, a team of polishers, buffers in hand and working in front of an array of ultrabright LED lights, examines the bodies for blemishes and scratches.
The penultimate stop in the process is an indoor dynamometer that calibrates the TLX's drive system and braking performance. Before the car is washed and prepped, it's docked onto a four-post "shaker," a hydraulic gizmo that can simulate driving on a variety of surfaces, including cobblestones and severe bumps. After a water-leak test, each car is wrapped in a cover. Ostensibly, it's not actually driven -- indeed, it doesn't see daylight -- until it's received by the dealer.
Speaking of shipping, the destination charge for the TLX PMC model is $ 1,995, double the sum that buyers would pay for a 2019 BMW 3 series or an Audi A5 coupe, for example. Chris Naughton, an Acura spokesman, said the fee reflected the cost of the car cover and the fact that it was shipped in an enclosed carrier.
The suggested retail price of a delivered TLX PMC sedan is $ 50,945. Lottery winners can consider stepping up to the NSX. NSX buyers who would like to visit the plant can opt for a version of the "Insider Experience," which offers several packages, such as a tour, lunch and a "Performance Drive" for $ 2,787 for one person, $ 4,459 for two. Airfare, hotel and all travel accouterments are extra. As, of course, is the NSX.
Photograph Painting the PMC-edition Acuras is a science at the Performance Manufacturing Center in Marysville, Ohio. Before color is applied, the bodies go through three ovens, a technician said.; The American Honda factory in Marysville has white walls and floors, and its "associates" wear white coats. The company builds only six of the custom TLX models a day. The car comes in only one color, Valencia Red, and features a full leather interior, a surround-view camera system, a heated steering wheel, a 10-speaker audio system and a six-cylinder engine.

Introducing a Stomach-Churning Way to Deal With Rats: Drown Them

Texto completo: Traps. Poison. Birth control. Dry ice. And now, what city officials are touting as a high-tech solution: drowning.
New York has attempted to eradicate its teeming rat population for 355 years and counting. On Thursday, the latest tactic in the Sisyphean effort was unveiled, with great fanfare, by Eric Adams, the Brooklyn borough president.
It was, in effect, a bucket that would lure the rodents and send them plunging to their deaths in a mysterious vinegary concoction. The toxic potion, according to its maker, Rat Trap Inc., prevents them from rotting too quickly and emitting a stink.
A dozen reporters were gathered around Mr. Adams when he gleefully displayed a plastic bin containing blobs of rat floating around in a mouse-gray stew; it was a ghastly spectacle and the odor was stomach-churning.
"Sometimes you need to see for yourselves to get the shock effect," Mr. Adams said.
"Are you serious?" said one of the reporters present, while another turned his face away. "That's disgusting."
Mr. Adams said he wants to install the newfangled traps, which cost between $ 300 and $ 400, in several locations in Brooklyn. If successful, he said he would look to expand the methodology citywide.
The pilot program has already hit one snag. Mr. Adams's office initially placed five boxes in and around Brooklyn Borough Hall, but one was disabled by a very large rat. "It was so big it broke the spring mechanism in the box so that it was no longer functioning," said Jonah Allon, Mr. Adams's spokesman.
Though New York's "War on Rats" is as old as the city itself, the methods keep changing.
Back in 1865, an exasperated reporter for The New York Times wrote that "traps are of no use whatsoever," and that the solution would be to "engage a Pied Piper to charm the vermin to their destruction."
More recently, after the Giuliani administration escalated the anti-rat campaign -- using three kinds of rat poison -- an exterminator in Manhattan and Brooklyn told The Times that the rodent population had been "astronomical for the last two years," and added: "They are healthier than ever. You see them all bloated, either fat or pregnant."
There was an attempt at rat birth control, first tested in 2011 and then rolled out by the Department of Health as a pilot program in 2017; it is still used in parts of the city.
Then the Metropolitan Transportation Authority ran a six-month, $ 1 million trial of the "fertility management bait" in subways in 2013, and said in 2017 that it would expand to additional stations following "promising results." But rodent and pest control experts said that while the plan may have slowed down breeding somewhat, it has not had a quantifiable effect.
In 2017, the de Blasio administration offered a $ 32 million plan, part of which involved killing rats by stuffing their burrows with dry ice, a method approved by the E.P.A. (In one Chinatown park, packing burrows with dry ice resulted in the deaths of 1,200 rats -- suffocated by the release of carbon dioxide -- and a reduction of rat burrows from 60 to two, officials said.)
That plan is generally effective, said Jason Munshi-South, a professor of biology at Fordham University who has studied New York City's rats. But it requires a lot of labor and energy; someone has to stuff the dry ice in thousands of burrows and then monitor the nests.
In unveiling his new rat trap, Mr. Adams -- who held a so-called Rat Summit last year -- went on a tirade against Mr. de Blasio's 2017 plan, which included using mint-scented, rat-repelling garbage bags that, by many accounts, do not seem to work. He showed a video of rodents crawling inside one of the bags.
"None of these have noticeable results," said Professor Munshi-South, who said he had seen rats feeding from Mint-X bags. "The day-to-day experience of people in the city is that rats are a problem, and it's getting worse."
Professor Munshi-South described Mr. Adams's solution as a "dunk tank at a carnival where the rat falls in and drowns." Still, he added, "It's beneficial in that you're not spreading poison."
But he said it will ultimately prove futile until New York solves underlying issues like proper garbage etiquette. Even if 90 percent of the city's rats were killed, the survivors could potentially breed faster because of less competition for food, he said.
"You may be harvesting rats like grains," he said.
Mr. Adams did say that the city's human residents bear much of the responsibility for curbing the rat population in New York City.
"New Yorkers need to understand that they have a role in stopping this," he said. "I don't believe we have built in a right culture of how to dispose of our garbage. People have not made the connection between what your neighbors are doing with their garbage, and how this feeds the problem."
A news release for the event said that Mr. Adams would "display 90 rats caught during new pilot program," but there were actually only about 20 in the new trap.
Rat sightings reported to the city's 311 hotline have soared nearly 38 percent, to 17,353 last year, up from 12,617 in 2014, according to an analysis of city data by OpenTheBooks.com, a nonprofit watchdog group, and The Times. In the same period, the number of times that city health inspections found active signs of rats nearly doubled.
As the rats in New York City have swelled in numbers and physical size, so has the business for pest control.
"It's gross but it's helping people," Peter Golia, who runs Rat Trap Distribution, said as he held aloft a bag of rat carcasses. "If you put a dead rat in a garbage with poison, it's degrading into the ground and contaminating the soil."
Still, he was coy about the trap's precise rodent-killing recipe, calling it "an all-natural solution."
"It's an alcohol, oil and vinegar-based solution," he said vaguely, adding: "It's organic!"
"You could actually drink that and you probably wouldn't die," he said. "Well, maybe a little sick."

Texto completo: Count Scarlett Johansson as one of Woody Allen's few remaining supporters.
The actress, who has starred in films by the controversial director including "Match Point" and "Vicky Cristina Barcelona," says she believes Allen when he denies accusations that he sexually molested his adopted daughter Dylan Farrow when she was 7 years old.
"I love Woody," Johansson told The Hollywood Reporter in an interview out Wednesday. "I believe him, and I would work with him anytime."
Johansson, 34, didn't stop there.
"I see Woody whenever I can, and I have had a lot of conversations with him about it," she added. "I have been very direct with him, and he's very direct with me. He maintains his innocence, and I believe him."
Other actors who previously worked with Allen, including Timothée Chalamet and Natalie Portman, have since come out in support of Farrow.
In a 2014 interview with The Guardian, Johansson was less direct about unabashedly voicing support for Allen. "I don't know anything about it," she said at the time. "It would be ridiculous for me to make any kind of assumption one way or the other."
That article was published a month after Farrow wrote an open letter in The New York Times, detailing for the first time in public what she allegedly went through.
"I was 7 years old, Woody Allen took me by the hand and led me into a dim, closetlike attic on the second floor of our house," Farrow wrote.
"He told me to lay on my stomach and play with my brother's electric train set. Then he sexually assaulted me. He talked to me while he did it, whispering that I was a good girl, that this was our secret, promising that we'd go to Paris and I'd be a star in his movies."
In that 2014 piece, Farrow also called out celebrities who had worked with Allen, including Johansson, Cate Blanchett and Emma Stone.
She wrote, "What if it had been your child, Cate Blanchett? Louis C.K.? Alec Baldwin? What if it had been you, Emma Stone? Or you, Scarlett Johansson? You knew me when I was a little girl, Diane Keaton. Have you forgotten me?"
The alleged abuse happened in 1992 at the Connecticut home of Allen's ex, and Farrow's adoptive mother, Mia Farrow. Allen, now 83, has consistently denied the allegations.
Connecticut officials investigated when the allegations first came to light and though the prosecutor found probable cause to press charges, none were filed.

In Bahamas, 'crisis of epic proportions'

Texto completo: Desperate residents stranded on rooftops amid swirling currents. Rescue efforts stalled by flooded vehicles and roads turned to rivers. Communications in ruins and basic infrastructure — including shelters, hospitals, and public buildings — under water.
And all around, vicious winds and crashing waves brought on by Hurricane Dorian, one of the most powerful storms recorded in the Atlantic, continued to whip the low-lying islands of the northwestern Bahamas for a second day.
“This was a crisis of epic proportions," said Marvin Dames, the minister of national security of the Bahamas, to reporters. Seven people have died, but “unfortunately, we will see more deaths," he said, adding that he expected children to be among them.
Hurricane Dorian first made landfall in the Bahamas as a Category 5 storm Sunday, but then it lingered, pummeling the low-lying Grand Bahama and Abacos islands, blocking even a basic accounting of the number of victims and the destruction. The true extent of its toll is only beginning to emerge as the storm began to pull away.
Cindy Russell, a resident of Marsh Harbour whose home was destroyed, said she had no words to describe what Dorian left in its wake.
“It's like we just need to be rescued and put on another island to start over again," she said. “Complete devastation."
Though the hurricane, now a Category 2, was pushing its way toward Florida, it was not expected to clear the islands until close to midnight Tuesday.
Over 2 million people along the coast in Florida, Georgia, and North and South Carolina were warned to evacuate as Dorian moved northwest. While the threat of a direct hit on Florida had all but evaporated, Dorian was expected to pass dangerously close to Georgia and South Carolina — and perhaps strike North Carolina — on Thursday or Friday.
A video from a helicopter flyover showed entire neighborhoods reduced to unrecognizable fields of rubble, houses crushed into splinters, and boats tossed into heaps like toys. About 60 percent of the land is under water, satellite company Iceye said Monday. That includes the airport.
“Storm surge is the No. 1 killer in a tropical storm," said Dennis Feltgen, a meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center in Miami, speaking of the rising of the sea that results from the wind and pressure changes brought on by a storm.
In Freeport, the largest city on Grand Bahama, Sarah Kirkby watched helpless as a massive tidal flood poured in and inundated her house.
“It was absolutely terrifying," she said. “I have never seen water come in like that. You don't realize the power until you're in it."
Some local rescue efforts began Tuesday, she said, as the water began to recede, with neighbors manning Jet Skis to rescue people trapped on their roofs — but it was unclear where they might go, since many shelters were also flooded or damaged by the storm.
The islands in the northwestern Bahamas that were hit the hardest — the Abacos Islands and Grand Bahama — are 30 feet at their highest point, and the storm surge reached up to 23 feet, not counting the waves, said Joel Cline, the Tropical Program Coordinator at NOAA.
On the Abaco Islands, east of Grand Bahama, officials believe whole towns have been wiped out.
Caribbean disaster response managers say that they may not be able to get any firsthand information out of the islands until Wednesday.
The Bahamas are no stranger to hurricanes. But Dorian, with sustained wind speeds of 185 miles per hour, ranks as one of the strongest to ever make landfall, tied with the 1935 Labor Day hurricane.
The powerful storm's sluggish pace ensured steady, brutal destruction.
On Tuesday, many residents faced the terrifying choice between staying in their rapidly-flooding homes or plunging into the volatile waters to seek shelter.
Tim Aylen, a Grand Bahama resident, waded through chest-deep storm surges with his wife and young son, spurred on by fear and horror. He barely had time to make the decision to flee.
“We have experienced a lot of hurricanes in our time, but nothing like this," he said.

Texto completo: Headnote Learning Black History Year Round
Counting down to liftoff. Dangerous trips to the upper reaches of Earth's atmosphere. Gravitational forces powerful enough to pull blood from the eyes. The sound of immense power unleashed in barely controlled fury. Thundering toward the sun. Zero gravity.
Born in 1933 in Kansas City, Kan., Edward Joseph Dwight was an altar boy who visited the local airport every day, where he studied and drew the airplanes. He loved art, but his dream was to fly. "This was a white man's world," he said of his early passion. "I never thought for a minute that I would really fly an airplane. This was crazy."
But a front-page story in his local newspaper fueled Dwight's ambitions: The plane of an African-American pilot from his hometown had been shot down in Korea. "He was standing on a wing of a jet ... and I was like, Oh my God, they're letting Black folks fly jets," he said during an interview.
Dwight enlisted in the U.S. Air Force in 1953, where he rose through the ranks: from cadet to second and then first lieutenant, and later, to captain. While training to become a test pilot, he attended night classes at Arizona State University, graduating in 1957.
On Nov. 4, 1961, Dwight received a signed letter from President Kennedy's office that read: "I'm inviting you to become America's first Negro astronaut... this is very exciting because if this project succeeds, you will probably end up being the greatest Negro that ever lived."
The news brought immediate attention from local and international media: Dwight had become the first African American astronaut trainee.
A New York Times headline read: "Negro Astronaut Aiming for Moon." The Indianapolis Recorder reported: "Kansas Native in Line as First Sepia Astronaut." The United States Information Agency sent photos of Dwight to newspapers worldwide. "I was sending out 5,000 press photographs a month, and I made 176 speeches the first year," Dwight told Ebony magazine in 1984.
The civil rights movement and the space race seemed to have embraced. But after Pres. Kennedy's assassination, NASA did not select Dwight. He later shared that the racial politics and a lack of career opportunities encouraged him to resign from the Air Force in 1966, never having gone into space.
He then worked a few jobs and eventually moved to Denver, Colo., where he would resume one of his childhood passions: art.
Dwight studied at the University of Denver, earning his MFA in 1977. During that time, he gained a reputation as a sculptor.
Now 85, Dwight's private Denver studio, Ed Dwight Studios, is one of the largest privately owned production and marketing facilities in the western United States.
His commissions include: Underground Railroad Memorial, Patterson, N.J.; Denmark Vesey, Charleston, S.C.; Medgar Evers Memorial, Alcorn, Miss.; Martin Luther Jr. & Coretta Scott King Memorial, Allentown, Pa.; and Tulsa Race Riot Memorial, Tulsa, Okla.

Texto completo: When the Washington Post hired Margaret Sullivan as a media critic in 2016, no one knew that she would become what every single other media “critic” in the national press is: an apologist for everything wrong about the industry she’s supposed to be critiquing.
A case in point is Sullivan’s latest column, which accuses President Trump of “ramping it up” with his “attacks on the news media” ahead of the 2020 election. She describes these "attacks" as “ugly and destructive.” At no point does she address the shocking amount of lies and deliberate misrepresentations by the media (including in her own paper) about Trump and the administration.
Here’s just one blatant falsehood the Post spread in early August about Trump’s visit to a hospital right after the mass shooting in El Paso:
As Trump exchanges pleasantries with doctors and others at the University Medical Center of El Paso, the video shows him pausing to reminisce about dueling rallies that he and [Democratic presidential candidate Beto O’rourke] staged in El Paso in February focused on immigration and border security. “That was some crowd,” Trump says of his event. “We had twice the number outside. And then you had this crazy Beto. Beto had like 400 people in a parking lot, and they said his crowd was wonderful.” The video shows no one responding to Trump’s assertion before convening for group photos.
In fact, this is untrue. For as long as the audio is on, you can hear the people off camera laughing at Trump’s remarks, which were clearly made in jest. Immediately thereafter, you see one of the hospital personnel lift up his pant leg at the ankle to show his sock embroidered with “TRUMP.” (See it for yourself here.)
When the Post misrepresents even a harmless dialogue like this for the sole purpose of embarrassing Trump, it isn't hard to understand why he feels the way he does. So why is the story always about Trump’s “attacks” on the media, rather than his response to demonstrably false reporting?
The national media march in lockstep with the same story lines and opinions opposing this White House. They talk to the same “experts.” They even cower and change their coverage when #TheResistance mob gets mad.
Even their supposedly dissenting voices are apologists for overwhelming media narratives. New York Times conservative Ross Douthat began his Wednesday column rebutting the “white supremacy” hysteria thusly: “The American right in the Trump era has a racism problem.”
That’s the pro-conservative voice of our nation’s premier newspaper.
Sullivan could be right that Trump is “ramping it up” against the news media. But where is there a media critic in the national press to say there’s a legitimate reason for that?

Texto completo: New York City  is dedicating an official to fighting hate crimes at a time when anti-Jewish hate crimes have skyrocketed across the five boroughs. 
Deborah Lauter started August 26 as executive director of the Office for the Prevention of Hate Crimes. An appointee of Mayor Bill de Blasio, Lauter has spent much of her career working forJewish-affiliated groups, including two decades with the Anti-Defamation League.
NYPD statistics show hate crimes in the city increased 67% in the first five months of this year, compared with the same period in 2018; anti-Jewish crimes increased 82 percent.
Of the 148 crimes reported, 85 were anti-Jewish - over 50 percent of the total. Of those 85 crimes, 80 percent were the drawing of swastikas.
"Clearly, I think the incidents that we've been seeing are coming out of Brooklyn, and the Hasidic community in particular," Lauter said. "They are the most visibly Jewish, and they've been the targets of atrocious attacks."
On Friday, a Queens beach club reported that its playground had "Heil Hitler" drawn in big block letters, club walls painted with a red swastika, the words "gas chamber" painted on a door, along with racial slurs against black people, according to The New York Times. That incident remains unsolved.
Lauter's office will coordinate the city's response to hate crimes in the city, seek to prevent them from occurring, help people who report hate crimes, as well as "fostering healing for victims and their communities."
Lauter, 62, will be paid $150,000, according to B. Colby Hamilton, a spokesman for the Mayor's Office of Criminal Justice, to whom Lauter reports. Hamilton said Lauter's budget will be $1.7 this fiscal year, decreasing to $710,000 in the following years.
The NYPD tracks hate crimes that are reported to be targeting various groups, including "Anti-Arab, "Anti-Black," "Anti-Buddhist," "Anti- homosexual (Lesbian)," "Anti-Islamic (Muslim)," "Anti-Jewish," "Anti-LGBT (mixed group)," "Anti-Male homosexual (Gay)," "Anti-Other Ethnicity/national origin," "Anti-Transgender" and "Anti-White." The direction of trendlines are mixed, with some up and some down, according to NYPD figures.
Lauter, whose office will include 5 or 6 staffers, has done stints as executive director of a pro-Israel political action committee in San Francisco, at the Jewish Federation of Atlanta and 20 years at the Anti-Defamation League.
While living in Atlanta in the 1990s -- where she was called epithets online by the Ku Klux Klan -- she was herself a victim of a hate crime: at her home, she said: a vandal or vandals who were never caught left pork and shellfish products in her mailbox. (Jews who are obey Jewish dietary laws -- Lauter said she keeps kosher -- do not eat pork or shellfish.)
"When it happened to me personally, I realized how much it meant to my identity and how much fear it raised," she said, adding: "These were obviously products that Jews don't eat, and they were well aware that I was a Jew and the position I held, and it was pretty terrifying... in the scheme of things, I was not assaulted and the home wasn't vandalized... but it was pretty terrifying for

Texto completo: Joseph Hays was a Truro farmer, husband, father and a devout Catholic.
But for much of his life, he was known as the man who'd brought the pope to Iowa.
Hays died Saturday surrounded by family, according to his obituary. He was 78. He had received hospice care for several months after being diagnosed with cancer, the Catholic Mirror reported.
Passionate about land issues and conservation as a young farmer and dad, Hays wrote a letter to Pope John Paul II, inviting him to visit the heartland during the pope's scheduled tour of the United States 40 years ago next month. He brought the letter to his parish — Immaculate Conception Church in St. Marys, Iowa — where Hays' pastor was ready to help his cause.
"Our prayer here in the heartland of our United States is that more people ... develop true concern for our land and its use by mankind," he wrote in orderly cursive in a two-page letter dated July 19, 1979. "In this way, we can be a stepping stone in the proper use of our land for the betterment of mankind."
The pastor connected Hays to then-Des Moines Bishop Maurice Dingman days later, according to reports from the time. The bishop helped relay the letter to the Vatican, resulting in what would become one of the most iconic events in Iowa history.
Eleven weeks later, on Oct. 4, 1979, Urbandale's Living History Farms was host to an estimated 350,000 people — more than the current populations of Iowa's two largest cities combined, and 50,000 shy of the turnout for the 1969 Woodstock music festival. A group of 99 Iowans reportedly walked 150 miles to and from the outdoor mass.
"You are stewards of some of the most important resources God has given to the world," Pope John Paul II told the sea of people. "Therefore, conserve the land well, so that your children's children and generations after them will inherit an even richer land than was entrusted to you."
The pope fulfilled Hays' wish twice over. He also visited St. Patrick's, a tiny church in the countryside near Cumming.
The front page of The New York Times anticipated the novel visit. As reported in the Register the following day, the pope read his sermon to 205 parishioners as a baby cried and a fly buzzed around his head.
A veteran and chaplain Hays was born Sept. 11, 1940, to Francis and Jenny (Bertoletti) Hays, according to his obituary. The family moved from Illinois to Iowa when Hays was just six. After graduating from high school in 1959, he married Ann Adams in 1961 at St. Bernard Catholic Church in Osceola. Together, they had four children.
Hays served 27 years in the U.S. Navy Reserve, earning the rank of chief petty officer, his obituary said. He also served AMVETS, a national veterans service organization, in local, statewide and national roles, including as a Department of Iowa commander. In the past year, he'd been the organization's statewide chaplain.
"He was an excellent chaplain," said Clark Leckington, executive director of AMVETS Department of Iowa. "He was very religious. He's the one that took the pope around."
Leckington said Hays was known for his deep "bullfrog voice" and being active in political causes he cared about, including caucusing for his favorite candidates.
Hays worked for John Deere for 36 years, his obituary said. He and his wife were also hobby farmers.
A funeral is scheduled for 10:30 a.m. Friday at St. Joeseph's Catholic Church in Winterset. He will be buried with full military honors at Hopeville Cemetery.

In Bahamas, rescue efforts crippled in 'crisis of epic proportions'

Texto completo: Desperate residents stranded on rooftops amid swirling currents. Rescue efforts stalled by flooded vehicles and roads turned to rivers. Communications in ruins and basic infrastructure — including shelters, hospitals and public buildings — under water.
And all around, vicious winds and crashing waves brought on by Hurricane Dorian, one of the most powerful storms recorded in the Atlantic, continued to whip the low-lying islands of the northwestern Bahamas for a second day.
“This was a crisis of epic proportions," said Marvin Dames, the minister of national security of the Bahamas, to reporters. Five people have died, but “unfortunately, we will see more deaths," he said, adding that he expected children to be among them.
Hurricane Dorian first made landfall in the Bahamas as a Category 5 storm Sunday, but then it lingered, pummeling the low-lying Grand Bahama and Abacos islands, blocking even a basic accounting of the number of victims and the destruction. The true extent of its toll is only beginning to emerge as the storm began to pull away.
Cindy Russell, a resident of Marsh Harbour whose home was destroyed, said she had no words to describe what Dorian left in its wake.
“It's like we just need to be rescued and put on another island to start over again," she said. “Complete devastation."
Though the hurricane, now a Category 2, was pushing its way toward Florida, it was not expected to clear the islands until close to midnight Tuesday.
Over 2 million people along the coast in Florida, Georgia, and North and South Carolina were warned to evacuate as Dorian moved northwest. While the threat of a direct hit on Florida had all but evaporated, Dorian was expected to pass dangerously close to Georgia and South Carolina — and perhaps strike North Carolina — on Thursday or Friday.
A video from a helicopter flyover showed entire neighborhoods reduced to unrecognizable fields of rubble, houses crushed into splinters, and boats tossed into heaps like toys. About 60 percent of the land is under water, satellite company Iceye said Monday. That includes the airport.
“Storm surge is the No. 1 killer in a tropical storm," said Dennis Feltgen, a meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center in Miami, speaking of the rising of the sea that results from the wind and pressure changes brought on by a storm.
In Freeport, the largest city on Grand Bahama, Sarah Kirkby watched helpless as a massive tidal flood poured in and inundated her house.
“It was absolutely terrifying," she said. “I have never seen water come in like that. You don't realize the power until you're in it."
Some local rescue efforts began Tuesday, she said, as the water began to recede, with neighbors manning Jet Skis to rescue people trapped on their roofs — but it was unclear where they might go, since many shelters were also flooded or damaged by the storm.
The islands in the northwestern Bahamas that were hit the hardest — the Abacos Islands and Grand Bahama — are 30 feet at their highest point, and the storm surge reached up to 23 feet, not counting the waves, said Joel Cline, the Tropical Program Coordinator at NOAA.
Photographs from flights over the island show trees sheared of limbs and leaves and saltwater ponds covering swaths of land where homes once stood. Some houses had their roofs ripped completely off, while others were reduced to piles of debris mired in water. All around, a rough ocean lapped at the low-lying islands.
On the Abaco Islands, east of Grand Bahama, officials believe whole towns have been wiped out. The area, whose population includes Haitian migrants living in shantytowns, is especially vulnerable.
Caribbean disaster response managers say that they may not be able to get any firsthand information out of the islands until Wednesday.
The Bahamas are no stranger to hurricanes. But Dorian, with sustained wind speeds of 185 mph, ranks as one of the strongest to ever make landfall, tied with the 1935 Labor Day hurricane.
The powerful storm's sluggish pace ensured steady, brutal destruction.
On Tuesday, many residents faced the terrifying choice between staying in their rapidly-flooding homes or plunging into the volatile waters to seek shelter.
Tim Aylen, a Grand Bahama resident, waded through chest-deep storm surges with his wife and young son, spurred on by fear and horror. He barely had time to make the decision to flee.
“We have experienced a lot of hurricanes in our time, but nothing like this," he said.

David Bowie’s Prized Tintoretto Masterpiece Will Go on View in Venice

Texto completo: David Bowie‘s long and multifaceted career redefined how audiences interpreted the boundary between musical and visual art, so it stands to reason that The Man Who Fell to Earth cultivated a big collection of landmark works during his lifetime. Bowie was a prolific fan of contemporary art, but one of his most treasured pieces was much older: an altarpiece made by the dramatic Italian master Tintoretto entitled The Angel Foretelling Saint Catherine of Alexandria of Her Martyrdom, which Bowie bought from a dealer in London in 1987. This week, Saint Catherine is going on display in Venice after having recently been purchased by Marnix Neerman, a Belgian collector who elected to place the altarpiece in a show devoted to Flemish and Italian Old Masters that will open at the Palazzo Ducale on September 5.
The altarpiece was purchased by Neerman for 191,000 pounds at a record-breaking Sotheby’s auction held in 2016 that featured a vast array of Bowie’s collection. The musician had pieces by Winifred Nicholson, Peter Lanyon, David Bomberg, Frank Auerbach, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Alan Davie, Marcel Duchamp and many others; he even collaborated with some famous stars like Damien Hirst on original works that were both kaleidoscopic and psychedelic.

Towards the latter decades of his life, Bowie also made visual art on his own as a way of digging himself out of a musical rut. And it was, above all, what he prized the most. “Art was, seriously, the only thing I’d ever wanted to own,” Bowie told the New York Times in 1988. “It has always been for me a stable nourishment. I use it. It can change the way that I feel in the mornings. The same work can change me in different ways, depending on what I’m going through.”
If you happen to be lucky enough to be visiting Venice within the next couple of months, The Angel Foretelling Saint Catherine of Alexandria of Her Martyrdom will be on display though March 2020.

Debunking blockchain, currency's new frontier

Resumen: A blockchain is a kind of database shared across a network of computers. While its first widespread use was for Bitcoin, the technology can be used for much more.

Texto completo: If you follow economics or technology in the news you’ve probably stumbled upon headlines with the word “blockchain.” And if you read those stories, you may have gotten the impression that blockchain is either (1) an earth-shattering technology that will completely transform finance, supply-chain management, and property records, and usher in a new era of online trust or (2) a currency-speculation scheme by amoral libertarians who don’t mind enabling drug deals and wasting electricity.
So which is it? As with nearly every human invention, blockchain can be used to achieve goals that are helpful, harmful, or some combination of the two. If you want to decide for yourself what the appropriate uses of blockchain are, you’ll first need to know what it is.
OK, so what is a blockchain? A blockchain is a kind of database, a structured way of storing information, shared across a network of computers.  
Once a piece of information – a record, in blockchain parlance – is entered into this database, it is time-stamped and added to a “block” that is shared across the network. Each block contains digital fingerprints, known as hashes, that link it to the blocks that came before and after it. Changing a record on one block would require changing all the other blocks in the chain, making the system extremely resistant to tampering.
“Blockchain is a time-stamped recorder of what’s going on in an infrastructure,” says Bina Ramamurthy, a teaching professor in the University at Buffalo’s computer science and engineering department. “It’s simply an enabling technology that enables trust.”
What was it created for? Researchers since the early 1990s have been working on creating distributed, tamper-proof records using chains of blocks, but the concept first rose to prominence in 2009, with the creation of the digital currency Bitcoin. 
In creating Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, a pseudonym for the unknown person or persons who drafted the original Bitcoin white paper and coded its initial blockchain database, solved a vexing problem in digital currency. If the money is nothing more than a file on a computer, how do you stop people from spending it more than once?
With traditional digital currency, like the kind you use when you make a credit-card purchase, a bank handles most of the transaction. The bank validates the credit card, checks the billing address, authorizes the payment, and puts a hold on your account. The merchant typically gets your payment within 24 to 48 hours. 
With Bitcoin and other so-called cryptocurrencies, you and the merchant create a record of the transaction, which gets uploaded to a block. The record is validated by the network. 
Having a bank validate and authorize digital payments costs money, which is why merchants often impose minimum spending limits on credit-card purchases. With cryptocurrencies, people can send micropayments, which can help change people’s lives in poorer countries. Professor Ramamurthy suggests, for instance, that cryptocurrencies could be used to pay schoolchildren to pick up plastic on the way to school.
With Bitcoin, the creation of new blocks is performed by computers. This process, known as mining, requires considerable computing resources, as well as vast amounts of electricity. Globally, Bitcoin mining consumes an estimated 66.9 terawatt-hours   per year, according to University of Cambridge as of this writing. That’s roughly the power consumption of Colombia. 
So blockchain is a Bitcoin thing, then? Not necessarily. While blockchain’s first widespread application was for Bitcoin, the technology can be used for lots of things. There are several other blockchain-enabled cryptocurrencies. 
Three years ago, Tavonia Evans, an entrepreneur and technologist in Atlanta, began working on developing $GUAP Coin, a currency aimed at keeping wealth within the black community. Unlike Bitcoin, $GUAP Coin doesn’t rely on mining, and thus uses far less energy. Instead $GUAP Coin uses a “proof of stake” model. In a proof-of-stake model, purchases are validated by those who already have the coins. Currently $GUAP Coin has about 2,000 users, says Ms. Evans.
“There’s a lot of money that flows out of African American communities and doesn’t flow back into the community,” she says. “I want black people to be able to get in and say, ‘This is our spending power.’”
Other applications for blockchain have nothing to do with cryptocurrencies. The London-based digital platform Provenance is using blockchain to attempt to improve transparency in the global fishing industry, which is notorious for slavery and overfishing. The United Nations World Food Program is currently using blockchain to distribute food vouchers to Syrian refugees, and others have proposed using the technology for everything from tracking carbon credits to providing a secure identity for stateless persons. 
Last month, The New York Times announced the News Provenance Project, which uses blockchain to verify the authenticity of photos, and aims to expand into validating other journalistic content.
“One of the beautiful things about blockchain,” says Ms. Evans, “is that it’s very visible, it’s very transparent.”
“I see it giving the power back to the individual,” she says. “Giving real value to whatever it is that they offer to the world.”

Texto completo: Shows at Madison Square Garden, Barclays Center and MetLife Stadium suck up a lot of oxygen in the press, thanks to the biggest of headliners. But where the New York music scene shines is in the clubs and venues open most nights of the week, with bands that may be the next big thing, or have found their hardcore fans, or even are just getting their start in the industry. Each month, we bring you five different concerts featuring independent or new acts, headlining in one of these smaller clubs. It's a chance to not only discover your new favorite artist, but also be telling the truth when, five years from now, you say to your friends "I saw them when they were small..."
Fontaines D.C.  
The Irish post-punk crew finds inspiration in poets (as a collective, it's released two poetry compilations themselves) as much as musical predecessors. Debut album "Dogrel" has received critical raves, and earned press from Pitchfork and The New York Times, among others. Fans of The Clash might discover their new favorite band. (Friday, Music Hall of Williamsburg; September 10, Bowery Ballroom)
Stream: "Too Real"
High Waisted
The surf pop-rock New York outfit preps for its upcoming national tour with a midweek date in Brooklyn. This show is for a great cause, too -- it's a fundraiser for Happy Period, an organization which provides menstrual hygiene kits to homeless and low income people. (September 13, Brooklyn Bazaar)
Steam: "Free Throw"
Boy Harsher  
Dark, with minimal synth lines driving bass and drums, the duo's sound has received rave reviews. This year's "Careful" album is a slice of goth-industrial that feels as big as a film score, while still remaining as intimate as a whisper. Recommended in particular for fans of "cold wave" bands like Kraftwerk. (September 17, Music Hall of Williamsburg)
Stream: "Come Closer"
CupcakKe  
To read the Chicago emcee's discography is to read a Penthouse Forum vocabulary list -- she carries the flag for sexually-explicit women rappers further than almost any prior artist. She created a remix of "Old Town Road" this past spring, retitling it "Old Town Hoe," because of course she did. She also plans to give away $10,000 to one lucky fan each night of her upcoming tour. (September 24, (le) Poisson Rouge)
Stream: "Whoregasm"
Snow Tha Product 
She's only released one "official" album, 2011's "Unorthodox," but the San Jose emcee has more than a decade's worth of songs spread out over EPs, mixtapes, and singles. She's also got more than 800K subscribers on YouTube for both her music videos and vlogs; the star broke free from the major label system last year. (September 26, Elsewhere; September 27, Gramercy Theatre)

The 10 best new shows coming this fall

Texto completo: TV is about to become bigger this fall. A whole lot bigger.
In addition to the usual crop of new shows from broadcast networks, cable channels and streaming services, two new players will jump into the game in fall 2019: Apple TV+ and Disney+.
Disney will unveil "The Mandalorian," the first live-action TV show in the "Star Wars" franchise, with the service's Nov. 12 launch. Apple, which has not yet announced a debut date, is betting on star power, including Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon and Steve Carell in drama "The Morning Show."
And some old favorites will return, including the long-awaited third season of Netflix's "The Crown" ( Nov. 17), with Oscar-winner Olivia Colman stepping in the role of Queen Elizabeth II. Series such as ABC's long-running family sitcom "Modern Family" (Sept. 25) are also coming back for one last season.
To help you sort through this fall's avalanche of television, we chose the 10 most exciting new series.
'Undone' Amazon Prime (Sept. 13)
"BoJack Horseman" creator Raphael Bob-Waksberg joins forces with Kate Purdy ("Cougar Town") for this adult animated series that embraces darkness. "Undone" is a magical realist drama about Alma (Rose Salazar), a directionless woman in her late 20s who survives a terrible car accident and discovers she has an ability to move through time and communicate with her dead father. The series touches on themes of family history and self-destruction, and uses its animation to beautifully and render eerily realistic sketches of its talented cast, which includes Bob Odenkirk as Alma's father. The result is a series that deliberately lives in the uncanny valley, much like its protagonist.
'Country Music' PBS (Sept. 15, Sundays at 8 EDT/PDT; check local listings)
Because aKen Burns documentary is almost always a gripping, informative and gorgeously scored examination of American history, it's natural for the celebrated director to point his lens at country music, a uniquely American cultural phenomenon. The 18-hour, comprehensive look at the genre's rise genre is not just for diehard fans. It looks at the influences of African instruments and rhythm and blues, among others, includes interviews with dozens of artists and historians, and features an excellent soundtrack.
'Stumptown' ABC, Sept. 25 (Wednesdays at 10 EDT/PDT)
Cobie Smulders ("How I Met Your Mother") returns to TV with the butt-kicking moves she learned from her Marvel films ("The Avengers"). Except Dex, her damaged private investigator character on "Stumptown," drinks and gambles far more than S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Maria ever would. Based on a graphic novel, "Stumptown" which also stars Jake Johnson, follows Dex as she solves (and sometimes mildly commits) crimes and other cases in Portland, Oregon, while she takes care of her younger brother (Cole Sibus), who has Down syndrome, and tries not to gamble her way into poverty. The pilot episode deftly mixes action, drama and comedy, and Smulders remains the magnetic leading lady she was for nine years on "Mother."
'The Unicorn' CBS, Sept. 26 (Thursdays at 8:30 EDT/PDT)
This new comedy is not about mythical horse creatures, but rather Walton Goggins' Wade, a widower who's reluctantly re-entering the dating pool as a rare middle-aged "unicorn" because he's not divorced or a cheating husband, has his own loving family and is earnest. It's a great setup for great romantic comedy, and has a stellar cast, including Rob Corddry and Michaela Watkins, along with the adorable Goggins, who can make almost anything funny.
'The Politician' Netflix (Sept. 27)
Prolific creator Ryan Murphy's first Netflix series preserves his stylish flair. "The Politician" stars Ben Platt ("Pitch Perfect," "Dear Evan Hansen") as a pathologically driven high-school student who is convinced he will become president of the United States. The first step on his journey is president of his senior class, and he will do anything to win. Co-starring Gwyneth Paltrow as Platt's mother, "Politician" is more akin to early seasons of "Glee" than recent seasons of "American Horror Story;" "Politician" has just the right amount of surrealism and melodrama without going over the edge, at least in early episodes.
'Back to Life' Showtime, (Oct. 6, Sundays at 8:30 EDT/PDT)
Fans of dark British comedies "Fleabag" and "Catastrophe" will be drawn to this new series created by and starring Daisy Haggard ("Episodes"). The understated but affecting series follows Miri, a middle-aged woman who returns to her parents' house after 18 years in prison. "Life" is awkward, sweet, sad and witty, and wisely takes its time to unfurl Miri's past, initially withholding the reason she was sent to prison.
'Living With Yourself' Netflix (Oct. 18)
In this new comedy from "Daily Show" writer Timothy Greenberg, the great Paul Rudd stars as Miles, a depressed, struggling and unmotivated man who can't even seek fertility doctors. He seeks out an unconventional treatment for his malaise at a strip-mall spa, and receives much more than he bargained for. Without spoiling the first episode's major twist, let's just say the riotously smart series gives you a double dose of Rudd.
'Modern Love' Amazon (Oct. 18)
This effervescent romance, based on the New York Times column, is as sweet as apple pie without becoming sickly. "Love" is structured as an anthology series about love. That could mean a relationship between an overprotective doorman and an apartment resident, or someone with bipolar disorder worried about revealing it to their new flame. The joyful series stars Anne Hathaway, Tina Fey, John Slattery, Dev Patel and Cristin Millioti.
'High School Musical the Musical the Series' Disney+ (Nov. 12)
An extension of Disney Channel's "High School Musical" franchise, this mockumentary chronicles students' efforts to put on a production of the musical. The tongue-in-cheek approach offers enough new and old music to satisfy fans but creates modern new characters to anchor the stories. Aimed at teens (or nostalgic millennials) instead of Disney Channel's kid and tween audience, "High School" is self-aware and self-effacing. It does almost everything right that NBC's ill-fated "Rise" did wrong, and is genuinely funny. "The Mandalorian" (which was unavailable to preview) will get much of the attention when Disney+ launches, but don't write off this sitcom as just for kids.
'His Dark Materials' HBO (expected in November)
The world of Phillip Pullman's classic fantasy trilogy comes to life, in far more detail (and with better writing) than the failed 2007 film "The Golden Compass." With each planned season based on one of Pullman's novels, "Materials" (already renewed for a second) gives more depth to the story of Lyra (Dafne Keen), the bright young girl living in a world slightly different than our own (human souls live outside their bodies in animals called "daemons"). Co-starring Lin-Manuel Miranda, James McAvoy and Ruth Wilson, the steampunk-style fantasy world might satisfy HBO viewers who miss the high fantasy that "Game of Thrones" brought them for so long.

TRUMP AND XI CAN BOTH WIN THEIR TRADE WAR STEP BACK FOR SIX MONTHS AND WORK TO MAKE IT BETTER, OR THINGS WILL TURN UGLY FAST

Texto completo: It is impossible to exaggerate what a dangerous cliff the U.S. and China are perched on today.
If the current trade dispute tips over into a full-blown economic war - and that spreads to Chinese students and scientists being thrown out of America and American business executives out of China and that spreads to all the investments we've made in each other's countries being ripped out - the world as we've known it for the last four decades is going to be replaced with something much uglier, less prosperous, less stable and less able to meet global challenges, like climate change and cybercrime, that are barreling down on us.
This has become a really bad play. We have a juvenile, unstable U.S. president actually enacting trade policy via Twitter - ignoring the advice of his experts - and we have a pressured Chinese president who is afraid to appear to be kowtowing to any trade demands from the U.S. for fear that his domestic rivals will denounce him as weak and that pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong will be emboldened by his weakness.
So each man is trying to intimidate the other into submission by showing who has the biggest tariff.
We need a cease-fire now - and if no one else is going to propose the terms, I will.
President Donald Trump should say to President Xi Jinping: "For the next six months, we'll suspend all the tariffs that we've imposed. And in those six months we expect you to order from the top down an end to your worst trade abuses - and you know which ones we're talking about: stealing intellectual property, forcing technology transfers, restricting access, etc. You don't have to announce anything or put anything into law. Just get it done your own way and tell your people whatever you want. I won't tweet a word to embarrass you. And we'll re-evaluate in six months whether the results constitute meaningful progress.''
That's not a perfect outcome after two years of negotiations, but perfect is not on the menu. Only "better" is on the menu right now. I vote for better.
Don't get me wrong, Mr. Trump was right to insist that the U.S.-China trading relationship had to change. But Mr. Trump vastly underestimated in several ways how "easy" winning a trade war with China would be.
Mr. Trump, by doing the whole thing in public - with his ego-inflating tweets always intended to show that he was winning and China was caving - clearly prompted the Chinese to remind the U.S. president that they're not some dumpling restaurant in a Trump Tower that can be bullied into paying more rent. They're actually one-sixth of humanity, and they hold more than $1.1 trillion in U.S. Treasury bills, notes and bonds. That is 27% of all the U.S. government debt held by foreign countries, and they're pretty good at making stuff.
For instance, it takes about 22 hours on Amtrak to go by train from New York to Chicago. Beijing to Shanghai is about the same distance, and it takes China's bullet train 4.5 hours to make that trip. That's not a typo. And it partly explains why a lot of Chinese officials look at America today as a dysfunctional mess that elected a crazy man as president and that can't build anything big and hard anymore because it can't act together.
Also, while I respect the comprehensive approach Mr. Trump's actual trade negotiators took in these talks - they wanted China to enact laws and regulations that would outlaw stealing of intellectual property, forced technology transfers, certain government subsidies and to create a U.S.-China mechanism to verify compliance - it might have been too much change all at once for the Chinese system. That's not an excuse for Beijing. It's just a fact.
Mr. Xi seems to be saying that he can't write into Chinese law the market-opening, verification and transparency regulations that Mr. Trump demands because Mr. Xi would appear to be conceding to the demands of foreigners and because it would constrict the Communist Party's arbitrary powers. Mr. Xi has plenty of hard-liners around him trying to protect its companies from U.S. competition by telling Mr. Xi that the Americans' trade demands are really intended to undermine Communist Party rule.
I don't think Mr. Trump is looking to take down China. He just wants a deal he can boast about. But there are people around Trump who do want to use this trade war to topple Communist China - as if democracy, not massive global chaos, would automatically bloom in its wake. It's madness, but that is why this moment is so scary. Messrs. Trump and Xi could both go either way.
What Mr. Trump also underestimated is that we don't just have a trade access problem with China today, we also have a trust shortage problem. When all we bought from China were toys and T-shirts and cheap electronics, we did not care if they were communists, capitalists, authoritarians or vegetarians. But now that China wants to sell us many of the same high-tech products that America and Europe make - from 5G infrastructure to cellphones to advanced electronics - products that get deeply embedded in our society and can be dual use (civilian and military), we need a whole new level of trust between our societies.
Mr. Xi, for his part, completely misread how much Republicans, Democrats and the broad U.S. business community are behind Mr. Trump's unwillingness to tolerate China's trade abuses any longer - not when China wants to make and export all the same products that we do. If Mr. Xi thinks Americans will continue to tolerate the status quo in U.S. -China trade, he is badly mistaken.
So for all of these reasons it's best to go right now for a truce and a period of confidence-building, during which China proves that it really will open up and Mr. Trump proves to China that all he wants are results he can brag about - not a revolution in Beijing.
While those six months play out, Mr. Trump should sign the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal - which brings the 12 biggest Pacific economies, except China, into a global Pacific trade pact built around American values and standards - and then line up all of our European Union allies as well.
That way when we revisit this issue in six months, we can present China with a united front to formalize its trade openings. By then it won't be Mr. Trump versus Mr. Xi, but rather the world versus China over what are the best reciprocal rules for trade for all. That should be our goal, maneuvering China into a rules-based global competition.
If Messrs. Trump and Xi can forge a bigger deal right now, God bless them. I'll tip my cap. But everything I see today tells me that we should just focus on better. I'd be happy making some real trade progress now, lowering the temperature so we can have a more rational, long-term discussion about rules and avoiding a new Cold War with China that will destabilize the whole globalization system - a system that's also not perfect but, boy, you will miss it if it's gone.

Texto completo: A commercial dive boat with 39 passengers and crew members aboard was engulfed in flames early Monday and sunk hours later near the Santa Cruz Island shoreline off the Ventura County coast. By late Monday, authorities confirmed that 25 people died in the ordeal, with several others still unaccounted for, the Associated Press reported.
FIve of the boat’s six crew members were rescued.
By midday Monday, authorities had confirmed that four victims were found dead near the 75-foot vessel Conception, which departed Saturday from Santa Barbara Harbor for a Labor Day holiday weekend excursion. Later in the day, crews discovered four more bodies on the ocean floor near the wreckage of the vessel, Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said.
The AP reported that, by late Monday, the Coast Guard had confirmed that at least 25 people had died.
Torrance resident says ‘divine intervention’ kept him off deadly dive boat
What sparked the horrific fire, which was first reported to the Coast Guard via a frantic mayday call around 3:30 a.m., wasn’t immediately known.
“Our hearts go out to the families of the victims of this terrible tragedy,” Brown said at a somber news conference. “We understand the tremendous burden they are under right now as they wait to determine exactly what happened. We will be working diligently to get them as much information as possible as soon as possible.”
Authorities were continuing to search into the evening for more of the 33 passengers unaccounted for after flames tore through boat. The Conception also carried six crew members, five of whom were rescued after fleeing the burning craft, officials said.
“We will continue to search but we should be prepared for the worst outcome,” U.S. Coast Guard Capt. Monica Rochester said.
Firefighters responded to the blaze shortly before 3:30 a.m., about 90 miles from Los Angeles. Coast Guard Sector Los Angeles-Long Beach overheard a mayday call about 15 minutes earlier of a commercial vessel with 39 people aboard.
By the time crews arrived shortly after the mayday call, the boat was fully engulfed in flames with little anyone could do to save it, said Mark Hartwig, Santa Barbara County’s fire chief.
Crews from the Coast Guard, Santa Barbara Fire Department, Ventura County Fire Department and Vessel Assist responded. The fire crews were fighting the blaze when the vessel sank 20 yards off shore in 64 feet of water, officials said.
Authorities said that initial four recovered bodies had injuries consistent with drowning, according to The Associated Press.
Five of the boat’s crew members were rescued by a nearby boat.
“The crew was actually already awake and on the bridge and they jumped off,” Rochester told reporters at a news conference at the Channel Islands Harbor.
They were evacuated on to a good Samaritan’s boat, Grape Escape, the Coast Guard said. Two of the crew members had minor injuries, said Coast Guard Petty Officer Mark Barney.
“When we looked out, the other boat was totally engulfed in flames, from stem to stern,” Grape Escape owner Bob Hansen told The New York Times. “I could see the fire coming through holes on the side of the boat. There were these explosions every few beats. You can’t prepare yourself for that. It was horrendous.”
As the morning turned to afternoon, family members of the missing passengers trickled in to the Coast Guard station in Oxnard in search of answers.
Sheriff Brown told reporters that the passengers would have be identified through DNA, depending on the condition of their remains.
A woman who came to the harbor early Monday said, “My son was on that boat.” She was led away by a Ventura County firefighter.
At around 8:30 a.m. the vessel had a portion of the bow sticking out of the water, authorities said.
Rochester said that the missing passengers were sleeping below deck at the time of the fire. She said authorities were working with the owners of the boat which had been in “full compliance” prior to its trip departure.
Rochester said rescuers would continue searching through the night.
“This isn’t a day that we wanted to wake up to,” she said at the afternoon news conference.
Several photos on social media posted by the fire agencies showed the Santa Barbara Harbor-based vessel completely overtaken by flames.
According to the Worldwide Diving Adventures website, the boat was on its last day of a three-day diving excursion that started in Santa Barbara Harbor. The Labor Day weekend trip, which started Aug. 31, gave passengers the opportunity to see marine life and explore San Miguel Island, according to the website.
The Conception had departed at 4 a.m. Saturday with plans to return Monday.
The boat was launched in 1981 and had a 46-person capacity, according to its profile on the website of Truth Aquatics, the Santa Barbara company that owns the ship. It had rafts and life jackets for 110 passengers and a fixed CO2 engine room for fire suppression.
Divers sleep in a single room of bunk beds, according to a diagram of the Conception posted on the website.
Thomas Kruger, director of scuba operations at Dive N’ Surf in Redondo Beach, said the boat and the operator had a good reputation.
Dive N’ Surf has booked charters on the Conception and other dive boats operated by Truth Aquatics, but not for at least a year mainly because of the distance, he said.
“This has been way out of left field,” Kruger said in an interview Monday. “The boat has been a phenomenally good boat that was meticulously kept. There was nothing anytime they were diving that would have indicated an event like this.”
Dive boats of that size are typically inspected by the U.S. Coast Guard about once per year, Kruger said. Operators also generally perform regular checks of fire extinguishers and other safety devices whenever the boat goes out, he said.
“Having a boat of that caliber there is a lot that goes into maintaining those boats and the systems on them,” Kruger said.
The event had a major effect on the close-knit diving community. Calls have been coming in inquiring whether anyone local was on board, Kruger said. As of Monday afternoon, the identities of the victims had not been released and Kruger did not know if any local divers were on board.
“We are sending out our prayers and our hopes that we get some better news by the end of the day,” he said.
Dale Sheckler, a Torrance man who is an experienced diver, had planned on spending Labor Day weekend aboard the Conception, but a hip surgery sidelined those plans.
“I feel frightened and relieved at the same time,” Sheckler said. “I’m also sick about the lives that were lost. I’m upset about it. My heart goes out to them.”
Sheckler said he’s been on the Conception several times before, but hasn’t been on the vessel in well over a year.
“I think considering the fact that the crew lost one of their members, I think that people need to understand that the crew was probably unable to assist those in distress,” he said.
Members of the diving community also expressed their grief on social media. Many shared their thoughts on the Truth Aquatics Facebook page, some recounting their own diving experiences.

Others showed photos of the vessel’s sleeping area, pondering if passengers could have escaped.
Most, like Kruger, offered their condolences and prayers.
Sprinkled into the comments were those who questioned why members of the crew may have been the only ones to survive. That sentiment was addressed by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who Monday afternoon called for an “immediate and robust” investigation.
“It’s inconceivable that with all the safety regulations we have in place today, a fire on a boat can lead to the loss of life we saw this morning near Santa Cruz Island,” Feinstein said in a statement.
“We must know what fire-suppression systems and other emergency equipment are in place on these boats and whether they were in working order on the Conception. And we need to understand exactly how the crew was trained and, if they were awake and above-deck, why they were unable to alert or help rescue passengers.”
The Channel Islands National Park Service said that the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Department, Santa Barbara County Fire Department, United States Coast Guard are working with it as a unified command.
A one-mile safety zone was established around the perimeter of the incident while search-and-rescue efforts continue, officials said. A 3,000-foot flight restriction was also temporarily placed around the ship.
Authorities have established a Family Assistance Center at the Earl Warren Showgrounds, 3400 Calle Real, Santa Barbara, which is expected to remain open through Thursday. Information via phone is available from the Santa Barbara County Office of Emergency Management at 833-688-5551.

Texto completo: Producer Will Packer's films, such as the NWA biopic "Straight Outta Compton," Tiffany Haddish's breakout vehicle "Girls Trip" and the dance drama "Stomp the Yard," have generated more than $1 billion at the box office by making blockbusters that appeal to black audiences and beyond.
"Little," starring Issa Rae and "Black-ish" cast member Marsai Martin, was co-produced by Martin, who is 14, with whom he worked to develop and pitch the idea for a "Big"-in-reverse-style comedy. He talks about changing things up in Hollywood and working with a new generation of talented women.
Fast Company: You've collaborated with a lot of powerful women over the years, including Tiffany Haddish, Queen Latifah, and Taraji P. Henson. "Little" showcases the talent of Marsai Martin, both behind and in front of the camera. She's now the youngest person to have produced a Hollywood movie. What made you want to work with her?
Will Packer: This next generation of creatives is more comfortable with its voice than previous generations. They are more aware of their reach and their power. With the right leadership and guiding hand, the sky's the limit for them. Marsai is a great example. She's amazing in that she listens to me and allows me to give her advice. But she has a very clear idea of what she wants to do, and what her talents are. My job is to put her in a position to win.
FC: You broke into film in 1994 as an undergraduate at Florida A&M University by producing "Chocolate City," a drama about a young man attending a historically black college. You spent $20,000 on the film, which became a local hit. What did you learn from that experience?
WP: There is a benefit to naïvete -- you try everything and you're fearless. As an industry veteran, I think you still have to be fearless, even when you know that certain things may not work. You have (to remember) that you wouldn't be where you are if it wasn't for bucking trends and doing things in a nontraditional way.
I still have the philosophy that I have to attack this industry every day as if it's my first movie and I've got something to prove.
FC: With "Chocolate City," you tapped into an underserved audience that was hungry for films that spoke to their own experiences. Do you think the industry has changed its outlook on tailoring content for specific audiences?
WP: Being somebody who started off creating content for a niche audience, I was always feeling pressure from financiers, studios, distributors to bring the budgets down. But I understood how to get in under the hood and where to move the chips around in order to make (my films) palatable for a financier.
This is before people realized how big and fruitful my niche could be. I don't think anybody would say the urban -- or new American mainstream -- audience is some tiny niche now. Everybody knows that audience is a force to be reckoned with.
FC: Lately, your movies, like "Girls Trip" and your shows on OWN -- which include the reality dating show "Ready to Love" and the family drama "Ambitions" -- have focused on black women. You also acquired the popular black women's lifestyle site xoNecole. How do you identify content that appeals to this segment of the population?
WP: In today's environment of oversaturated content, if you're not making a movie for a specific somebody then you damn sure better be making it for everybody. But that's really, really hard to do.
So I think about (a specific) audience member. I think about what she does, what she likes, what she wants to see, what she hasn't seen and how she likes to see herself. I think about how I can make something that feels really specific and organic to her. And the stories usually evolve from that. "Girls Trip" was based on Essence magazine's annual music festival celebrating African-American culture and music. That was a real festival with real people, so it had a real texture to it.
FC: You are based out of Los Angeles and Atlanta, a major hub for black culture. Does having roots in Atlanta help your career?
WP: Living in Atlanta means I interact with my consumers daily. It gives me a leg up over my peers who don't leave the Hollywood bubble very often. The (2012) movie "Think Like a Man," which I produced and which was very successful, is based on Steve Harvey's book "Act Like a Lady, Think Like a Man." I reached out to Steve before it was a New York Times best-seller.
I was dropping my girlfriend off at the hair salon when I noticed somebody with the book -- it had been passed along to her, and there were two other people waiting to read it. I saw a demand (for the book) in a way that's not quantifiable, at least not in the ways that Hollywood usually thinks about intellectual property.
Ultimately, the book caught fire and multiple studios reached out to Steve. But to his credit, he said, "Will Packer was the first to talk to me about turning it into a movie."
FC: How has your role as a producer evolved since you founded your upstart production company, Rainforest Films, which you began while you were in college, to your current company, Will Packer Productions?
WP: I am what I like to call a "real" Hollywood producer. I've actually done every role on-set. I've held the boom. I've wrangled the cables. I understand physical production. So I'm not just an idea guy -- I'm also somebody who understands the full 360-degree process of the execution of an idea. Although I'm a macro person, I pay attention to the minutiae.

Texto completo: "I think unions are better at playing defense to stop bad things from happening than they are in making good things happen."
Steven Greenhouse
Former labor reporter for the New York Times
In his sobering new book on the state of organized labor in America, author Steven Greenhouse offers enough examples of the plight of U.S. workers to make this Labor Day feel less like a celebration than a dirge.
Greenhouse, the former labor reporter for the New York Times, writes in "Beaten Down, Worked Up" (Knopf, 397 pages, $27.95) of the fast-food worker in Milwaukee who, after her hour-long bus commute, was told to go home even without her minimum-wage pay because her manager didn't need her for that shift, after all.
Or there are the Uber drivers who work 60 hours a week and can barely make ends meet. Or the chicken processing plants where "the poultry workers say they literally pee in their pants because they're not given time to go to the bathroom," as Greenhouse told me in a recent phone conversation.
Labor unions, which won higher pay and benefits for workers in the 1930s and '40s, were always the champion for working people to resist such oppressive conditions. At mid-20th century, leaders like the legendary Walter Reuther (profiled in an excellent chapter in Greenhouse's book) won historic gains for UAW workers in Detroit that were widely emulated throughout industry and helped create the nation's middle-class prosperity.
But beginning with the failed PATCO strike by air traffic controllers in 1981, when then-President Ronald Reagan broke the controllers' union and fired thousands of its members, conservative forces have waged a relentless and largely successful fight to weaken labor unions through legislation and in the courts.
As a result, not only has union membership in America plummeted from about 20% of of the U.S. workforce in the mid-1980s to barely 10% today, but unions continue to struggle in their fight for a higher minimum wage, equal pay for women, and even basic safety conditions in places like poultry plants.
On this Labor Day weekend, we're now at what may be a new pivot point in that history. As Greenhouse told me, there is a new militancy among workers in many fields, from classrooms to fast-food counters. But whether this translates into a new era of worker power remains very far from clear.
A labor awakening "If you asked me two or three years ago I'd say labor seems half asleep," Greenhouse said. But a number of militant actions, including the "D15" campaign for a $15 minimum wage for fast food workers and the strikes by low-paid teachers in West Virginia and elsewhere, organized labor seemed to be making some serious gains.
Unions "looked dead in the water and all of a sudden we had the biggest (teachers) strike in probably decades," he said. "Not only do we see 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 thousand teachers mobilized in various states but they had huge support from parents and kids. And that signaled a new energy and new wave of support for unions that we really haven't seen in many, many years."
He added, "Successful strikes beget more successful strikes. Successful militancy begets more successful militancy, just as the disaster of the PATCO strike discouraged more such strikes."
But this new militancy doesn't necessarily translate into a new day for unions.
"On one hand, we're seeing militancy in strikes, but we're not seeing huge successes in adding to labor's overall labor rolls," he said. "I don't think we're seeing nearly enough organizing among blue collar workers to say labor is back. But it's much more awake, more vigorous, than it was three or four years ago."
But to what end? Even with such militancy, Greenhouse said unions today don't play anywhere near the role they did at mid-20th century leading broad social change. In his book, Greenhouse includes a chapter on Reuther, who not only built up the UAW as a major force for workers but fought for broader social change.
"In the 1950s and '60s, the late '40s, the unions were the force in society pushing for progressive change, a strong social safety net," Greenhouse said during our talk. "Better health insurance, Social Security. They played a key role in (passing) Medicare. They played a key role in Medicaid and the civil rights legislation. And, more recently, I don't think Obamacare would have been enacted had they not put their all to get enough votes in Congress."
But with conservative Republicans in charge of Congress and the White House, organized labor has been forced onto the defensive.
"I think unions are better at playing defense to stop bad things from happening than they are in making good things happen," he said. "Whereas in the age of Reuther, they really helped make good things happen for workers and the public at large."
What the CEOs said Greenhouse takes a skeptical view of statements by business leaders that they acknowledge their duty to the community at large and not just to their bottom line. Such talk is cheap, he says.
The Business Roundtable, a group of CEOs from the nation's leading firms, issued a new "purpose of a corporation" philosophical statement in mid-August that recognized that all stakeholders, including employees and the community at large, are equally as valuable as the profit motive.
"Each of our stakeholders is essential," the statement from the Roundtable said. "We commit to deliver value to all of them, for the future success of our companies, our communities and our country."
In his book, Greenhouse notes that in 1990 the Business Roundtable issued a very similar statement affirming that profits alone were not enough. Corporations also had to focus on the welfare of workers, customers, suppliers and the community, the Roundtable said then.
But just seven years later, after a wave of conservative backlash about the primacy of shareholder value, the Roundtable backtracked, saying in a 1997 statement, "The paramount duty of management and boards of directors is to the corporation's stockholders."
So, Greenhouse said, let's see if the CEOs stick with the latest version of their dogma and live it in practice. If it really means this latest version of its philosophy, Greenhouse quipped on Twitter, the Roundtable would lobby for Congress to repeal the massive recent tax cut for corporations that mostly went to stock buybacks.
"It would be better for the nation if we use that 1 trillion dollars to fight things like the homeless crisis or the affordable housing crisis," he told me.
Looking ahead Reuther used to say that unions had to be active politically or otherwise what they gained at the bargaining table they could lose at the ballot box. With that in mind, unions are focusing on both state and federal elections, including next year's contest where unions will join other progressives trying to oust President Donald Trump.
A victory in 2020 would make life a little easier for organized labor. If nothing else, a Democratic president would get to appoint the majority of members to the National Labor Relations Board. That's the government referee of union-management disputes.
But that won't be enough. The American workplace is more troubled than the top half of society would like to admit, especially for low-wage workers and those not represented by unions
And Greenhouse's disquieting look at the state of labor in "Beaten Down, Worked Up" makes that clear. It will take more than a political win or two to set things right.

The students were detained by Customs and Border Protection officials "over the last week," the university said in a statement Friday. The students were "denied admission to the U.S. to continue their studies" and were sent back to China, ASU said.
"We are working as quickly as possible to coordinate with the federal government to understand the circumstances surrounding these actions and to rectify the situation," ASU said.
ASU said it has not been able to get answers on why the students were detained and sent back.
Despite returning to China, they're still enrolled at ASU, working through ASU Online, an ASU official said. The university expects some of the detained students to graduate this semester, the official said.
What U.S. customs agency says Contacted by The Arizona Republic, a spokesman for the agency said in a statement, "U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is charged with determining admissibility of aliens at ports of entry, under U.S. immigration law applicants for admission bear the burden of proof to establish that they are clearly eligible to enter the United States. In order to demonstrate that they are admissible, the applicant must overcome ALL grounds of inadmissibility.
"The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) broadly governs the admissibility and inadmissibility of aliens into the United States. INA Section 212(a) lists more than 60 grounds of inadmissibility divided into several major categories, including health-related grounds, criminality, security reasons, public charge, labor certification, illegal entrants and immigration violations, documentation requirements, and miscellaneous grounds.
"The Chinese students were deemed inadmissible to the United States based on information discovered during the CBP inspection."
Problems for international students The detentions come amid an increasingly tense relationship between the U.S. and China. But problems for international students aren't just affecting Chinese students at U.S. universities.
News outlets have reported delays and problems with visas for international students from other countries under the Trump administration. The New York Times reported students from various countries were facing issues with visas.
Earlier this week, the Harvard Crimson reported a Palestinian student was detained by Customs and Border Protection and sent home to Lebanon.
In that instance, the student claims customs officials found posts from people that included political views that opposed the U.S. on his friends' list.
The posts were not from the student himself, the student told the Crimson.
ASU also had to close its Confucius Institute, which was funded by the Chinese government, to continue receiving funds from the Department of Defense for a language program.
Students' electronics were searched The university said in a statement Friday that the detentions weren't based on academic dishonesty issues, despite a media report to the contrary. Customs officials haven't told ASU it was related to academic dishonesty, the university said.
"In fact CBP has given ASU no information on what has transpired," the university said.
If there were an academic dishonesty issue, that's the purview of ASU, not customs officials, ASU said.
"All of the students caught in this situation were academically eligible to return to ASU and to the United States under their visas," ASU said.
The detention happened as students were returning to the country for the fall semester.
Since then, ASU has reached out to "all levels of federal government," the university said. ASU President Michael Crow sent letters to Michael Pompeo, the U.S. Secretary of State, and Kevin McAleenan, the acting secretary of Homeland Security.
"In each case, the students were in possession of all needed documentation to enter the U.S. yet they were refused entry at the airport, told they needed to return to China, that they needed to pay for their own airline ticket to do so or face a ban from re-entering the U.S. for five years," Crow wrote to the federal officials.
Crow wants a review of the individual situations for the nine students and a review of the procedures that now include searching electronic devices carried by students who enter the U.S.
"In our country, where we value due process and celebrate the different ways in which our government behaves from that of the arbitrary and capricious behavior of other nations, it is beyond my comprehension how the U.S. government could establish and implement policies that bring about the outcomes we are now witnessing," Crow wrote.
Crow said the situation seemed to be similar to the Harvard student, which also involved customs officials looking at electronic devices.

Texto completo: In her debut book, Sarah M. Broom presents a powerful memoir of the New Orleans she experienced as a child (growing up in a family of 12 children), and the house that swallowed up the dreams and finances of her resilient mother.
Broom earned a master's degree in journalism from the University of California Berkley in 2004 and won a Whiting Foundation Creative Nonfiction Grant in 2016. She was a finalist for the New York Foundation for the Arts Fellowship in Creative Nonfiction in 2011, and has been awarded fellowships at Djerassi Resident Artists Program and The MacDowell Colony.
Her work has appeared in the New Yorker, The New York Times Magazine, The Oxford American and O, The Oprah Magazine, and others.
Today Broom lives in Harlem.
"The Yellow House" is a richly detailed memoir of your life, sharing not just stories of your immediate family but those of at least two preceding generations. Why was it important to you to devote so much detail to previous generations to fully tell this story?
I wanted to provide context, a kind of grounding, to situate the story in a lineage. To begin at the moment of my birth would have been dishonest, and also would have ignored the people who compose me and make me who I am. I was setting up a matriarchal world, establishing the women who preceded me within the City of New Orleans. The story of my mother's house felt, to me, indistinguishable from the story of my Grandmother Lolo and her many houses.
The neighborhood in which the yellow house was built was part of New Orleans East, touted in the early 1960s as a "new frontier" and a "Model City" like nothing that had come before it. Describe the idea behind its expected growth, and why it would eventually fail.
New Orleans East was an enormous area of the city, east of the Industrial Canal, a navigation channel opened in 1923. Long before New Orleans East, Inc. arrived, there was a collection of communities within the east including Orangedale Subdivision, where my mother eventually bought the yellow house. New Orleans East, Inc. began to build out the more easternmost parts of the area, which created a flurry of excitement and news stories. Eventually, the entire area of the city took on the corporate name. The East failed for many reasons — the oil bust, white flight which led to divestment, public policy and city planning choices, and inattention.
Your mother, Ivory Mae Soule Webb, was a 19-year-old widow when she bought the yellow house in 1961, paying the $3,200 price with life insurance money after her first husband's death. By 1964, when they moved in, she was remarried to Simon Broom, and they began married life with six children between them. Tell me about your mom's pride in her home, and how important it was to her to keep everything looking nice, inside and out.
My mother loved to make a beautiful home. She was raised by women who took pride in all the places where she lived. For my mother, owning a house of her own was buying into the American dream. Through home ownership, I suspect she learned quite a bit about the frailty of the American dream, about the critical importance of the solidity of the "ground" so to speak. (It was) understood through time that her investment might not build wealth for her as it might for someone else.
After several career moves and the devastation of Katrina, you eventually were drawn back to New Orleans. At the end you state: "The house was the only thing that belonged to all of us." Ultimately, what did (and does) the yellow house mean to you and your family?
It is to this day a repository. Witness to our lives. The place our mother paid for, in which she built a world full of joy and surprise and sometimes sadness, but it belonged to her and it still is ours even as a memory.

INDIA SAYS NO PLANS FOR WAR OVER KASHMIR

Texto completo: NEW DELHI - With tensions rising in the disputed Kashmir region, the Indian government said Friday that it had no intention of going to war with Pakistan and that any talk of a looming conflict was simply "fearmongering."
"The present narrative of the India-Pakistan situation by Pakistan, including the possibility of a war, is intended to project an alarmist situation," said Raveesh Kumar, an Indian government spokesman. "It is far removed from the reality on the ground."
India has come under increasing criticism for its decision in early August to revoke Kashmir's autonomy and lock down the area, arresting thousands and cutting off phone and internet service to millions.
Pakistan also claims parts of Kashmir, a mountainous region between India and Pakistan that has been racked by unrest for decades. Many people are worried that India's moves could further inflame the area, possibly even stoking a major conflict between the two archrivals, both of which have nuclear arms.
On Friday, Imran Khan, Pakistan's prime minister, said in an op-ed in The New York Times that "if the world does nothing to stop the Indian assault on Kashmir and its people, there will be consequences for the whole world as two nuclear-armed states get ever closer to a direct military confrontation."
India says Pakistan's strategy is to paint a dire picture of the situation, play up fears of nuclear war and scare the world into intervening in Kashmir, which India considers an internal matter.
Another U.S. soldier dies
An American soldier died during a combat operation on Thursday in Afghanistan, the Defense Department said, the third in just over a week.
The soldier, a member of the Army Special Forces, died in Zabul province, in the country's southeast, after disembarking a helicopter at the start of a joint mission with Afghan commandos, one department official said. The exact circumstances of his death remained unclear.
A statement from the Defense Department announcing the death did not provide any details.
The soldier's death comes as Taliban officials and State Department negotiators navigate the diplomatic details needed to finalize a plan for peace, one that is expected to include the withdrawal of American troops from the country.
The soldier's death brings the number of U.S. troops killed in combat so far this year to 15, the highest number of losses in a year since 2014, when the Pentagon announced the end of combat operations in Afghanistan.
Ex-PM sorry for tweet
A powerful storm has formed in the Atlantic, threatening Florida and parts of the Bahamas. But another formed on Twitter this week, after a former Canadian prime minister tweeted that she hoped Hurricane Dorian would strike President Donald Trump's Palm Beach, Fla., resort.
Forecasters are closely watching Dorian, which could potentially strike Florida early Tuesday as a Category 4 hurricane. But in a since-deleted tweet, former Canadian Prime Minister Kim Campbell responded to news of the threat by saying, "I'm rooting for a direct hit on Mar a Lago!"
On Friday, Ms. Campbell deleted the original message about Mar-a-Lago taking a hit - two days after it was initially posted - and apologized "to all it offended."
"I sh[oul]d know better," she wrote. "Mea culpa."

Texto completo: How To Be a Family
The Year I Dragged My Kids Around the World To Find a New Way To Be Together
Dan Kois

Little, Brown and Company: 336 pages, $25.98
--
An American family has moved to Holland, where their older daughter's conduct at school has landed them in a meeting.
"You can see a revolting attitude in her," the Dutch educator says of the 11-year-old -- who, back at home, was merely a quirky, opinionated, smart, above-average kid. "First of all," the girl says in response, "you tell me that I talk too much, and then you talk to me for like eight minutes straight."
The parents are aghast, a bit amazed. What have they done?
A year earlier, Dan Kois was sitting in a hot tub in Iceland, on assignment for The New York Times Magazine, where he is a contributor and has written several memorable and charming features. (The one about playing cards is great and appears in this book.)
He's also an editor at Slate, founding host of the "Mom and Dad Are Fighting" podcast, and writes an engaging Twitter account.
The Iceland trip sticks with him: How could families and mayors and lawyers and bricklayers all soak together, every night, when his own family was always so busy back at home, lusting after screens, everyone somehow bored and also miserable. It comes to a head when his younger daughter, Harper, is lying awake, close to midnight, lights on and teeth gritted. "I can't turn it all off!" she cries.
"[W]e were fundamentally living the wrong life ... we were doing being a family wrong," Kois decides.
So he and his wife, First Amendment lawyer Alia Smith, suddenly decide, without really consulting the children, to do what many of us have only dreamed of. Seeking togetherness, adventure, adversity -- but not the kind where you're late for soccer practice in suburban Arlington, Va. -- and wanting to discover "an existence that made more sense," they leave it all behind. They resolve to spend four months in each of the following: New Zealand, a midsized city in Holland, a beach town in Costa Rica and a town of 20,000 in Kansas.
Some bumps in the resulting book, "How To Be a Family," surface early as both a function of some less-than-stellar writing and a set of quotes and bits of history and news that aim to situate us. A bleak example: "[A]lthough the popular American view of New Zealand is a country of jolly white people -- some short like hobbits, some stout like dwarves, some tall like elves -- in fact, New Zealand is rapidly becoming one of the most diverse countries on earth."
Thankfully, Kois quickly recovers, returning to the kind of scene-based detail that animated his work from the Iceland trip that inspired the whole saga.
The way Kois describes the neighborhood sharing a communal trampoline is particularly rich. But soon, after backyard parties and excursions to edenic wild places in New Zealand and even some acquisition of the Maori language, a reader may be just as devastated as the family is when they decamp for Delft, Holland.
Matching the power of his insight about New Zealand's accident insurance fund, which allows his kids to play on a random trampoline without worrying about liability, Kois recounts the startling way Holland gave up being car-centric after a 1970s initiative called "Stop the Child Murder." Fifty years later, the country is fundamentally oriented around bicycling; the family gets by without a car for the four months they live beside the canals.
The book doesn't just amusingly collect magazine-length anecdotes; it's in Holland that the most important goals of the book begin to coalesce. This book shows how one family works, as a way of helping us all ask ourselves: How might (and ought) our own families best function?
The family ends up in Kansas, which feels anticlimactic, but magically, these pages are the book's best, featuring reporting and personal reflection and a section on faith that might be the start of a next big project. One of the greatest revelations? Kois discusses the power of a local public library, staffed by 20-something English majors, to give Kansas kids some privacy and a place to learn about a world far beyond the small town's borders.
The year over, this book cruising to an end, now what? In New Zealand, everyone was happy to be "middling," to be a "dog," whereas in Holland the goal is to be "normal." Costa Rica lets people check out from whatever seems to constitute real life for most of us. Maybe it's Kansas, where Kois gets back in touch with the avocation he's long ago abandoned (theater!), that has the room and pace to let a guy figure out who he really wants to be?
This is, and the author owns up to it, a deeply upper-middle-class, white and East Coast book. Readers of a Los Angeles-based newspaper, for example, might have mixed feelings to learn that one apparent solution to the family's problems might be ... moving to California.
Without giving away what actually happens, consider this: It's hard to imagine it not being a fun project to discuss this book with people you care about, who also care about you. Because, spoiler: What matters most to the Kois/Smith clan, even more than ambition and being part of the national conversation? Friends and family.
The best scene in the book finds the author riding along a Costa Rican beach at sundown with daughter Harper, their tires making a quiet shhhhhps sound on the sand. "This is so beautiful," he says. "Will you remember it with me?" "Yes," she says. "For my whole life."

Texto completo: Letter notes she's only one with plan but says it lacks 'measure of justice'
More than 60 black farmers, advocates and academics have signed onto a letter critiquing Sen. Elizabeth Warren's farm plan, saying it fails to adequately help African American farmers.
The letter, being circulated among liberal agriculture and civil rights activists, says presidential hopeful Warren (D-Mass.) has failed to take on structural problems at the Agriculture Department, which they call an "out of control agency" that employs "on-going discrimination" that harms blacks in the farming community, according to a draft of the letter.
Warren's plan largely focused on consolidation in the agriculture industry and leaves the USDA intact. It does include a section on black farmers and proposes auditing the department to be sure it's not discriminating, increasing funding to existing initiatives that offer legal services to those in danger of losing their farms, earmarking more funds for loans to minorities and fully funding the department's civil rights office.
"We feel as though you just can't throw money at the problem at USDA," said Lawrence Lucas, president emeritus of the USDA Coalition of Minority Employees, who helped write the letter and is collecting signatures for it. "You have to do a major overhaul of the system and make it functional."
In the letter, the advocates said they "applaud" Warren's efforts to address black farmers and noted that she's the only potential Democratic nominee to do so. But they also called on her to "correct factual errors" and "refashion" her plan into a proposal that "would provide black farmers, at long last, with some measure of justice," according to a draft.
The loss of black-owned farmland is a major concern among civil rights groups and academics who say that racist federal policies have led to blacks losing their land at much higher rates than whites and Hispanics. The problem has roots in the post-Reconstruction era but has persisted to modern times, with an estimated 6 million acres of black-owned farmland dispossessed from 1950 to 1969, according to a September cover story in the Atlantic titled "The Great Land Robbery: The shameful story of how 1 million black families have been ripped from their farms."
Warren has set herself apart in a crowded field of candidates by releasing a stream of policy papers. The strategy has fueled her rise in polls and has, so far, bolstered her image as someone who favors major changes to the federal government and knows exactly how she'd achieve these goals.
To date, most of the complaints about her policies have come from the center or right, with critics saying that her ideas are a mixture of unworkable, unconstitutional or too extreme. What's unusual here is that Warren's farm plan is being criticized by liberals saying her vision lacks the big, structural changes central to her candidacy.
Warren typically has tried hard to address the needs of blacks in her various plans and makes a point of talking about eradicating systemic racism in her stump speech. It's part of her larger attempt to woo African American voters key to securing the Democratic nomination and who have so far been cool to her candidacy.
"We have reached out to the group," said Saloni Sharma, a spokeswoman for Warren's campaign, after The Washington Post shared a draft of the letter with them. "We appreciate their concerns and will look forward to talking about it with them and addressing them."
Sharma also defended Warren's original proposal, saying it "takes steps to end the historic and systematic dispossession of black-owned land, strengthens oversight at the USDA and expands access to credit for black farmers."
But black farming advocates say the USDA must be totally overhauled to address land loss. They also say the Agriculture Department's office of civil rights has become an "enemy of civil rights" because concerns raised by blacks aren't taken seriously, and that the office's leaders should be dismissed.
A spokesman for the USDA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In the draft letter, advocates call on Warren to endorse reparations for black farmers who have lost their land. They propose creating a land trust that would buy land from retiring black farmers and set it aside for younger black farmers .
The letter also objected to the section of Warren's plan that focuses on the black-owned farms that have been lost when the older generation retires or dies and the younger family members are unable to agree on whether to continue farming or afford to continue. The advocates say the issue known as "heirs property" isn't the driver in land dispossession for blacks. Instead, they point to racist policies and outright discrimination.
"By framing heirs property as the main problem facing black farmers, your plan shifts attention away from the many other challenges we face," according to the letter. "We urge you to not only get the history of land loss right, but to also get the solutions right."
Lucas said that he wasn't consulted before Warren issued her policy and is unaware of any black farming advocacy organization that helped her. Furthermore, he said he was troubled by a report in the New York Times that former agriculture secretary Tom Vilsack, also a former Iowa governor, helped craft the policy.
"Instead of fixing the problem, he pretended the problem was fixed," Lucas said of Vilsack's record on black farm dispossession.
Vilsack defended his tenure at the department that he led from 2009 to 2017. "We did more than any previous administration in recent history to right the wrongs of the past," said Vilsack, who was reached in China via text message. "We may not have satisfied everyone but we provided help to thousands of African-American farmers and I am fiercely proud of that fact."
Sharma declined to say specifically whether Warren's team contacted advocates for black farmers as they crafted the plan. "Our campaign discussed the plan with a number of farmers, advocates and researchers," she said.

CDC, FDA RAISE ALARM ABOUT VAPING AS NUMBERS OF ODD LUNG PROBLEMS RISE

Texto completo: So far this summer, doctors in 25 states have seen 215 cases of a severe lung illness associated with vaping, according to a report Friday from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Also on Friday, the CDC and Food and Drug Association expressed concern about vaping as the two agencies investigate vaping-associated lung injuries. In response, the American Lung Association called for a clearer warning against the use of e-cigarettes.
A joint statement from the CDC and FDA recommended that while the investigation continues, people who are concerned about the health risk should consider not using e-cigarette products. They also recommended that people using vaping products should not buy products off the street, specifically those containing THC or other cannabinoids, or products modified from the original manufactured item.
In its statement, the Lung Association said, "We urge the federal government to send a clear message to the public that e-cigarettes are not safe and contain harmful chemicals that can cause severe and irreversible lung damage and disease."
The federal agencies also encouraged doctors and public health officials to provide the CDC with suspected injury reports and recommended that people who need help quitting tobacco products contact their doctor. The statement also said regardless of the current investigation, vaping products should not be used by children, teens, young adults and pregnant women.
In Pittsburgh, UPMC hospitals had seen 12 cases as of Wednesday. Four patients have been treated by Dr. John Kreit, pulmonary division chief at UPMC Mercy. Previously healthy young men ages 24 to 28 came in with conditions ranging from mild to life-threatening.
It starts with a shortness of breath that gets worse quickly. Then it's a trip to the doctor's office or the emergency room. After a chest X-ray or CT scan, the verdict comes in: a lung injury without an obvious cause.
Dr. Kreit saw the first patient through a video link, a telemedicine connection with UPMC Horizon, north of Pittsburgh, where no pulmonary specialist is available. He was short of breath but didn't need oxygen.
"It was a young man with diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates," he said, translating that as abnormal material in both lungs, possibly inflammatory cells. "It was likely something he inhaled. Later we determined he was vaping some type of cannabis product. It seemed likely that was the cause."
A week later Dr. Kreit saw another patient and learned that cases first recognized in Wisconsin and Illinois were showing up everywhere.
"Some patients aren't very sick at all and others almost die ... One death [in Illinois] has been attributed to this already."
His second patient, at UPMC Shadyside, came in critically ill, needing mechanical ventilation.
"He could've died, but he did get better and is now recovered," Dr. Kreit reported. He said he heard of one 16-year-old in critical condition who was treated at UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh.
He predicted most young patients will recover completely and have no lasting effects.
The main symptom is rapidly worsening shortness of breath that can be accompanied by a high fever and pain in the center of the chest. Some patients have also had nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.
The Aug. 23 CDC bulletin was extremely vague about the suspected cause of the lung injuries, Dr. Kreit said. The CDC said it is providing consultation to state health departments for these cases and the FDA is helping with information on vaping products or substances and providing technical and lab help.
Although the CDC said some patients had vaped products containing nicotine, Dr. Kreit said many of the cases around the country seem to be related to cannabis-related substances - such as e-liquid containing THC.
"In all four cases I've seen, they were vaping some sort of marijuana, cannabis," he said. "It's more likely related to that, not [a product] in general manufactured by reputable companies."
He suspects patients have used substances made in homes or sold over the internet. "They have no idea what is going into their lungs," he said.
For example, a large volume of online sites provide step-by-step instructions on how to reuse vaping pods made by Juul, the popular brand of e-cigarette among teens and young adults. Buying refilled or replacement pods from non-Juul sites is taking a chance, Dr. Kreit said.
"Some of the websites look very slick," he said. "People assume they're very reputable. But you don't know what you're getting."
Dr. Kreit said the type of lung injury is usually seen in patients who have an underlying illness, like autoimmune diseases rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma and lupus.
"It's not usually from something they've inhaled," he said. But the young healthy patients were not previously sick and weren't taking any medications, he said. "That led us to think it's something they have inhaled."
In vaping, a heating element turns the substance into a mist, which is inhaled. Harmful substances have already been identified in traditional nicotine vape liquid. In the unregulated process of preparing marijuana for vaping, Dr. Kreit said, unknown contaminants can remain in the vaporized material.
In addition to THC extracted from marijuana, he said, people are starting to vape other drugs, including methamphetamine and synthetic marijuana.
"Nobody really knows what the effects are; they're being vaped as well," Dr. Kreit said. "Whole groups of chemicals are being inhaled, and it's totally unregulated. That's what makes it so hard to see what's causing all of this."
The question is what was in the vaping materials, he said, predicting that the CDC will find the common thread. For now, Dr. Kreit said, patients seemed to have different vaping habits, in terms of both frequency and substances. Out of all the people who are vaping, it's still a small portion who get sick, he added.
"They are all young healthy people. You're 25 and almost die. That's something people need to take notice of."
People with concerns can contact the Pittsburgh Poison Center of UPMC (a 24-hour hotline) at 800-222-1222.

Texto completo: "Merrily We Roll Along" spent just two weeks on Broadway after it opened in 1981. Now, a film adaptation of the Stephen Sondheim and George Furth musical -- which fans have grown to love, despite its rather floppy start -- will be in production for more than 500 times as long.
Over the next 20 years, Richard Linklater will direct the "Merrily" movie, starring Ben Platt, Beanie Feldstein and Blake Jenner, Mr. Sondheim confirmed on Thursday evening.
The musical moves in reverse, chronicling over two decades the fortunes of three best friends in show business. Frank, a Broadway composer, starts the show jaded and successful before regressing to his bright-eyed past. Charley, his regular lyricist, and Mary, a writer, also move back toward their idealistic beginnings in a show that features such Sondheim standards as "Good Thing Going" and "Not a Day Goes By."
"It's experimental for a lot of people, and it's hard for people to imagine," Ginger Sledge, who is producing "Merrily We Roll Along," said in a phone interview on Friday. "We have to shoot in reverse."
Mr. Linklater, 59, is no stranger to yearslong production schedules: His 2014 film "Boyhood" was shot over 12 years and followed the same young actor as he grew up. Mr. Linklater has also worked with Mr. Jenner on his 2016 film "Everybody Wants Some!!"
"I first saw, and fell in love with 'Merrily' in the '80s, and I can't think of a better place to spend the next 20 years than in the world of a Sondheim musical," Mr. Linklater said in a statement. "I don't enter this multiyear experience lightly, but it seems the best, perhaps the only way, to do this story justice on film."
Mr. Jenner, known for his time on Fox's teen musical series "Glee" and Netflix's "What/If," will play Frank, while Mr. Platt and Ms. Feldstein -- real-life best friends -- will portray Charley and Mary. The news of the screen adaptation and its cast was first reported by Collider.
In a statement, Mr. Jenner called the show "a beautiful, relatable story, with music I'm in love with, and I know this is going to be an amazingly creative journey for the next 20 years."
Mr. Platt vaulted to fame with his Tony Award-winning title performance in "Dear Evan Hansen." He will also star in the Netflix series "The Politician" later this year.
"This project has already been one of the most special blessings of my life," Mr. Platt wrote on Twitter.
Ms. Feldstein has had plum roles in films like "Booksmart" and "Lady Bird," and she was recently tapped to play Monica Lewinsky in the new season of "American Crime Story." She has a Broadway background as well, as Minnie Fay in the revival of "Hello, Dolly!"
She and Mr. Platt attended the same high school, and, if a 2016 tweet is any indication, their casting in "Merrily" together has been a dream of hers for quite some time.
"It's a really nice group, family-like atmosphere," Ms. Sledge said in the interview. "Everyone's really just hanging in there because everyone's really excited and wants to do it. We're just going to take good care of ourselves."
Principal photography has already been completed for the first part of the film, Ms. Sledge said, and she expects they will shoot more scenes every couple of years to allow the actors to age. (If it follows the show, the film will show those scenes in reverse order.)
Jason Blum, Jonathan Marc Sherman and Mr. Linklater are among the film's other producers. They are using the latest book as the script, Ms. Sledge said -- "the version Sondheim is happiest with."
"Here's the thing about Rick: He knew what 'Boyhood' was going to be when it was done when he started," Ms. Sledge said. "And he feels that way about this too. He knows how this is all going to develop and end already, and I think he really feels this is the way this story is going to work."
The original "Merrily," directed by Hal Prince, was the biggest flop of Mr. Sondheim's career. As recounted in a 2016 documentary, it famously featured teenage actors playing characters their own age as well as ones who were much older -- a conceit that never worked.
The score included "a half-dozen songs that are crushing and beautiful -- that soar and linger and hurt," Frank Rich wrote in his New York Times review, but the show itself was a shambles.
Revivals over the years -- twice on the West End and twice Off Broadway, among others -- haven't fully cracked it, either. "On the evidence of its umpteenth unsatisfactory revisal," Jesse Green wrote earlier this year in his Times review of the latest production, "I'm sorry to say that it's still not 'Merrily"s time. Maybe it never will be."
Perhaps by 2040, that time will come.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: html> When Popeyes’ new fried chicken sandwich went viral for its deliciousness last week, I did not pause, not even for a second, to consider the vast toll of suffering and environmental destruction inherent in its rise. I am guessing you didn’t either; indeed, I can already feel your eyes rolling deep into your head at the mere suggestion that there’s anything to feel guilty about regarding the sold-out sandwich. So before we go on, let me warn you: The rest of this column is going to give your eye-rolling muscles a very good workout.
You want to shake me: Shut up, killjoy! Haven’t I heard how unspeakably delicious the sandwich is? As The New Yorker proclaimed, “The Popeyes Chicken Sandwich Is Here to Save America.” So why spoil this one last true thing by mentioning the squalid, overcrowded, constantly lit, 40-day life span of the typical factory-farmed, fast-food chicken?
Or, for that matter, the irony of the sandwich going viral at the same time as heartbreaking pictures of the Amazon rainforest on fire. Many of us, myself included, engage in painless, performative environmentalism. We’ll give up plastic straws and tweet passionately that someone should do something about the Amazon, yet few of us make space in our worldview to acknowledge the carcass in the room: the irrefutable evidence that our addiction to meat is killing the planet right before our eyes. After all, it takes only a few minutes of investigation to learn that there is one overwhelming reason the Amazon is burning — to clear ground for cattle ranching and for the cultivation of soy, the vast majority of which goes not into tofu but into animal feed, including for fast-food chicken.
As I say, I did not consider any of this, because I don’t regularly come into contact with a lot of preachy vegans. Indeed, preachy vegans are something of a myth. There’s an old joke — “How do you know you’re talking to a vegan? Don’t worry, they’ll tell you” — that is as untrue as it is revealing about the teller. Although vegans can marshal stronger evidence to support their claims than adherents of many other belief systems — whether of other diets or major religions — they get little respect, and their ideas rarely receive mass media acknowledgment other than mockery.
I am not a vegan. I am barely, failingly, a vegetarian/pescatarian — I make an effort to avoid meat, but for reasons of convenience and shameless hedonism still end up eating it several times a month, especially fish. My purpose here is not to change how you eat, dress or think about the ethics of consuming something like the Popeyes’ sandwich. Instead, as a fellow omnivore and a person concerned about the planet’s future, I want to ask you to do something much more simple: to alter how you think about vegans.
I want to urge you to give vegans a chance — to love and to celebrate them instead of ridiculing them. We need more vegan voices, because on the big issues — the criminal cruelty of industrial farming; the sentience and emotional depth of food animals; the environmental toll of meat and the unsustainability of its global rise — vegans are irrefutably on the right side of history. They are the vanguard. Climate scholars say that if we are ever to survive a warming planet, people will have to consume far fewer animals than we do now. We will all have to become a little more vegan — and if we are to succeed in that, we will have to start by saluting vegans, not mocking them.
We are nowhere close to that now. In the media, in pop culture and even in progressive, enlightened polite society it is still widely acceptable to make fun of vegans. The stereotype of the smug, self-satisfied, annoying vegan has taken deep cultural root. One survey found that vegans are viewed more negatively than atheists and immigrants, and are only slightly more tolerated than drug addicts.
It’s true that America’s food industry has recently begun investing heavily in animal-free milks and meats; supermarkets are brimming with bounties of meat alternatives, Burger King is selling an Impossible Whopper, and KFC just announced fake fried chicken wings and nuggets. This is all great news for the planet, yet no one thanks vegans for creating a market for these alternatives. Not even the meat-alternative startups themselves, which call themselves “plant-based” and strictly avoid the V-word, perhaps because food industry surveys find that “vegan” is the least appealing label that can be applied to food — worse than “diet” and “sugar-free.”
“There are many things that have gotten better in the five years that I’ve been vegan, like the availability of options or the quality of vegan cheese — but the attitude that omnivores have about vegans doesn’t feel like it’s changed that much, if at all,” Summer Anne Burton, editor of a new vegan-focused magazine called Tenderly, told me. “Even people who are really radical and progressive in lots of areas of their lives still seem really suspicious, frustrated and annoyed by the idea of someone being vegan.”
The annoyance manifests in all kinds of ways. Burton will post an inoffensive vegan recipe, and someone will invariably reply, “That would be better with bacon!” Vegans are constantly tarred with the suggestion that they are unfun — they’re asked whether oral sex is vegan, or accused of ruining weddings and birthday dinners with their outlandish preferences. “Being vegan or talking about your reasons for being vegan is taken to mean you are judgmental and smug — ‘You must be fun at parties!’ is probably the thing that I hear most often,” Burton said.
The tragedy here is that the mockery intimidates vegans. Rather than being out and proud about their beliefs, vegans find themselves biting their tongues. “A lot of us overcorrect,” Burton said. “You make a sacrifice because of your beliefs, and when people ask you about it, you’re afraid to sound judgmental or smug, so you brush it off.”
There are many theories for why vegans have it so rough, but the one I lean on is guilt and cognitive dissonance. Many omnivores understand the toll that meat wreaks on the planet, and we can’t help but feel the tension between loving animals in the abstract while eating them with abandon on the plate. All of this creates feelings of defensiveness, so when a vegan comes along, their very presence seems like an affront. To an omnivore, every vegan looks like a preachy vegan.
Well, that’s the point! As a culture, we are far too comfortable with consuming animals. The idea that meat is cost-free is exactly what led us into this trap; delicious as it may be, we should feel embarrassed and uncomfortable that people are going gaga for a mass-manufactured fried chicken sandwich.
For the good of the planet, put down the sandwich. But if you won’t do that, at least refrain from putting down the people who are trying to light a path to a livable future. The vegans are right. The vegans were always right. The least you can do is shower them with respect and our gratitude, because they deserve it.

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES—Valerie Harper, who scored guffaws, stole hearts and busted TV taboos as the brash, self-deprecating Rhoda Morgenstern on back-to-back hit sitcoms in the 1970s, has died.
Longtime family friend Dan Watt confirmed Ms. Harper died Friday, adding the family wasn't immediately releasing any further details. She had been battling cancer for years, and her husband said recently he had been advised to put her in hospice care.
Ms. Harper was a breakout star on "The Mary Tyler Moore Show," then the lead of her own series, "Rhoda." She was 80.
She won three consecutive Emmys (1971-73) as supporting actress on "The Mary Tyler Moore Show" and another for outstanding lead actress for "Rhoda," which ran from 1974-78. Beyond awards, she was immortalized—and typecast—for playing one of television's most beloved characters, a best friend the equal of Ethel Mertz and Ed Norton in TV's sidekick pantheon.
Fans had long feared the news of her passing. In 2013, she first revealed that she had been diagnosed with brain cancer and had been told by her doctors she had as little as three months to live. Some responded as if a family member were in peril.
But she refused to despair. "I'm not dying until I do," Ms. Harper said in an interview on NBC's "Today" show. "I promise I won't." Ms. Harper did outlive her famous co-star: Mary Tyler Moore died in January 2017. Ed Asner, Cloris Leachman and Betty White are among the former cast members who survive her.
In recent years, Ms. Harper's other appearances included "American Dad!" ''The Simpsons" and "Two Broke Girls."
Ms. Harper was a chorus dancer on Broadway as a teen before moving into comedy and improv when, in 1970, she auditioned for the part of a Bronx-born Jewish girl who would be a neighbor and pal of Minneapolis news producer Mary Richards on a new sitcom for CBS.
It seemed a long shot for the young, unknown actress. As she recalled, "I'm not Jewish, not from New York, and I have a small shiksa nose." And she had almost no TV experience.
But Ms. Harper, who arrived for her audition some 20 pounds overweight, may have clinched the role when she blurted out in admiration to the show's tall, slender star: "Look at you in white pants without a long jacket to cover your behind!"
It was exactly the sort of thing Rhoda would say to "Mar," as Ms. Harper recalled in her 2013 memoir, "I, Rhoda." Ms. Harper was signed without a screen test.
Of course, if CBS had gotten its way, Rhoda might have been a very different character with a much different actress in place. As "The Mary Tyler Moore Show" was being developed, its producers were battling a four-point decree from the network, which insisted that the nation's TV viewers wouldn't accept series characters who were (1) divorced, (2) from New York, (3) Jewish or (4) have mustaches.
The producers lost on having Mary Richards divorced (instead, she had been dumped by her longtime boyfriend). But with Rhoda they overrode the network on two other counts.
The show that resulted was a groundbreaking hit, with comically relatable Rhoda one big reason.
"Women really identified with Rhoda because her problems and fears were theirs," Ms. Harper theorized in her book. "Despite the fact that she was the butt of most of her own jokes, so to speak...her confident swagger masked her insecurity. Rhoda never gave up."
Neither did Ms. Harper, who confronted her own insecurities with similar moxie.
"I was always a little overweight," she once told the Associated Press. "I'd say, 'Hello, I'm Valerie Harper and I'm overweight.' I'd say it quickly before they could...I always got called chubby, my nose was too wide, my hair was too kinky."
But as "The Mary Tyler Moore Show" evolved, so did Rhoda. Rhoda trimmed down and glammed up, while never losing her comic step. The audience loved her more than ever.
A spinoff seemed inevitable. In 1974, Rhoda was dispatched from Minneapolis back home to New York City, where she was reunited with her parents and younger sister in a new sitcom that co-starred Nancy Walker, Harold Gould and Julie Kavner.
She also met and fell in love with the hunky owner of a demolition firm.
The premiere of "Rhoda" that September was the week's top-rated show, getting a 42% share of audience against competition including "Monday Night Football" on ABC. And a few weeks later, when Rhoda and her fiancé, Joe, were wed in a one-hour special episode, more than 52 million people—half of the U.S. viewing audience—tuned in.
But "Rhoda" couldn't maintain those comic or popular heights. A domesticated, lucky-in-love Rhoda wasn't a funny Rhoda. By the end of the third season, the writers had taken a desperate step: Rhoda divorced Joe. Thus had Rhoda (and Ms. Harper) defied a third CBS taboo.
The series ended in 1978 with Ms. Harper having played Rhoda for a total of nine seasons.
She had captured the character by studying her Italian stepmother. But Harper's own ethnicity—neither Jewish nor Italian—was summed up in a New York Times profile as "an exotic mixture of Spanish-English-Scotch-Irish-Welsh-French-Canadian."
And she wasn't a Gothamite. Born in Suffern, N.Y., into a family headed by a peripatetic sales executive, she spent her early years in Oregon, Michigan and California before settling in Jersey City, N.J.

Hurricane Comey Was a National Disaster; The bureaucratic rules he flouted are designed to protect the country from people like the FBI chief.

Texto completo: It is time to start reckoning with the consequences of James Comey.
If not for the former FBI chief, the Justice Department likely would have closed its investigation of Hillary Clinton in 2016 with a terse statement that it was taking "no action." Voters would have had to make of this what they would.
There would have been no Comey press conference simultaneously chastising Mrs. Clinton and excusing her behavior—an improper intervention by the FBI chief, a subsequent Justice Department investigation found, and one that was undertaken partly in response to intercepted foreign intelligence that even then was believed to be false.
In turn, there would have been no second intervention—also improper according to the department inspector general—reopening the Clinton case shortly before Election Day, which may have tilted the election to Donald Trump.
Without Mr. Comey, there may also not have followed a counterintelligence investigation of the Trump campaign, or the conditions under which the discredited Steele dossier would become a widely reported and widely believed account of Trump collusion. An assessment of these Trump-related matters is due any day now, but it's unlikely to break new ground by finding that Mr. Comey acted with good judgment and scrupulous adherence to departmental rules.
In turn, there would have been no Comey firing, no leaking by him of internal FBI memos to outside parties, including the press—again improper, according to yet another internal report released Thursday. There would have been no Robert Mueller investigation in search of collusion. There would have been no two-year effort, as it now appears, by junior functionaries of Mr. Mueller to tempt Mr. Trump into illegally obstructing an investigation of crimes that didn't exist.
Mr. Comey is given to portentous rationales. In his memoir, he melodramatically describes his intervention in the Clinton case as being driven by a "development still unknown to the American public to this day"—referring to the secret intelligence that colleagues at the FBI had already judged to be "objectively false." In this week's report, he is quoted telling the inspector general that his imprudent leaking of FBI memos was justified by their "incredible importance to the Nation."

Let's not pretend to know more than we do. It is impossible to say for sure that Donald Trump would not be president if not for Mr. Comey's unwarranted interventions in the Hillary Clinton case.
It is impossible to know what course Mr. Trump's ideologically noncommittal and weakly partisan administration might have followed had it not been weighed down by the Russia incubus. The New York Times reminds us this week that Mr. Trump was widely understood by the electorate to be "substantially more moderate than his party."
It is impossible to know how Mr. Trump's own behavior and calculations would have been different if he had been greeted with the usual presidential honeymoon rather than a concerted campaign to portray him as a Russian stooge.
But one judgment we are ready to render on Mr. Comey's tenure: If he had chosen a different career (say, driving instructor) and never joined the FBI, I doubt we'd be lamenting his absence now. Indeed, it seems overwhelmingly likely that the country would be better off today without his heedless and ill-advised decisions.
Though a precedent from U.S. history doesn't leap to mind, one from popular culture does: Maxwell Smart, the bumbling master spy with the inflated ego and talent for disaster from the TV show "Get Smart." As Mel Brooks, creator of the rollicking 1960s sitcom, told a reporter at the time, "No one had ever done a show about an idiot before. I decided to be the first."
Finally, let's have a word about the bureaucracy that Michael Horowitz, the Obama-appointed inspector general, represents. Bureaucracy gets a bad name but it plays a vital role in collecting information and ensuring that government decisions are made on a reasoned, evidentiary and orderly basis. And Mr. Horowitz is a hero of the bureaucracy in the best sense. With what the reliably foolish Harry Litman in the Washington Post calls his "hall-monitor rectitude," the inspector general's reports are landmarks in upholding the value of established procedures when the powers of government are in the hands of chaotic persons like Mr. Comey.

Trump and Biden are both running on their unlikability They're giving the nation's voters an ultimatum rather than inspiration.

Texto completo: During a recent Manchester, New Hampshire, speech, President Trump unveiled a new campaign line: "Whether you love me or hate me, you have got to vote for me." Citing the strong economy, Trump told voters that if he loses, "your 401(k), everything is going to be down the tubes," so "you have no choice!" To underscore the point, when he finished speaking the music that came on was the Rolling Stones singing, "You can't always get what you want. But if you try sometimes, well, you might find, you get what you need."
Not far away, in Nashua, the Biden campaign rolled out the very same message about its candidate. "I know that not all of you are committed to my husband, and I respect that," Jill Biden told Democratic primary voters. "Your candidate might be better on, I don't know, health care, than Joe is. But you've got to look at who's going to win this election. And maybe you have to swallow a little bit and say, 'OK, I personally like so and so better,' but your bottom line has to be that we have to beat Trump."
To put it another way: "Whether you love Joe or hate him, you have got to vote for him."
Trump and Biden are both running on the same message, but with a key difference: Trump is directing his at independent swing voters; Biden is directing that message at his base.
The New York Times reports that, despite his commanding lead in the polls, Biden faces a problem of low enthusiasm. While Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., "have followings rooted in zealous support for their ideas," support for Biden is rooted in a belief that he is the candidate best positioned to beat Trump.
Patrick Murray, director of Monmouth University's Polling Institute, told the paper that while spending time recently in Iowa, he "did not meet one Biden voter who was in any way, shape or form excited about voting for Biden. They feel that they have to vote for Joe Biden as the centrist candidate, to keep somebody from the left who they feel is unelectable from getting the nomination."
The danger of running on electability is that all it takes is one catastrophic gaffe or debate stumble for Biden's support to collapse. And even if Biden secures the Democratic nomination, running a campaign built exclusively on ousting the sitting president, rather than enthusiasm for your own ideas, is not a winning strategy. Just ask President Mitt Romney.
Trump, by contrast, has his base wrapped up. The president consistently enjoys nearly 90 percent support among Republicans (in contrast with Barack Obama, who had just 75 percent support among Democrats at this stage in 2011, according to Gallup). For Trump, the risk of this strategy is not with his base, but with the swing voters who put him over the top in 2016.
According to Axios, in 2016 "20 percent of Trump's voters told exit pollsters they didn't like him." These reluctant Trump voters put Trump in the White House and are critical to his keeping it in 2020. Like many Americans, they are exhausted by the chaos of the Trump presidency. Biden is targeting his message directly at these voters, echoing George W. Bush's 2000 campaign pledge to restore "honor and dignity" to the Oval Office in the wake of the tumultuous presidency of Bill Clinton.
Yet, despite their exhaustion with Trump, many of these voters approve of his economic performance in office. Despite recent market turbulence, the U.S. economy remains strong. On Trump's watch, unemployment has reached a five-decade low, and our biggest economic problem is that we have 1.6 million more job openings than we have unemployed workers to fill them. And a decade after the Great Recession, wages are finally rising, with those at the bottom of the economic ladder benefiting the most.
The problem is that Trump has made virtually no effort to win over these reluctant Trump voters again, much less expand his base by appealing to Americans who did not vote for him but are benefiting from his policies. He is betting that presidents seeking re-election in a full-employment economy don't tend to lose. The danger is that, if the economy takes a nose dive, his argument for re-election with these voters does as well.
Biden and Trump are giving voters an ultimatum rather than inspiration. They both may find that running on your unlikability is a risky strategy.

Texto completo: Headnote THE WORLD ACCORDING TO DOMINIC
In America, white is a lot more than the skin color or race of our nations majority, albeit dwindling segment of that segment of the population, which has maintained its lofty position in the driver's seat since the days of the Founding Fathers - if not for generations even earlier when the majority of the population on the continent that would eventually become the United States were Native Americans.
White, through a calculated manipulation of history and truth, has always been, and remains today, about power - political and economic dominance much to the detriment of the worlds and our nations "non-white people." Like any form of power, those who benefit from being members of the powerful class have long fought tooth and nail to maintain the privileges and, by extension, legalized rights gleaned simply because of being born with white skin in a society that touts "whiteness" as the center, the norm - the most desirable state of being.
So, it should come as no surprise that with the recent publication of the attention-grabbing, highly-provocative New York Times "1619 Project," many white, conservative Americans are up in arms, including former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a historian by academic training, who asserts that the report is "factually false," "nonsense" and "propaganda" which should be an "embarrassment" to the editors and owners of the Times.
As the publication states in its preface, its purpose is "to reframe the country's history, understanding 1619 [the year when the first slaves came to America] as our true founding and placing the consequences of slavery and the contributions of slavery and the contributions of Black Americans at the very center of the story we tell ourselves about who we are."
The recognition of 400 years of Africans in America that took place last weekend on the Virginia shores where it all began, has lit a fire in our nation - a "teachable moment" as Oprah Winfrey has been known to say that, which for all the bellyaching raised by detractors of the Project, will not be easily squelched even among the most powerful and vociferous, conservative-minded white Americans.
Historians, scholars, educators, politicians and journalists - even "Ma" and "Pa" - have taken differing views on the truth, or lack thereof, which the "1619 Project" claims to unveil. Nonetheless, whether the year we cite is 1619, 1776 or 2019, it's hard to refute the fact that our Republic's ideals of liberty, justice and democratic rule stand in stark contrast to the reality of life for those born "non-white" and has served as the foundation of America's very existence from the days of the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, the landing of Africans in Virginia - even the so-called discovery of America by Christopher Columbus.
Truth be told, the economic system of chattel slavery that prevailed in the South for more than 200 years not only continues to leave its mark on American culture and institutions, but has reinforced the continuing of two societies within one. In this dual society, whites still enjoy the fruits of forced, unpaid Black labor. Meanwhile, Blacks continue to hover at the bottom rung, no longer chained by shackles but still "shackled."
I disagree with those who contend that the "1619 Project" is anti-American or anti-white identity politics. Yet, at least for now, I cannot fully embrace the report's finding without further, more careful review. I suppose I can understand the fury that's been unleashed by those who cannot imagine abandoning a "collective identity" that's given whites their firmly-grasped sense of being and belonging well over 400 years. If someone suddenly referred to my heroes as rapists, described my sacred tomes and texts as "false alibis" for a "world-historic crime" and reconfigured the hill on which America sits not as a shining cite worthy of respect but one more accurately labeled as a landmark undergirded by the "unmarked graves of men it condemned to unlived lives," I'd be ready to go toe-to-toe with just about anyone.
Give up my seat, my place of prominence, my undeserved perch at the top of the human totem pole? You must be crazy! No way - no how! As the 19 th century philosopher Lord John Acton said, while referencing the practices of the Roman emperors and Napoleon, "absolute power corrupts absolutely. Great men are almost always bad men."
We may not like the truth, and coming to terms with that truth may be both unsettling and painful, but one day - someday - America will have no choice but to come face to face with its own day of reckoning. As the saying goes, "and the truth will set you free."

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES - If one thing remains true in the rapidly changing world of television, it's that viewers love a medical mystery. The Patient With the Obscure Ailment That Baffles Physicians has been a fixture on hospital dramas for as long as they've existed.
Unexplained illnesses fueled eight seasons of the Fox series "House," which starred Hugh Laurie as a brilliant but misanthropic diagnostician, not to mention countless daytime talk-show segments and sensational reality-TV series on cable.
Two new shows, "Diagnosis" on Netflix and "Chasing the Cure" on TNT/TBS, put a new spin on the age-old question "What's ailing me, doc?" by using crowdsourcing to diagnose people suffering from unexplained illnesses.
While the shows differ dramatically in tone, style and format, both operate from the same basic assumption: Finding an answer for these patients means bucking standard medical practice and presenting their cases to a mass audience.
Premiering within weeks of each other, the shows arrive at a moment when mistrust of the medical establishment, negative views of the U.S. health care system and the use of crowdfunding sites such as GoFundMe to pay for health care are increasing.
But leveraging the perceived wisdom of the crowd - most of whom are not medical professionals - and sharing sensitive medical information with potentially millions of strangers also raise a number of ethical and practical questions, starting with the obvious: Does the crowd really know that much?
The answer, say those involved, is an emphatic yes. "The assumption is that the crowd doesn't know anything," says Ann Curry, anchor and executive producer of "Chasing the Cure." "The truth is, the crowd knows a lot.
"When you're dealing with unsolved cases of people suffering, there's a chance that someone out there has experienced similar symptoms, or (there's a) medical professional who has dealt with a similar case."
"Chasing the Cure" combines a live broadcast with pretaped segments, giving it the look and feel of daytime television. Led by the former "Today" host, each hourlong episode zips through three or four cases introduced in brief videos.
A panel of specialists convenes to review the files, then meets live on air with the patients to discuss possible diagnoses. Some even undergo treatments that are broadcast on the show.
It also leans heavily on social media: Viewers are urged to call or text a toll-free number, tweet using a designated hashtag and visit an elaborate website to review individual case files, provide tips or share their own experiences. The goal, Curry says, is "to democratize data."
While the live element of the program means that not every patient receives a firm diagnosis, they all leave with a recommended path forward. "Each patient should walk away feeling like 'I got some information that I needed, some support that I needed, and I was pointed in the right direction,'" says executive producer and showrunner Kim Bondy.
The idea for "Chasing the Cure" emerged after a colleague of Curry's saw a post on Facebook seeking donations for someone with an undiagnosed illness; she realized that live television could amplify this kind of appeal.
So far, it seems to be doing just that: The premiere episode of "Chasing the Cure" drew 1 million viewers. More than 10,000 people have registered to use the website and are active in the case files, according to TNT and TBS.
Crowdsourcing "acknowledges that there are different ways of knowing," says Dr. Lisa Sanders, author of the popular New York Times Magazine column that inspired "Diagnosis." "Doctors know things because we read books and have shelves filled with medical journals and medical books.
"And so there's that kind of learning. There's my experiences as a doctor. And there's also my experiences as a human being who has friends and relatives who are sick, and there are my own illnesses."
Each episode of "Diagnosis" follows a single subject and his or her family on their quest for answers, providing thorough and often moving portraits of the emotional and financial cost of living with debilitating, unexplained ailments.
Shot in a photojournalistic style, "Diagnosis" has a restrained true crime sensibility, with Sanders, an internist and professor at the Yale School of Medicine, playing the role of lead detective. Sanders narrates the investigation, following clues submitted by readers via video chat, and consults with patients who range in age, affliction and location.
"As a doctor, you know that when you see something you don't know, the first thing you do is you go to your friend who has a different set of knowledge than you," says Sanders, who also was a technical adviser on "House." "For me, crowdsourcing was just taking that to the furthest limits imaginable."
Netflix doesn't release viewing statistics, but it says that Sanders received thousands of tips through her column. About half the feedback came from medical professionals - doctors, nurses, pharmacists, even some veterinarians. The rest came from laypeople.
Sanders notes that informal crowdsourcing is commonplace in the medical community. For example, sermo.com is a private social network where doctors often turn for advice with difficult cases.
Both shows open with carefully worded legal disclaimers, and producers say they have taken care to protect patient privacy. "People would much rather wear their entire medical record on their clothes than, say, the PIN number to their savings account," says Sanders.
"But as it turns out, medical information is much more tightly held. So the most important thing is to make sure the patients know what they're getting into."
"Chasing the Cure" has an ethics team, including an ethicist, a social worker, a psychologist and a lawyer. "I am not going to put anything on television that's irresponsible or does not help people," Curry says.
Television and social media have empowered armchair diagnosticians - who, it turns out, are sometimes right. Tarek El Moussa, host of HGTV's "Flip or Flop," found out he had Stage 3 thyroid cancer thanks to an eagle-eyed viewer who noticed a lump on his neck.
"The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills" star Denise Richards recently said a fan tipped her off to a similar condition after watching her on TV. Curry believes crowdsourcing can break down crucial barriers.
"We are in a system today where people are siloed by their medical insurance, by where they live, by who they're recommended to go to for specialists.
"What we're doing is punching a hole in the silo and saying, 'What if you take really sick people and you expose them to top-drawer doctors, some of the brightest minds in the profession directly, and to the world?' "
Nearly every patient in "Chasing the Cure" and "Diagnosis" is dealing with some sort of financial nightmare on top of his or her medical condition - fighting with an insurer over coverage, struggling with medical debt, losing jobs, struggling to navigate government bureaucracies or all of the above.
While neither show is framed as an overt critique of our health care system, both highlight the additional financial stress created by chronic health problems and illustrate how inadequate coverage can prolong the quest for answers.

Best Tool That Parents Have Is Still Common Sense

Texto completo: How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Jessica Grose, the editor of NYT Parenting , discussed the tech she's using.
Tell us about The Times's new Parenting initiative.
Parenting is a glutted field, so we wanted to make sure we were bringing something new to the coverage area.
We realized quickly that evidence-based, heavily researched guidance for aspiring parents and parents of very little kids was the sweet spot where The Times could really make a difference in people's day-to-day lives.
We also wanted to provide a lot of information for parents themselves: about how their relationships, work lives and self-conception may have changed when they had kids. Parenting includes a stand-alone website, like The Times's Cooking product, and we have a weekly newsletter, which you should sign up for!
We're still in beta, and there's lots more coming in 2020, so look out.
So what tech tools help you do the job?
While most of our team is in New York, we have an editor in Atlanta, and engineers in Seattle, San Francisco and Portland, Ore., so tools that help with remote work are essential.
Slack, first and foremost -- don't sleep on Slack calls, which I find are better for quickly sharing screens and designs than Google Hangouts.
We're also trying out a Google Jamboard, which is an "interactive business whiteboard" -- a description that makes me want to die. The team named our Jamboard "Pumpkins." We just had a rousing cross-functional session on Pumpkins, which involved lots of virtual stickies.
I report and write the newsletter every week, and I use either my iPhone or an extremely ancient Olympus digital recorder to record interviews.
Are there any parenting sites that you find useful and, if so, which ones and why?
Common Sense Media is an excellent resource for all media recommendations. I particularly like using it for apps. I feel fairly equipped to assess whether TV or movies are appropriate for my kids, but I am often at a loss when it comes to apps.
The sites I use most as a reporter and an editor are the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; the American Academy of Pediatrics' website, Healthy Children; and PubMed, where I look up studies all the time. Part of the usefulness of the Times Parenting site is that we read all of the research and recommendations from experts and distill it down to answer your questions in a readable, accessible way.
[Is your child a digital addict? Here's what you can do .]
Tech use among children is a big issue, including questions about how early children should be using tech, how long each day they should be spending on screens and the like. What do you tell parents who ask about that?
The American Academy of Pediatrics suggests that kids under 18 months should use screens only to do video chats with relatives, and that kids under 6 should have only one hour a day of "high-quality programs" that they watch with grown-ups, who can contextualize the shows for them.
While I believe in the A.A.P. as an ideal, I also am a person with two kids, a full-time job and a husband who also has a full-time job, which means we are tired and our household does not always live up to the A.A.P. standards. During the week we follow the guidelines, but on the weekends our kids definitely zombie out in front of the TV for several hours at a clip. (But they also go outside, and read, and we take them places, and they are not totally feral.)
I also really love TV and movies, and think they are underappreciated as a way that kids can bond with one another. If you sit and listen to preschoolers chat, you will hear them talk about which PJ Masks character is their favorite and hear them do fantasy play about Wakanda. Even kindergartners have water-cooler talk.
[Read Jessica Grose on children's TV shows you can tolerate watching.]
And some apps, like Me: A Kid's Diary, are genuinely interactive and educational. I believe Endless Alphabet and Endless Reader helped my older daughter learn to read and spell.
Finally, many of these technologies are new, and we really don't know yet how they might affect our kids and their brains. I tend to not be particularly alarmist about it, though I no longer let my children, who are 3 and 6, watch YouTube, after the reporting about the videos that slipped past kid-approved filters.
So TLDR: I believe in the experts, and I believe in research, and I think most things are reasonable in moderation. My overall recommendation about most things tech is to use common sense and don't freak out.
Outside of work, what tech do you love?
We have a Google Home, which has helped me avert many a meltdown by playing dance music. My kids are partial to "Shake Your Groove Thing," by Peaches and Herb, and honestly I have no idea where they picked it up, but I'm not mad about it. Also, you haven't lived until you hear a 3-year-old say, "O.K., Google, play 'Old Town Road."'
While we are continuing to develop our product, I look at a lot of other products outside the parenting space for ideas and inspiration. And the ones that I have found most addictive, useful and/or pleasing in my nonwork life are the iOS apps from TheRealReal and FoodKick.
TheRealReal is designer consignment, and it did an excellent job of building filters that work for the best bespoke shopping experience. I have a saved search of long-sleeve dresses in my size that refreshes with new pieces in my price range every day.
FoodKick, which is a grocery delivery app, is essential to my functioning in the world as a working mom because it saves my family so much time shopping. I love the way it lets you browse previous orders, but also the way its home page is designed for browsing. I'm often ordering food it suggests because it's in season or because it's part of a recipe FoodKick is pushing.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: Attack occurred after American surveillance drone was shot down
American military cyber forces in June knocked out a crucial database used by Iran's elite paramilitary force to target oil tankers and shipping traffic in the Persian Gulf hours after that force shot down a U.S. surveillance drone, according to U.S. officials.
The retaliatory strike by U.S. Cyber Command against the system used by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps was approved by President Trump, who that same day called off a military airstrike against Iran because killing Iranians would not be "proportionate to shooting down an unmanned drone."
U.S. Cyber Command did not address questions on the secret operation. "As a matter of policy and for operational security, we do not discuss cyberspace operations, intelligence, or planning," Elissa Smith, a Pentagon spokeswoman, said in a statement.
The operation was first reported by the New York Times. It has not been publicly acknowledged by the U.S. government.
The cyberstrike was in the works for weeks if not months, officials have said, adding that the Pentagon proposed launching it after Iran's alleged attacks on two tankers in the Gulf of Oman earlier in June.
The cyber response to a military shoot-down of a drone shows how the Pentagon is expanding its repertoire of options to integrate cyber into military plans, said officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe a sensitive operation.
It also shows how Cybercom, which coordinated the strike with Central Command, which oversees the Middle East, is able to support regional commanders to achieve strategic aims - in this case to preserve freedom of navigation in one of the world's most important shipping lanes.
The drone downing and retaliatory computer attack reflect how increasingly hostilities are playing out below the threshold of use of force, in what is often called the "gray zone."
The cyberstrike was designed to be debilitating - Iran is still trying to restore data - but proportionate and not so provocative as to result in escalation, officials said.
"When you're in this realm there's always the chance for miscalculation," one official said, adding that "there were concerns generally about Iranian responses," perhaps against U.S. or Israeli interests. But the feeling was the strike would not lead to a retaliatory spiral, the official said.
The cyber operation did not target missile and rocket launch systems, as The Washington Post previously reported, U.S. officials said.
It nonetheless represents a flexing of offensive muscle by Cyber Command, led by Gen. Paul Nakasone, which was elevated to a full combatant command in May 2018. And it follows an operation last fall in which the command disrupted Internet access to a Russian entity, the Internet Research Agency, to prevent cyber "trolls" from sowing discord among Americans during the 2018 midterm elections. This more aggressive posture is enabled in part by new authorities granted by Congress and the president.
Iran said the drone flew into its airspace, while the United States said it was in international airspace.
"To the extent that Iran is conducting unlawful operations, I think [the cyberstrike] was an appropriate measure to take to preclude their ability to conduct further unlawful operations," said Michael Schmitt, international law professor at the U.S. Naval War College. "Sometimes cyberspace allows you to take operations that are not as escalatory as other options on the table. And this would strike me as one such operation."
Jason Healey, a former White House and military cyber official, said that although such operations may prove less escalatory, they may also encourage U.S. adversaries to imitate them. "China might say, 'You did it to Iran, we're just doing it to Taiwan. What are you getting so upset about?' "

Texto completo: The Glenbard Parent Series Navigating Healthy Families is partnering with the Glen Ellyn Public Library for a discussion of the true crime thriller "Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI."
Be a part of the book chat of this New York Times bestseller and the Glenbard Parent Series community read at 7 p.m. Wednesday, Aug. 28, at the Glen Ellyn Public Library, 400 Duane St.
At the end of the 19th century, the Osage Indians were driven onto presumed-worthless land, but their Oklahoma reservation turned out to be atop one of the largest U.S. oil deposits, turning members of the Osage Nation into some of the wealthiest people in the world. And, ultimately, marking them for death.
Exposing the turbulent history of the relations between whites and the Osage Nation over the course of more than a century, this book provides a look at the prejudices that continue to cast a shadow over our country, and how, ultimately, a team from the fledgling FBI, led by old-style Texas lawman Tom White, solved a shocking murder case directed at members of the Osage Nation.
On Thursday, Sept 5, hear author David Grann, a National Book Award finalist, at a Glenbard Parent Series program at 7 p.m. at Glenbard West High School, 670 Crescent Blvd. in Glen Ellyn.
Grann will further explore his book, which is based on essential American history. The book is being made into a major motion picture with director Martin Scorsese and starring Leonardo DiCaprio.
Grann is a New York Times bestselling author and an award-winning staff writer at The New Yorker magazine. Before joining The New Yorker in 2003, Grann was a senior editor at The New Republic, and, from 1995 until 1996, executive editor of the newspaper The Hill. He holds master’s degrees in international relations from the Fletcher School of Law & Diplomacy, as well as in creative writing from Boston University.
After graduating from Connecticut College in 1989, he received a Thomas Watson Fellowship and did research in Mexico, where he began his career in journalism.

Texto completo: Joe Biden has put the deaths of his first wife and baby daughter in 1972, as well as the demise of his adult son in 2015, at the center of his 2020 presidential campaign in a new ad, despite objecting to and forcing the withdrawal of an eerily similar ad when he was pondering a 2016 run.
The new television ad, named "Personal" and slated to begin airing in Iowa this week, begins with the former vice president discussing the car accident that killed his first wife, Neilia Hunter Biden, and Naomi Biden, before moving on to the terminal cancer of his son Beau. Their deaths are then connected to Biden's desire to preserve "affordable healthcare" if he is elected.
"I was sworn into the United States Senate next to a hospital bed." Biden intones in the new ad his daughter had been killed in a car crash. "Lying in that bedroom were my two surviving little boys. I couldn't imagine what it would have been like if we didn't have the healthcare they needed immediately."
"Forty years later, one of those little boys, my son Beau, was diagnosed with terminal cancer and given only months to live. I can't fathom what would have happened if the insurance companies had said for the last six months of his life, 'You're on your own.'"
iFrame ObjectIn October 2015, a group of Biden supporters founded the "Draft Biden" political action committee and commissioned an ad, named "My Redemption," closely resembling the one released Tuesday, named "Personal."
Both ads begin with a voice over from Biden describing the death of his first wife and daughter. They even feature the same photographs, one showing Hunter and Beau Biden as children in 1972 in a hospital bed playing with their toys, another of Joe Biden embracing an adult Beau Biden in his Army uniform.
Political ad makers, as well as at least one rival 2020 campaign, noticed the startling similarities immediately.
"The commercials are so similar, it’s difficult for me to imagine they didn’t use the old ad to inspire the new one, despite calling it tasteless at the time," veteran GOP ad maker Alex Castellanos told the Washington Examiner. "Fact of the matter is, Joe Biden is telling us something with this ad: This is all he’s got. If he’s got to do this, he doesn’t have anything else in his bag. It's such a personal topic that voters know Joe Biden wouldn’t do this unless he felt he really had to."
The Draft Biden "My Redemption" ad was produced by Democratic consultant Mark Putnam, a veteran of the 1988 Biden campaign who joined his 2020 campaign when it was launched. He quit in May, shortly after the backlash surrounding the controversy over Biden's comments on working with segregationist Democrats in the Senate. It is not known if Putnam, who was a lead ad maker for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, was involved in making the "Personal" ad.
According to numerous news reports at the time, Biden objected to the imagery of his dead wife and daughter as well as that of Beau, who had died five months earlier in May 2015. A source close to Biden was quoted as saying that the ad "treads on sacred ground."
David Axelrod, former senior adviser to Obama, said: "Am I alone in finding this Draft Biden ad tasteless? It's powerful, but exploitative. Can't believe he'd approve." The advertisement was quickly pulled.iFrame ObjectNow that Biden is in the throes of his third White House run, using strikingly intimate images of his loved ones and reflecting on three tragic deaths is at one with a campaign that leans heavily on nostalgia and his biography.
"The Draft Biden PAC was an outside organization with which Vice President was not involved. The crucial difference is that now he is telling this story on his own terms, in his own words, and in reference to an issue he couldn't care more about: protecting the Affordable Care Act," a Biden source with knowledge of the internal workings of the campaign told the Washington Examiner.
In 2016, Biden reportedly spoke to New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd about his son's dying wish that his father run for president because "the country would be better off with Biden values.”
The Biden campaign says the 60-second "Personal" ad is part of a six-figure media campaign that will also include digital targeting of Iowans over social media. Announcing the ad via Twitter, Biden said: "This ad wasn't easy for me to record."
It concludes: "Healthcare is personal to me. Obamacare is personal to me. When I see the president try to tear it down and others propose to replace it and start over, that's personal to me, too," he continues in a veiled jab against his rivals such as Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Kamala Harris of California, and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who have all endorsed Medicare for All, which would effectively eliminate the ACA.
"Protecting the ACA from Republicans seeking to tear it down, or from others proposing to replace it, is a crucial and personal issue for Vice President Biden and for Americans across the country," campaign manager Greg Schultz said in a statement. "We are reaching Iowans on the airwaves and online to create a surround-sound message about protecting and expanding their access to health care.”

No, Renoir’s paintings aren’t sexist

Texto completo: It’s never too late to get canceled.
One of the premier impressionist painters, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, died in 1919, but that won’t stop today’s art critics from revisiting his legacy through their modern lens.
Tweet
In “Renoir’s Problem Nudes,” the New Yorker’s art critic Peter Schjeldahl writes that Renoir has become known as a sexist artist. Why? Not for any indiscretions in his personal life (though there are reasons to believe he undershot innocence).
As critic Karen Wilkin wrote at the New Criterion, “Of course, his attitude towards women, by most reports, fell spectacularly short of present-day standards. His answer to a journalist who asked how he managed to paint with hands crippled by arthritis—‘I paint with my prick’—doesn’t help.”
But no, his personal life is not so much a problem, which is good news for artists from Caravaggio to Picasso. The problem is that his nude portraits, apparently, represent women in a patriarchal and sexist way.
Tweet
Schjeldahl writes, first, that the paintings are not good because they’re not sexy:
“Renoir’s women strum no erotic nerves in me. There’s no beholding distance from their monotonously compact, rounded breasts and thunderous thighs, smushed into depthless landscapes and interiors, and thus no imaginable approach to intimacy.”
Wait, the problem with the paintings isn’t that they’re objectifying? It’s that they don’t elicit enough desire? This is what critics sound like when they get tangled in too many strings of woke.
Next, Schjeldahl writes that the nude paintings aren’t good because their subjects look stupid:
“Their faces nearly always look, not to put too fine a point on it, dumb—bearing out Renoir’s indifference to the women as individuals with inner lives. They aren’t subjects, only occasions.”
That seems a little rude, to say the least. Finally, these paintings are bad because their subjects have, wait for it, realistic hands:
“Peculiarly, Renoir did grant the women wonderfully articulated hands, the body part hardest to render convincingly—good for doing things, perhaps around the house. In his later work, his most prominent models were his servants or other lower-middle-class women.”
So Schjeldahl (a) assumes that the only thing a woman could do with her hands is housework, and (b) is bothered by any depiction of the working class.
Schjeldahl, who is “one of America’s most brilliant art critics” according to the New York Times, has a career full of insightful art criticism that spans decades. If even our shrewdest critics are dancing to the stilted and dissonant tunes of identity politics, there's little hope.
Tweet
One problem with this sort of zeroing in on Renoir’s alleged sexism is the way other artists get a pass, or they do for now, and they’ll be canceled when our perspectives evolve again over the next few decades.
Writing in the art website Hyperallergic, art critic David Carrier says, “Many, perhaps most of us, are willing to enjoy paintings of women by Pablo Picasso notwithstanding his obvious sadism; or by Gustave Courbet, allowing for his frankly salacious eroticism; or by Paul Cézanne, for their oddly gawky formal qualities.”
Tweet
But not Renoir. Carrier writes: “The trouble, then, with Renoir’s female nudes, buxom stout young women, is that, the way he painted them, they look so … what’s the word I’m looking for? Vapid?”
Accuse Renoir’s nudes of looking “dumb” and “vapid” all you want. Modern sensibilities about the “male gaze” can’t minimize his contributions to art history. Schjeldahl says as much in his article, but his review of the Renoir exhibit currently at the Clark Art Institute gets muddied by his commitment not to understanding the art, but to elucidating its politics. “It feels wrong to term Renoir a misogynist, though he was certainly patriarchal,” he writes.
To modern eyes, Renoir's art is no longer about its content, but about the "problematic" ways in which it could be received. If even Renoir is not safe from such criticism, expect to see more artists accused not of creating poor art, but of antagonizing our modern sensibilities.

Frank Bruni: Donald Trump has worn us all out

Texto completo: Donald Trump’s presidency has baffled me, enraged me and above all saddened me, because I’m a stubborn believer in America’s promise, which he mocks and imperils.
But last week his presidency did something to me that it hadn’t done before. It absolutely flattened me.
I woke up Saturday, made my coffee, shuffled to my computer, started to glance at the news and suddenly had to stop. I couldn’t go on. Trump had yet again said something untrue, once more suggested something absurd, contradicted himself, deified himself, claimed martyrdom, blamed Barack Obama, made his billionth threat and hurled his trillionth insult.
That was all clear from the headlines, which were as much as I could take. He had commandeered too many of my thoughts, run roughshod over too many of my emotions, made me question too many articles of faith.
I was sapped — if not quite of the will to live, then of the will to tweet, to Google and to surf the cable channels, where his furious mien and curious mane are ubiquitous. What I was feeling was beyond Trump fatigue and bigger than Trump exhaustion. It was Trump enervation. Trump enfeeblement.
And within it I saw a ray of hope.
Until now it has been unclear to me precisely how Trump ends. His manifestly rotten character hasn’t alienated his supporters, who are all too ready with rationalizations and fluent in trade-offs. They’re also unbothered by many of his missteps, because he has sold those to a cynical electorate as media fables and rivals’ fabrications. He’s so enterprising and assiduous at pointing the finger elsewhere that many voters have lost their bearings. Defeat is victory. Oppressors are liberators. Corruption is caring. Mar-a-Loco is Shangri-La.
But Americans of all persuasions recognize melodrama when it keeps smacking them in the head, and he has manufactured a bruising degree of it. They’re not keen on Washington or politics, so they don’t care for the way in which fevered discussions of both have become so pervasive as to be ambient.
They’re woozy and wiped out, and they can’t lay their depletion on the doorsteps of frustrated Democrats and Fake News. The president’s tweets speak for themselves, in both volume and vitriol. The president’s thunder is deafening without any amplification by CNN or MSNBC.
The turnover in his White House and the bloat of a Trump-administration diaspora can’t be dismissed as the detritus of disruption, the flotsam and jetsam of an unconventional management style. They’re what happens when you place a cyclone at the Resolute Desk. Everything splinters and screams, and you can’t find a safe space.
“Even Trump’s Supporters Are Getting Tired of His Daily Drama” was the headline on Jim Geraghty’s Monday column in National Review, which sometimes travels fantastically creative routes to reach the sunny side of Trump. Geraghty wrote that the publication’s editors “are exhausted with presidential tweets, from asking whether Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell or Chinese leader Chairman Xi is the bigger enemy, to ‘hereby ordering’ private companies to look for alternatives to operations in China.”
He linked to a lament by conservative writer Rod Dreher, who, he noted, “is exhausted from the president behaving like ‘a clown who refuses to meet with the prime minister of Denmark because she won’t sell him Greenland.’ ”
Notice a theme? Apparently weariness with Trump’s wackiness does something virtually unheard-of in the United States circa 2019: It transcends partisanship.
Trump’s instinct and strategy are to conquer by overwhelming. But there’s a difference between wearing people down and wearing them out. He’s like the last seasons of “House of Cards” — a riveting spectacle devolved into a repellent burlesque, so unrestrained in its appetites that it devoured itself.
I wouldn’t be surprised if voters consciously or subconsciously conclude that they just can’t continue to live like this and that four more years would be ruinous, if not to the country as a whole, then to our individual psyches. By the time Election Day rolls around, they may crave nothing more electric than stability and serenity. That wouldn’t be a bad Democratic bumper sticker. It’s essentially the message of Joe Biden’s campaign.
According to Morning Consult’s tracking poll, Trump’s approval rating in vital swing states has declined significantly since he took office. Take Wisconsin: His approval rating in January 2017 was 47%, and his disapproval rating was 41, for a net plus of 6 percentage points. Now his approval has fallen to 41 while his disapproval has climbed to 55, for a net minus of 14.
Maybe that reflects voters’ economic worries. I suspect it’s just as much about their exhaustion. They’ve binged on Trump and now they’re overstuffed with Trump, and if Democratic candidates are smart, they’ll not dwell on his mess and madness, because voters have taken his measure and made their judgments, and what many of them want is release from the incessant drumbeat of that infernal syllable: Trump, Trump, Trump .
They’d like a new miniseries with a different cast, and Democrats aren’t giving them that if they keep putting Trump’s name above the title. On Saturday and then again Sunday, I turned the whole damn show off and fled to the park for fresh air. I pray that’s some sort of omen.

'The 1619 Project' Hurts Blacks; The New York Times series wallows in victimhood and ignores success.

Texto completo: The New York Times recently released a special 100-page edition of its Sunday magazine arguing that slavery has left an indelible mark on the soul of our nation and that its legacy remains the principal cause of inequities between races. Titled "The 1619 Project" (referencing the arrival of the first black slaves, 400 years ago), the initiative is designed to show that whites have always been and continue to be the beneficiaries of both slavery and its attendant institutional racism—and blacks the perpetual victims.
This thesis is the consensus of the nearly 20 black scholars, poets and artists who contributed to this issue of the Times magazine, and it will be the mantra of subsequent media coverage as well as various speeches by left-leaning politicians. Most dangerous of all, the Pulitzer Center has packaged the Times project as a curriculum for students of all ages that will be disseminated throughout the country.
Those who cherish the founding vision and values of our nation have critiqued the central premise of the 1619 Project. But criticism should also be voiced by leaders within the black community, whom the project purports to represent. The most devastating aspect of the project's narrative is its insinuation that blacks are born inherently damaged by an all-prevailing racism and that their future prospects are determined by the whims of whites.
Though slavery and discrimination are undeniably a tragic part of our nation's history, America has made strides in its long and tortuous journey to realize its promise and abide by its founding principles. The best way to continue that advancement is to teach people the inspiring stories of those who have achieved in spite of prejudice and bettered the nation. Barraging minorities with constant reminders of the injuries their ancestors suffered only discourages them from working to surmount the obstacles in their way.
In truth, even during the worst periods of oppression, there were blacks who were in slavery but not of slavery. They maintained a strong moral code and a belief in self-determination and mutual support that allowed them to rise despite their enslavement. There were men and women who were born slaves yet died millionaires.
Even in the era of legislated segregation and discrimination before the civil-rights movement, blacks tapped an entrepreneurial legacy to launch thriving enterprises, including hotels, banks, hospitals, dental schools, insurance companies and even a dry dock and railroad company. In fact, the black business district of Durham, N.C., was widely known as "Black Wall Street." This spectrum of achievement is a powerful refutation of the claim that the destiny of black Americans is determined by what whites do—or what they did in the past.
This empowering spirit is alive today. While the race-grievance purveyors declare that institutional racism destines blacks to lives of poverty and impotence, black people have risen to establish oases of excellence and accomplishment in their communities. My organization, the Woodson Center, was created to draw attention and support their efforts. For nearly 40 years, it has provided resources and technical assistance to thousands of community leaders of all races who have rejuvenated their neighborhoods and empowered the people they serve to improve their lives.
Black America's history of success and achievement—and its continuing legacy today—is a vital, inspiring part of our nation's past. It's sadly overlooked in "The 1619 Project." That project also promotes the dangerous idea that the black community is exempt from responsibility to lift itself. To paraphrase C.S. Lewis, some prisons have locks that are on the inside.
Mr. Woodson is president and founder of the Woodson Center.

Texto completo: The speech of the year in 1984 was an address to Republican Convention. Former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Jeane J. Kirkpatrick brought the crowd to its feet many times over with her repeated litany that when anything went wrong anywhere in the world or the country, the instinctive response of the American Left, and indeed the Left anywhere, was to "blame America first."
Their aim was not to acknowledge the nation's flaws, but to hold up those flaws as the whole of the matter, as if the flaws had been all that there ever was. Because it was lost, Vietnam was the one war that mattered. Because they were wrong, segregation and slavery were the two things that defined the whole country, and still define it now that they’re gone.
Having failed to prove that the country was sick because the president had sold out to Russia, the New York Times has gone back to that oldest of wells to say that the country is still doomed by segregation and slavery. Neither the Civil War nor the civil rights movement had any effect. America is really all about slavery, and its real founding was not 1787, when delegates signed the Constitution, but 1619, when the first slave ship arrived on the coast of Virginia.
Of course, in 1619, as "the country" consisted of two tiny outposts on the coast. But out of that seed grew the malevolent plant, which would soon threaten everything — the contradiction between Thomas Jefferson’s words that "all men are created equal" and "endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights," and the harsh fact that he, in his long life, literally owned hundreds of people with no rights at all.
This conflict between Jefferson’s life and his own aspirations would force his country to re-found itself many times over. This included the 1860’s, when it ended slavery, and one hundred years later, when segregation was ended. Each alteration brought the United States closer to his aspirations.
The Times acts as if the ill-fated landing in 1619 was an event that froze everything. In fact, it was only a series of many ongoing adjustments, which may not yet have run out their course.
None of founders who left Philadelphia in 1787, when the Constitutional Convention had ended, had any illusions that their problems were settled. The Times doesn't say that abolitionist movements existed almost as long as did slavery; that Washington said that if the Union broke up over slavery he would leave Virginia and side with the North; that Jefferson called slavery "a fire-bell in the night" that could ring any moment, and that he spoke for a great many others in this anguished confession "I tremble for my country when I recall that God is just."
Will the Times tip its hat to the protests and riots that broke out against admitting new slave states to the union? To ‘Bleeding Kansas,’ and the massacres therein? To the hundreds of thousands who couldn’t live in a country that allowed these things to happen, and thus gave up their own lives?
If the country swallowed slavery once, it had the good sense to cough it up later, instead of settling for a compromised and laissez-faire country in which the South was permitted to do its own thing. If the country defined itself once when it let slavery settle, it defined itself even more in the battle against it, which in the event was its genuine founding. Will the Times ever dare say this is true?

Texto completo: President Trump trolled the media saying that there aren't bedbugs at his Doral golf resort after facing scrutiny for suggesting that the United States may host next year's G-7 summit at the resort.
The president revealed that Doral was a leading location for next year's summit on Monday. Following the revelation, a number of people were critical of the idea suggesting that Trump could profit financially for hosting the event there.
"No bedbugs at Doral," Trump tweeted Tuesday morning. "The Radical Left Democrats, upon hearing that the perfectly located (for the next G-7) Doral National MIAMI was under consideration for the next G-7, spread that false and nasty rumor. Not nice!"TweetThe reference to bedbugs likely refers to the news that The New York Times found evidence of possible bedbug infiltration throughout the newsroom. An email to employees said that there was evidence of the parasites in a wellness room, “on the second floor, a couch on the third floor and a booth on the fourth floor.”
Despite the president's claim, a New Jersey insurance executive sued the Doral resort back after allegedly getting bit by bedbugs while staying there in March, 2016. The Miami Herald's coverage of the lawsuit from the time it took place resurfaced on social media Monday following the president's announcement.

De Blasio Gives Up on Educating Poor Kids; Rather than expanding schools that help minority students, the mayor wants to shut them down.

Texto completo: To say that many liberal elites have all but given up on educating low-income minorities might seem like an overstatement. But when you consider the state of public education in our inner cities, and the priorities of those in charge, it's hard to draw any other conclusion.
After Labor Day, New York City's 1.1 million public school students will return to the classroom. The majority of them can't do basic reading or math, according to state standardized test results released last week. And the numbers get even more depressing when broken down by race and ethnicity. Black and Hispanic students make up 67% of the system, while whites and Asians are about 15% and 16%, respectively. Only 28% of black students passed the math exam, versus 33% of Hispanics, 67% of whites and 74% of Asians. On the English exam, the passage rates were 68% for Asians, 67% for whites, 37% for Hispanics and 35% for blacks.
Sadly, these racial gaps in academic achievement have persisted for decades, and they are a main source of racial inequality in America. Want to help someone avoid poverty or addiction or incarceration? An education goes a long way. The irony is that the same social-justice advocates who obsess over inequality also spurn reforms, such as public charter schools, that help close black-white differences in learning. "City charter schools, now teaching roughly 10% of the city's student population, markedly outperformed traditional public schools again" on the state tests, reported the New York Post. Fifty-seven percent of charter-school test takers passed the state English exam, and 63% passed the math portion.
Moreover, the highest scores in the state, for the third year in a row, came from Success Academy, a New York City-based charter-school network, where the passage rates for math and English were an astounding 99% and 90%, respectively. Even more impressive is that these charter students are mostly low-income blacks and Hispanics, not middle-class Asians and whites.
If the primary goal were student achievement, Democratic politicians like New York Mayor Bill de Blasio would allow these successful school models to proliferate. But the mayor is far more interested in placating his political benefactors, the powerful teachers unions, which oppose charter schools because they don't control them. To the National Education Association, the American Federation of Teachers and their thousands of state and local affiliates, public education is more about jobs than about kids. Reforms that marginalize or circumvent union members are rejected, regardless of whether they benefit students. Mr. de Blasio may identify as a progressive champion of the underprivileged, but that's lip service. The reality is that he's blocking the surest path to the middle class for the city's poor by relegating them to inferior schools.
Opponents of school reform insist that a lack of funding is a major problem, but education spending has increased for decades without significant improvements in outcomes. Per pupil spending in places like Baltimore and Washington is among the highest in the nation, but you'd never know that based on test scores. In New York's poorer neighborhoods, school spending is significantly higher than the citywide average, which in turn is well above the national average.
The claim that racism explains the learning gap also can't withstand scrutiny, but that hasn't stopped liberals from making school desegregation a priority. In fact, some of the best public schools in the country are high-performing charter schools with large percentages of black and brown students. That doesn't mean segregated schools are desirable or that they lead to academic success, but at the very least it does suggest that black children don't need white classmates before they can learn how to multiply fractions or diagram sentences.
Nevertheless, the left's ideological obsession with racial balance in the classroom continues. Mr. de Blasio is currently preoccupied with trying to phase out gifted-and-talented programs because they are populated with too many white and Asian students. This is an extension of his beef with the city's elite public high schools, which admit kids based on a standardized exam. It's worth noting that even the New York Times has questioned the mayor's reasoning and the possible fallout. "He risks alienating tens of thousands of mostly white and Asian families whose children are enrolled in the gifted programs and selective schools," the paper wrote this week. "If a substantial number of those families leave the system, it would be even more difficult to achieve integration."
You'd think that the main objective of the inequality-obsessed would be to help more minorities meet high academic standards, but Mr. de Blasio and his fellow progressives would rather eliminate the standards altogether. I'd call that giving up on minority kids. What would you call it?

Texto completo: What should communities do as climate change escalates threats like sea-level rise?
Until now, much of the focus has been on disaster response, with very little discussion of orderly, strategic retreat from areas at risk. After Hurricane Sandy in 2012, for example, the New York state governor’s office ran a public service announcement that made clear the focus would be on rebuilding.
But a paper published this month in the journal Science makes a case that, sometimes, retreating from nature instead of fighting it can actually open up new opportunities for communities.
“There’s a definite rhetoric of, ‘We’re going to build it back better. We’re going to win. We’re going to beat this. Something technological is going to come and it’s going to save us,’ ” said A.R. Siders, an assistant professor with the disaster research center at the University of Delaware and lead author of the paper.
“It’s like, let’s step back and think for a minute,” she said. “You’re in a fight with the ocean. You’re fighting to hold the ocean in place. Maybe that’s not the battle we want to pick.”
In fact, people have often retreated after catastrophic weather events. New Orleans, for example, lost roughly half of its population after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and the city’s population is still only 85% of what it was before the storm. But those retreats have generally been ad hoc, not managed, and not necessarily done with broader social interests in mind.
“After major storms, a lot of communities want to relocate,” Siders said. She noted that in New York after Sandy, a number of communities applied for buyout programs to relocate, but only two of them actually got funding.
That left people in those other communities with limited options, most of them bad.
If they were wealthy, they could walk away from their homes and take the financial loss. But if they had lower income, they often couldn’t make that decision and faced the prospect of remaining in houses they knew were at high risk of flooding. And even if they did manage to sell their homes, they wouldn’t be lessening the risks so much as transferring them to others.
The new paper lays out ways communities could practice managed retreats that would address their broader needs. Lack of access to reliable climate-hazard maps, for example, makes it difficult to make informed choices about risk. Such maps must be improved and updated regularly, the paper said.
“I’m so glad that these kinds of pieces are getting written and that they’re laying out this sort of agenda for research and practice and thinking around these like very inevitably thorny and conflictual questions of retreat,” said Liz Koslov an assistant professor in the department of urban planning at the University of California, Los Angeles, who was not involved in the study.
If communities could practice strategic retreats, the study says, doing so would not only reduce the need for people to choose among bad options, but also improve their circumstances.
Siders pointed to Soldiers Grove, Wisconsin, a town of about 500 that, after one too many floods, moved itself out of the flood plain. The community took that challenge and turned it into opportunity, reorienting the business district such that it could take advantage of highway traffic and powering it entirely with solar energy - and they did this in the 1970s.
The article not only stresses the viability of retreat but challenges the idea that retreat is based exclusively on geographical factors like elevation and proximity to the coast. “Retreat, in practice, depends at least as much on sort of social, economic, cultural geography,” Koslov said.
“It’s not that everywhere should retreat,” Siders said. “It’s that retreat should be an option. It should be a real viable option on the table that some places will need to use.”

Texto completo: Doctors told Sara Gonzalez the only way to stop her daughter's paralyzing seizures was to remove half of her brain. But before opting for a surgery that could completely strip her 7-year-old of independence, the Queens resident turned to "the crowd" for a second opinion. 
"The crowd" is what Dr. Lisa Sanders calls the readers of her New York Times Magazine series "Diagnosis." The column turns to the public for help solving health issues that have medical professionals stumped, and it's recently been turned into a docuseries on Netflix.
The second episode of "Diagnosis," titled "Second Opinions," takes viewers into the life of Gonzalez's daughter Sadie.
"She was an unstoppable force of nature," Sanders says of the resilient child whose deteriorating health has kept her from school and friends. She suffers from a rare brain disease that causes her to have multiple seizures per day.
Her story was first featured in the Times' Oct. 11, 2018, column.
"Sadie's seizures don't respond to medications at all," Gonzalez explains in the episode. After a year of watching her daughter suffer seemingly unpredictable seizures targeting her mouth and legs, the determined mother reveals Sadie's doctors have landed on a diagnosis of Rasmussen's Encephalitis. An inflammatory neurological disease that's both chronic and quite rare, RE is characterized by, among other traits, seizures, loss of motor skills and speech, and eventual partial paralysis. 
The only cure in sight: The removal of the impacted portion of Sadie's brain.
Sanders - who serves as a consultant of sorts for patients impacted by such medical mysteries - helps Sara sort through thousands of video tips sent in by Times readers, doctors and medical students from around the globe suggesting Sadie may not have Rasmussen's after all. 
We caught up with Sanders to discuss how her column helped change Sadie's life.
What initially intrigued you about Sadie's condition when selecting her case for your column?
I heard about Sadie's case from my nephew - they are friends with Sadie's family. And it just sounded so heartbreaking. To have a great kid - normal, healthy, incredibly social and outgoing - suddenly transformed and in this extraordinary way. She and her parents are such vibrant personalities. I was fascinated by their remarkable story and felt others would be moved to want to help. I certainly was.
How did you see this condition impacting her life?
I visited with Sadie one afternoon when they were going to visit Sadie's grandmother. She's a really charismatic kid and puts on such a brave face. When I saw her she was having seizures in her mouth and leg. She stopped when the seizures made her but then, as soon as she was able, kept going. I knew she was frustrated - how could she not be? But she was determined to have fun and enjoy the visit with her grandmother and cousins no matter what.
How did the crowd help change her life?
The crowd gave her mother options. And that's really what it's supposed to do.
After hearing from "the crowd," Sara opted to have a device implanted in Sadie's brain to help limit her seizures. How is she doing now? 
Last I heard, she was doing well with the implanted device. But I've been out of touch for the past few months.
Your column reflects the rise of internet diagnosis. How are you seeing this change the medical field? 
It really allows doctors to provide evidence-based care to our patients in a way that the pre-internet, very limited access to immediate information could never do. There is so much excellent information at our fingertips, it makes it much easier to provide the kind of excellent care we aspire to.
And it's given patients access to information too, and that's been hugely helpful. There is excellent information out there. There is also not excellent information and outright bad information, too. And sometimes it can be hard to tell them apart ... the only way to know that information is of high quality is to get it from a high-quality source. I suggest to my patients that they rely on information that comes from the NIH [National Institutes of Health] or other government sources. That's information that is accurate and useful. 
What kind of issues does "Diagnosis" expose in terms of health care accessibility?
We didn't design the show as a critique of U.S. health care. But in the course of following these patients in their search for a diagnosis, we could see, sometimes, where issues in the system became problems for the patient.
For example, Sadie couldn't go see the top specialist in Rasmussen's Encephalitis at John's Hopkins because her insurance wouldn't cover it. So, that's not only the actual visit but any of the tests he might want to order or procedures he might have wanted to do. So, she didn't get to see him. Was that a problem? I don't know, but it might have been nice to know what the leading expert in a rare disease, the expert who has seen the most patients with this disorder, might have said, thought and done.

Texto completo: Just when families and communities need naloxone the most, federal authorities are warning that not enough of the overdose-reversing drug is being dispensed.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued an alarming report recently that the drug is hard to find, particularly in rural communities, which are often hardest hit by the opioid-addiction crisis.
While medical experts recommend that naloxone be dispensed with every painkiller prescription, fewer than 70% of people who get a painkiller prescription also get the naloxone that can save their lives if they overdose, the CDC found.
Naloxone, which is often sold under the brand name Narcan, is useful in reviving overdose victims, especially when they are discovered by family or first responders or even strangers. In many cases, it can reverse an overdose and save victims' lives before an ambulance or other medical help can arrive to help them.
The CDC report says that naloxone is not readily available because physicians are not prescribing it along with painkillers, as they should. Also, the agency report says, the drug can be too expensive or difficult for pharmacies to keep on hand.
We know that better access to naloxone saves lives. In Pennsylvania and Ohio, dramatic and surprising drops in the number of overdose deaths last year are in part credited to wide distribution and use of naloxone.
The same agency now sounding the alarm about a slowdown in naloxone dispersal - the CDC - released the overdose-death statistics earlier this summer. That data showed that in Pennsylvania and Ohio, 2018 overdose deaths had declined by as much as 20% from 2017. That change reverses a terrifying trend of several years when the overdose-death rates had risen by that much or more annually. And it means about 1,000 fewer people in each statedied from an accidental overdose in 2018 than in 2017.
The opioid epidemic has taken a terrible toll across the country, but Pennsylvania has routinely been among the hardest-hit states. Solving the crisis will require much more than improving access to the drug that can reverse overdoses: more drug abuse prevention and education, better access to detox and drug treatment, better alternatives to the opioid painkillers that have ensnared many in the grip of addiction.
Even with the slight drop in deaths last year, the overdose-death rate in the United States is about seven times higher than it was a generation ago.
The CDC report called for doctors and pharmacies to be sure prescription painkillers are always accompanied by naloxone. Insurance companies can help by making sure the drug is not prohibitively expensive.
But many overdose victims are not falling victim to drugs they were recently prescribed. For many, an opioid addiction continues long after the prescription is gone but their addiction has taken hold. These victims may overdose on illicit prescription painkillers, or heroin, or even synthetic fentanyl, bought on the street.
Making naloxone readily available, over the counter or through community distribution programs, is also essential.

Taylor Swift's Inner Thoughts, in Longhand

Texto completo: On Friday, when Taylor Swift released her seventh album, "Lover," she didn't just deliver 18 songs into the digital ether. As one of the few remaining pop stars to prioritize physical sales, Swift offered her devoted fan base four special-edition CD versions of the album, available exclusively at Target, each accompanied by a booklet containing a reprinted selection of handwritten journal entries spanning her career, from ages 13 to 27.
Instead of collectible fluff, the result, for any close reader of Swift's work, is a meticulously curated glimpse into the artist's real-time feelings on an array of issues, people, ideas and squabbles that have defined her life as a musician and celebrity. "I frequently and drastically changed my opinions on love, friends, confidence and trust," she notes in the introduction to the selections, and then proceeds to show just how.
Across the four unique assortments, Swift tells a piecemeal story of her rise in the industry, where label meetings as a young teenager turn into radio play, record sales, the Grammy Awards and the Met Gala, mixing landmark moments with mundane personal updates, drafts of lyrics and other marginalia.
Jon Caramanica, a New York Times pop music critic, and Joe Coscarelli, the pop music reporter, dug through the entries searching for insights about Swift, her music and her methods of self-presentation.
JOE COSCARELLI Jon, I have to come right out and say that after reading the "Lover" booklets multiple times as if they were Tina Brown's "Vanity Fair Diaries," I can't help but be borderline hyperbolic: Nearly a decade and a half into Swift's career, which includes seven varyingly diaristic albums and countless hours in the public eye, these carefully selected and expertly pruned diary pages might somehow be the single most revealing cumulative artifact when it comes to establishing what kind of person, artist and operator Taylor Swift has become -- and has always been. I'm not sure she'll ever need a memoir if she has hundreds more of these pages lying around.
Like the best pop culture ephemera, the entries feel like a skeleton key to an Established Persona in ways both intentional and not, leaving the reader to wonder exactly how much self-awareness is involved at any given moment. Most often, the answer is obviously a lot -- every page feels designed to address a running theme or controversy in Swift's career, from her endless ambition to her obsession with fairy-tale love to her anxiety around performance to newer narratives, like her struggles with her body image. But then there are selections that feel so telling, vulnerable and formative that you wonder how such a careful, politician-like celebrity could be so casually, unceasingly herself.
JON CARAMANICA I gobbled these up as well, but as my excitement was growing with each oh-wow detail, I couldn't help but think, time and again, that I was being triggered by someone who specifically understands just how much to reveal, and on what terms.
Because of course there's an entry decrying how the internet was making young people less present in the moment. (Was there also one -- not included -- talking about how awesome it is?) Of course there's an entry from when she was still shopping for a record deal where she says she was told that, in country music, "Radio just doesn't play teens," which we now know is false (at least, if that teen is named Taylor Swift). These are tiny firecrackers designed to spark empathy, to make any right-minded person sign up to wage Taylor's battles right alongside her.
COSCARELLI As far as her relationship to technology goes, Swift does call a new iPhone her "soul mate" at age 18. Could we ever have been so innocent?
Don't get me wrong, more than half the fun of reading these is gut-checking myself on when, exactly, I'm being spun or manipulated, which is exactly how I feel about her best lyrics (and most great art).
The earliest stuff included is in many ways the most impactful for me, because it leaves you feeling as if things could not have ever turned out any differently than they have. A couple of sentences about Swift's first day of eighth grade in Wyomissing, Pa., from 2003, have all the drive, eagerness, defensiveness, perceived ostracization and earnest optimism we've come to expect: "I think my teacher's gonna give me a spotlight solo in chorus! This year could be fun. I don't care what people think of me now because I won't let them bring me down."
Or elsewhere, also from age 13: "I guess I'm just not good enough for people my own age. OR maybe I'm not bad enough?" The next year, she gives a big "I <3 SCHOOL!" -- but only on the day of the talent show, where Swift writes that she "got a standing ovation and everything."
CARAMANICA Those early entries shook me as well, largely for their prescience -- here was a teenager with uncommon drive, fully formed ambition, and the wherewithal to write it all down, as if anticipating the needs of fans, scholars and The New York Times. Imagine, after attending your first Met Gala, having the patience and presence of mind to write a diary entry about everything that happened, including that Jon Bon Jovi said hello.
COSCARELLI Not only said hello, but "(who called me over to talk to him)" -- crucial parenthetical!
For someone who has long been accused by her least generous critics of having a victim or persecution complex, as well as a ruthless corporate spirit, it feels borderline defiant to have included some of this stuff. Though I do wonder if the physical nature of these documents and the scavenger-hunt aspect of collecting them all -- a barrier to entry that could keep out all but the most completist fans -- allowed Swift to know she would be reaching an overwhelmingly sympathetic audience.
CARAMANICA The diary entries from 2003-06 aren't simply the loose musings of a young singer with big dreams and, suddenly, the opportunity and resources to pursue them. They also capture the mercenary instincts of the teenage Taylor. Two of the entries begin with her noting her song placements on the Mediabase and Billboard charts.
It all made me a little sad? The teen years are ruthless without the additional pressure of attempting to infiltrate a corporate ecosystem not at all designed for you. In May 2003, she's practically hyperventilating on the way to Nashville to audition for labels: "I'm okay. I'll be fine. I'm young. I'm talented. They'll see it in me. I'll be okay. I've got to hang on. Can't worry. I'm only 13. I'm allowed to make mistakes, right?" By 19, she's journaling about management: "I gave everyone in the band raises." Her crew included 72 people: "Bonused everybody."
COSCARELLI We should probably talk about the weight and dieting moments, as well. Body image is not something that has traditionally been thought of as a Swiftian subject, but it's something that she's begun touching on in interviews and public statements and that's really prevalent here.
She writes about visiting New York and stopping with her mother at a Tasti D-Lite, the faux-ice cream shop that was a favorite of Carrie Bradshaw. Swift raves about it as "kosher, noncholesterol, extremely tasty, dreamy frozen yogurt and only 40 calories. Does it get any better than that?" She was 13.
At 16, in an otherwise unrelated entry, she drops in: "Oh and I'm dieting again. Over the holidays I didn't watch what I ate and man it's so weird how fast I can gain or lose weight. It's crazy. So I'm going to lose some now." This is the kind of thing I can imagine really connecting with fans, who might otherwise feel like they know all there is to know about this figure.
CARAMANICA I felt a similar way when, at 13, she wrote about a Code Red drill at her school, which seems like an oblique nod at the current gun control debate, and the ways in which the specter of gun violence has become a reality hanging over American children.
COSCARELLI In this age of celebrities controlling so much of their own narratives via social media, self-helmed multimedia projects and an anemic press, I found these relatively raw, primary-source documents to be a far richer personal text than, say, a Beyoncé documentary or even Swift's own public writing, like her "30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30" listicle.
And obviously it takes a certain type of person to write things privately that seem from the jump to be designed for posterity, for history, for public consumption, but it feels almost throwback in the way it nods to Important Artists like Springsteen or Dylan donating their archives to major institutions.
CARAMANICA I dare Bob Dylan to donate his teenage diaries to a museum! Also we've spoken so much about how we're waiting for Taylor to make her Joni Mitchell "Blue" album and there's an entry here where she cops to teaching herself to play the Appalachian dulcimer because that's what Joni played on that album. We see you, Taylor.
COSCARELLI: And she mentions teaching herself to play "A Case of You," which felt like an allusion to the writer Bob Lefsetz, a longtime Swift antagonist, claiming that he was the one to introduce Taylor to Joni's music.
Even as a pure P.R. exercise, the diary includes the sort of tactical sophistication I want from an artist of this size and caliber. There are two drafts of the lyrics for "All Too Well" that cement it as some of her strongest writing; and a tease of an entry -- pure wide-eyed naïveté -- about Kanye interrupting her at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards that cuts off before she gets to anything truly juicy. Then there's the last page of the Version 2 booklet, from August 2016, right after Kim Kardashian West detonated her Snapchat/snake emoji gossip bomb, that just reads: "This summer is the apocalypse," and nothing more. That's just great zine-making.
CARAMANICA That quick line is great, a gut punch neatly rendered on the page. Another of the few late-era Taylor entries is from 2017, three months into her relationship with Joe Alwyn, a brief note on wanting to protect the blossoming relationship "from the nasty world that just wants to ruin things."
But this, too, is a kind of feint. Apart from this and the occasional fleeting allusion to romance -- "haven't kissed a boy in 209 days" -- very little in here is of a personal nature, the sorts of things that typically fill teenage diaries. (That said, I'm certain that there are subtweets to her exes embedded herein.)
All these hand-scrawled sentiments are really in service of a narrative about the predestiny of Taylor's career -- say, capturing the mood the days she wrote "Red" or "I Knew You Were Trouble" -- deploying one type of intimacy as a means of eliding a whole other one.
Sometimes, though, the kind she leans in to is telling, and brutal. I'm thinking of the casual allusions to Scott Borchetta, who recently sold Big Machine Records -- and with it, the masters to the first six Taylor Swift albums -- to Ithaca Holdings, the company led by Scooter Braun, who Taylor perceives as an enemy for his long association with Kanye West. In these entries, Borchetta is portrayed as a good guy, the one record executive who believed in her early -- they're source documents entered into evidence as proof of good faith. But Taylor isn't including these entries to absolve him -- she's including them to damn him. (He posted a pic on his Instagram nonetheless.)
She does this, too, with the conservative country singer John Rich, who assailed her last year for her support of the Democratic Senate candidate Phil Bredesen, but who at the end of the 2000s was someone she looked up to, and eventually wrote songs with.
COSCARELLI In a lot of ways, it's a callback to the way she used to leave codes in her album's lyric booklets that gave more cryptic context and encouraged listeners to match the scenarios to real-life events. These mentions aren't nearly as subtle.
I also enjoyed the self-effacing moments, like when she writes on Grammys' eve 2014: "Never have I felt so good about our chances. Never have I wanted something as badly as I want to hear them say 'Red' is the Album of the Year." Swift, of course, has won album of the year twice, but didn't that time; instead, there was the semi-viral moment of her celebrating preemptively as Alicia Keys, accompanied by Yoko Ono, announced "'Rrr ... andom Access Memories,' Daft Punk" as the winner.
CARAMANICA: I should say that I've maybe never been more impressed with Taylor than I was reading the 2014 entries that suggest that her total time between deciding to move to New York and being essentially fully moved in was under three months. Meanwhile, your favorite pop star has her assistant bookmarking StreetEasy listings that she never clicks on.
But even after all this, there's one question that's still nagging at me. What if the entries are all ... deepfakes?
COSCARELLI Then they're the most realistic ones I've seen yet.

Texto completo: The legal team for Andrew McCabe met last week with the No. 2 official at the Justice Department and the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, a person familiar with the matter said, suggesting that a decision could be close on whether the FBI's former acting director will face criminal charges on allegations that he lied to investigators.
McCabe's team met with U.S. Attorney Jessie K. Liu and, separately, with Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey A. Rosen, the person said. Meetings with such high-level law enforcement officials typically come near the end of criminal investigations, affording defense attorneys a chance to make their last pitch on why their client should not be charged.
Spokesmen for McCabe and the Justice Department declined to comment. The person familiar with the matter spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation. The development was first reported Monday by the New York Times.
Federal prosecutors have been weighing for well over a year whether to charge McCabe, after the Justice Department's inspector general alleged that McCabe had misled investigators several times about a media disclosure regarding the investigation into Hillary Clinton's family foundation.
By the inspector general's telling, McCabe approved the disclosure and later - when asked about the matter by investigators with the FBI's inspection division and inspector general's office - denied having done so. McCabe's attorney has said previously that his statements "are more properly understood as the result of misunderstanding, miscommunication, and honest failures of recollection based on the swirl of events around him." Lying to investigators is a federal crime.
McCabe, the FBI's No. 2 official who was elevated to lead the bureau after President Trump fired James B. Comey as director in May 2017, has become a lightning rod for the political battles surrounding the bureau's recent work. He authorized the FBI to begin investigating Trump after Comey's firing, and he became a frequent target of the president's criticism.
In March 2018, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired McCabe, citing the inspector general's findings. But McCabe alleged that the move - which came just hours before he could retire and collect full benefits - was politically motivated. He later wrote a book airing unflattering details of his interactions with Trump and Sessions, and earlier this month, he sued over his removal.
All the while, the U.S. attorney's office for the District has continued to examine McCabe.
It remains unclear whether McCabe will be charged - although the recent meeting shows that the case is alive. Trump supporters probably would be dismayed to see the Justice Department pass on the case, particularly because there were Trump allies who pleaded guilty to lying as part of then-special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's probe. Charges against McCabe, on the other hand, could spark allegations from the left that he is being retaliated against for authorizing the investigation into Trump.

Texto completo: Joe Walsh, a former Illinois congressman and tea party favorite turned radio talk show host, announced a challenge Sunday to President Donald Trump for the Republican nomination in 2020, saying the incumbent is unfit for office and must be denied a second term.
"He's nuts. He's erratic. He's cruel. He stokes bigotry. He's incompetent. He doesn't know what he's doing, Walsh told ABC's "This Week. The longshot portrayed himself as a legitimate alternative in party where he said many are opposed to Trump but are "scared to death of saying so publicly.
His campaign slogan: "Be brave.
Polls shows Trump is backed by most Republican voters, and the lone rival already in the race is former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld, the 2016 Libertarian Party vice presidential nominee who is regarded as fiscally conservative but socially liberal.
Undeterred from pressing ahead with his candidacy, Walsh said, "I think this thing ... will catch on like wildfire. The former Trump booster added: "I'm a conservative. And I think there's a decent chance to present to Republican voters a conservative without all the baggage.
The one-word response from Trump's campaign to Walsh's entry: "Whatever.
Walsh narrowly won a House seat from suburban Chicago in the 2010 tea party wave but lost a 2012 reelection bid and has since hosted a radio talk show. He has a history of inflammatory statements regarding Muslims and others and declared just before the 2016 election that if Trump lost, "I'm grabbing my musket.
But he has since soured on Trump, criticizing the president over growth of the federal deficit and writing in a New York Times column that the president was "a racial arsonist who encourages bigotry and xenophobia to rouse his base.
The road ahead for any Republican primary challenger will be difficult.
In recent months, Trump's allies have taken over state parties that control primary elections in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and elsewhere. State party leaders sometimes pay lip service to the notion that they would welcome a primary challenger, as their state party rules usually require, but they are already working to ensure Trump's reelection.
South Carolina Republicans have gone so far as to discuss canceling their state's GOP primary altogether if a legitimate primary challenge emerges to eliminate the threat.
At the same time, polling consistently shows that Trump has the solid backing of an overwhelming majority of Republican voters. An Associated Press-NORC poll conducted this month found that 78% of Republicans approve of Trump's job performance. That number has been hovering around 80% even as repeated scandals have rocked his presidency.
"Look, this isn't easy to do. ... I'm opening up my life to tweets and attacks. Everything I've said and tweeted now, Trump's going to go after, and his bullies are going to go after, Walsh said.
Asked whether he was prepared for that, Walsh replied: "Yes, I'm ready for it.
Weld, in an interview on NBC's "Meet the Press, said he was "thrilled that Walsh was in the race and that Mark Sanford, a former South Carolina governor and congressman, was considering joining them, leading to a "more robust conversation.
"Who knows? The networks might even cover Republican primary debates, Weld said.
Walsh, 57, rode a wave of anti-President Barack Obama sentiment to a 300-vote victory over a Democratic incumbent in the 2010 election. He made a name for himself in Washington as a cable news fixture who was highly disparaging of Obama.
Walsh was criticized for saying that the Democratic Party's "game is to make Latinos dependent on government just like "they got African Americans dependent upon government. At another point, he said radical Muslims are in the U.S. "trying to kill Americans every week, including in Chicago's suburbs.
He lost his 2012 reelection bid by more than 20,000 votes to Democrat Tammy Duckworth, who was elected to the U.S. Senate four years later.
Walsh told Obama to "watch out on Twitter in July 2016 after five police officers were killed in Dallas. Just days before Trump's 2016 win over Hillary Clinton, Walsh tweeted: "On November 8th, I'm voting for Trump. On November 9th, if Trump loses, I'm grabbing my musket. You in? Walsh later said on Twitter that he was referring to "acts of civil disobedience.
On Sunday, Walsh said he apologized for past divisive comments.
"I helped create Trump. There's no doubt about that, the personal, ugly politics. I regret that. And I'm sorry for that, he said.

Texto completo: Grabbing a copy of the newspaper at your favorite coffee shop is a thing of the past, at least it is if you frequent Starbucks.
The coffee chain will quit selling USA TODAY as well as The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal in more than 8,600 U.S. stores in September. Starbucks has sold The Times since 2000 and other papers since 2010. The New York Post first reported Starbucks' decision to drop newspapers.
The decision was attributed to the decline of in-store sales of newspapers.
"We are always looking at what we offer our customers in our stores and making adjustments to our portfolio based on changing customer behavior," said Starbucks spokesperson Sanja Gould. "As part of our continuous efforts to enhance the overall experience in our stores for both partners and customers, we are removing select fixtures from our retail lobby in September."
These fixtures include shelves with whole bean coffee and snacks, although these items will be available elsewhere in the store.
Newspapers won't necessarily be out at all Starbucks locations. Licensed locations in hospitals, universities and other institutions might continue to sell newspapers since they are not operated by the coffee chain itself.
The company has looked to simplify and reduce the number of products included in the store, including tumblers and specialty drinks, based on what customers are buying.
Though java and journalism have been a classic pairing for generations, indeed, the smells and smears of newsprint are in decline. While some papers are adding digital subscribers, newspaper weekday circulation has declined by more than half since its peak in the mid-'80s.

Texto completo: On a daily basis - with special emphasis from the Democratic primary candidates - we read and hear that President Donald Trump is the source of all hatred and uncivil public discourse in this country.
Yet, little, if anything, is said about the hatred spewing from the mouths and pens of such public progressives as Cory Booker, who has said he'd like to punch the president; Jimmy Kimmel, Snoop Dogg and Johnny Depp, who have "joked" about assassinating the president; Madonna, who said she wants to blow up the White House; Kathy Griffin, who posed with a fake severed head that resembled the president; and the Black Lives Matter protesters, who have said they want to see more dead cops.
Not to mention the coarse language of Rep. Rashida Tlaib, who referred to the president with expletatives, or the routine assaults on people by members of the "antifa" movement.
I'm left to ponder which side is promoting more hatred. It's not clear to me that Mr. Trump, who is certainly not innocent, is any more to blame for these uncivil times than the supposedly peace-loving progressives.
Both factions need to clean up their acts.

Trump's chicanery
In the Aug. 15 op-ed "Trump's Pile of Rubble," New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd did not mince her words and presented an argument hard to dispute.
President Donald Trump recently visited Pennsylvania. During the visit, he pathetically blamed others for his blunders and falsely claimed others' achievements as his own.
The president is supposed to be a leader and set an example for all Americans, not a chosen few or one specific political party.
A president serves and represents every American, every family, all races and religions, an entire nation, an obligation that should be fully understood and accepted by all candidates for the office.
Crowd numbers and creating havoc for families at the border seems more important to Mr. Trump than building highways and fixing bridges.
Make no mistake about it, if nothing changed except that a Democrat was the president, Mr. Trump would be the first to bellow and bark of the inhumanities and failures at the border.
Those who accept his chicanery may deserve him, but true Americans do not.
Marty Weixel
Allison Park
Heed Ardent's words
Twenty-first-century Americans would do well to heed the words of the late political philosopher Hannah Arendt. She is famous for her writings on Nazi Germany and the Holocaust, but many of her ideas apply to the United States today.
Here are two of her thoughts:
"Before mass leaders seize the power to fit reality to their lies, their propaganda is marked by its extreme contempt for facts as such, for in their opinion fact depends entirely on the power of the man who can fabricate it."
"The ideal subject of totalitarian rule is not the convinced Nazi ... but people for whom the distinction between fact and fiction ... and between true and false no longer exists."
The failure of many Americans to critically examine their blind allegiance to President Donald Trump is the most perplexing phenomena of the past 50 years. By almost any measure, Mr. Trump is erratic and unfit for office. The blind support from his devoted followers presents a threat to the functioning of our established institutions.
When the citizens of a democracy allow themselves to accept the frequent and outrageous lies of a devious demagogue, then we and our nation are in peril.
William Rice
Butler
Failing America
Washington, D.C., is failing America.
Every time there is a mass shooting, politicians talk about mental illness, which further stigmatizes mental illness, even though those who suffer are far more likely to be victims than perpetrators and their treatments are often denied funding.
And if it is not mental illness, politicians will blame the media, video games or some other nonsense. They never look at our extremely lax gun laws or the spread of white supremacist ideology on the internet, echoed in the rhetoric of our president.
We need to invest in proper gun control and we need to censure the president.
There are no excuses.
People are dying.
Eben Alguire
Wilkinsburg
Time to grow up
I have a suggestion, and I am not taking sides here.
Because the vast majority of our high-ranking elected officials seem to think that they don't have to be productive because they don't like the boss, our president, then maybe they shouldn't get paid for all of their wasted time.
Who else in this country can stop being productive simply because they don't like the boss?
The issue is not who the president is, whether you voted for him or whether you like him. The job of our elected officials is to work together to keep our country from deteriorating.
Please grow up, ladies and gentlemen - there is no "I" in team.

First Steps Toward Fixing the Data Minefield

Texto completo: Each week, we review the week's news , offering analysis about the most important developments in the tech industry.
Hi, I'm Jamie Condliffe. Greetings from London. Here's a look at this week's tech news:
Big Tech is listening. Listening in, certainly. But listening to its critics? Well, maybe a little.
One trend of the past few months that I've not addressed here in detail is the drip feed of stories about what big tech companies are doing with user audio -- particularly words uttered to A.I. assistants like Alexa and Siri, ones sent via Messenger or directed at your Xbox. It turns out that Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft have all been sending sound clips to third-party companies to have them transcribed.
This will surprise no one in Silicon Valley: Picking out information from those audio files helps improve the artificial intelligence systems that now underpin many of Big Tech's products.
Still, it surprised users. And that's really my main reflection on this news: It's a reminder of Big Tech's reluctance to embrace transparency. The companies rarely explain how data is being used and shared. "The main fear, I think, is that in opening a dialogue with users, they will become more paranoid," said Max Van Kleek, an associate professor at Oxford University who works on human-centered computing.
But there is now, more than ever, pressure for this to change. And this week, we got a preview of how that could happen.
On Tuesday, Facebook introduced a new tool, called Off-Facebook Activity, that allows users to see the mountain of data held about them in browsing histories, gathered via "Login with Facebook" partners or the company's tracking pixels, that sites and apps have shared with the social network. Users can also disconnect that data from their account, so Facebook can't use it for targeted advertising.
What Facebook is offering here "is a good first step" to building systems that are more honest with users about the company's data collection and sharing, said Mr. Van Kleek. And, if you're feeling optimistic, you can imagine from the tool a future that Mr. Van Kleek would like to see, where we all have more control over our data: Maybe you'll choose to give information to some algorithms when you're willing to trade privacy for better service, but keep it away from others you don't trust -- a kind of licensing out of your data.
But that's not what's happening here. Disconnect your browsing data from your Facebook account, and the company can still make use of it; it just can't be used to aggressively target ads. This is not the jump to the "delete history" feature that Mark Zuckerberg promised the tool would be. It's not close to stopping Facebook's collecting the data in the first place. But it's a first step.
Missing information about misinformation
Facebook and Twitter this week identified and removed Chinese accounts from their platforms, which they said were sowing divisive messages about the Hong Kong protests. Facebook deleted a handful of pages, Groups and accounts; Twitter culled 936 accounts and banned state-controlled media from promoting tweets. (China disputes the claim of the social networks, that this was a state-backed disinformation campaign.) YouTube on Thursday joined them, deleting 210 channels that had spread disinformation.
Researchers who study disinformation told me that the swift action by the platforms demonstrated some progress. "In the past it was denial," said Sinan Aral, a professor at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management, about the past responses of tech platforms to misinformation. "Then it was slow reaction. Now things are moving in the right direction." But, he added: "I wouldn't say it's where we want it to be. Ultimately it needs to be proactive."
That's not easy to achieve for many reasons. A look at the Chinese content that Facebook and Twitter responded to shows that not all disinformation is made equal. Russia's tactics, used to interfere with the 2016 and 2018 elections in the United States, were offensive, focused on so-called wedge issues to "widen the middle ground" and make it harder for people "to come together to negotiate," said Samantha Bradshaw, a researcher at the Oxford Internet Institute. China's have been defensive, "using the voice of authoritarian regimes, for suppressing freedom of speech" and "undermining and discrediting critical dissidents."
I asked Professor Aral which kind of misinformation was more effective. "Let me be very clear," he said. "We have very little understanding about its effectiveness."
There's no consensus on how to monitor it, or measure its impact. In large part, that's because social media platforms have been reluctant to share details about how their algorithms work, or how content is moderated. "Some of these really basic stats, researchers still don't have access to," Ms. Bradshaw said.
Only by better understanding how misinformation works will we be able to figure out how to overcome it. And unless we want tech platforms to unilaterally solve the problem, they will need to give up some information to make that happen.
Big Tech's big challenge
If the conclusions of those two stories seem in conflict, that's because they are. Social networks are under pressure to better protect user data. They're also being asked to open up so we can understand how they're tackling issues like misinformation and hate speech.
Professor Aral called this the "Transparency Paradox," a term he coined in 2018. "The only way to solve it," he said, "is to thread the needle, by becoming more transparent and more secure at the same time."
That's not impossible: There are ways to share data with trusted partners while preserving a level of user privacy. One example, differential privacy, is already used by Apple, Google and even the United States Census Bureau to limit the amount of personal information that is shared with an organization while still allowing it to make useful inferences from the data.
The problem is that reform of data privacy and increased transparency could threaten the core business model of Big Tech -- basically, algorithms that churn data to earn cash -- by drying up its data stash and revealing its secret algorithmic sauces. So for now, companies seem to be making only the smallest of steps to change. Until they make bigger moves, the critics are unlikely to let up.
Some stories you shouldn't miss
■ Huawei got another reprieve. The United States government said American companies would be allowed to continue doing some business with the Chinese tech giant for another 90 days.
■ Facebook's liberal bias audit pleased nobody. It reported concerns about potential bias, but didn't say it exists. Republicans called it a whitewash; Democrats said it lent legitimacy to unfounded claims.
■ Antitrust scrutiny of Big Tech intensified. States are joining the Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission and Congress in the investigations. (Bonus: Here are four main ideas for reining in the industry.)
■ The European Union may clamp down on facial recognition. It is said to be considering how to "impose strict limits" on the use of the technology, The Financial Times reports.
■ Ransomware hit 22 Texas towns. One expert told The New York Times that it was the largest such coordinated attack yet, and could presage more widespread strikes.
■ President Trump claimed that Google manipulated the 2016 election. But the report he cited has been widely discredited.
■ Big Tech companies don't like France's new digital tax, and will testify against it to the U.S. Trade Representative next week. (Amazon plans to pass the costs onto French sellers.)
■ For sale on Facebook: guns. Its Marketplace is being gamed by sellers who offer overpriced gun boxes that actually contain rifles, The Wall Street Journal reports.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON—The criminal trial of a prominent lawyer has provided a behind-the-scenes, often unflattering look at how public-relations agents, political consultants and lawyers set about shaping public opinion for foreign governments.
Such details are often cloaked by attorney-client privilege or confidentiality agreements. But in this case the particulars have been presented in testimony in the federal trial of Gregory Craig, former White House counsel for President Obama and a go-to inside-the-Beltway lawyer.
Share Your Thoughts
Should it be a crime for people not to disclose their public relations work for foreign governments? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.
He has been charged with misleading the Justice Department over his work for Ukraine, which he denies . The first two weeks of his trial have offered up rare glimpses into the nitty-gritty of an influence campaign.
The campaign at issue is a multimillion-dollar effort in 2012 by Ukraine's government. At the time, the government was seen as pro-Moscow, but it hoped to rehabilitate its image in Europe and eventually win admission to the European Union. Tapped to lead the effort were political consultants Paul Manafort and his business partner Rick Gates, who had earlier worked to elect then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych.
Mr. Craig became involved during a stint working at a white-shoe law firm , Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom LLP. He was asked by Mr. Manafort to write a report evaluating the fairness of the trial of Yulia Tymoshenko, an opposition politician and former prime minister. The Ukrainians sought a Western lawyer of some stature to examine the facts and add credibility to their effort. Messrs. Manafort and Gates also hired a number of international public relations firms to assist them.
Mr. Craig insisted on independence in drafting his report and concluded that Ms. Tymoshenko's trial was flawed, according to testimony. But a consultant for one of the chief PR firms on the case, FTI Consulting, said the plan was to use the report publicly to burnish Ukraine's reputation. "The understanding that we at FTI had was that the Skadden report was a PR tool to help Ukraine reset its relationship with the European Union," said Jonathan Hawker in court. FTI declined to comment.
Emails entered in court as well as witness testimony showed that the public relations team working for Ukraine drafted press material touting the report's conclusions before they had seen it. Mr. Hawker wrote in an email to Mr. Gates: "We've provided answers even when we do not know the facts." The team wrote news releases after the report that misstated some of its central conclusions, emails showed.
Mr. Hawker prepared talking points that "the report clearly states that there is no evidence of political motivation"—when the Skadden team didn't examine that question.
Mr. Gates acknowledged in his testimony never having read the full Skadden report.
The plan, Mr. Gates said, was to leak the report to a select journalist to win favorable coverage and then rely on what he viewed as the herd mentality of other reporters to follow the story. "Journalists typically don't like to do all of their own legwork, so they borrow from other reporters," Mr. Gates told the jury. "It's kind of like a domino effect where if you get one good article, a lot of the other articles would follow suit."
The team settled on David Sanger of the New York Times, a reporter Mr. Craig knew and whose byline he believed would carry weight in Washington and abroad.
The story Mr. Sanger co-wrote, headlined "Failings Found in Trial of Ukrainian Ex-Premier," wasn't quite the shot of positivity that the PR team hoped for, Mr. Gates acknowledged: "It wasn't the greatest." But he also said in testimony that Mr. Sanger's article "at least was viewed neutrally."
"The Times wrote an appropriately skeptical story about the prosecution of former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, which raised questions about the political nature of the trial and about the compensation that Mr. Craig's firm was paid for the report," an attorney for the Times said in a statement.
After the Times story was published, other journalists became interested. One reporter from Radio Free Europe reached out to Mr. Hawker—who falsely told the reporter that he wasn't representing the Ukrainian Ministry of Justice when the ministry was his client. "I misled him," Mr. Hawker testified. "It was a very bad decision."
Mr. Hawker also claimed in emails submitted in court that he called a reporter for the Telegraph, a British newspaper, to change quotes Mr. Craig had given him about the report in a bid to improve the story's tone. Mr. Craig's quotes to the reporter were "not massively helpful but I changed them. He might be pissed about that if he finds out," Mr. Hawker wrote to other consultants. He testified that he called the journalist, Tom Parfitt, and "asked him to include a couple of positive elements in the story."
Mr. Parfitt, now the Moscow correspondent for the Times of London, denied that account. "The quotes from Craig that were published were exactly the ones that he gave to me in the interview, and which I checked with him via email," he said in an email to The Wall Street Journal. (The Times and the Journal are both owned by News Corp.)
The case against Mr. Craig resulted from special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian election interference and related issues. That investigation led the conviction of Mr. Manafort, who was President Trump's 2016 campaign manager, for financial crimes. Mr. Gates pleaded guilty to conspiracy and false statements and is cooperating with the government.
Mr. Craig was charged with misleading the Justice Department while at Skadden, which earlier this year paid a fine of $4.6 million to settle a government civil complaint and registered retroactively as a foreign agent for its Ukraine work. Under federal law, U.S. citizens who represent foreign governments are required to disclose that work to the Justice Department.
Mr. Craig's lawyer has argued that his legal work didn't require registration. They said any contacts with journalists were to ensure that his report wasn't misrepresented by Ukraine's PR consultants. Mr. Craig also spoke to reporters from the Los Angeles Times and the National Law Journal.

Texto completo: A plant-based diet may have seemed extreme years ago, but today it’s all the rage — and for good reason. In many ways the planet and human health are in trouble, and a plant-centric diet is one way to address both issues.
More than 10,000 studies in peer-reviewed medical journals show that a diet based on whole plant foods leads to higher life expectancy and lower rates of cancer, heart disease, Type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer’s and most other chronic ailments. “If you eat the standard American diet, you’re going to get the standard American diseases,” says Ocean Robbins, co-founder of the Food Revolution Network and author of 31-Day Food Revolution.
“However, a plant-based diet can add years to your life and life to your years. ” When you look more closely at heart disease, the No. 1 killer of American adults, the story becomes even more convincing. “The only diet proven not just to prevent but also reverse heart disease is a plant-based diet,” says Marco A. Borges, exercise physiologist, founder of 22 Days Nutrition and New York Times bestselling author whose latest book is The Greenprint: Plant-Based Diet, Best Body, Better World. Statistics show that roughly 600,000 Americans die from heart disease every year, but 80 percent of cardiovascular disease is preventable, especially with a shift to a plant-based diet, says Dr. Saray Stancic, a lifestyle medicine physician in Ramsey, N. J.
There’s also evidence that the current food system is unsustainable. “Worldwide, animal agriculture provides 18 percent of humanity’s food calories and 37 percent of protein, but uses 83 percent of farmland and one-third of the planet’s fresh water, and is responsible for more greenhouse gas emissions than the world’s cars, planes, trucks, ships and trains combined,” Robbins says.
Yet, changing how you’ve always eaten isn’t easy. Where do you start? Experts share seven strategies:
1. Don’t think all or nothing. Just as Rome wasn’t built in a day, you don’t need to shift your diet overnight. “Every step you take toward more whole plant foods is a step toward greater health for you and the planet,” Robbins says. How closely you lean into plants is your choice, but know that in the “Blue Zones” — places around the world where people live the longest and healthiest — diets are focused on whole plant foods with almost no added sugar or processed foods and between zero and 10 percent of calories from animal products. In the United States, however, approximately 54 percent of calories come from processed foods and another 34 percent from animal products, Robbins says. No amount of processed food is healthy, and even if animal products are a small part of your diet, “the Blue Zones show that what’s best is a lot less than most are eating,” he adds.
2. Make plants the star of your plate. If you’re eating like most Americans, animal products comprise most of your plate. An easy fix? “Put plants at the center of your plate, and if you do have any animal products, make them the side dish,” Stancic says. As your taste buds adapt to this new way of eating, gradually push animal products off your plate completely so that you’re following the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine’s Power Plate formula, which divides a meal into four quadrants: whole grains, fruits, vegetables and legumes.
3. Add whole plant foods to your environment. Your environment plays a key role in determining whether you’ll succeed at adopting a new habit, which is why it makes sense to set it up for success. The best strategy? “Bring more whole plant foods into your house and put them out where you can see them,” Borges says. How many times, after all, have you bought fruits or veggies, shoved them into the back of your fridge and later found them spoiled because you forgot about them? Instead, keep fruits and veggies at eye level in the fridge and place bowls of fruit on counters in view. At the same time, keep unhealthy processed foods out of sight as you gradually work on cutting them from your kitchen.
4. Be a planner. Nothing gets done in life without some planning, healthy eating included. Start by shopping from a list, as you’ll stand a better chance of avoiding unhealthy impulse purchases, Robbins says. Then think about your meals for the next week, or just the next day if that’s easier (“plan breakfast before you go to bed,” he adds, suggesting overnight oats or presoaked chia blueberry porridge), so that you don’t end up eating unhealthy food in a pinch.
5. Do batch cooking. When Borges’ mom switched to a 100 percent plant-based diet, he advised her to pick a day each week to cook foods like whole grains and beans in batches, even making salad dressing for the week. She could then store the foods in the fridge or the freezer and pull them out as needed. “Although it takes time to cook them, it’s a huge time-saver,” he says.
6. Adopt the Meatless Monday habit. This global campaign encourages people to take meat off their plate every Monday, and it’s a good entry point to eating more plants. “Research shows that we have our best intentions for healthy eating on Monday, and Meatless Monday is a great way to dip your toes in the water,” says Sharon Palmer, registered dietitian and author of Plant-Powered for Life. After seeing how easy it is, you may be encouraged to eat meatless on other days, too.
7. Find support. No matter what change you’re trying to make, going it alone can be challenging. That’s why Stancic asks her patients to bring family members when she speaks to them about adopting a whole food, plant-based diet. “You’re introducing a significant change into your life, and if you don’t have support, that change becomes more difficult,” she says. Even if your family isn’t on board, you can find support in friends, work colleagues and local meetup or Facebook groups. Of course, changing habits can be challenging, and for many, shifting to a plant-based diet is a work in progress. And that’s OK. As Borges says, “Aim for progression, not perfection. ”

Tolerance of others' beliefs, or lack of same, is essential

Texto completo: I read an article in the New York Times Sunday Review section by Ross Douthat. It was entitled "The Stories That Divide Us."
What I glean from this article is that our nation is so divided that we don't even share common stories; our narratives are different. Some people believe their story is the only one and cannot even imagine that the other even has a valid point. We certainly are not behaving as if we are one people sharing this beautiful nation of ours. Mr. Douthat is speaking of our current political climate.
I think this is a symptom of a more universal problem - people's uncomfortableness with pluralism. It seems we cannot tolerate political pluralism, but what about religious pluralism. That is even harder to accept, as we are speaking of people's views of God and of all those profound questions of existence and our place in the universe.
Religious beliefs are at the very core of a person's being. There seems to be a constant struggle between religious orthodoxy and more liberal forms. In Israel, which is a religious state, the head rabbi is always Orthodox and the other movements of Judaism are not afforded the same rights as the Orthodox. In Israel, you can only be married by a rabbi who is approved by the state. My son, who married an Israeli girl and was married in Haifa, had to find an approved rabbi to officiate at their wedding. I could not officiate at their wedding because I am a Reform cantor. Israel is now struggling with religious pluralism and feminism. It is a long process and requires vigilance on the part of the society to solve the problem.
In the United States, we do not suffer from the same problems as Israel; we are a secular nation and have the separation of church and state. Nevertheless, we have issues concerning tolerance of other people's religion.
I have seen in people's eyes the distrust we feel toward those who look differently, dress differently and perhaps have customs we do not understand. In Judaism, it is an important tenet to always welcome the stranger and to follow Shalom Bayit, make your home a peaceful, welcoming place. We should not use traditions to divide us but to draw us nearer to one another.
In the Valley, we have a Jewish Clergy Council, where clergy from all the denominations meet once a month to be supportive of one another and to discuss how best to serve our community. We have many differences, but we work on finding our similarities. I believe this is a gift to all of us and to our congregants. This may be a small thing in terms of solving the problems of intolerance, but it is a start.
We must also curb our negative speech. I have heard many times the contempt that many have toward those of faith. They insinuate you have to be dumb, ill-informed or misguided to believe in a higher power and in the institutions that foster that belief.
Believers also should not call those who do not believe heathens and sinful. The demonization of those whose views are different than ours is corrosive and leads to this polarization of our country. We can disagree but let us try to find common ground.
There certainly are views of some faith communities that I do not agree with and I may even find contrary to my understanding of religion. The response should not be to refuse to engage and dislike them. This is a mistake that leads to distrust of those around us. We must embrace pluralism and work in our communities to find areas where we can agree and ultimately to work together. Perhaps, then we can have a country that is "kinder and more gentle".

The Tragedy of the Times

Texto completo: Thank you, Dean Baquet. Readers who complain about articles they don't like, and who assume they are written under pressure from advertisers, could do worse than to study recent comments of the New York Times executive editor.
Mr. Baquet was secretly recorded at a staff meeting. A transcript was posted at Slate.com. But he has made similar points publicly. The gist: It's readers nowadays who pressure newspapers to toe a line. Publishers pine for the era when advertising dollars insulated us from such pressures.
Under fire from its public for an anodyne and accurate headline about Donald Trump after the El Paso shootings, which the paper later changed, Mr. Baquet almost pleaded with his crew: "We are an independent news organization, one of the few remaining . . . . Our readers and some of our staff cheer us when we take on Donald Trump, but they jeer at us when we take on Joe Biden. They sometimes want us to pretend that he was not elected president, but he was elected president."
If he meant a newspaper's job is to report the facts and arrange them in a logical fashion regardless of the howling winds of reader prejudice, he's right. Unfortunately it's not clear this is what he meant.
To his credit, the Times has been one of a few news organizations that have refrained from labelling Mr. Trump a racist, as if this quality can be factually determined between the lines of his tweets. What Mr. Baquet is up against was illustrated by one of his own reporters, quoted in the Slate transcript saying, "I just feel like racism is in everything. It should be considered in our science reporting, in our culture reporting, in our national reporting."
Such thinking is why audiences other than the Times's have become cynical when charges of racism are flung.
But Mr. Baquet also lent credence to an already rampant suspicion that the Times sees its job as imposing a "narrative" (a word he used repeatedly) on the world rather than listening to what the world teaches. After the Russia collusion fiasco, you might think an order of business would be finding out how our politics came to be so roiled by fabricated allegations. All too plainly, Mr. Baquet seemed to suggest that the Times, having failed to deliver the Russia story its readers wanted, must now deliver the Trump racism story they want. "Our readers who want Donald Trump to go away suddenly thought, 'Holy [bleep], Bob Mueller is not going to do it.'"
Is Mr. Trump a racist? I don't know. Are you? What I do know, and what's apparent to everyone, is the existence of powerful incentives in American life to level such charges, indeed a delight in doing so. The Times knows this better than most. It can hardly fire anyone without being accused of racism. Of particular note, a 2016 class action claimed not only that the paper is hostile to "older employees of color," but that it prefers its readers to be "young, white [and] wealthy" too.
Now this is ironic. Multiple Democratic alarums have been sounded lately, including in the Times, about how the racial radicalism of exactly these young white liberals endangers the party's 2020 chances. But let's have a moment of realism. Politicians are about politics. Democrats manifestly see race as a winning card. Their presidential candidates even play it against each other. Mr. Trump, or any alternative in our two-party system, has a card too -- the resistance of a large part of America to the role being assigned them in the Democrats' identity-politics melodrama.
A newspaper should tell this story, not serve as one side's propaganda arm. But also evident in Mr. Baquet's plea is another fact of life: He, or any editor who is basically an employee of the New York Times ruling family, will be hard-pressed to steer an independent path for the paper when so many of its readers, staff, editors and patrons want it to be a shield of their wokeness. An owner needs to take a hand.
But I thank him for clearing the air on one matter, the notion that advertisers dictate coverage. Which brings me to Elon Musk.
Never mind that he comprehensively missed the point of a column here in April, which criticized certain electric-vehicle mandates precisely because they were unfair to Tesla. What had me chuckling was his tweeted suggestion that this writer and "WSJ in general are sock puppets of big oil."
Look around. Do you see any big-oil ads? I wish we had more ads of any kind.
For better or worse, newspapers are more dependent than ever on readers to pay our bills. But then Mr. Musk probably knows this. He wouldn't be tweeting if he didn't believe the way to influence me is through our readers.

Backing down not his game

Texto completo: FOXBOROUGH — Carolina Panthers safety Eric Reid is a man of conviction and action. One of the NFL's most passionate players in the fight for social justice, he doesn't shy away from delivering pointed messages with his pads or his words. His intentions are true, sometimes his aim is not.
That was the case when Reid levied a late hit on Patriots tight end Benjamin Watson in the first quarter of Thursday night's preseason game at Gillette Stadium, ending Watson's night with a concussion. It's also the case when it comes to rapper Jay-Z lining up with the NFL.
Reid, along with Miami wide receiver Kenny Stills, offered pointed criticism of Jay-Z for entering into an entertainment and social justice partnership with the NFL on Aug. 14. Reid called it “a money move" and said the rap mogul “capitalized on this situation" while bemoaning Jay-Z's statement that the movement has “moved past kneeling."
Jay-Z's statement was patronizing to Colin Kaepernick and players who have and continue to protest during the national anthem. But two prominent African-American voices for change on the same side of the systemic racism issue feuding is exactly what detractors want. It's the social change version of a play-action fake and Reid bit on it. It draws the attention and the onus away from the issues of inequality and injustice and puts it on division among those trying to foster that change. It's an intellectual countermeasure designed to detract from the importance of the movement and diminish its effectiveness.
They want us fighting amongst ourselves instead of fighting for equality. No minority group is a monolith. There is always going to be disagreement about the proper and most effective approach to change. It's reasonable to disagree on the methods, but it shouldn't drown out the message in the public conscious. That's counterproductive. The motivation and the goal remain the same, despite disagreements on the approach.
Reid didn't back down or back off any of his statements, but he understands that his critique of Jay-Z can undercut the larger issue.
“It's almost divide and conquer. Get people split on the narrative," said Reid. “I think the conversation needs to shift back to the NFL, not so much Jay-Z. Again, I'm going to call out what I see. I'm going to call it how I see it, which I've done. But the NFL is still blackballing Colin and still pretending that they're addressing social injustice."
It has been three years since Reid's friend and former San Francisco 49ers teammate Kaepernick gave the QB kneel-down a whole new meaning by protesting during the national anthem. Reid was the first player to join him and is one of the few remaining players continuing with the Kaepernick-style peaceable protests.
“I think I just want to be able to sleep at night, and for me to believe what I believe and to see what's happening in this country and to not say something it wouldn't sit right with me," said the safety. “Like we've said from the beginning, we're trying to give a voice to the people who don't have a voice."
It's easy for Kaepernick and Reid to feel like the movement they were at the vanguard of has been co-opted while they've paid the price. Kaepernick is out of the league. Reid had a difficult time finding a job last year before he was signed by the Panthers in Week 4. Both Kaepernick and Reid settled collusion suits against the NFL related to their employment opportunities. This offseason, Carolina re-signed Reid to a three-year, $22 million deal.
That's why comments like this one from Jay-Z in his press conference with NFL commissioner Roger Goodell rankle Reid. It feels like a betrayal and a usurpation.
“Everyone's saying, 'How are you going forward if Kap doesn't have a job?' " said Jay-Z. “This was not about him having a job. That became part of it. We know what it is — now how do we address that injustice? What's the way forward?"
Despite the league's pledge of $89 million over seven years to support social justices initiatives, Reid remains wary that the league really just wants to put an end to the protests that have proven polarizing among NFL fans. He remembers a summit between players and owners in October of 2017.
“The bottom line with that meeting was just to get people to stop protesting. They didn't seem very concerned with actually addressing social injustice," said Reid.
He feels the union with Jay-Z is more of the same. That partnership was brokered in part by Patriots owner Robert Kraft, who is friendly with Jay-Z and was active along with Philadelphia 76ers co-owner Michael Rubin in advocating for the release of rapper Meek Mill from jail and for wider criminal justice reform. (Rubin attended Thursday's preseason game.)
It's complicated because Kraft and other owners are open and active social justice advocates, but also have made political contributions to President Donald Trump, who has demeaned players for demonstrating. Stills called out his team's owner, Stephen Ross, for that contradictory stance.
“I still think there is a narrative out there that we should be happy with any efforts toward social justice, and that's true," said Reid. “But what we can't separate is the fact that the NFL is blackballing the person that brought this to the forefront of their platform. But they say that it's bigger than him. It's PR for y'all. Y'all weren't doing anything social justice-related until Colin protested. Now, y'all are addressing it to calm people down, to say they're addressing what we're concerned about."
One of the speculated, unwritten parts of Jay-Z's team up with the NFL is that he'll have a path to an ownership stake in a team. The onus is on the rap impresario to prove that this deal with his Roc Nation company, which includes advising the NFL on musical acts, will foster meaningful change on the social justice front.
This isn't the first time Reid has feuded with folks aligned philosophically, but not strategically, with him on tackling these issues. Reid has been an outspoken critic of the Players Coalition, which has emerged as the most powerful force among NFL players for social initiatives. Reid got into an on-field confrontation with Players Coalition co-founder Philadelphia Eagles safety Malcolm Jenkins last season and regrettably called Jenkins a “sellout."
Reid derisively called the Jay-Z agreement “Players Coalition 2.0." That sparked a Twitter rebuttal from Watson, who along with Devin McCourty is a member of the coalition's 12-member task force.
Some drew a link between Watson's tweet and Reid's late hit, which is being reviewed by the league.
“I didn't even know that he tweeted that," said Reid, who asked Watson if he was OK and attempted to give him a hand up post-hit. “That's not even something that you process in a game. I'm not analyzing who has the ball in their hands and what they tweeted at me while I'm playing the game."
Agree with his approach or not, Reid is knowledgeable and passionate about the cause. Just read his New York Times op-ed. That can't be disputed.
What can be is whether he is engaging in too much friendly fire.
The lyrics from Jay-Z's song “Family Feud" apply: “We all lose when the family feuds."

D.C. Memo: Seen as a dispensable relic

Texto completo: The D.C. Memo is a weekly recap of Washington political news, journalism, and opinion, delivered with an eye toward what matters for Minnesota. Sign up to get it in your inbox every Thursday.
Welcome to this week’s edition of the D.C. Memo. This week in Washington, Congress is still in recess. But in Minnesota, the State Fair (!), where Jason Lewis announced a bid for U.S. Senate, Sen. Bernie Sanders is set to have a Q&A, and you can visit Sen. Amy Klobuchar’s booth.
Jason Lewis is running for Senate
On Thursday morning, former MN-2 Rep. Jason Lewis announced that he will run for Senate in 2020, challenging incumbent Sen. Tina Smith for her seat. Why is he running?
“Private property, religious liberty, due process, the pride of citizenship, the national anthem, the pledge of allegiance, even Betsy Ross’ flag, are now seen as dispensable relics to a radical political movement that appears to be gaining steam in the corridors of power,” Lewis said in his announcement video.
Lewis’ website is currently one page, touting his experience in Congress and his résumé.
Lewis lost his House seat to Rep. Angie Craig by more than five percentage points in 2018. The National Republican Congressional Committee , chaired by Rep. Tom Emmer , announced in February that Lewis’ former district, MN-2, would be a critical race for them this cycle, but it’s unclear who Republicans will field.
Smith won her seat in a special election, 56 percent to 39 percent, against Republican state Sen. Karin Housley in 2018.
Dual loyalty
President Donald Trump at least twice this week charged Americans Jews who vote for Democrats with not being loyal to Israel. “In my opinion, you vote for a Democrat, you’re being very disloyal to Jewish people, and you’re being very disloyal to Israel,” President Trump told reporters outside the White House on Wednesday.
Earlier this year, Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minneapolis was criticized for saying: “I want to talk about the political influence in this country that says it is OK to push for allegiance to a foreign country,” in reference to Israel’s influence on the United States. Some groups interpreted this as raising the idea of Jewish dual loyalty, an anstisemitic trope. Trump’s comments far more explicitly say Jewish Americans owe loyalty to Israel.


“A reminder that the Tree of Life synagogue shooter murdered 11 Jews on Shabbos because of their congregation’s social justice work and support for immigrant rights,” said Jewish Community Action Executive Director Carin Mrotz . “The President’s labeling of liberal Jews as disloyal is a validation of this kind of violence. It’s chilling.”
Warren’s visit
Sen. Elizabeth Warren visited St. Paul earlier this week, hosting a town hall for thousands at Macalester College. There, Warren promised significant pushback against Line 3 and Twin Metals, drawing praise from environmental advocates and upsetting Minnesota construction unions. Read more from MinnPost’s Walker Orenstein.
No soil underneath his fingernails
As the trade war between President Trump and the Chinese government continues with no end in sight, groups that represent farmers have taken to the media to again express exasperation and discontent.
“Well, I can tell you the farmers are definitely losing. You know, I know examples already of farmers that couldn’t get their operating loans,” Minnesota Farmers Union Gary Wertish told CNN’s Jim Sciutto on Monday.
“And, you know, it’s very, very disappointing. It’s coming from somebody that’s really never had any soil underneath his fingernails or dirt underneath his fingernails or grease on his hands…to tell us that it’s going to be great in the end, what’s the end going to look like?”
The President next door
Sen. Amy Klobuchar is at the Minnesota State Fair this week. Her campaign will be chatting with fairgoers, and on Thursday, Klobuchar stopped by MPR’s booth to talk agricultural policy and Denmark, among other things. (Speaking of the state fair, are you curious about who runs it? It’s not a mysterious cabal of families. And it’s also not the state government. Read more from MinnPost’s Greta Kaul. )
On Monday, Klobuchar was one of several candidates to attend the first even Native American Presidential forum in Sioux City, Iowa, where she attempted to link her policy proposals to the issues brought up at the forum, emphasizing her efforts to establish nationwide broadband access and improve infrastructure, including on reservations.
News from the rest of the pack
* Washington Gov. Jay Inslee dropped out of the presidential race on Wednesday, saying “It’s become clear that I’m not going to be carrying the ball.” Before dropping out, Inslee released his sixth and final climate proposal: a strategy for rural communities and farmers to tackle the climate crisis.
* Former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper announced a bid for U.S. Senate in Colorado, just a week after ending his own presidential campaign. Hickenlooper will be running against Republican incumbent Cory Gardner.
* Sen. Bernie Sanders will visit the Minnesota State Fair on Saturday for a question and answer session with Minnesota Public Radio.
* Sen. Kamala Harris this week renounced her support for Medicare for All, telling Washington Post reporter Chelsea Janes: “I can’t make this circle fit into a square.”
In other news
* In the Washington Post, Nick Miroff and Josh Dawsey have a profile of Stephen Miller, “the adviser who scripts Trump’s immigration policy.” Miller is the mastermind and defender of the President’s nativist policies, most recently pushing a policy that would make obtaining citizenship more difficult if immigrants use Medicaid or food stamps.
* At NBC, Brandy Zadrozny and Ben Collins have a months long investigative story on The Epoch Times, the Falun Gong-affiliated newspaper that’s been pushing both a pro-Trump agenda and QAnon conspiracy theories.
Quote of the week
“Right by the haunted house, and the pork chop on a stick, and the snake zoo,” Klobuchar told WCCO about the location of her state fair booth.
What I’m reading
The New York Times: 1619 Project
This week, a recommendation to read the 1619 Project, a project to contextualize the founding of the United States, making clear its contradictions — and Black Americans’ resilience in spite of them. The project is a collection of non-fiction and artistic works by prominent Black writers from around the country, including Nikole Hannah-Jones, Eve Ewing and Jamelle Bouie.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump has forgotten who holds the power within the Republican Party.
There's a perception that the National Rifle Association has an impenetrable lock on base Republican voters and thus is holding GOP members of Congress captive. But Trump is the one person who has the capital with the GOP base to oppose the NRA and get something done on guns. And the president is missing an opportunity to add a legacy item to his time in office and even help his chances of winning a second term.
In the wake of the deadly shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, Trump diverged from the typical Republican talking points.
"Well, I'm looking to do background checks," Trump told reporters on Aug. 7. "I think background checks are important. I don't want to put guns into the hands of mentally unstable people or people with rage or hate." He added that "we have to have very meaningful background checks."
Then, it appeared the president backed away from that stance after talks with the NRA's chief executive, Wayne LaPierre, and other GOP elected officials, according to The Atlantic, New York Times and other outlets.
On Wednesday, however, Trump told reporters "we're going to be doing background checks" and they would tighten loopholes, not impose universal checks.
Rather than falling back on typical GOP talking points, Trump could be leaning in to one of his greatest strengths: being a political outsider. He was initially elected as a Republican without being a traditional Republican, and without being limited by ideological purity.
Now he has the power of nearly the full GOP behind him.
The president's job approval rating among Republicans is extremely high. It was 90% in a mid-July poll by NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist and 88% in an Aug. 11-13 Fox News poll.
The NRA is popular among Republicans as well, but not at the same level as the president. The August Fox News poll pinned the NRA's favorability rating among Republicans at 72%. And according to an Aug. 10-13 Economist/YouGov poll, 73% of Republicans had a favorable view of the NRA.
Republican voters have bought into Trump as a messenger and are predisposed to believe his policy decisions, even if they run counter to their previous views or the traditional Republican Party platform.
In short, if anyone could withstand that strength of the NRA within the Republican Party, it's President Trump. GOP politicians should fear the wrath of the president more than the NRA. Right now, the preeminent litmus test within the Republican Party is whether you are for or against Trump.
Even though voices inside and outside the president's circle of advisers are telling him that a stance in favor of more restrictions on gun ownership will jeopardize support among Trump's base voters, count me as skeptical.
Not only do most Republicans trust what the president says, but they will also never vote Democratic (or stay home and not vote) because they are so alarmed with the alternative. Republicans who may not be convinced by Trump, or are even disappointed with him, on new gun legislation would still be compelled to vote by the threat of socialism and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez running the country.
But tackling gun regulations is an opportunity for Trump to demonstrate independence from traditional GOP views and gain ground with independent voters he likely needs to win a second term. He could even put Democrats in a bind by coupling gun restrictions with something else Republicans want, particularly on border security.
But that chance is slipping away.

Texto completo: History evolves as scholars learn more
When The New York Times published "The 1619 Project" on Aug. 18, there was a backlash from conservative critics about the integrity and accuracy of the project, which aims to reframe U.S. history with slavery as its foundation.
Newsday columnist Cathy Young writes that the project is "revisionist," a common pejorative used to discredit histories that highlight negative aspects of America's past ["A revisionist narrative of slavery," Opinion, Aug. 20].
But all history is revisionist, as it is based on newly uncovered primary sources, scholarship, and contributions from groups - like enslaved Africans and African-Americans - excluded from previous accounts. The editors and authors of "The 1619 Project" would likely embrace the claim that theirs is a revisionist history that tells "the unvarnished truth," in the words of historian John Hope Franklin.
Young writes that "we risk replacing one mythology with another that demonizes America and its achievements" and could make "ordinary Americans feel that patriotism is being made politically incorrect." This is a false dichotomy; history isn't a zero-sum endeavor, either patriotic or critical. It's both, because uncovering negative aspects from the past pushes us toward a brighter future.
As a teacher of history, I must teach about the good, the bad and the ugly to help students think critically to understand the devastating impact of slavery and racism on our country.

Suffolk lawmaker should show up
To Susan Berland's request to Skype into meetings of the Suffolk County Legislature, which represents hubris of the highest order, I say a resounding NO ["Participation via Skype?," News, Aug. 19].
She was elected to serve as a legislator, and serving means being there. If that is too much, I suggest she resign in favor of someone who cares more for his or her constituents than about vacations, which can be scheduled when the legislature is not in session. And I say this as a member of the Democratic Party, the same as Berland.

Texto completo: Pick your political cliché. Jill Biden was either saying the quiet part out loud or committing a Michael Kinsley gaffe (that is, speaking the truth) when she suggested that her husband needs the support of voters who prefer other Democratic candidates.
“Your candidate might be better on, I don’t know, health care, than Joe is, but you’ve got to look at who’s going to win this election,” former Vice President Joe Biden’s spouse said Monday at a campaign event in New Hampshire. She added: “And maybe you have to swallow a little bit and say, ‘OK, I personally like so-and-so better,’ but your bottom line has to be that we have to beat Trump.”
“Swallow a Little Bit for Biden” isn’t anyone’s idea of a catchy campaign slogan. But isn’t Dr. Biden (as the New York Times refers to her, in recognition of her doctorate in education) simply being open about what, in fact, is the overarching narrative of her husband’s campaign?
If she is, it’s the wrong message, especially this early in the campaign.
It’s not clear that if Biden wins the nomination it will be because a majority of voters in Democratic primaries rose above principle in the cause of ousting President Trump. Biden may prove to be an electable nominee because a decisive number of primary voters are attracted to either his personal qualities or his positions, including his opposition to a “Medicare for All” plan that would end private health insurance. (There is some evidence that other candidates are migrating closer to Biden’s position.)
By suggesting that a lot of voters will have to rise above principle to support her husband, Jill Biden may be conceding too much too soon. Her comment will embolden supporters of other candidates who argue that “electable” is a code word for a candidate you disagree strongly with, but grudgingly support anyway.
Actually, as the Los Angeles Times observed in an editorial in April, “electability” is a more complicated concept than that. We wrote at the time: “Certainly ‘electable’ shouldn’t be regarded as a synonym for ‘older white male’ or ‘centrist.’ It’s possible that candidates who fit neither description will make the most effective case that they can translate enthusiasm in the primaries into a general-election victory.”
It’s also possible that the relatively centrist Biden, despite a shaky start, will convince a significant number of primary voters that he’s electable and that he would be a good president. Neither Biden should give up on that scenario.

Former Rep. Joe Walsh will challenge Trump for GOP 2020 nomination

Texto completo: Joe Walsh of Illinois, a former one-term House member, is set to announce he's challenging President Trump for the party's nomination for the 2020 election.
Walsh, 57, now a syndicated radio host and prolific tweeter, is expected to make the announcement this weekend, according to Politico. Walsh would face daunting odds against the sitting president, considering Trump's approval rating among Republican voters is consistently in the high 80s.
“If I’m to do it, it’s going to happen soon,” Walsh said. “I’ve been really surprised by the amount of anxiousness from people across the spectrum who want this president to have a challenge, because there’s just a real concern that he’s absolutely unfit.”
Walsh would join a seemingly growing field of GOP primary challengers to Trump. Former Massachusetts Gov. William Weld, the 2016 Libertarian Party vice-presidential nominee, previously announced his campaign. But Weld, 74, has little traction despite months of campaigning in New Hampshire. Former South Carolina governor and Congressman Mark Sanford is also eyeing a Republican primary challenge from the right, focused on deficit spending and fiscal discipline.
Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan earlier this year eyed a Republican primary challenge to Trump, but decided against running.
A Trump campaign spokesman responded to Walsh's expected announcement by telling the New York Times, it would end in "certain failure."
Walsh backed Trump for president in 2016 but has become a vociferous critic over the president's tweets, general temperament, and coziness with Russia, including what he called genuflecting to Russian President Vladimir Putin at a meeting in Finland.
“He lost me for good in Helsinki, when he stood in front of the world and said, ‘I believe Putin and I don’t believe my fellow Americans,’” Mr. Walsh stated.

Stacey Abrams’ tinfoil hat brigade

Texto completo: A high-profile politician sows the seeds of doubt about an election, refusing to concede and embarking on a months-long campaign with the aid of friendly media and party officials, to undermine the legitimacy of our democracy.
No, not President Trump. It's Democrat Stacey Abrams.
During the 2016 election, Trump caused a stir when asked by Chris Wallace if he'd accept the results of the election. Trump responded, "I will look at it at the time." Hillary Clinton rightly castigated Trump, saying, "That is not the way our democracy works. We've been around 240 years and have had free and fair elections. We've accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them. He is denigrating; he is talking down our democracy. And I, for one, am appalled."
As it turned out, a fellow Democrat was the one who needed to heed Clinton's words. Following her defeat to Brian Kemp in the 2018 Georgia gubernatorial election, Abrams did what Clinton argued should never happen. She refused, and continues to refuse, to concede and accept the results.
Instead, she weaved a tale of supposed voter suppression that cost her the win. "I will not concede because the erosion of our democracy is not right," she said defiantly after officially ending her campaign.
Kemp won the election with 50.2% of the vote to Abrams' 48.8%, a difference of approximately 54,000 votes. The margin was enough to avoid a runoff. If Abrams' refusal to accept defeat was the final mention of the race, the controversy might have faded. But she was just getting started.
Abrams toured the state starting in 2019, giving speeches where she'd audaciously say, "I'm gonna tell you what I've told folks across this state, and this is not a partisan statement, it's a true statement: We won."
She has plenty of enablers: 2020 Democratic presidential candidates upped the ante in her name. California Sen. Kamala Harris said, "Let's say this loud and clear: Without voter suppression, Stacey Abrams would be the governor of Georgia." South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg also blamed voter suppression, claiming Abrams "ought to be the governor of Georgia." Joe Biden got in on the act as well. "Voter suppression is the reason Stacey Abrams isn't governor right now," he said.
And what about the liberal talking heads, pundits, and commentariat who were agog at Trump's comments at the 2016 debate? What did they make of Abrams' claims and those of her defenders? It ranged from either silence or tacit support to unconditional support, hailing her as a real fighter for voting rights. Long gone were the lamentations about candidates accepting the outcome of an election.
Worse yet is the treatment that Abrams receives from the press, which borders on adulation. An August profile in Vogue is titled, "Can Stacey Abrams Save American Democracy?" Another in the New Yorker says, "Stacey Abrams's Fight for a Fair Vote." The press is hailing Abrams as a modern-day Susan B. Anthony, repeating her accusations of voter suppression with almost zero examination of the facts. If they did, they'd find her claims unworthy of anything but the far reaches of the internet fever swamps.
Abrams delivered the Democratic response to the State of the Union address and said, "Voter suppression is real." One example of it, she said, is making it harder to register to vote. Georgia, however, is one of the most accessible states in which to register. Voters can register online, print the forms online, or pick up a form at the local county registrar's office. They can also get forms at the public library, the post office, or almost any other government building. College students can get a registration form at their school registrar's office. A recent survey report by the United States Election Assistance Commission showed nearly 3.6 million people registered to vote or updated their information through the Georgia Department of Driver Services from October 2016 to October 2018. Almost 700,000 of those were new or first-time registrants.
Abrams also said it's harder to stay on the voter rolls. Georgia is one of nine states where citizens can get removed from the voter registration list for not voting in past elections. It's often referred to in the press with the sinister-sounding, "voter purge." It's merely a way to ensure data integrity. Democrats are so concerned about Russian interference but only focus on voting machine security. Voting machines aren't attached to a central database, but voter registration is, and it is subject to hacking and manipulation. The "use or lose it" laws make sense, primarily since voter registration is vulnerable to bad actors. I lived in Georgia for five years, and I moved to Texas in 2017. Despite the move, at the time of the 2018 midterm elections, my registration in Georgia still showed as "active." It now shows as "inactive" (that status does not mean one cannot vote), but the state is not "suppressing" my voting rights by making the status inactive and then removing my registration entirely following another election cycle.
Abrams and her allies accused Kemp of "closing over 200 polling stations across Georgia" as a means of suppressing minority votes. Kemp, in his role as secretary of state, had zero authority to make those decisions. Counties make those decisions, and the closures had more to do with saving money by consolidating voting precincts, particularly in light of more people taking advantage of early voting.
Minority turnout also throws cold water on suppression conspiracy theories. Voter turnout among Georgia minorities reached an all-time high of 40% in 2018, including 30% represented by black voters. In 1994, minority turnout was a mere 18%.
If Georgia Republicans are attempting to suppress minority voters, it's one of the most inept and ineffective efforts in electoral history.
But that hasn't stopped Abrams from continuing to deny reality. During an appearance on CBS This Morning on Aug. 19, she still wouldn't concede. She said doing so would acknowledge the process is "fair," and "I am complicit if I say that that system is fair." Abrams' rhetoric didn't sound all that different from mid-October 2016 when then-candidate Trump claimed the election was "rigged" in favor of Clinton.
People say, "Trump didn't have any evidence." Neither did Abrams, and she said so herself in an April interview with the New York Times, aptly but absurdly titled, "Why Stacey Abrams Is Still Saying She Won." Abrams said, "I have no empirical evidence that I would have achieved a higher number of votes."
Richard Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California, Irvine, while giving the nod to "suppressive effects," said, "I have seen no good evidence that the suppressive effects of strict voting and registration laws affected the outcome of the governor's races in Georgia and Florida."
At a time when we know Russia is doing all it can to undermine the confidence Americans have in the electoral process, it's appalling that, rather than lambasting Abrams for her refusal to accept election results, media have rolled out the red carpet for her.
Abrams came close to achieving a historic victory in Georgia and could have used it to help build out a Democratic blueprint to win future statewide elections. Instead, she chose to embrace the worst elements of partisanship in a cynical effort to convince people she was the victim of an unfair system.
It won't get Abrams any closer to the governor's mansion, but it's sure to add more seeds of doubt to the public's faith in our elections.

Vender Puerto Rico, la broma de Trump en su afán por comprar gran isla de país europeo

Texto completo: El presidente Donald Trump bromeó con miembros de su ejecutivo con la posibilidad de intercambiar Puerto Rico para adquirir Groenlandia , un territorio autónomo danés.
Después de que se hiciera público el interés del presidente por la isla ubicada al norte de Canadá, un exfuncionario de la administración Trump confirmó aThe New York Times que el mandatario había comentado a modo de broma la idea de cambiarla por la isla caribeña.
Trump manifestó su inclinación por Groenlandia debido a “los abundantes recursos de la isla y a su importancia geopolítica “. Sin embargo, la Primera Ministra de Dinamarca tachó esta idea de “absurda”. “Groenlandia no está en venta. Groenlandia no es danesa, es groenlandesa. Espero que no […] se haya dicho en serio”, expresó el lunes Mette Frederiksen. Tras estas afirmaciones, Donald Trump suspendió la visita que tenía prevista a la reina Margarita II.
Respecto a Puerto Rico, el presidente ha arremetido reiteradamente contra su gobierno , al que a señalado como “ incopetente y corrupto “. La brecha entre el gobierno de la isla y el federal se hizo más grande tras el huracán María en septiembre de 2017. Los isleños criticaron las gestión del gobierno de los Estados Unidos.
Después de The New York Times hiciera pública este jueves la broma de Trump, el exgobernador portorriqueño Aníbal Acevedo Vilá cuestionó en un tuit a la comisionada residente en Washington Jenniffer González y a la actual gobernadora de la isla. “¿Seguirá considerando declararse republicana?”, preguntó Acevedo Vilá sobre Wanda Vázquez, que se inclinó recientemente hacia “filosofías republicanas”.
Según el New York Times, Trump propuso cambiarnos por Groenlandia. ¿Qué tendrá qué decir Jenniffer González sobre esto? ¿Volverá a quedarse callada? Y la Gobernadora, ¿seguirá considerando declararse republicana? La dignidad de Puerto Rico ???? no es negociable. pic.twitter.com/U75u5tCigz

Texto completo: Con la más reciente encuesta de CNN sobre los aspirantes demócratas a la candidatura presidencial del 2020, el exsecretario de Vivienda y Desarrollo Urbano, Julián Castro , cumplió sus requisitos para formar parte del tercer debate, que tendrá entre los moderadores al periodista Jorge Ramos .
“Nunca se supuso que fuera un favorito en esta carrera presidencial”, reconoció Castro en un mensaje de correo electrónico a sus seguidores. “A las personas que crecieron donde yo lo hice, que fueron criadas por madres solteras como yo, que provienen de una familia de inmigrantes como yo, nos dijeron que bajáramos la vista. Pero me ayudaste a hacer historia y demostrar que están equivocados”.
Destacó que a pesar de las adversidades ha logrado avanzar en el proceso, incluso hizo alusión a los ataques del presidente Donald Trump a los inmigrantes mexicanos, a quienes llamó “violadores” y “criminales”.
“Cuando el presidente me atacó a mí y a mi familia… cuando la prensa no me dio una oportunidad justa… Cuando la extrema derecha dijo que alguien de una comunidad inmigrante nunca podría representar a este país… Creíste en mí y me respaldaste. No tienes idea de cuánto significa eso” , apuntó. “Gracias por creer que un niño del West Side de San Antonio merece compartir mi visión con Estados Unidos. No te defraudaré”.
En seis días es la fecha límite para que los contendientes logren los 130,000 donantes únicos en al menos 20 entidades , además del 2% de la intención de voto en cuatro encuestas a nivel nacional , pero en los estados con votación anticipada: Iowa, New Hampshire, Carolina del Sur y/o Nevada.
Esas encuestas deben ser realizadas por los siguientes medios: Associated Press, ABC News, CBS News, CNN, Des Moines Register, Fox News, Monmouth University, NBC News, New York Times, National Public Radio, Quinnipiac University, University of New Hampshire, Wall Street Journal, USA Today, Washington Post y Winthrop University.
Si para el 28 de agosto no cumplen esos requisitos, contendientes como el multimillonario Tom Steyer no podrán participar, ya que le falta completar el segundo requisito, al sumar solamente tres sondeos con el porcentaje requerido.
Castro logró su pase, aunque la mayoría de los encuestados siguen sin conocerlo, un reto que él mismo ha reconocido como clave para su campaña.
“El objetivo es presentarme a muchas personas que aún no saben quién soy, porque mi nombre de identificación es aún más bajo que algunos de los otros candidatos”, expresó en una entrevista a NPR.
En orden alfabético, quienes han asegurado su participación son el exvicepresidente Joe Biden ; el senador de Nueva Jersey, Cory Booker ; el alcalde de South Bend, Indiana, Pete Buttigieg ; el exsecretario Castro; la senadora por California, Kamala Harris ; la senadora de Minnesota, Amy Klobuchar ; el exrepresentante de Texas, Beto O’Rourke ; el senador por Vermont, Bernie Sanders ; la senadora de Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren , y el empresario Andrew Yang , quien ha sorprendido en los debates anteriores y han superado incluso a personajes más conocidos, como el aspirante hispano.
El debate se llevará a cabo en la Texas Southern University y se transmitirá a través de ABC y Univision con traducción al español. Los organizadores indicaron que también estará disponible en las aplicaciones de ABC News, Hulu Live, The Roku Channel, Facebook Watch, AppleTV, Amazon Fire TV, YouTube, Apple News y Twitter.
Los conductores serán el presentador George Stephanopoulos , el presentador de World News Tonight, David Muir ; la corresponsal de ABC News, Linsey Davis , y el periodista Jorge Ramos . Todavía está pendiente la decisión de si habrá dos sesiones del mismo debate.

Texto completo: If you’ve ever wondered how a $35-a-class Pilates studio could survive an economic crash, you’re not alone. There is no doubt the explosive increase of boutique fitness companies in recent years has helped make it into a multi-billion dollar industry. But as with other luxury goods, the viability of their business model has come into question as an economic downturn hovers on the horizon.
With whispers of an oncoming recession getting louder, the industry is already looking for ways to modify costs and improve margins in order to avoid a bubble burst. This is evident by the recent announcement of Flywheel Sports’ closure of 11 locations and SoulCycle’s political embroilment causing members to boycott.
SEE ALSO: Cult-Fave Peloton Could Pay $150 Million for Stealing Hit Songs
While à la carte fitness chains such as cult favorite SoulCycle attempt to expand services, by adding Peloton-esque digital class subscriptions among other offerings, others are confident that diversity is the answer to differing tastes. SoulCycle has resisted joining a marketplace like ClassPass, opting to keep its brand exclusive. But when customers are faced with a choice of subscription cancellations to save money, luxury spending, such as pay-per-class studio fees, are typically the first to be cut.
“Some brands will be fine, but there will be casualties,” Paul O’Reilly-Hyland, CEO of gym passport app Zeamo, told Observer. “When it comes to a recession, we can see some of the models being tested, with consumers looking for the best value.”
The sentiment was echoed by ClassPass co-founder Payal Kadakia, who told The New York Times last week that trendy fitness classes aren’t just “a fad,” citing variety as a factor in ClassPass’ longevity.
“Due to ClassPass’ flexibility to work with different types of clubs and studios, we kind of sit above all the trends. We’ve built this place where anything works,” Kadakia explained. “Our job isn’t to prescribe. It’s to give you all the options so you can choose and have access to what you want to do.”
Struggling brands would benefit from partnering with a fitness platform like Zeamo and ClassPass during a recession, O’Reilly-Hyland explained. It would help not only to offset overhead costs like real estate space and instructors’ fees, but it would also allow struggling boutique studios to forego digital maintenance, such as a booking system’s backend.
Because larger, more established wellness clubs have been around long enough to experience long-term growth and downturn already, they’re more likely to survive another decline in customer base.
The fitness industry as a whole is still very fragmented right now, with countless wellness startups attempting to build out their own infrastructure. However, O’Reilly-Hyland predicts that “eventually we’ll begin to see consolidation between larger clubs and specialty studios, similar to what other industries have experienced in the past.”

On tour, Squeeze has no shortage of almost-hits to play

Texto completo: Having hits can be overrated. For evidence, look no further than Squeeze, the New Wave veterans behind gems such as “Black Coffee in Bed," “Goodbye Girl," “Pulling Mussels (From the Shell)," and the soulfully self-flagellating “Tempted," not one of which cracked the Top 40. In fact, outside of 1987's “Hourglass" and 1988's “853-5937," the British band (which barnstorms the South Shore Music Circus in Cohasset on Sunday, the Cape Cod Melody Tent in Hyannis on Tuesday, and the Tanglewood Koussevitzky Music Shed in Lenox on Thursday) didn't actually have many substantial hits in the US. “No, we did not, no," says singer-guitarist Glenn Tilbrook with a laugh. “I thought ['Tempted'] was a hit, but then it wasn't. We ignored it for a while after that."
But Squeeze's catalog has managed to have a rather long tail, and most of its (many) best-of collections play like one shadow classic after another. “Yeah, that's the wonderful thing about those compilations, is that they got our songs out in a way that probably radio didn't, mostly," Tilbrook says. And if that was frustrating in the short term, the singer — whose longtime songwriting partnership with guitarist Chris Difford remains at the core of an ever-shifting lineup that's been stable since 2007, give or take a bassist or two — feels different about it now.
“That's in the past, and that's the way it happened. From where I am now, we have a body of work, most of which I'm extremely proud of. And we were lucky to have so many songs, from where selecting songs for this tour was really hard, to know what to do and what to leave out. So that's a great position to be in."
Q. Squeeze has enough albums that a lot of your songs have obviously fallen off of your concert setlists over the years. What's your relationship with those songs? You obviously thought highly enough of them at the time to put care into recording them and releasing them to the public.
A. Yeah. Well, you know, the thing about Squeeze and being on a major label is that most of the early records were how we wanted to make them. And then the further along you get in your career, the harder it is to maintain control, because as soon as you're deemed to be not successful, everyone has an idea of how to fix it. So you find yourself going out on a limb more. So for instance, I've often said “Cosi Fan Tutti Frutti" is my least favorite Squeeze album, but on this tour, we've gone back to that record and the original intention. There's a song called “King George Street," which actually I wrote as a sort of Fleetwood Mac-y type song. It was beautiful and simple, and we contrived in production and recording to make it the most complicated thing ever. And you listen to the record and it just sounds ugly to me. But we uncovered the song beneath it, and it's one of the highlights of the new set we have now, I think.
Q. Part of the genius of “Tempted" is in how there's very little agony expressed or even backstory given to the situation. Instead, it's just an accumulation of mundane details that still paint a picture of self-recrimination.
A. Yeah. It took me about a week to write the tune, actually. It was really hard to get it to sound easy. But it just felt like we'd created a milestone for ourselves. But then we couldn't record it properly. We made a disastrous first recording of it. Then [singer-keyboardist] Paul Carrack came along, and we did the version that we did, and it was just like, “Oh, yeah. [Chuckles] That's how it's supposed to be."
Q. What was disastrous about that first recording?
A. We did more like ELO, and I sang it. I don't know if it's still on any streaming platforms, but it's on a compilation album called “Excess Moderation," and you can hear it. And thank goodness that wasn't the version that came out.
Q. Back in 2010, Squeeze recorded exact replicas of some of your classics for an album called “Spot the Difference." How many of your fans took that as a challenge?
A. None as far as I know. [Laughs] That was a strange album to do, to go back and try and examine and remember not only what you did, how you sang, what amps you used, but how some members of the band who weren't there played and what they did, too. So it drove me a bit mad doing that. It was the sort of project I had to pick up and put down and go away from every now and then. But when we actually tied it up, I was really, really pleased, because most of the time, I think we got pretty close to the [original] records. And [there were] times where, like on “Black Coffee in Bed," that's my favorite version. It's better than the record, as far as I'm concerned. I know that people love the record, and I get that, but that was the record that we should've made. [Laughs]
Q. Why did you like that version better?
A. I could sing it better. My enthusiasm excelled my ability to sing in the way that I wanted to at that point. Maybe that was endearing, and I just hear all the stuff that I didn't get quite right. However, I got it right on the “Spot the Difference" version. And I tell you what, one thing that I was really proud of, I've got to tell you this story, is that “Black Coffee in Bed" came on somewhere that I was, and I just thought, “Oh, that's 'Black Coffee.' " And only about halfway through did I realize that it was the “Spot the Difference" version. [Laughs] Which is the ultimate compliment, that I managed to fool myself.
Q. You're not the only band to have embarked on such a project in recent years. Def Leppard and Cracker have also done similar exact-replica rerecordings. What do you think that it says about the recording industry?
A. I don't know what it says about the recording industry. I can tell you what it says about where we are, that of course like 90 percent of other bands that have had deals, we don't have any control over our catalog. The parts of our catalog that have ended up with Universal, we have been unable to ascertain up until now where our masters are and if they survived the fire. [In June, The New York Times Magazine ran a story on a massive, unreported 2008 vault fire at Universal Studios Hollywood estimated to have destroyed hundreds of thousands of original master recordings.] So that's a huge wodge of our work to basically not control, that's the point about it. Nor reap the benefits from it. So it was a small attempt to wrestle back some control while we still can. And I have to say, it was a successful audio adventure that, up until now, we've had zero profits from how we intended it to be, because no one's used it. [Chuckles]

Texto completo: This zucchini pancake recipe is inspired by a popular dish in Turkey called mucver (pronounced moosh-vair).

This version is slightly different, with the addition of crumbled feta cheese and fresh dill. I also added grated carrots, fresh thyme, lemon zest and honey.

I think zucchini pancakes should be the size of a traditional American pancake, so I made them twice as big as the recipe called for, using ¼ cup batter for each one. For appetizers, you could make them smaller, and theyd be perfect as two-bite pancakes. (Use 1 tablespoon batter each.)

For this recipe, you will need about three large zucchini and two large carrots. Measure after you shred the vegetables, and squeeze out any excess moisture.

The original New York Times recipe says to make sure the zucchini is well drained before mixing all the ingredients. This ensures a crispy but tender pancake every time.

My recipe removes the seeds in the middle to keep the pancake from becoming too mushy. Use your food processor shredder to make easy work of grating the zucchini and carrots. A box grater will work just fine, too.

If your zucchini is ultra-fresh, leave the skin on, as the green color will make beautiful pancakes with the orange carrots. Serve with whipped feta and yogurt sauce at the table. Add a drizzle of honey over the top, if you like.

Weinstein Seeks Change Of Trial Venue

Texto completo: [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox .]
Harvey Weinstein, the once-powerful movie mogul who put Manhattan's skyline in the Miramax logo, wants his trial on sexual assault charges moved out of New York City, arguing that the intense media scrutiny makes it impossible for jurors to give him a fair trial.
Among the arguments Mr. Weinstein's legal team made in a court document filed on Friday was that Mr. Weinstein's name was mentioned online by Page Six, The New York Post's irreverent gossip column, more than 11,000 times.
The court papers that seek a change of venue also contend that Times Square billboards and newsstands on every corner mean city residents cannot avoid headlines related to Mr. Weinstein, and that Manhattan is the epicenter of global hashtag-driven movements like #MeToo.
"New York City is the least-likely place on earth where Mr. Weinstein could receive a fair trial," wrote Arthur L. Aidala, a lawyer for Mr. Weinstein.
A spokesman for the Manhattan district attorney's office said that it would respond in writing to the court motion, which was filed with the Appellate Division, First Judicial Department.
It is not at all clear that Mr. Weinstein, 67, has a better reputation elsewhere in the state.
Mr. Weinstein's celebrity connections and business dealings were already tabloid and trade fodder well before October 2017, when The New York Times and The New Yorker revealed the sexual harassment and abuse allegations against him.
Those articles generated worldwide news coverage about Mr. Weinstein, fueling a national debate and contributing to a reckoning about workplace harassment and sexual assault, which is now inextricably linked to his name.
The accusations, many from high-profile actresses, ignited the conversation that vaulted "me, too" from a two-word phrase to a political movement and led to a flood of allegations about sexual misconduct that brought down many other powerful men.
In his motion, Mr. Aidala acknowledged that the attention surrounding Mr. Weinstein's case -- which he called "an unprecedented amount of negative publicity" -- expanded well beyond the five boroughs.
"It is difficult to conceive of a similar case in recent memory that has generated more inflammatory press coverage," he wrote.
But he suggested that because New York City was the center of the media world, holding Mr. Weinstein's trial there would create a spectacle that would coerce prospective jurors to follow the court of public opinion.
It would be impossible, he wrote, "for Mr. Weinstein to obtain a fair and impartial jury that could come to court every day past newsstands, and the throngs of activists, celebrities and journalists" without being swayed.
Motions to change a trial's venue are common in high-profile criminal cases that generate a swirl of coverage. Defense attorneys generally see an onslaught of media coverage as an obstacle to picking an impartial jury.
"If the publicity is heavily tilted against you in a particular jurisdiction, there's a concern that you just can't find those jurors or that it's basically impossible," said Daniel S. Medwed, a professor at the Northeastern University School of Law.
But judges in these cases typically must balance concerns over finding a neutral jury with a well-established legal precedent that cases should be tried where the crimes took place.
Daniel Richman, a former prosecutor who teaches at Columbia Law School, said that judges, who have wide leeway in deciding these motions, have been reluctant to change the venue of trials. "The defense generally faces a real uphill battle," he said.
In Mr. Weinstein's case in particular, Mr. Richman and Mr. Medwed said it might be difficult for lawyers to show that news coverage had been more prejudicial in New York than elsewhere, given how much national attention the case has received.
They pointed to the trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who was sentenced to death in 2015 for his role in the Boston Marathon bombing. Mr. Tsarnaev's lawyers had asked for his trial to be moved from eastern Massachusetts, arguing among other things that media coverage would influence would-be jurors. Judges ultimately denied the request.
In the motion in Mr. Weinstein's case, Mr. Aidala described an "unending and ever-expanding deluge of local, national and international news, press coverage and online social media hysteria."
He described New York City as "ground zero" for all of it, as well as for a political movement that he said disproportionately affected the views of Democrats in the city when it came to harassment issues.
The motion repeatedly mentioned Page Six, which Mr. Aidala called a fixture of local news and accused of "constant, biased and sensational reporting." The New York Post declined to comment.
As an alternative to a Manhattan court, Mr. Aidala's motion proposed moving the trial to Suffolk County, the easternmost county in Long Island, which is within New York City's media reach, but has more conservative politics. Another option, he wrote, would be Albany County, a longtime Democratic bastion about 150 miles north of New York City.
Mr. Weinstein's trial is currently scheduled to begin Sept. 9 in State Supreme Court in Manhattan. He has been indicted on charges of rape, criminal sexual act and predatory sexual assault stemming from the accusations of two women.
The Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., is also seeking a new grand jury indictment that would allow the actress Annabella Sciorra, who has accused Mr. Weinstein of rape, to testify at his trial. Several women are expected to testify about additional allegations in an effort to establish a pattern of behavior.
Mr. Weinstein has denied the allegations and has said the sexual encounters were consensual. Earlier this year, he built a "dream team" of heavy-hitting lawyers that has since fallen apart. The motion filed Friday came about a month after Mr. Weinstein hired two new lawyers, Donna Rotunno and Damon M. Cheronis, to take over his case.

Texto completo: The police officer accused of placing Eric Garner in a deadly chokehold five years ago was "untruthful" and "disingenuous" in his recounting of the incident, says the city judge who recommended he be fired.
Officer Daniel Pantaleo didn't testify at his departmental trial this year in the death of Eric Garner - but when interviewed by NYPD Internal Affairs Bureau cops, he claimed he did not use a prohibited chokehold on Garner as he tried to arrest him on a Staten Island sidewalk in 2014.
"I found [Pantaleo's] uncorroborated hearsay statements explaining his actions to be untruthful," NYPD Deputy Commissioner of Trials Rosemarie Maldonado said.
Maldonado's ruling was published in The New York Times on Sunday night.
"First, I found [Pantaleo] to be disingenuous when he viewed the video and denied using a chokehold, even though his actions were completely consistent with his own erroneous and restrictive definition of the Patrol Guide prohibition.
She continued, "Second, the preponderance of the credible evidence contradicted his rationalization that the positioning of his elbow protected Mr. Garner's neck and that he exerted no pressure to the throat."
Video of Garner's death, first published by the Daily News, showed Pantaleo wrapping one arm under Garner's right armpit and around his shoulder, and his other arm over Garner's left shoulder and upper chest.
Maldonado focused on the moment after Pantaleo pulled Garner forward to prevent him from crashing through a store window.
"[Pantaleo] had the opportunity to readjust his grip from a prohibited chokehold to a less lethal alternative; he did not," the judge wrote.
"It is at this point that the video shows that [Pantaleo's] right arm is no longer in its initial position underneath Mr. Garner's armpit," she wrote. "Instead, [Pantaleo's] right hand clasps his left hand while his left forearm is still wrapped around Mr. Garner's throat in a chokehold."
She added that Pantaleo kept the grip even as Garner lay on his side. "It was here that Respondent's conduct escalated from a Patrol Guide violation to criminal recklessness," she wrote.
The decision to fire or retain Pantaleo, a 13-year veteran, sits with NYPD Commissioner James O'Neill.

Greenland to Trump: Thanks, but we're not for sale

Texto completo: COPENHAGEN, Denmark - President Donald Trump's idea to possibly buy Greenland for its natural resources left residents of the semiautonomous Danish territory amused, apoplectic and in disbelief, and received a chilly reception in Denmark on Friday.
"I hope it's a joke, because it's a terrible and grotesque thought," said Martin Lidegaard, chairman of Denmark's Foreign Policy Committee.
The idea first sprang up last year, according to a New York Times report Thursday, when Trump joked about buying Greenland for its natural wealth during a meeting that spring in the Oval Office. Citing people familiar with his thinking, the article said he had repeatedly returned to the possibility, adding that the country, which is part of the kingdom of Denmark, also appeals to him because of its location in the North Atlantic has security value.
His advisers were highly skeptical that a purchase of the world's largest island could ever happen, but they agreed to investigate the possibility.
"Greenland is not for sale and cannot be sold, but Greenland is open for trade and corporation with other countries - including the United States," Kim Kielsen, Greenland's premier, said in a statement, according to the Ritzau news agency.
Social media users were quick to exploit the report about the American president's exploring the purchase of Greenland. One photoshopped a pompous-looking golden tower into a picture of Greenlandic villages with colorful two-story wooden houses. Another asked if Denmark could trade Greenland for Hawaii
Greenland, a nation of 56,000, has a shared history with Denmark since the first Vikings settled there. If that relationship were to change, it would not be up to Denmark and certainly not up to an American president's "impulse," said Henrik O. Breitenbauch, an expert on Greenland and the head of the Center for Military Studies at Copenhagen University.
"You don't just trade people and countries," Breitenbauch added.
The speculation is that Trump, a former real estate developer, was keen on Greenland because he tends to see the world through a prism of acquisitions. And Greenland, located among both friendly and hostile neighbors, has everything a real estate investor could desire in terms of fresh air, direct access to the sea, an abundance of shrimp, cod and halibut and a backyard rich with lucrative minerals.
"Greenland could choose to become Puerto Rico with snow, but I doubt there's much interest in that," Breitenbauch said, referring to the unincorporated U.S. territory.

The Species Act, Endangered

Texto completo: In early May, a United Nations panel on biodiversity released a deeply troubling 1,500-page report warning that as many as one million plant and animal species were at risk of extinction worldwide. It strongly urged nations everywhere to accelerate efforts to save the marine and terrestrial life that remain -- the mammals, the birds, the fish, the plants, even the insects that pollinate the world's food supply. The report also noted that global warming had become a major driver of this alarming decline, shrinking or shifting the ecosystems in which wildlife had evolved.Now comes what amounts to a thumb in the eye from the Trump administration: The Interior Department announced a set of rules on Monday that, far from enlarging protections, will weaken how the nation's most important conservation law, the Endangered Species Act, is applied. The proposed changes would make it harder to shield fragile species not only from commercial development like logging and oil and gas drilling, but also from the multiple threats posed by climate change. Specifically, the rules would complicate the task of getting species listed as threatened or endangered in the first place, and would reduce the habitat judged necessary for their survival.These changes should come as no surprise to anyone who has paid the least bit of attention to this administration's environmental and energy policies over the past two years. They are fully consistent with a broader pattern of regulatory moves aimed at reducing costs and burdens on business. They are in keeping as well with a host of other actions supporting President Trump's policy of "energy dominance," including but not limited to a pell-mell rush to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil exploration, the evisceration of two national monuments in Utah to make way for drilling and mining, and clawing back nine million acres in several oil-rich Western states that the Obama administration had set aside to protect the imperiled sage grouse.The announcement of the new rules was accompanied by predictably pious boilerplate from David Bernhardt, the interior secretary and a former oil lobbyist, to the effect that the changes were necessary to modernize and simplify the law and make it more transparent. Neither he nor the dozen or so Republicans from Western states recruited to sing his praises mentioned anywhere in their public statements the act's popularity with the general public and its rich bipartisan pedigree. Strongly endorsed by President Richard Nixon, and approved by huge margins in both chambers of Congress (the House vote was an astounding 355 to 4), the act would stand zero chance of passage in today's poisoned political climate. The moderate Republicans who thrived in Congress in Nixon's day are themselves an endangered species, if not, for all practical purposes, extinct.Nor was there any mention of the act's striking successes, the species brought back from the edge, including, among other creatures small and great, the bald eagle, the peregrine falcon, the American alligator and the gray wolf. Instead, we heard the tired and irrelevant complaint that, of the more than 1,650 species listed as threatened or endangered, only 47 have been delisted because their populations have rebounded to fully sustainable levels. But that's a nutty way of measuring success; species once hurtling toward extinction can hardly be expected to rebuild healthy populations overnight. And only a relative handful have actually gone to their doom, while many are deemed stable and on the road to recovery.There are several shortcomings to the Trump administration's new rules, but two stand out. The first would allow regulators for the first time to calculate economic costs when deciding whether a species warrants protection -- for instance, estimating lost revenue from logging operations prohibited in habitat set aside for species. Under current law, listing decisions must be made solely on the basis of science "without reference to possible economic or other impacts." An administration official insisted that future listings would still be based solely on science and that economic studies would be for informational purposes only.But let's not be naïve. First, there's the mind-set of senior officials; from Day 1, this administration has shown disregard bordering on contempt for science when making important decisions about the environment. Economic information could covertly influence regulators who are already suspicious of science, from Mr. Bernhardt on down, and really didn't much like the Endangered Species Act to begin with. It could also be used to tilt public opinion against a controversial listing.The second major shortcoming in the new rules is their failure to squarely confront the problem of climate change. Indeed, the rule makers appear to have gone to some lengths to dodge the problem. The law defines two categories of at-risk species -- threatened and endangered. Currently, a threatened species is one "likely to become an endangered species within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range." "Foreseeable future" is not defined. The new rules do so, in some detail and in ways that critics believe will invite the government to discount the future effects of global warming.Under the new rules, "foreseeable future" extends only as far as officials can "reasonably determine" that the future threats are "likely." This leaves substantial room to dismiss the far-off threats of climate change as excessively speculative. It might have made it difficult, for instance, back in 2008, to designate the polar bear as a threatened species and, two years later, set aside more than 187,000 square miles of sea ice and barrier islands in Alaska as critical habit and thus off limits to development. At the time, officials relied on climate models that extended many decades into the future, which under the new rules might not have been acceptable.The ability of species to adapt to global warming could be further undermined by new language addressing critical habitat, the land that can be kept off limits to development to help species recover. Current rules define critical habitat as not only the land where the threatened or endangered species live but also the land they once occupied and land they might need in the future. As the world warms, species will move, their ranges will shift and that unoccupied land could become important to their survival. But that land gets short shrift in the new rules, and it could now be opened for mining, timbering, oil drilling or other forms of exploitation.For all of Mr. Bernhardt's talk of transparency and efficiency, some of the new rules seemed deliberately designed to throw sand in the machinery (which may, of course, be the whole point). Under present practice, known as the "blanket section 4(d) rule," the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, which administers the law, automatically extends many of the same protections to threatened species as it does to endangered ones. The point of the act is to keep species from becoming endangered or, even worse, blinking out.This rule is now history, replaced by a system in which the agency will, case by case, develop species-specific protection plans. This could be a cumbersome and time-consuming task, of little benefit to the species awaiting help. Mr. Bernhardt's team has already slowed the listing process. The Obama administration added an average of 49 species a year to the threatened and endangered lists. The Trump administration has added no more than 11 in one year. In 2019, it has added only the trispot darter, a type of fish from the Southeast listed as threatened in late January.Like other Trump environmental rule changes and rollbacks, this one will undoubtedly face challenges. Environmentally inclined senators have been talking about invoking congressional oversight procedures to overturn the rules, which is possible if they move quickly enough, but unlikely. The best hope lies with the courts, which in several cases -- notably Mr. Trump's efforts to roll back Obama-era protections against drilling in Arctic waters -- have not been at all reluctant to slam on the brakes, and in general have been a bulwark against Trumpian overreach. The California attorney general, Xavier Becerra, and his Massachusetts counterpart, Maura Healey, citing findings from the alarming United Nations extinctions study in May, have said they will take the administration to court for what they believe are multiple violations of the law's basic purpose.We hope they, and the environmental groups that join them, will persist. Ms. Healey likens the new rules to "a plan from a cartoon villain," ignoring everything we know about biodiversity, its uses and its alarming decline in pursuit of Mr. Trump's reckless energy agenda. At issue is the full expression of one of the country's noblest and most ambitious environmental laws.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Texto completo: Nonfiction is sometimes more resilient to the reader than fiction of comparable quality. If a serious novel's organizing theme doesn't quite gel, the novel is typically deemed a dud. If a well-researched nonfiction work doesn't ultimately come together thematically, well, you can still learn some interesting things.

The titular friends of the book were not so much friends of each other as friends of author and classmate Cohan, an experienced journalist. All five were part of the micro generation of late baby boomers born around 1960, and the four alluded to in the title all died around age 40. All five spent time together at the ultimate American prestige secondary school, Phillips Academy of Andover, Mass., referred to throughout the book, and presumably by those in the know, as "Andover."

The school had been boys-only and rules-heavy throughout most of its history. By the time 1960-vintage teens entered around 1974, it was coed and more forgiving toward typical high school behavior, but still quite difficult academically. The four friends (plus the author) arrived there through giftedness, family prosperity and prominence, or some mix, and fared well enough. Whether their lives would have been dramatically different if they had gone to other secondary schools isn't clear.

One of the four friends was John F. Kennedy Jr. and another was Will Daniel, grandson of 33rd U.S. President Harry Truman and son of mystery writer Margaret Truman Daniel and New York Times Editor Clifton Daniel. One was Jack Berman, son of economically struggling Holocaust survivors, and one was Harry Bull, heir to a multi-generational Midwest business.

All graduated from Andover and then (in Daniel's case, eventually) college. Three followed college with law school. Three married. Two left children behind. All had occasional or chronic emotional and academic struggles. Three experienced deaths tinged with at least a suggestion of mystery or recklessness, but the most violent death was dealt to the one who was blamelessly in the wrong place at the wrong time.

The two sons of famous families get the longest chapters. Not only are they, let's face it, a greater draw to the typical reader because of the fame factor, more is known about them. Ferreting out the life histories of the two more obscure required a great deal of first hand reporting, mostly in the form of interviews with surviving relatives, friends and colleagues.

Thinking about the commonalities and differences among the men and trying to draw a line from Andover to their ultimate fates didn't yield much. Taking the tack of "Here are the lives, triumphs and crises of four American men with access to privilege, all born and all dying within a fairly short span of each other" yields a lot of the texture of an era, and makes reading "Four Friends" a worthwhile use of a back-to-school season day.

Texto completo: Q. I see the following two phrases all too often: 1. "Three (or two or four) times less." I would think "one times less" means it is free, and that "two times less" means you get paid the value of the item if you take it away! 2. "One of the only," as in "one of the only car dealers to offer this." One of the only what? - Francis Charest, East Hartford
A. You are a shrewd consumer, Francis, and a savvy grammarian as well. Both of these usage slips involve counting, and you're right on both counts.
Using "X times less," no matter what the value of X may be, always causes confusion. A recent story in The New York Post, for instance, referred to Pedialyte's claim that it's better than most sports drinks because it contains "two times less sugar." Does that mean Pedialyte contains half the sugar, a third of the sugar, no sugar, or even some kind of negative sugar content? Who knows?
Likewise, a recent Denver Post story reported that the $730,000 spent to prevent wildfires was "more than 100 times less" than the $120 million spent to put out wildfires. By my calculation, "100 times less" would mean that NEGATIVE $11.88 billion was spent on preventing wildfires ($12 billion, minus the first $120 million).
You're 100 times more likely to avoid absurdities like this if you avoid "times less" entirely and simply use fractions or percentages, e.g., "half the sugar," "50 percent of the sugar," "less than one hundredth (or less than one percent) of the $120 million spent."
As for the "one of the only car dealers" trope, "only," like "unique," means "sole, one-of-a-kind." So if there's at least one other car dealer making this offer, how can this one claim to be the "only" one doing so?
The correct wording is "one of the few car dealers to offer this." This boast sounds much less impressive, of course, so marketers insert "only," hoping that its alluring, one-of-a-kind aroma will get bargain-hungry customers salivating.
But the misuse of "only" for "few" isn't restricted to advertising. A recent New York Times story referred to "one of the only [read 'few'] administration officials who was already booked for the Sunday talk shows," while a Washington Post headline read, "Congress is losing one of the only [read 'few'] incentives it had to address the deficit."
Despite this growing misuse, I encourage you to resist the seductive allure of using "only" to mean "few," even though you might be one of the only . . . er, few people to do so.

Texto completo: I lasted 11 years in a 700-square-foot, one-bedroom apartment. Technically, there was a small office with a window that looked out onto a bricked-in elevator shaft, a room that only a real estate agent would call a second "bedroom." Nobody in his right mind would want to sleep there.
When I left, the building's landlord grumbled, then re-listed the unit online. After a few months without a new renter to pay the price he sought, he changed tactics. Rather than drop the rent, he audaciously pitched the apartment as a four-bedroom space.
For potential tenants without enough imagination to envision life in a 21st century tenement, he included a blueprint illustrating how beds could be sardined around the one bathroom.
It should come as no surprise when I tell you he didn't rent it. Not even Charlie Bucket's family could have made that arrangement work.
Brazen floor-plans came to mind frequently during my first meal at Portland's Royale Lunch Bar, which opened this April. For the first 10 minutes, as my two guests and I shared a supercharged Lord Goat Boy milkshake ($6) - a Vietnamese-style iced coffee frappe with enough caffeine to qualify it as a pre-workout supplement - things seemed cozy but manageable at our wall-adjacent table.
Then food began arriving, piling up in a logjam of sheet trays and utensils, and it became clear that our table (and all the others in the rough shiplap-paneled room) was actually a two-top. Ours was ambitiously set with three chairs, while others were surrounded with an even more aspirational four.
So when you read that there are 30 seats in the quirky, French-Canadian-inspired lunch joint, be forewarned: A little fanciful math went into that calculus.
Around noon on a weekday, solo diners and duos stand the best chance of finding a place to devour their hefty, homemade-mustard-slathered smoked beef brisket sandwiches ($11) or delicately smoked, deep-fried half-chickens ($12) sheathed in crispy skin pulled tighter than Cher's.
If you cannot find a seat, you'll want to take your order somewhere with a flat surface - Royale's are not meals intended for on-the-go consumption as you stroll around the Old Port. It would be difficult to imagine scarfing the Caesar Royale ($8) - a hearty, albeit gloppily overdressed salad bulked up with Kalamata olives and toasted farro - while in transit.
So too, the undersalted (yet accurately named) Smokey Tomato Soup ($5), and the bland-and-wet, extremely healthy-tasting fluorescent cauliflower "Mac N Cheese" ($7). Frankly, you're better off not bothering with either of these two sides, both of which start with a bland vichyssoise base that deadens all other flavors.
Unfortunately, the same can be said for one of Royale's signature dishes, its poutine ($7). Each element is special on its own: skinny fries hand-cut from Green Thumb Farms potatoes; lush house-made gravy that burbles in puffs of rosemary and thyme; squeaky, savory cheese curds; and if you're game, a scattering of Montreal-style smoked brisket (add $4).
But as I discovered during two visits, combining the components into poutine diminishes them all. Under a flood of cool gravy, the fries wind up mushy and the cheese stubbornly unmelted.
Still, chat with co-owner and executive chef Joe Farr for a few minutes, and you get the feeling that he's got the skills to sort out a soggy poutine. Trained locally at Back Bay Grill, then a caterer at Bread & Butter/158 Pickett St. CafÃ© (along with two of his business partners), Farr envisions Royale Lunch Bar as a modern response to fast food and downtown sandwich shops that source everything from corporate distributors.
"We're using as much local produce and ingredients as we possibly can," he said. "All the breads, buns and bagels we use come from Southside Productions, another 158 Pickett connection. Our gravy is made from backs and necks from whole chickens, we're making our own mustard and of course all of our own pickles."
While not strictly French- Canadian, Royale's tangy, fermented vegetables are exceptional. Most sandwiches are served with at least one portion, like Fresno-chile turbo-boosted bread-and-butter pickles that the kitchen slips into a potato bun alongside a concussively crunchy deep-fried chicken thigh ($9). It is a gorgeous and deceptively spicy combination.
Or discs of sweet-pickled carrots spooned into an orange border around a Philly-meets-Sherbrooke mashup, Farr's excellent Bifteck Sandwich ($9), featuring shavings of red-wine-marinated smoked eye-round mounded with tart, sweet onion jam, all obscured by a gauzy film of melted American cheese.
But to get a real sense of Royale's pickling prowess, order the five preserved vegetables served with chips the kitchen makes from bagels left over from its bustling breakfast service ($7). Snappy sour dill spears, garlic-marinated mushrooms and dilly beans as fat as your thumb arrive in an overcrowded paper boat (along with bread-and-butter slices and pickled carrots). Remove one of the superb pickles and several will tumble from the container onto your aluminum sheet tray, but you won't mind. This is one situation where overambitious space planning is easy to forgive.

It Takes a Lot of Labor To Get Yourself to Work

Texto completo: As a matter of principle, it shouldn't be such misery to get somewhere you don't even want to go. That's why commuting to work can awaken elemental feelings of dread, powerlessness and rage.
You strategize. You wake early. You wedge your body into an obscenely packed subway or inch your car along a planet-killing freeway. Finally, you are victorious: Congratulations, you've made it to the office! By the way, there's now a pre-meeting before the meeting. Todd brought mini bagels.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Americans spend about 27 minutes a day getting to work. That number will sound wondrously low to many riders of the M.T.A. and New Jersey Transit. In the New York metropolitan area -- go, team! -- it takes 37 minutes on average to get from door to door. While other cities (Atlanta, Chicago, Houston, Phoenix and Seattle all come to mind) have tormented their work forces over the years, there has always been something uniquely awful about the New York commute. Back in 2001, Alan E. Pisarski, a transportation consultant, told The New York Times, "You guys are safely ensconced in the lead." Asked about Los Angeles and its fabled freeway jams, he said, "That's an American myth, I think perpetuated by New Yorkers." Not anymore, it seems. Some studies now actually bestow the longest-commute crown on Palmdale, Calif., a suburb of ... Los Angeles.
The photographs here all ran in The Times and capture commuters from the 1940s onward. One of the more striking images, taken by Dith Pran in 1981, shows a New Yorker in a turtleneck sweater and winter coat holding open the subway doors so another woman can join what looks like a hellscape inside. It's a peculiarly urban sort of kindness.
In the early 20th century, New York subways actually had attendants, colloquially called "sardine-packers," to physically cram people in. The Japanese famously employed uniformed, white-gloved "shiri oshi" -- meaning "tushy pushers" -- to do the same during rush hour. A pusher in Tokyo told The Times in 1995, "If their back is toward us, it's easier, but if they're facing us, it's harder because there's no proper spot to push them, though we try to push their bags or something else they are holding. In any case, we always first say, 'We will push you."' Once the trains left the station, the attendants used long, hooked poles to recover shoes and other items that had fallen on the track. Said another pusher, back in 1964, "I really wonder how so many of those girls manage to go to work with one shoe."
As with any bleak subject, it may be wisest to focus not on the depressing stuff but on the triumph of the human spirit that it inspires. These photos also record the ways in which people have reinvented the commute over the years -- by walking, bicycling, scooting and so on. For the thousands leaving distant suburbs at unholy hours, there is always some guy who crosses the Hudson in a collapsible kayak before unfolding his bike.
It is possible to be a conscientious objector to the whole laborious, stress-inducing, health-endangering process, of course. More than 5 percent of American workers now work at least part of the week from home, where no one steals their passion fruit LaCroix from the fridge. Everyone else can only hope to avoid the kind of existential crisis that a commuter named Ted Ogren experienced in January 1996, when a heavy snowfall turned his trip from New Jersey to Long Island City into a six-hour test of Shackletonian endurance.
"This is absurd," Ogren told a Times reporter. "I'll probably get to work just in time to come back."

Texto completo: I’ll never forget the moment I learned we were on lockdown. It was Aug. 15, 2012. My frustration mingled with fear. Trapped on the sixth floor, we knew someone had been shot. We knew we couldn’t leave yet. We knew little else.
While I was missing lunch, a crime scene played out in the office lobby below me. My coworker and friend Leo wasn’t armed, but he’d played the quick-thinking and inadvertent hero, disarming a young man on a mission to kill me and as many of my colleagues as possible. The gunman had packed his backpack with ammo and 15 Chick-fil-A sandwiches — later admitting that he’d planned to smear them on our lifeless faces as a political statement. Leo took a bullet in the arm but managed to disarm and hold the attacker until law enforcement arrived.
I wrote and edited for the Family Research Council, a public advocacy organization that promoted the principles I’d cared about since childhood: protecting the family, promoting the dignity of every human life and advocating for religious liberty. It reads like a tagline, but it’s also just what I believed and the way I chose to match my career with my convictions.
Biology is not bigotry: My daughter thinks she's transgender. Her public school undermined my efforts to help her.
I never expected that everyone would celebrate or share my beliefs. But I did expect to be able to discuss and debate these differences without becoming a political target in an act of terrorism, the first conviction under Washington, D. C. ’s 2002 Anti-Terrorism Act.
The Southern Poverty Law Center labeled us a "hate group"
It was the type of violent incident that one could expect a group that purportedly monitors “hate,” like the Southern Poverty Law Center, to notice, research, and decry. In fact, we were on the center’s radar but for all the wrong reasons. The assailant acknowledged later in FBI testimony that he had selected our office precisely because the SPLC had labeled my employer a “hate group. ”
It’s always been easier to smear people rather than wrestle with their ideas. It’s a bully who calls names and spreads lies rather than thoroughly reading a brief’s legal arguments or challenging the rationale underlying a policy proposal. The SPLC has chosen to take the easy path — to intimidate and mislead for raw political power and financial benefit.
Hate groups in America: I grew up a white nationalist. We never blamed ourselves for mass shootings like El Paso.
For years, former employees revealed, local journalists reported and commentators have lamented: the Southern Poverty Law Center is not what it claims to be. Not a pure-hearted, clear-headed legal advocate for the vulnerable, but rather an obscenely wealthy marketing scheme. For years, the left-wing interest group has used its “hate group” list to promote the fiction that violent Neo-Nazis and Christian nonprofits peacefully promoting orthodox beliefs about marriage and sex are indistinguishable. Sometimes, it’s apologized to public figures; it’s smeared and recently paid out millions to settle a threatened defamation lawsuit.
The SPLC has its own troubles
These shameful secrets are no longer hidden in shadows. The New York Times, Politico, NPR and a host of other mainstream publications are reporting on the corruption and widening credibility gap. The SPLC dismissed its co-founder, and its president resigned amidst numerous claims of sexual harassment, gender discrimination and racism within the organization — a parade of disgraces that vividly force the conclusion: The SPLC is hollow, rotten and failing at the very virtues it pretends to celebrate.
The criticism comes from many corners. There’s the Current Affairs editor who seems sympathetic to the center’s progressive mission but decries its “hate group” list as an “outright fraud” and a “willful deception designed to scare older liberals into writing checks to the SPLC. ”
There’s the retired investigative journalist who helped research and write an eight-part series on the center’s “litany of problems and questionable practices” in the mid-1990s. His Washington Post opinion piece reads with a thinly-veiled message: We nearly got a Pulitzer Prize for TELLING YOU SO.
But perhaps most damning of all are the indictments leveled by former employee Bob Moser in The New Yorker. He remembers being welcomed to the “Poverty Palace” and recounts the heart-sinking reality of it all — being “pawns” in a “highly profitable scam. ”
False 'racism' claims carry real burden: Oberlin bakery owner: Gibson's Bakery paid a high cost for an unfairly damaged reputation
Jobs and years have passed, and I work now for Alliance Defending Freedom. ADF ranks among “the top performing firm(s]" litigating First Amendment cases, the “Christian legal powerhouse that keeps winning at the Supreme Court. ” And yes, my new employer has also attracted one of the SPLC’s spurious hate labels. The label easily peels and fades away when one actually does the research and listens to truth before deciding to troll.
I won't be intimidated by the SPLC
If the SPLC thought that their hate would intimidate or silence me and my colleagues, they’re sadly mistaken. I’m lucky — blessed, really — that I didn’t take a bullet for my beliefs back in 2012. But the center’s ugly slander and the gunman’s misguided attack have sharpened my resolve and deepened my faith in my Savior, who commands my destiny and shields me from the schemes of man. The same is true for my colleagues.
Fifty-one years ago, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. , fell to an assassin’s bullet. The SPLC pretends to carry his legacy but weaponizes hate labels instead. Unlike SPLC's name-calling, Dr. King’s words and vision stand the test of time. “Injustice anywhere,” he warned, “is a threat to justice everywhere. ”
The SPLC, as an institution, has thoroughly disqualified itself as an arbiter of justice. But this country would be a better place if the center’s donors, lawyers and friends would truly believe and apply Dr. King’s legacy — his peaceful pursuit of justice and his love of neighbor.

Texto completo: Many wealthy Americans don't like to think of themselves as rich.
"Rich" can carry connotations of greed, opulence or entitlement, which, not surprisingly, few want to be associated with.
They prefer words like "affluent" or "comfortable" or "lucky," said Rachel Sherman, a sociology professor at the New School who wrote a book chronicling the attitudes and perceptions of affluent New Yorkers.
Moreover, studies show that many people think they are lower on the income ladder than they actually are, which has implications for public policy.
Most of us prefer to call our incomes "average," even when, statistically speaking, they're not. For many people, it's not even a quantitative question at all.
A 2018 YouGov study, for example, asked respondents what annual income would be required before a person could be considered rich. The higher a respondent's income, the higher he or she set the bar.
"What people are doing is telling you how they feel about how much money they have," said Keith Payne, a psychology professor at the University of North Carolina who has written about inequality and income perception. "Do they feel like they have as much money as they need? Or do they feel like they don't have enough?"
Some of this perception may be rooted in the lopsided nature of income distribution in the United States, in which the very top earners have made extraordinary gains. In a country where the top 1 percent earns about one-fifth of the national income, it can seem as if "the rich" really means "the megarich."
When most of us assess our financial well-being, we typically refer not to data tables but to comparisons with the world around us: our friends, our colleagues and our neighbors. Wonderful as they may be, they do not necessarily make up a representative sample of the income distributions in our cities, especially when we are increasingly living among people with incomes similar to ours.
If Americans were perfectly scientific about assessing their incomes, we might expect the accompanying chart to have symmetry around the 50th percentile -- the true middle of the income distribution. But respondents in the 60th and 70th percentiles were more likely to call their incomes "average" than those in the true middle. And people near the very bottom of the income distribution were nearly as likely to call their incomes "average" as those near the very top.
This phenomenon is not unique to the United States. In 2016, researchers in Sweden published the results of an experiment in which they asked a representative sample of Swedes to guess their place on the income distribution.
The researchers found that a "vast majority" of their respondents believed they were poorer, relative to others, than they actually were. The people who thought they were right in the middle of the income distribution -- perfectly middle class, you might say -- were, on average, closer to the 75th percentile. And as a group, respondents whose incomes actually resembled the true median thought they were closer to the bottom fourth.
It's true that the differences between perceived income rank and actual income rank represent much smaller dollar amounts in Sweden than they do in the United States. The difference between the 80th percentile and 50th percentile in the U.S. is about $ 60,000; in Sweden it's closer to $ 15,000. But the overall trend is similar: Wealthier people thought they were doing worse than they were, relative to everyone else.
Americans generally like the idea of taxing other people to provide benefits for people like themselves. But not surprisingly, redistributive policies become less popular as more details about them become known -- one reason some Democrats are worried that initial public support for proposals like "Medicare for all" and guaranteed free tuition to public two- and four-year colleges will eventually wane.
In the Swedish experiment, when survey respondents learned they were higher on the income spectrum than they thought they were, they became less generous in their attitudes toward policies that would distribute money away from people like them. That logic works in the other direction, too: Redistributive policies might be more popular if lower-earning households who perceive themselves as higher on the income ladder knew where they truly stood.
A real-world example occurred after the 2015 State of the Union address, in which President Obama proposed ending tax benefits for college savings accounts (most of the balances in such accounts were held by families making at least $ 200,000 a year). More than 90 percent of American married couples made less than that, but Mr. Obama abandoned the proposal within a week under political pressure from both parties.
Writing about the episode for The New York Times, Josh Barro offered this summary: "The first rule of modern tax policy is raise taxes only on the rich. The second rule is that your family isn't rich, even if you make a lot of money."

Column: Jay-Z sells out Kaepernick, grabs big money from NFL

Texto completo: Remember when Jay-Z was a dynamic hip-hop artist whose stark lyrics gave voice to the oppressed and downtrodden?
Well, those days are over.
He may have 99 Problems – but a conscience certainly ain’t one.
Completing his transformation to total sellout, Jay-Z climbed into bed with those racial progressives over at the NFL in what was clearly nothing more than a money grab for one side and a public-relations coup for the other.
Sorry, Kaep.
Social justice has been banished to the sidelines.
“I think we’ve moved past kneeling and I think it’s time to go into actionable items,” Jay-Z said in a ludicrously weak attempt to spin his hefty NFL payoff into some sort of profile in courage.
With a totally straight face – and NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell by his side – the rap icon and entrepreneur said his partnership with the league is actually a progressive step to carry on the campaign that banished quarterback Colin Kaepernick courageously began by kneeling during the national anthem to bring attention to police brutality and glaring racial inequities in the U.S. justice system.
“I think everyone knows what the issue is – we’re done with that,” Jay-Z said. “We all know the issue now. OK, next.”
Hmm, where have we heard that before?
Oh, yeah, from opponents of the civil rights movement, who derided those protesting against whites-only lunch counters and seats in the back of the bus as nothing more than rabble-rousers who should’ve been focused on real issues afflicting the African American community, as if a system that denied pretty much every human dignity wasn’t the actual problem.
“Now that we all know what’s going on, what are we going to do?” Jay-Z said, putting his foot further in his mouth. “How are we going to stop it? Because the kneeling was not about a job, it was about injustice.”
Hey, maybe the NFL should take its deal with Roc Nation to a whole new level by pairing Jay-Z with Jon Voight, another celebrity (yes, kids, Jon Voight was once a cutting-edge actor) who turned in what little was left of his cred card after that awful film “Anaconda” by declaring recently that racism was “solved long ago by our forefathers.”
We can see the ad now:
“Welcome to another season of exciting NFL football! Featuring the social justice stylings of Jay-Z, who’ll show us all how to make a buck off police beating up black people.
And the racially harmonious world of Jon Voight, asking the question that’s been on everyone’s mind: Why can’t we all just get along?
And finally, we’ll bring you the smiling face of Roger Goodell, reminding everyone for the 847th time that Colin Kaepernick is not in the NFL because he’s just not good enough.”
Now, back to reality.
Safety Eric Reid, who joined Kaepernick in his kneeling protest but managed to keep a job in the NFL, took aim at Jay-Z for teaming up with the league without getting some sort of assurance that his former 49ers teammate would get another crack at taking the field, something he clearly wants to do.
Jay-Z framed it this way: “So what are we gonna do? ... (Help) millions and millions of people, or we get stuck on Colin not having a job.”
Reid replied on Twitter: “These aren’t mutually exclusive. They can both happen at the same time! It looks like your goal was to make millions and millions of dollars by assisting the NFL in burying Colin’s career.”
Touche.
Maybe we’re being too hard on Jay-Z, who has long pulled off that delicate balancing act between social consciousness (such as his Trayvon Martin documentary series) and the potential pitfalls of good ol’ capitalism (his 2013 collaboration with Barney’s was widely panned over allegations that the luxury store discriminated against black shoppers).
He’s been on the right side of many issues, but never let it stand in the way of making a buck.
Jay-Z was reportedly peeved at rapper Travis Scott for performing with Maroon 5 during last season’s Super Bowl in Atlanta, after many black artists bailed on the halftime show over the league’s treatment of Kaepernick.
But now that he’s got all that cash in his pocket, Jay-Z says his stance had nothing to do with the ex-quarterback.
“My problem is (Scott) had the biggest year to me last year, and he’s playing on a stage that had an M on it,” Jay-Z said.
“I didn’t see any reason for him to play second fiddle to anyone that year, and that was my argument.”
Jay-Z says he won’t be performing at this season’s Super Bowl, but his company – home to Rihanna, DJ Khaled and other stars – will co-produce the halftime show and serve as a consultant on other entertainment projects with the league, as well as working with its Inspire Change initiative.
“The NFL has a great big platform, and it has to be all-inclusive,” Jay-Z told The New York Times when his deal with the league was first announced. “They were willing to do some things, to make some changes, that we can do some good.”
Too bad he won’t be pushing for an NFL that includes Kaepernick.

Dozens of central banks cutting rates

Texto completo: More than 30 central banks around the world have cut interest rates this year, as countries move to shore up their economies amid rising concerns over global growth, trade conflicts and the threat of a messy Brexit.
Last week alone, India, Thailand and New Zealand unexpectedly lowered rates or cut by more than expected. Mexico on Thursday surprised some economists by cutting its key lending rare for the first time since 2014. And as President Donald Trump admonishes the Federal Reserve to continue dropping its benchmark interest rate, many of the world's largest economies have also begun reducing borrowing costs or are considering doing so.
The moves collectively end an era when major central banks hoped, and in some cases tried, to return low rates and large balance sheets - hallmarks of recovery efforts after the Great Recession - back to normal levels.
Now policymakers are reorienting their efforts toward steeling their economies against recession risks. The last time so many of the world's major economies cut rates or considered stimulus in unison was during the financial crisis, according to data from Refinitiv.
Traditionally, central bankers have cut rates or bought bonds to stoke spending and borrowing at home. But in many places inflation and interest rates are stuck at historically low levels, so policymakers have less room to encourage lending and spending with cheap money. As a result, rate cuts could increasingly focus on keeping currencies cheap.
A cheaper currency allows a country to export more goods and services while making imports more expensive, in effect helping to prop up domestic prices.
"Increasingly, we may be looking at a world where the exchange rate becomes the objective of monetary policy, of interest rates," said David Woo, head of global interest rates and foreign exchange research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. "There's no growth, there's no inflation, so you can justify it - we're weakening the currency to import inflation."
Central banks have always watched currency levels, and their interest rate moves affect them. But most have avoided explicitly tying monetary decisions to foreign exchange out of fear of being called manipulators, which could bring geopolitical risks.

Former Obama White House counsel 'schemed, falsified, and concealed' facts from investigators: Prosecutors

Texto completo: The prosecution and defense painted starkly different pictures of how Obama White House counsel Greg Craig handled a report involving Ukraine, Paul Manafort, and the media in their opening statements at Craig's trial Thursday.
Craig is charged with misleading investigators about his role in promoting the report at the behest of the Kremlin-linked government in Ukraine regarding the country’s controversial prosecution of former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko over allegations of corruption, in a case spun off from special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.
The charge relates to the Foreign Agents Registration Act, which mandates anyone working on behalf of a foreign government to register with the Department of Justice.
The government's case against Craig focuses on the public relations work performed by the Democratic attorney and the law firm he worked for — Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher, and Flom — for Ukraine in 2012. Manafort, who headed Trump’s campaign in 2016 only to be found guilty of tax and bank fraud and other violations by Mueller, worked alongside right-hand man Rick Gates to assist President Viktor Yanukovych. Skadden and Craig were roped into one of their efforts.
The Democratic attorney maintains it was an independent report.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Molly Gaston told jurors Thursday that Craig “schemed, falsified, and concealed” important facts from the investigators who enforce the foreign agents law in 2013. Gaston said whether Craig was required to register under the law was irrelevant because it’s illegal to lie to investigators.
Defense attorney William Taylor downplayed the allegations, saying this was just about “words” and not about stealing, assault, or bribery. But after opening statements ended and the jury stepped out, Judge Amy Berman Jackson reprimanded Taylor, saying false statements to investigators are crimes. Berman Jackson also warned the defense about hinting at jury nullification — when a jury finds a defendant not guilty because they disagree with the law — and said she didn’t want to hear that argument again.
In open court, the prosecutor said Craig's decisions that led to his prosecution fall into three chapters: those related to the report itself, the public relations rollout of the report, and how he handled being investigated.
Craig initially sought advice about whether he’d need to register under the law if he took the job writing the report, since he didn’t want to register as an agent of Ukraine, Gaston said. A colleague advised him writing a report would be fine, but doing public relations work would not, but Craig “did not follow that advice.”
Gaston also alleged Craig didn't want to register because it could reveal “non-public facts,” including more than $4 million in payments Ukrainian businessman Victor Pinchuk sent to Skadden via Manafort’s account in Cyprus.
Craig was intimately involved in coordinating public relations for the report, Gaston said, going so far as to work with Jonathan Hawker, in public relations at FTI Consulting, as well as Manafort and Gates to promote the report's version of events related to corruption and prosecution of the country's former prime minister — a version the prosecutor said was sympathetic to the pro-Russia government. Gaston said Craig called and emailed a New York Times reporter to offer him the report, ultimately hand-delivering a copy of it to the reporter's home and dropping it in his screen door.
When investigators saw media coverage of the report and the role Skadden played, Gaston said unit chief Heather Hunt questioned Craig on if he should’ve registered. Gaston alleged Craig intentionally concealed the facts the investigators wanted.
Craig's attorney, however, said Craig was not coordinating with the Ukrainian government on the public relations effort, but was instead speaking with the media to allay his fears Ukraine was attempting to whitewash the report. Taylor said Ukraine tried delaying the release of the report, which included some critiques of the way Yanukovych prosecuted Tymoshenko, and Manafort, Gates, and Hawker wanted to put a positive, misleading spin on it through talking points, but Craig wanted no part and worked against those efforts by speaking with journalists.
“He could not trust FTI to tell the truth, so he was even more determined that the New York Times get it right,” Taylor said. “Mr. Craig did not think correcting the ‘fake news’ meant he was working for Ukraine.”
Taylor said Hawker, who recently retroactively registered under FARA, would likely be a witness "with an arm’s length relationship with the truth" and said Gates has already been convicted for lying.
Craig never knowingly misled or deceived the investigators about his contacts with the media, Taylor said.
Witnesses for the prosecution also began testifying Thursday. The case is expected to last approximately two weeks, and Craig faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine if convicted.
Skadden settled with the federal government in January following a FARA investigation and relinquished $4.6 million — the same amount the company was paid by Ukraine for its report.

Texto completo: The sudden death of accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein in a Manhattan detention center has been ruled a suicide by hanging, according to New York's chief medical examiner.
The much anticipated determination, issued by Dr. Barbara Sampson, refutes a wave of conspiracy theories that have been building since the disgraced financier was found unresponsive at Manhattan's Metropolitan Correctional Center last week.
"After careful review of all investigative information, including complete autopsy findings, the determination on the death of Jeffrey Epstein" is that he committed suicide by hanging, Sampson wrote.
At the time of his death, Epstein, 66, was awaiting trial following last month's indictment on charges of sex trafficking and sex-trafficking conspiracy.
Federal prosecutors alleged that Epstein "sexually exploited and abused dozens of minor girls at his homes" in Manhattan and Palm Beach, Florida, and at other locations from 2002-2005.
He was found "unresponsive in his cell" early Saturday at the federal detention in Manhattan and transported to nearby New York Presbyterian-Lower Manhattan Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.
Lawyers for Epstein issued a statement Friday saying they were dissatisfied with the medical examiner’s conclusions.
Attorneys Martin Weinberg, Reid Weingarten and Michael Miller said it is “indisputable that the authorities violated their own protocols” and they plan conduct their own independent investigation.
Epstein's death is now the subject of at least three federal investigations, involving the FBI, the Justice Department's inspector general and the Bureau of Prisons.
Among the areas of focus, authorities have been examining whether guards assigned to Epstein's unit may have slept through checks on the prisoner's cell in the hours before he was found dead, a person familiar with the matter said.
The review of the guards' conduct also will include whether they appropriately accounted for their time on duty, said the person who is not authorized to comment publicly.
Prison union officials have long warned that officer fatigue, caused by staffing deficits and frequent overtime duties, compromised security at the Manhattan facility. Serene Gregg, local president of the prison workers' union, has said that there are more than 30 staffing vacancies at the facility and that prison officials have regularly deployed civilian staffers to work guard duty to plug unfilled officer positions.
Ten of 18 staffers who reported for duty Saturday on the midnight-to-8 a. m. shift, were working overtime, according to the Justice official, relating information provided by federal prison authorities. The official spoke on condition of anonymity. Guards discovered an unresponsive Epstein shortly after 6:30 a. m.
On the previous shift, Friday's 4 p. m. -to-midnight rotation, six of the 20 staffers were working overtime.
Earlier this week, Attorney General William Barr temporarily reassigned the warden at the New York detention center, and prison officials placed two staffers on administrative leave. One of those staffers, according to the person familiar with the investigation, had worked multiple overtime shifts before reporting to duty on Epstein's unit.
Epstein's death set off a wave of recriminations from his accusers, lawmakers and the attorney general who referred to the discovery of "serious irregularities" at the federal detention center.
"We will get to the bottom of what happened, and there will be accountability," Barr said. “Let me assure you that this case will continue on against anyone who was complicit with Epstein. "
After the Washington Post reported Thursday that the autopsy found multiple broken bones in Epstein's neck, speculation accelerated that the fractures may indicate that Epstein could have died by strangulation.
Just three weeks before he died, Epstein had been found in his jail cell semiconscious with bruises on his neck that prompted authorities to put him on suicide watch. His removal from suicide monitoring just days later also has drawn investigative interest.
A Justice official said Friday that investigators also have encountered difficulties assembling a timeline leading to Epstein death, citing limited access to prison workers officials who have retained counsel.
At the time of his death, Epstein was being held in the same lower Manhattan jail that previously held infamous criminals such as Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzman.
Multiple jail suicide experts have told USA TODAY that an inmate can only be removed from suicide watch if a licensed mental health professional finds them to no longer be at risk for attempting suicide.
“When removing such a high risk individual from suicide watch it would be critical to do it in a step-down fashion so that there is still some extra monitoring on the high-risk individual," said Lisa Boesky, a clinical psychologist and jail suicide expert from San Diego, California.
But Boesky said Epstein was still "a high risk for suicide" because of the nature of his crimes, the humiliation he is experiencing and the recent reported suicide attempt. "This would increase his risk for suicide significantly. ”

Trump’s policy on China: incoherent, values-free

Resumen: [...]it should not surprise us that as Xi tries to put down pro-democracy forces in Hong Kong, Trump was ready to employ "the language used by Communist Party officials," as The New York Times put it, in saying on Aug. 1 that Hong Kong has had "riots for a long period of time. When it came to trade negotiations, Trump blustered about imposing new tariffs on Chinese goods, sent the stock market into a tailspin, and then backed off from many of the tariffs, "just in case they might have an impact on people." What’s maddening about Trump’s approach at a practical level is that many nations, including the United States’ traditional democratic allies, see China as a bad actor tearing up trade rules not to its liking and regularly violating intellectual property rights.

Texto completo: A concern for human rights and democracy has often been seen as an add-on to our country’s foreign policy, an attractive veneer over the usual realpolitik. But President Donald Trump is demonstrating that a supposedly "America First" policy focused entirely on trade and divorced from a commitment to our values is incoherent.
Trump is embarrassing our country — and weakening it, too — by refusing to stand with the people of Hong Kong as they struggle against China’s dictatorship.
We have long wondered when the thoughtless chaos of Trump’s presidency would finally catch up with him and endanger our country. How long could an administration that replaces policy with impulse and thinking with tweeting stay out of crisis? The disarray around Trump’s China policy and the economic turmoil it has unleashed tell us that moment is now.
Somehow, Trump seemed to think that he could be tough on China and still express his admiration for President Xi Jinping’s brutally authoritarian rule.
"He’s now president for life. President for life. And he’s great," Trump told Republican donors at a fundraising event at his Mar-a-Lago estate in early 2018. "And look, he was able to do that. I think it’s great. Maybe we’ll give that a shot some day."
So it should not surprise us that as Xi tries to put down pro-democracy forces in Hong Kong, Trump was ready to employ "the language used by Communist Party officials," as The New York Times put it, in saying on Aug. 1 that Hong Kong has had "riots for a long period of time."
"Somebody said that at some point they’re going to want to stop that," Trump added. "But that’s between Hong Kong and that’s between China, because Hong Kong is a part of China." Translation: Do what you have to do, China.
Trump underscored his indifference to democracy Tuesday on Twitter. Responding to Chinese troops gathering at the Hong Kong border, he said only: "Everyone should be calm and safe!"
This reaction is scandalous from the leader of a nation whose Constitution begins with the words: "We the People." When it came to trade negotiations, Trump blustered about imposing new tariffs on Chinese goods, sent the stock market into a tailspin, and then backed off from many of the tariffs, "just in case they might have an impact on people."
But Trump’s correction-on-the-fly may not be able to undo the damage he (and Xi) have done to the world economy. The stock market’s dive on Wednesday reflected recession fears gripping investors. Unsurprisingly, Trump’s about-face seemed motivated not by any grand strategy but by a purely selfish concern for his own re-election. "Nobody wants to run for president, on either party, in the middle of a recession," Tom Donohue, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce CEO, told CNBC.
What’s maddening about Trump’s approach at a practical level is that many nations, including the United States’ traditional democratic allies, see China as a bad actor tearing up trade rules not to its liking and regularly violating intellectual property rights. But rather than going about the patient work of building support for what should be a broad and united front against China’s abuses, Trump’s erratic approach is making it easier for China to cast the U.S. as the heavy. This does not put the interests of America first.
And Trump’s affection for dictatorships is squandering the high ground our country has historically been able to occupy, even in the face of our imperfections and inconsistencies. Championing democracy is not simply the right thing to do. It is a strategic asset. It is also in our national interest at a time when democracy is under challenge from both China and Russia and faces nationalist threats in countries whose free institutions once seemed secure.
Our president has already done grave damage to our nation’s domestic fabric by dividing us against each other, provoking both racism and nativism, and seeking to delegitimize all who stand against him. Now, his nihilism is wreaking havoc on our economy and around the world. This is the place where a slapdash, value-free approach to governing was bound to lead us.

Texto completo: MANCHESTER, N.H. - President Trump told a packed crowd here Thursday night that supporters and critics alike must vote for him in 2020 because otherwise they'd see their personal finances depleted.
"The bottom line is, I know you like me, this is a love fest, but you have no choice but to vote for me because your 401(k)'s down the tubes. Everything is going to be down the tubes," Trump said. "So whether you love me or hate me, you've got to vote for me."
This reelection pitch mirrors what many of his campaign advisers say: Trump can win suburban voters and others who are skeptical of his personal style as long as the economy stays strong.
Trump's defense of his economic record comes amid signs in recent days of a possible downturn, which would complicate Trump's message over the next 15 months.
An unusual development in the bond market called an "inverted yield curve" created concern that another economic recession may follow. The U.S. Treasury is paying investors more to take out short-term bonds, rather than longer-term ones, which suggests investors are losing faith in the long-term prospects for the economy.
Trump seemed particularly attuned to concerns about his handling of the economy, including his decision to impose tariffs on China. He falsely said that action has resulted in billions of dollars coming in from China and that American farmers are the "biggest beneficiaries."
"I never said China was going to be easy," he said, contradicting his 2018 assertion that "trade wars are good and easy to win."
The stemwinder included a jeremiad against windmills, praise for campaign manager Brad Parscale for being so tall and a long riff on Hillary Clinton's email practices, resulting in a brief "lock her up" chant.
He told the crowd that NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg loved him, discussed personnel issues in the Washington bureau of the New York Times and mocked a protester's weight.
He also lavished praise on his former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, who is considering a run for Senate against Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), but did not endorse or call Lewandowski onstage as some thought he might.
"I think he'd be tough to beat. I'll tell you he'd go to Washington and have you in mind," Trump said.
Trump did not mention Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's decision to ban Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) from visiting the country - which dominated headlines throughout the day - though he spoke briefly about his administration's support for Israel. He mentioned Omar by name twice but quickly moved on to other subjects without drawing any reaction beyond a few boos.
Trump's biggest applause line of the night came when he echoed the National Rifle Association's argument that "it's not the gun that pulls the trigger, it's the person holding the gun," less than two weeks after back-to-back mass shootings in Texas and Ohio. Trump returned to the Republican position that the best way to solve the issue of gun violence in the country is through mental health and not stricter gun control, backing off a robust endorsement of enhanced background checks for firearm purchases.
New Hampshire catapulted Trump's candidacy after he dominated the Republican field in the 2016 primary contest. He then lost the state in the general election to Hillary Clinton by less than one-half of a percentage point.
Trump's would-be Democratic challengers have been campaigning in the state for months. His return to the state for only the second time as president is evidence of how competitive its four electoral college votes will be come November 2020.
Trump's job approval among New Hampshire residents has remained consistent over the past year, with 53 percent disapproving and 42 percent approving, according to a University of New Hampshire survey released this week.

Texto completo: Lake County State’s Attorney Mike Nerheim announced a lawsuit Tuesday against e-cigarette manufacturer Juul Labs, contending the company "intentionally created addicted teen customers to continuously come back looking for another fix." The merits of the specific case against Juul will be sorted out in court, but there is a broader reach to the alarm bells that Nerheim is sounding. In short, teen vaping is here, it’s dangerous and it poses the threat of a broad epidemic.
Illinois lawmakers recognized that truth when they included e-cigarettes in a new law that prohibits the sale of tobacco and tobacco-related products to anyone under 21 years old. Juul, it is worth pointing out, has launched major ad campaigns with some of the nation’s largest print and online news organizations declaring its support for such restrictions on the sale of vapor products.
The sincerity of Juul’s appeal may be open to question, but there’s no room for doubt that it and Illinois’ new regulations are running several steps behind the e-cigarette monster that is rampaging through suburban middle and high schools.
At a news conference announcing the lawsuit, Stevenson High School senior Vrushali Thakkar described classrooms in which students use e-cigarettes when teachers leave the room. A New York Times story this week reports the son of an anti-e-cigarette activist describing the flavors he and his friends prefer and the appeal to some kids of products whose higher nicotine content provide "a bigger head rush."
But, evidence isn’t merely anecdotal. The National Institute on Drug Abuse cites studies showing that more than 16% of high school seniors — and nearly 10% of eighth-graders have used e-cigarettes in the past month. Another National Institutes of Health survey found that about 37% of high school seniors reported vaping in 2018. The figure was 28% a year earlier.
While vape companies like to declare that their product is intended only to help people stop smoking, they may be working toward the precise opposite. The NIH report points to studies showing that nearly 31 percent of students who vape graduate to traditional cigarettes and tobacco products within six months.
According to The New York Times, Trump administration health officials recognize the problem and are considering counter measures. The outgoing FDA commissioner proposed isolating e-cigarette products at retailers where they won’t be accessible to teenagers and requiring merchants to demand purchasers show identification.
If adopted, such measures may be a start. But the situation also requires a broader societal response. Nerheim predicted Tuesday that "it will take years" to overcome the impact e-cigarettes have made on the present generation of teenagers. That is not going to happen merely by punishing companies that have made impressionable children think it’s harmless and cool to use their dangerous product. It also requires broad recognition by all of us of the need to make them realize that neither of those things is true.

Sandmann v. Washington Post: Discomfort is not libel

Texto completo: Welcome to Journalism 101, class.
Today's lessons come from the court ruling in Sandmann v. Washington Post on July 26, when a federal judge dismissed a young man's libel claim against a big newspaper. As a journalism professor and author on libel, I see important principles in the Sandmann case:
Truth seeking is a primary mission of journalism News reporting inspires debate. When reporting veers to malicious falsehood, that's libel. Reporting controversy does not constitute libel.
Nicholas Sandmann, a private citizen and student at Covington Catholic High School, was unwittingly catapulted into the fray amid angry politics that divide our nation.
He and his family – understandably – were upset by the glare of global attention. They sued for a quarter-billion dollars, the purchase price of The Washington Post in 2013.
Discomfort is not libel.
News evolves
News reports (video, photos and text) showed young Sandmann in a red MAGA ("Make America Great Again") hat, face-to-face with Native American elder Nathan Phillips on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., in January. Twitter exploded with viral videos with what appeared to be a confrontational moment between the two.
As the story evolved, journalists updated reports on the event in an era of heated us-versus-them politics and the 24-hour news cycle. Expanding their reporting, as more cell-phone video was released by onlookers, journalists informed us that a group of Black Hebrew Israelites was shouting slurs at Sandmann and other students in the moments before the initial viral video. His intent was to calm the situation, not to confront, he said.
More information, which may add to or revise meaning, does not constitute libel.
Opinions are protected speech "Few principles of law," said the federal judge in the Sandmann case (William O. Bertelsman), "are as well-established as the rule that statements of opinion are not actionable in libel actions."
Interestingly, Judge Bertelsman cited case law from Ohio to support his recent ruling that statements of opinion relating to matters of public concern are protected by the First Amendment (Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Company, 1990).
In the Sandmann case, the judge accepted Sandmann's statement that, when he was standing motionless in the confrontation with Phillips, his intent was to calm the situation and not to impede or block anyone.
"However, Phillips did not see it that way. He concluded that he was being 'blocked' and ... passed these conclusions on to The Post." The judge said the newspaper is not liable for publishing these opinions.
The big picture: protection of unpopular speech One of the toughest assignments of the First Amendment is to protect unpopular speech, even hate speech. Our Constitution protects the right of Americans to chant "send her back" at a Trump rally, a hateful shout aimed at Congresswoman Ilban Omar (D-MN).
Meanwhile, the Southern Poverty Law Center reports an increase, for the fourth straight year, in the number of hate groups operating across the country.
As we protect speech – even expression we may find abhorrent – we certainly must not undermine the free press.
America's standard for protecting free press and its search for truth was established by the Supreme Court in Sullivan v. New York Times (1964). It safeguards the free press from libel abuse, a vital protection for reporting on the civil rights movement, Watergate, and Vietnam.
Today, some want to undermine Sullivan, to erode protection of the free press. As we consider the big picture, let's remember Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis' time-honored advice that the answer to bad speech is more speech, not "enforced silence."
Class dismissed.

Texto completo: U.S. Rep. Steve King told the Westside Conservative Club on Wednesday that humanity might not exist if not for rape and incest throughout human history.
"What if we went back through all the family trees and just pulled out anyone who was a product of rape or incest? Would there be any population of the world left if we did that?" he said in Urbandale, Iowa. "Considering all the wars and all the rapes and pillages that happened throughout all these different nations, I know that I can't say that I was not a part of a product of that."
The Kiron Republican was discussing his defense of not allowing exceptions for rape and incest in the anti-abortion legislation he tried to pass in Congress. Republican leadership had prevented bills he sponsored on banning abortions from advancing through the House, despite GOP support for the measures, King said.
Just because a conception happened in bad circumstances doesn't mean the result isn't a person, King, who is Catholic, argued. "It's not the baby's fault for the sin of the father, or of the mother," he said.
King went over his positions on abortion and a variety of other issues, including immigration, guns and more, when he talked to a group of 50 people at the Machine Shed in Urbandale at a breakfast meeting.
He also discussed the criticism he faced over a New York Times quote on white nationalism and white supremacy in January. He said he was told by political insiders that there was a plot to take him out of power.
He cited state Sen. Randy Feenstra's Jan. 9 campaign announcement, a day before the Times quoted King saying "white nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?"
"People think it was an organic media feeding frenzy, but no, it was orchestrated from the beginning," he said Wednesday. "They had told me, 'Heads up before Christmas: They're going to try to drive you out of office and get you to resign.' Within 24 hours, you had people saying 'resign, resign, resign.' Why? Because the New York Times misquoted me?"
King said there was a plan for President Donald Trump to criticize him as well, but he met with Trump and said there's "no signal from Donald Trump that he's anything other than supportive of me."
That didn't stop other members of his party from coming after him, he said. Multiple high-level Republicans decried King's comments in January and others have publicly supported Feenstra's primary bid.
While he does not support the "odious ideology" of white nationalism, King said he supports his defense of the West, calling the United States "the flagship for Western civilization."
Some Westside Conservative Club members, like Rick Herron, a 72-year-old Clive resident, said they liked what King had to say. Herron said he has been a supporter of King's policies in the past, but was glad to get the chance to hear the "white nationalism" controversy story from his perspective.
"I did get a little better understanding of what he went through, in terms of the 'Never Trumpers' attack on him and setting him up for condemnation," Herron said. "You expect the Democrats to attack him, but not the Never Trumpers — members of his own party."

"It's not the baby's fault for the sin of the father, or of the mother," said U.S. Rep. Steve King, R-Kiron, addressing the Westside Conservative Club on Wednesday at The Machine Shed in Urbandale.

Texto completo: Lamont to name new UConn board chair
Gov. Ned Lamont will name a new chairman of the UConn Board of Trustees by Sept. 1, a top aide to the Democratic governor said Wednesday.
The governor's pick, whose name was not released, does not currently serve on the board, said Paul Mounds, Lamont's chief operating officer and the administration's liaison to the UConn board.
"It's going to be someone who understands the full fabric of this institution," Mounds said. "Just because the individual ... doesn't currently serve on the board of trustees it doesn't mean the individual would not have a previous relationship with the university."
Thomas Kruger, the previous chairman, resigned in April after Lamont made it clear he was seeking a new direction for the board. Also departing from the board was Dennis Nayden, a long-serving trustee who backed Lamont's Republican opponent in the 2018 gubernatorial race.
The board's vice chairman, former state House Speaker Thomas D. Ritter, has been serving as interim chairman.

Murphy, Trump talk guns
President Donald Trump said Tuesday he had a "very good conversation" with U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy on the issue of legislation to strengthen background checks on gun sales.
The development comes as Democrats in Congress are pressing for a vote on gun legislation in the wake of the recent mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayon, Ohio, that left 31 dead and dozens more wounded.
Murphy, D-Conn., has been one of the most outspoken proponents in the Senate of tougher gun laws. Elected to the chamber a month before the Dec. 12, 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, he has taken a lead role in the gun control debate and staged a near-15 hour filibuster in 2016 to force a vote on two gun measures that ultimately failed.
"I've spoken to [Trump] as well as [U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W Va.] and [U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa.] over the past several days re our background checks bill," Murphy said in a tweet. "We continue to work to find common ground, but as I told the President, we can't get a bill if he and the GOP give the gun lobby veto power."
What remains to be seen is whether Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., will entertain a vote on background checks in the Senate. He has resisted calls to force lawmakers to return early from their August recess to vote on the issue but said a vote could happen in the fall.
"I am convinced that Mitch wants to do something," Trump said Tuesday. "I've spoken to Mitch McConnell. He's a good man. He wants to do something. He wants to do it, I think, very strongly. He wants to do background checks, and I do too, and I think a lot of Republicans do. I don't know, frankly, that the Democrats will get us there."
The New York Times said a telephone call between Trump and Murphy took place Sunday.
"The conversation was positive, with Mr. Trump indicating that he was serious about persuading Republicans to act, according to officials familiar with their discussion," the newspaper reported. "And the two agreed to set up a staff-level dialogue this week between their offices and those of [Toomey] and [Manchin], who are working feverishly to revive the background check legislation they wrote after the Sandy Hook massacre."
Murphy took part in a roundtable discussion on gun legislation with Trump in 2018 after the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., but nothing significant came of the event.

The California model for lifting workers

Texto completo: In many ways, American workers have been taking it on the chin. The federal minimum wage hasn't increased in a decade. Millions of workers don't receive paid sick days or paid parental leave, while companies increasingly force employees to work unpredictable schedules that change from week to week, creating havoc in workers' lives. The Trump administration has rolled back a regulation extending overtime protections to millions more workers and made it harder for Uber and Lyft drivers and gig workers in general to receive basic worker protections.
In an era when workers are in many ways moving backward, California -- and various cities and groups in the state -- has vigorously pursued a counter-strategy that might even be called a pro-worker resistance. California has led the way in embracing strategies that have lifted workers even as -- or perhaps because -- Washington has done so little. And some of these pro-worker efforts, adopted in the last few years, have proven to be durable and effective, and could be models for rebuilding worker power in other regions of the country.
This is particularly true for partnerships between labor and the environmental movement. Elsewhere in the country, union leaders and environmental groups have often clashed over the proposed Green New Deal. Some unions complain that the green push to slash use of fossil fuels (for instance, by shutting down coal- and gas-fired power plants) will destroy many good-paying union jobs.

But the Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy, or LAANE, for example, has built an unusual labor-environmental partnership that has made important strides in improving the environment while increasing workers' pay and economic security.
Working closely with the Natural Resources Defense Council, LAANE brought unions, environmentalists and community groups together to develop a plan that has greatly reduced air pollution at the nation's largest seaport, the combined Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. Not only did this effort bring in a new generation of trucks that polluted far less, but it raised port truck drivers' pay and helped unionize hundreds of port drivers. This plan had Teamsters working hand in hand with green activists.
Similarly, LAANE, which was founded by a group of unions to be an incubator of pro-worker ideas, helped forge a coalition that played a pivotal role in revamping L.A.'s waste-hauling. This effort -- which involved dividing the city into 11 zones and awarding a franchise in each zone to one waste-hauling company through competitive bidding -- has increased recycling, reduced the number of polluting garbage trucks on L.A.'s streets, and improved pay and conditions for many waste-hauling and recycling workers.
While worker advocates cheered the plan, many waste-hauling companies that didn't win franchises criticized it bitterly. Some businesses and homeowners said they were paying more for garbage pickups. And there was a deluge of complaints about missed pickups when the program rolled out in 2017, as well as lawsuits brought by commercial customers.
After the troubled start, the program's performance improved with some adjustments, and many environmentalists and worker advocates praise its achievements. "LAANE's an inspiration for us," Matt Ryan, executive director of the Alliance for a Greater New York, a labor-environmental group, told me. "They're proof that you can change an economy, lift workers, and improve the environment at the local level."
LAANE has also worked with the electrical workers' union to expand apprenticeship programs for installing solar panels and making homes and office buildings more energy-efficient. With Mayor Eric Garcetti vowing to shut three gas-fired power plants, LAANE hopes to work with unions to ensure a "just transition" plan to find good-paying jobs for the laid-off workers and retrain them, if necessary. In these ways, LAANE is a model for other groups -- and states -- on how worker advocates and environmentalists can cooperate rather than cross swords.
On another front, LAANE persuaded L.A.'s City Council to enact a $15.37 minimum wage in 2014 for the city's hotel workers, leapfrogging the Fight for $15. While workers cheered, the hotel industry warned that the $15.37 wage would cripple new hotel construction in L.A. Industry advocates say a few hotels have been built in Glendale, rather than in L.A., to skirt the wage law, but supporters of that wage say the industry's dire predictions were overblown. In 2017, two years after the $15.37 wage took effect, 19 hotels with 3,880 rooms opened in Los Angeles County, with at least 5,000 new hotel rooms planned for downtown L.A.
There have been other trailblazing pro-worker developments in California, which was one of the first states to enact a $15 minimum wage. San Francisco was the first city to enact a fair scheduling law to make working life less unpredictable for retail workers. Emeryville, a town in the Bay Area, enacted the nation's highest minimum wage: $16.30 an hour. (Some businesses and economists argue that such moves result in fewer jobs, but a new UC Berkeley study released in July found that lifting the minimum wage to $15 doesn't reduce jobs.)
In Sacramento, lawmakers are pushing to enact a law that would make Uber and Lyft drivers employees, instead of independent contractors, making it easier for them to unionize and obtain basic worker protections like workers' compensation and unemployment insurance. And Jobs to Move America, a nonprofit based in L.A., has pioneered ways to get cities to use their public transit spending to pressure Japanese and Chinese companies to build bus and train factories in the U.S.
States can serve as laboratories of democracy, as Justice Louis Brandeis once suggested. It's fitting that California, as the most populous state, has become the biggest laboratory in developing new ideas to lift up workers. The 49 other states have a lot to learn from California.

Prison deaths all too normal

Texto completo: If only it took some dark conspiracy for a federal inmate like Jeffrey Epstein — or any inmate — to kill himself while in custody.
The news that the financier and sex offender accused of abusing scores of underage girls apparently committed suicide in a New York detention facility last week set off a frenzy of wild speculation. The high-profile detainee claimed to have damaging information on powerful men of all political persuasions. President Trump, the conspiracist-in-chief who was himself a friend of Epstein, helped spread the baseless accusation that the Clintons were responsible for silencing Epstein forever.
His death must have been engineered by somebody, proclaimed the Twitter sleuths. Otherwise, how could Epstein, who had already attempted suicide once, have died?
All too easily, comes the reply from anybody who has spent time working in this country's prisons, and especially its jails. There, inmates die all too often, not from some nefarious scheme, but of neglect — intentional and otherwise.
Mundane factors like understaffing, indifference, and lousy training can be deadly in their own way. The pretrial detention facility in which Epstein was held was well known for its overcrowded, inhumane conditions, including grave medical neglect. It was one of many federal prisons which were so chronically understaffed that teachers and secretaries were pressed into service as correctional officers, according to The New York Times.
One such substitute was tasked with guarding Epstein, who had been taken off suicide watch, on the night he died. Another officer was working his fifth straight overtime shift. Neither checked on Epstein for a three-hour period, even though they should have been looking in on him every 30 minutes. After they discovered he had hanged himself, they reportedly falsified records to cover up their inattention.
It's a familiar scenario to advocates like Leslie Walker of Prisoners Legal Services of Massachusetts. According to the New England Center for Investigative reporting, four inmates killed themselves in this state's prisons in 2018, and three committed suicide in county jails. Over the years, Walker and her colleagues have seen plenty of cases where inmates have committed suicide after corrections officers have skipped rounds.
“It's not infrequent to have the logs tampered with, or not filled out, or the log books look fine but the cameras reveal an officer has never left his or her desk," she said. Prisoners can figure out pretty quickly if and when they'll have an opportunity to take their own lives.
She worries that the attorney general's investigation of a prison he himself oversees will end with the firing of the corrections officers who failed to do their jobs, and nothing more.
“Heads will roll, problem solved," Walker said. “It's a very quick and dirty way to make sure a systemic problem is not brought to light."
Nothing trains the attention of an indifferent public on the shortcomings of our prisons like the death of an infamous inmate: Epstein; or former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez, who killed himself at Souza Baranowski Correctional Center in Shirley in 2017; or James “Whitey" Bulger, who was murdered last year after being transferred to a notoriously violent federal facility in West Virginia.
Likewise, few ordinary people were focused on the abysmal state of prison medical care until the revelation that former House speaker Sal DiMasi's cancer went undiagnosed for six months as he served a federal corruption sentence.
Still, infamy only goes so far: DiMasi's trials clearly did little to improve conditions in federal prisons. And it's unlikely the death of the detestable Epstein will do much to change them either.
What ails our corrections system is too mundane, too difficult to fix, to hold our attention for long — especially when we could enjoy a juicy conspiracy theory instead.

Texto completo: They were born nearly four years and a few neighborhoods apart in Brooklyn, N.Y., and became writers together — though at first only his was the name on the cover of sports books whose writing quality owed much to her careful editing.
Myrna Katz Frommer and Harvey Frommer left their New York City upbringing for the Long Island suburbs before moving 23 years ago to Lyme, N.H., where they remained the rest of their lives, co-teaching an oral history class at Dartmouth College and often writing books together.
Yet despite the distance from their childhoods, “Brooklyn stays with you — that special time, that special place," they wrote in “It Happened in Brooklyn," one of the oral histories they coauthored. “It keeps coming back like a song."
Harvey and Myrna Frommer died a week apart, almost to the hour — he on Aug. 1 of metastatic lung cancer, she on Aug. 8 of complications from Alzheimer's disease. He was 83, she was 80.
The more prolific author of the two, Harvey Frommer was a baseball historian, writing or co-writing more than 50 books about topics including the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox, Shoeless Joe Jackson of the Chicago White Sox, Yankee Stadium and Fenway Park, and the Red Sox-Yankees rivalry.
Myrna, like Harvey, taught in high schools, colleges, and at the graduate level, and along with collaborating with him on books, she wrote articles for a variety of publications.
The two also earned doctorates at New York University, where they met working at the college newspaper before marrying in 1960.
“My dad was extremely ahead of his time when it came to women's issues — singlehandedly promoting, advancing, and supporting my mom to get her PhD, encouraging her to publish, and later designing a master's course at Dartmouth where they could both teach together," their daughter, Jennifer Frommer, said in a eulogy at her father's service.
“My mom would often talk about the fact that she wouldn't have any professional life if not for my father — that she credited him for her professional successes — her career, which made her very happy," said Jennifer, a senior vice president at Columbia Records in New York. “She called him the 'idea man.' "
Harvey always had ideas aplenty for books, and boundless energy for writing.
“Even at the beach he would have a clipboard with him, with stacks of paper, and he would be writing," said his son Frederic J. Frommer, who collaborated with his father on some books and is head of the sports business practice at Dewey Square Group in Washington, D.C.
“My dad was always working, always hustling, trying to find the next new project," Frederic added in an interview. “In his later months, he was telling me he had this idea for a double biography of Ted Williams and Joe DiMaggio. He was determined to write one more book."
Early on, Myrna entered the family writing business to help refine Harvey's creativity.
“When he started his writing career, she was his incredible editor. She read everything he wrote," Frederic said. “He was cranking out a book a year. Not everything was smooth, and she would polish everything. She was an incredible asset to him all those years."
Harvey's solo books included “A Yankee Century," “Baseball's Greatest Managers," “Remembering Yankee Stadium," and “Remembering Fenway Park." “Red Sox vs. Yankees: The Great Rivalry" was among the books he and Frederic coauthored.
Other oral histories Myrna and Harvey cowrote included “Manhattan at Mid-Century," “It Happened in the Catskills," and “Growing Up Jewish in America."
The oral history books were “my favorite kind of writing," Harvey once wrote in a letter that their other son, Ian Frommer, a mathematics professor at the Coast Guard Academy in New London, Conn., quoted from in his eulogy. Those books, Harvey added in the letter, were the “most intellectually challenging, and working with her is fun."
Harvey Frommer was born Oct. 10, 1935, the son of Max Frommer, a cab driver, and Fannie Wechsler, a homemaker, and grew up in Brooklyn's Williamsburg neighborhood.
Myrna Katz was born March 29, 1939, and grew up in Brooklyn's Bensonhurst section, a daughter of Gertrude Bernstein, a homemaker, and Abraham Katz, a furrier — both Russian immigrants.
Myrna and Harvey went to New York University as undergraduate and graduate students. He finished with a bachelor's degree, master's, and doctorate, she with a bachelor's and a doctorate.
No matter where they lived, no matter where they worked, no matter what they wrote, “they were both Brooklyn kids, through and through," Frederic said. “They always had that Brooklyn vibe, that Brooklyn sensibility, that Brooklyn accent."
Harvey, however, broke ranks with the borough and the Brooklyn Dodgers to become a lifelong St. Louis Cardinals fan, in part to emulate Stan Musial, the team's star through his youth.
“Even when he got sick, he would talk about the fate of his own cancer and the fate of the Cardinals almost with the same level of anxiety," Frederic added.
Though baseball had been a passion since boyhood for Harvey, his marriage helped guide him toward a career writing about the sport. “My mom's side was much more intellectual and valued the written word more," Frederic said. “My mom's side really rubbed off on my dad."
After a stint as a sportswriter in Chicago for a wire service, Harvey served in the Army National Guard. He taught at a high school and at City University of New York while he and Myrna raised their children on Long Island.
Myrna was a high school teacher, a book editor, and college teacher before they moved to New Hampshire and began teaching at Dartmouth.
“My dad was an iconoclast, a rebel, an outlaw, and a storyteller," Jennifer said in her eulogy.
Harvey once recalled that along with the usual grades, as a teacher, he sometimes handed out “other ones, like 'C+ -.' What the heck did that mean?" Ian said in his eulogy. “Or my favorite, 'F+++.' Did that mean you failed but in a great way?"
In the introduction to “New York City Baseball: The Golden Age, 1947-1957," Harvey spoke of the many interviews he conducted for that book — his seventh.
“I did not know it then, but I was working as the oral historian I would become, disguised even to myself," he wrote. “And the great strength of 'New York City Baseball' and many of the other books I have created rests on the oral history, the multitude of voices and memories I was able to reach and record."
In addition to their three children, Harvey and Myrna leave her sister, Caroline Katz-Mount of Jersey City, N.J., and six grandchildren.
A service has been held for Harvey, and private services will be held for Myrna.
Memory played a starring role in all their books, from co-written oral histories, such as “It Happened on Broadway," to oral histories Harvey penned alone, such as “Where Have All Our Red Sox Gone?"
Myrna also appraised the insistent tug of memories in a 1979 essay for The New York Times, when the family moved to a larger suburban home. She considered herself “ruthless" when ridding their house of items ideal for garage sales, but she lingered over courtship letters to and from Harvey and their children's school papers.
“They will all go on with me from this house to the next, the very baggage of myself," Myrna wrote.
“From every corner of a house well lived in come the treasures of our day," she added. “Wrapped in tissue paper and enclosed in cardboard, the most amorphous and most permanent thing of all — the time of our lives — is ready to come along to a new address."

Texto completo: A New York woman who said Jeffrey Epstein groomed her for sex starting when she was 14 and then raped her a year later sued his estate on Wednesday, one of many possible lawsuits that his estate may face after his death by an apparent suicide.
While Mr. Epstein's recent death ended a federal criminal prosecution on child sex trafficking charges, his estate may still have to defend against civil suits. He was believed to have been worth at least $ 500 million.
Other women who have said they were victimized by Mr. Epstein said they planned to file lawsuits, and a new state law in New York that expands the amount of time that some sexual abuse victims can sue could open the door to more claims.
Mr. Epstein, 66, died Saturday after he hanged himself in a Manhattan federal jail where he had been held since his arrest in early July, authorities said.
In her lawsuit filed Wednesday, Jennifer Araoz said she was recruited by an unnamed woman outside her Manhattan high school in 2001 before meeting Mr. Epstein and giving him erotic massages once or twice a week in his Upper East Side townhouse.
In 2002, Mr. Epstein raped her during a massage, according to the lawsuit. She did not visit his townhouse again, she said.
His lawyers did not respond to requests for comment.
Ms. Araoz also sued the women she said helped Mr. Epstein, including Ghislaine Maxwell, Mr. Epstein's longtime confidante and the daughter of Robert Maxwell, a British publishing magnate. They also include three unnamed household staffers, including Mr. Epstein's secretary, his maid and a woman she called "the recruiter."
Dan Kaiser, Ms. Araoz's lawyer, said Mr. Epstein relied on a network of associates to feed him a pipeline of underage girls. While his client did not interact directly with Ms. Maxwell at the townhouse, lawyers included her in the suit because she was "one of the center spokes of this conspiracy."
Ms. Maxwell has been accused by numerous women of recruiting girls and women, instructing them on how to please Mr. Epstein and sometimes participating in sexual acts herself.
Ms. Maxwell's attorneys did not respond to a request for comment. In the past, she has emphatically denied accusations that she participated in sex trafficking or recruited underage girls.
Ms. Araoz, who is now 32, first went public with her allegations in an interview with NBC News last month, after Mr. Epstein was arrested at Teterboro Airport on the federal charges. She appeared to be the first person to sue Mr. Epstein's estate under the New York law passed this year.
The law, called the Child Victims Act, expands the amount of time that prosecutors can file sexual abuse charges and victims can sue for abuse that occurred when they were a minor.
Crucially, the law created a one-year "look-back window," during which claims that had already passed the statute of limitations could be revived. That window opened on Wednesday.
"Death does not end civil liability, death ends criminal liability," said Stephen Gillers, a professor at New York University School of Law. "The person is gone, but their assets remain."
Lisa Bloom, a California-based attorney, said she intended to file a lawsuit against Mr. Epstein's estate in the coming days on behalf of two accusers. She said her two clients were above the age of 18 when Mr. Epstein victimized them in the early 2000s in New York and that they had been communicating with federal investigators. She said the lawsuit would be filed under sex-trafficking statutes, although the statute of limitations may have expired.
Ms. Bloom said she believed she had arguments that the statute of limitations may not apply, and also that the estate may waive the requirement "in the interest of justice."
Several of Mr. Epstein's alleged victims have already filed and settled civil suits against him and his associates.
Ms. Araoz's attorneys said they planned to target Mr. Epstein's assets in this suit, which include his properties in New York, Florida and the United States Virgin Islands.
While it is possible that Mr. Epstein shielded his vast wealth in shell companies, Mr. Kaiser said, the real estate properties are "hard assets that are difficult to hide."
In her lawsuit, Ms. Araoz said she was approached by the unnamed "recruiter" -- whom she described as a brunette -- outside Talent Unlimited High School, where she was a freshman.
Ms. Araoz, who was raised in modest means by a single mother in Queens, said she confided in the woman about the recent death of her father from AIDS. She and the woman met for several weeks before meeting Mr. Epstein in his townhouse, located a few blocks from her school on the Upper East Side, the lawsuit said.
"Ms. Araoz was a prime target for grooming by a pedophile like Mr. Epstein," the suit said.
Ms. Araoz returned to the townhouse alone, where Mr. Epstein gave her a tour of the palatial building, one of the largest private residences in New York.
The lawsuit contained remarkable details about the home: Many rooms had elaborate murals painted on the ceilings, and there was a trophy room filled with exotic animals, including a stuffed giraffe. In Mr. Epstein's master bathroom, prosthetic breasts had been mounted on the wall which he could "look at or play with while in the bathtub," the lawsuit said.
Mr. Epstein led Ms. Araoz to his "favorite room" in the house, a large massage room on an upper floor with a blue ceiling painted with clouds and angels.
Mr. Epstein then asked her to take off her top, began fondling her breasts and asked her to give him a massage. Soon, she was coerced into giving him erotic massages once or twice a week, wearing only her underwear, the lawsuit said.
Mr. Epstein would masturbate and touch her breasts, then flatter and reward Ms. Araoz with $ 300 in cash, according to the lawsuit, which was filed in Manhattan. A maid would leave the money in a drawer in the massage room, according to the lawsuit, and as Mr. Epstein left, he would tell her he had given her something to help her family.
In the fall of 2002, the lawsuit said, Mr. Epstein told her he wanted to try something different. He instructed her to take off her underwear and climb atop him to give him a massage. She initially resisted, but Mr. Epstein told her that he "loved her and cared for her," so she complied. He then raped her, according to the lawsuit.
She did not go to police after the incident. In an opinion piece for The New York Times on Wednesday, she said that for years she did not tell anyone about the abuse because she was intimidated by Mr. Epstein's insistence that she stay silent.
She said she was wracked with shame, and eventually dropped out of high school.
Her lawyers said she had spoken to federal prosecutors who were preparing a case against Mr. Epstein.

Texto completo: Fall for Dance, the annual appetizer sampler of performers and choreographers from around the world, will return to New York City Center in October with four world premieres -- including one by Kyle Abraham for the American Ballet Theater star Misty Copeland -- and appearances by the Mariinsky Ballet and the tap wunderkind Caleb Teicher.
The festival, in its 16th season, is planned for Oct. 1-13, City Center announced on Tuesday. Tickets, only $ 15 and so fast-selling, will be available starting at 11 a.m. on Sept. 8.
Program One, which features Mr. Abraham's new work for Ms. Copeland, will have also appearances by Hubbard Street Dance Chicago and the South African troupe Vuyani Dance Company; Mr. Teicher will unveil "Bzzzz" -- an expansion of "Bzzz," which he presented at last year's Fall for Dance. (Siobhan Burke, reviewing the premiere in The New York Times, called "Bzzz" "rousing, clever, sometimes madcap" and "a music-making triumph.")
The Mark Morris Dance Group opens Program Two, which also features the French company Dyptik and Washington Ballet, as well as Malevo, of Argentina. On Program Three, the storied Mariinsky Ballet will dance the American premiere of Alexander Sergeev's "At the Wrong Time"; the evening's other troupes are the English National Ballet, performing a work by Akram Khan; Skanes Dansteater of Sweden; and Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, presenting a portion of Rennie Harris's "Lazarus," which had its premiere last season.
Merce Cunningham's "Beach Birds" (1991), performed by the French Compagnie CNDC-Angers/Robert Swinston, opens Program Four. Also onboard: Madboots Dance; a world premiere by Sonya Tayeh (fresh off choreographing "Moulin Rouge! The Musical" on Broadway); and Alicia Graf Mack -- the director of dance at the Juilliard School and a former Ailey star -- performing Geoffrey Holder's "Come Sunday," originally created for his wife, Carmen de Lavallade.
Program Five includes appearances by Les Ballets Jazz de Montréal, Monica Bill Barnes & Company and the Martha Graham Dance Company -- in Graham's 1936 work "Chronicle." But the main draw may be the New York City Ballet stars Taylor Stanley and Sara Mearns, a Fall for Dance regular, in a world premiere by Kim Brandstrup.

Texto completo: Public comments
This responds to "Our Say: Gun rights activists have a right to be heard. They just need to quit being jerks" (The Capital, Aug. 13).
Members of the Cliven Bundy-inspired "Patriot" movement won't stop being jerks. But the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force has no intention of stopping public comment. The task force will continue to invite written comments. Information and views already have been received and considered by the task force, and more is welcome. The only question is whether very limited public meeting time should be used to hear input that is oral instead of written.
The GVPTF needs data and evidence to make informed recommendations. That isn't easy to consider when orally presented. Personal opinions or anecdotes are less helpful. While information about the public trust in GVPTF recommendations is important, county residents can be sure that we already know that those who discuss violent overthrow of duly elected representatives will never trust any recommendations.
The Capital claimed that my statements can be inflammatory; I stand by the evidence that toxic masculinity causes many gun violence episodes. World-renowned journalists at the New York Times have concluded that misogyny influences shooters ("A Common Trait Among Mass Killers: Hatred Toward Women").
Children are most often shot in and near their homes, with unsecured guns, by another minor, in crossfire, or during domestic violence incidents. Women and children pay an unacceptable price for infatuation with guns. Military members experience staggering rates of gun suicide, heightened by the expectation that they should return from war without help to navigate their return to civilian life.
Recognizing toxic masculinity is not an indictment of all men. Although men make up most of the perpetrators of gun violence, they also make up most of the victims of this toxicity.
The Gun Violence Prevention Task Force continues to stand ready to welcome public input.

Gun violence
I was pleased to read side-by-side articles on gun violence by leaders of the Democratic and Republican parties in Anne Arundel County (The Capital, Aug. 11)! As a hunter and gun owner, I want to preserve the Second Amendment rights of citizens to own guns.
But, I am appalled by the growing gun violence in America that takes dozens of innocent lives each year, giving us one of the highest rates of gun violence worldwide. We must solve this, even if we have to change our attitudes about gun regulation!
Articles by James Appel of the Republican party and Patrick Armstrong of the Democratic party both made several very good suggestions, including forming a bipartisan working group to develop recommendations to reduce mass gun violence. In fact, for the most effective solutions why not adopt all the proposals in both of their articles!
Cooperation and compromise are needed to solve this. The political parties need to stop accusing, mischaracterizing and villainizing each other. The working group should focus on developing recommendations to solve the gun violence problem, not disparaging each other or its proposals.

Summer concerts
Many thanks to K&B True Value Hardware for being long-time sponsors of the Quiet Waters Park Summer Concert Series. My husband and I attended last Saturday's show featuring the Assisted Living Band, aptly named for their Oldies genre, and they were fabulous.
The evening was delightful (glorious weather didn't hurt), kids and adults were dancing, geezers, like myself, were singing along to all the recognizable tunes - such a wonderful slice of Americana.
Our country could use more family friendly, affordable (free) entertainment like this. So, thanks to local businesses and all who work to make these thoroughly enjoyable evenings a part of our fun-filled summer.

'Gross!': Ilhan Omar links Steve King 'incest' comments to theories about her marriages

Texto completo: Rep. Ilhan Omar weighed in on claims that she married her brother while she criticized Rep. Steve King's comments about rape and incest.
"Gross! This would explain why these weirdos are fixed on smearing me with claims of incest," the Minnesota Democrat tweeted Wednesday. "Projecting their filth, unreal."TweetThe Iowa Republican questioned how much of humanity would exist without conception from rape or incest.
"What if we went back through all the family trees and just pulled out anyone who was a product of rape or incest?" King asked. "Would there be any population of the world left if we did that? Considering all the wars and all the rapes and pillages that happened throughout all these different nations, I know that I can't say that I was not a part of a product of that."
House Republicans pulled King, 70, from all his committee assignments in January after he wistfully mused to the New York Times about how white nationalism and white supremacy had become offensive. Omar, 37, praised the decisions, saying King had "no business" being in Congress.
The freshman congresswoman's reference to the accusations that she married her brother follow media investigations into inconsistencies in the congresswoman's alleged marriage history. Several fact checking groups have found the claims made against Omar are inconclusive. A Politifact investigation said there was no "smoking gun" for claims that she married her brother, but there was "circumstantial evidence that begs for some kind of explanation from a member of Congress."
Omar has been reticent to talk about her marital history, refusing on multiple occasions to respond to inquiries by the Washington Examiner and other news outlets. In fall 2018, before she was elected to Congress, she gave her last significant public statement on her marriage history in an interview with the Associated Press.
Omar called the accusations "disgusting lies" and said that she did not want "to further the narrative" by providing any documentation to prove her side of the story.
Accusations against the congresswoman have continued to dog her after the Minnesota Campaign Finance and Public Disclosure Board revealed in June that she broke federal tax law by filing taxes with a man to whom she was not legally married.
A subsequent investigation by the Washington Examiner into dozens of legal documents suggested Omar lived with her first husband while she was married to her second husband. Some critics, including President Trump, have speculated that the second husband might have been her brother.

Texto completo: During a Wednesday speech to the Westside Conservative Club in Iowa, Rep. Steve King suggested that populations across the globe were rooted in rape, pillaging, and incest, while espousing that no baby should be aborted because of the way they were conceived.
"What if we went back through all the family trees and just pulled out anyone who was a product of rape or incest?" the Iowa congressman asked. "Would there be any population of the world left if we did that? Considering all the wars and all the rapes and pillages that happened throughout all these different nations, I know that I can't say that I was not a part of a product of that."
King, the father of three sons, argued that babies conceived of rape were no less valuable than those conceived intentionally. "It's not the baby's fault for the sin of the father, or of the mother," he said.
A staunchly conservative member of the GOP, King has long been a controversial figure in the U.S. Congress for comments about immigration, race, religion, and abortion.
King was stripped of his House committee assignments in January after he questioned why white supremacy was a bad thing. "White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?" he said to the New York Times.
Shortly after the interview, several top GOP members suggested that King be censured at the very least. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell suggested that King find "another line of work."

King, 70, was slammed for comments made in July 2016 about the contributions made by "nonwhite" people throughout history. "This whole ‘old white people’ business does get a little tired, Charlie," King said to writer Charles Pierce on an MSNBC appearance. "I’d ask you to go back through history and figure out where are these contributions that have been made by these other categories of people that you are talking about? Where did any other subgroup of people contribute more to civilization?"

Just days later, King received further criticism when he said, "The idea of multiculturalism, that every culture is equal — that’s not objectively true … We’ve been fed that information for the past 25 years, and we’re not going to become a greater nation if we continue to do that."
In a 2017 endorsement of controversial Dutch politician Geert Wilders, King said, "Wilders understands that culture and demographics are our destiny. We can't restore our civilization with somebody else's babies."

King later doubled down on his assertion, saying that he "meant exactly what I said." He further stated that populations and culture needed to be carefully cultivated. "You cannot rebuild your civilization with somebody else's babies," King said. "You've got to keep your birth rate up, and that you need to teach your children your values. In doing so, you can grow your population, you can strengthen your culture, and you can strengthen your way of life."
Democratic Iowa Rep. Abby Finkenauer slammed King's remarks as "incredibly cruel & disrespectful to survivors."
"Steve King & his values, his rhetoric, & his disdain for decency is a far cry from the Iowa I know," she said in a tweet. "He doesn’t represent who we are & he continues to be an embarrassment to our state & federal delegation."
Tweet
New York Sen. and Democratic presidential hopeful Kirsten Gillibrand called for King's resignation, tweeting, "You are a disgrace. Resign."
Tweet
In a rare reference to claims that she married her brother, Democratic Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar tweeted about King's comments, saying, "Gross! This would explain why these weirdos are fixed on smearing me with claims of incest. Projecting their filth, unreal."

Desperate for an end to almost 18-year war, US negotiating from position of weakness with Taliban

Texto completo: PLAYING A BAD HAND: If you’re looking for a graphic depiction of what U.S. special representative Zalmay Khalilzad is up against as he tries to bring the Taliban to the peace table with the American-backed Afghan government, the living map maintained by the Foundation for Defense of Democracies’ Long War Journal is a good place to start.
The map, based on open-source information, shows the breakdown of Taliban control by districts and population centers. The data show that half of Afghanistan’s population lives under Taliban controlled or contested districts.
While the Afghan government controls more districts (140) than the Taliban (66), almost half are contested, meaning “the government may be in control of the district center, but little else, and the Taliban controls large areas or all of the areas outside of the district center.”
“Districts have been retaken (by both sides) only to be lost shortly thereafter, largely resulting in the conflict’s current relative stalemate,” write FDD’s Bill Roggio and Alexandra Gutowski. “However, since the U.S. drawdown of peak forces in 2011, the Taliban has unquestionably been resurgent.”
FAILED STRATEGY: The revamped U.S. strategy announced by President Trump two years ago this month was supposed the end the stalemate and convince the Taliban it could not win on the battlefield and had no choice but to sue for peace. “Conditions on the ground — not arbitrary timetables — will guide our strategy from now on,” Trump said on Aug. 21, 2017. “America’s enemies must never know our plans or believe they can wait us out.”
But in telegraphing its desperation for a deal that would allow the withdrawal of thousands of U.S. troops and the effective end of the NATO Resolute Support mission, the Trump administration has given the Taliban the upper hand in the negotiations.
The Taliban is still refusing a key U.S. demand, that it negotiate directly with the Afghan government that it has denounced as an American puppet.
WAR ENTERS ‘A CRITICAL PERIOD’: Anthony Cordesman, the Arleigh Burke chairman in strategy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, is out with a new critical analysis on the state of play in Afghanistan, based on all the recent official reports as well as outside sources.
His sobering assessment: “Afghanistan is a ‘failed state’ whose civil structure is poorly prepared for either peace or for continuing the war. … Afghan politics are both corrupt and deeply divided.” He adds that “there is little prospect that this situation will change.”
“In summary, the official views on the course of the fighting data are mixed, uncertain, and increasingly politicized. They do, however, make it clear that the Taliban remains a major force, and they do raise critical questions about whether the Afghan Government can survive any major cuts in U.S. military aid, train and assist efforts, and combat support if there is no peace settlement," Cordesman said.
ECHOS OF VIETNAM: Cordesman sees eerie parallels to the U.S. efforts to end the Vietnam War under President Richard Nixon’s “peace with honor” policy, arguing that without “some form of continuing U.S. presence, aid, and security guarantees,” the Taliban may take over the country the same way the North took over Vietnam in the 1970s.
“There are far too many similarities to a similar period in the Vietnam War when the ARVN [South Vietnamese Army] at least appeared to be far stronger before a peace settlement — and a U.S. withdrawal — than the ANSF [Afghan National Security Forces] appears to be today.”

HAPPENING TODAY: Operations at Hong Kong's airport are pretty much back to normal after protests that shut down the main terminal for two days. China has moved troops close to the border with Hong Kong, and Chinese troops garrisoned in Hong Kong have so far remained in their barracks but have released a video showing “anti-riot” exercises, and its top brass have warned violence is “absolutely impermissible.”
TRUMP ON HONG KONG: ‘I HOPE IT WORKS OUT’: While there are bipartisan calls in Congress to send a clear message to Beijing to resist the use of force to put down demonstrations in Hong Kong, President Trump is taking a softer tone as he seeks a new trade deal with China.
“Well, the Hong Kong thing is a very tough situation. Very tough. We'll see what happens, but I'm sure it'll work out. I hope it works out for everybody, including China, by the way,” Trump said yesterday. “It's a very tricky situation. I think it'll work out, and I hope it works out for liberty. … I hope it works out peacefully. I hope nobody gets hurt. I hope nobody gets killed.”
CALL FOR A BOYCOTT: Florida Republican Sen. Rick Scott is among those calling for a tougher stance to warn Beijing away from any use of force in Hong Kong, suggesting Americans boycott Chinese products.
“American taxpayers cannot continue to support China’s aggression, and must start supporting American businesses over Chinese products,” said Scott. “This is about protecting human rights.”
“Scott’s call is the latest sign of congressional frustration with China, as lawmakers have threatened to review federal legislation that eases trade relations with Hong Kong if the mainland Chinese government backs an even more brutal crackdown,” writes Joel Gehrke in the Washington Examiner.
A SERIOUS RUPTURE: A military operation against Hong Kong protesters could trigger a rupture in U.S.-China relations that makes the trade war look minor in comparison, warns Arkansas Republican Sen. Tom Cotton.
“If Beijing cracked down on Hong Kong, it would require a fundamental reassessment of our relations with their country, the kind that should have happened after Tiananmen Square,” Cotton said yesterday.
‘WE ARE ALL HONG KONGERS’: Frank Gaffney of the Center for Security Policy thinks Trump should take a page from President John F. Kennedy’s playbook, recalling one of the defining moments of the Cold War.
In June 1963, Kennedy declared in German 'I am a Berliner,” which sent a clear message to the Kremlin.
"America’s bipartisan leadership should declare today that 'We are Hong Kongers.' If combined with a commitment to end the Chinese Communists’ ability to exploit Hong Kong’s Most Favored Nation trade status in the event its autonomy is ended, deterrence may just work again,” said Gaffney in his radio commentary.
UNDER A CLOUD: After President Trump lent a sympathetic ear to companies that complain they were not able to compete fairly for the Pentagon’s $10 billion cloud computing contract, Defense Secretary Mark Esper promised a review of the process.
Yesterday, the Pentagon’s independent inspector general announced it has assembled “a multidisciplinary team of auditors, investigators, and attorneys” to examine all aspects of the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure or “JEDI” cloud program.
“We are reviewing the DoD’s handing of the JEDI cloud acquisition, including the development of requirements and the request for proposal process,” said spokeswoman Dwrena Allen, in a statement emailed to the Washington Examiner. “In addition, we are investigating whether current or former DoD officials committed misconduct relating to the JEDI acquisition, such as whether any had any conflicts of interest related to their involvement in the acquisition process.”
The review is already underway and making substantial progress, according to Allen. “We recognize the importance and time sensitive nature of the issues, and we intend to complete our review as expeditiously as possible.”
WHAT’S THE BIGGER THREAT?: Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer plans to ask the Trump administration to divert a $5 billion wall funding allocation to programs aimed at ending gun violence and “violent white supremacist extremism.”
A Democratic source tells the Washington Examiner’s Susan Ferrechio the New York Democrat plans to make the formal request “soon” and increase pressure on the Trump administration to take action following three recent mass shootings.
“The dual scourges of gun violence and violent white supremacist extremism in this country are a national security threat plain and simple, and it’s time the Trump administration and Republicans in congress starting treating them as such," Schumer said in a statement. "Now Republicans and this administration need to put their money where their mouth is when it comes to addressing gun violence and stopping the rise of domestic terrorism, especially stemming from white supremacy."
KIA UPDATE: The Pentagon has updated its release on the death in Iraq of Marine Corps Gunnery Sgt. Scott A. Koppenhafer to indicate he was fatally wounded while supporting Iraqi Security Forces Saturday. The previous release said Koppenhafer died after “being engaged by enemy small arms fire while conducting combat operations.”
The change reflects the fact that the military is now investigating whether Koppenhafer may have been accidentally killed by friendly fire from U.S. or Iraqi forces.
LESS SAID THE BETTER: This is a verbatim release from the State Department, attributable to spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus:‎
“Director Yang Jiechi and Secretary Michael R. Pompeo had an extended exchange of views on U.S.-China relations.”

MUSK DENIES REPORT HE SOUGHT BUSINESS ADVICE FROM EPSTEIN

Texto completo: A report that says Tesla CEO Elon Musk sought the advice of financier Jeffrey Epstein when searching for a new Tesla chairman last year has been roundly refuted by the electric carmaker.
In a statement given to this news organization, a spokesperson for Musk and Tesla said, "It is incorrect to say that Epstein ever advised Elon on anything." In a column in the New York Times, writer James Stewart reported Epstein told him he had been advising Musk on the search for a new Tesla board chairman in 2018.
Epstein, who is alleged to have close ties to several top-flight political and financial leaders, was found dead of an apparent suicide in his prison cell on Saturday. He had been facing charges of child sex trafficking at the time of his death.
In his column, Stewart said Epstein made the claims about advising Musk during an interview last year at Epstein's mansion in Manhattan. According to Stewart, he met with Epstein after hearing rumors that the financier had been advising Musk during what was a turbulent period for Tesla.
In August 2018, Musk shocked Wall Street when he tweeted that he was “considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.” Musk eventually dropped his plans, and the Securities and Exchange Commission later sued Musk for fraud and sought to ban him from running any public company in the United States. Musk and the SEC soon settled in a deal that allowed Musk to remain as Tesla's CEO, but it also required him to step down as the company's chairman for a minimum of three years.
In November, Tesla named Robyn Denholm, a Tesla board member and executive with Australian telecom giant Telstra, as its new board chair.
In his column, Stewart said that some of Epstein's statements led him to question the veracity of Epstein's alleged connection to Musk. Stewart said Epstein admitted that he wasn't contacted directly by Musk; instead, the financier said he received an email “from someone very close to him (Musk)” but wouldn't say who that person was.
Stewart also said that Epstein told him his alleged email source denied a request to speak with Stewart.
The columnist doubted Epstein even made the interview request.
“I was struck by how little information Mr. Epstein had actually provided,” Stewart wrote. “While I can't say anything he said was an explicit lie, much of what he said was vague or speculative and couldn't be proved or disproved.” Contact Rex Crum at 408278- 3415.

Myrna Katz Frommer and Harvey Frommer, authors of baseball books and oral histories, die a week apart at 80 and 83

Texto completo: They were born nearly four years and a few neighborhoods apart in Brooklyn, N.Y., and became writers together — though at first only his was the name on the cover of sports books whose writing quality owed much to her careful editing.
Myrna Katz Frommer and Harvey Frommer left their New York City upbringing for the Long Island suburbs before moving 23 years ago to Lyme, N.H., where they remained the rest of their lives, co-teaching an oral history class at Dartmouth College and often writing books together.
Yet despite the distance from their childhoods, “Brooklyn stays with you — that special time, that special place," they wrote in “It Happened in Brooklyn," one of the oral histories they coauthored. “It keeps coming back like a song."
Harvey and Myrna Frommer died a week apart, almost to the hour — he on Aug. 1 of metastatic lung cancer, she on Aug. 8 of complications from Alzheimer's disease. He was 83, she was 80.
The more prolific author of the two, Harvey Frommer was a baseball historian, writing or co-writing more than 50 books about topics including the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox, Shoeless Joe Jackson of the Chicago White Sox, Yankee Stadium and Fenway Park, and the Red Sox-Yankees rivalry.
Myrna, like Harvey, taught in high schools, colleges, and at the graduate level, and along with collaborating with him on books, she wrote articles for a variety of publications.
The two also earned doctorates at New York University, where they met working at the college newspaper before marrying in 1960.
“My dad was extremely ahead of his time when it came to women's issues — singlehandedly promoting, advancing, and supporting my mom to get her PhD, encouraging her to publish, and later designing a master's course at Dartmouth where they could both teach together," their daughter, Jennifer Frommer, said in a eulogy at her father's service.
“My mom would often talk about the fact that she wouldn't have any professional life if not for my father — that she credited him for her professional successes — her career, which made her very happy," said Jennifer, a senior vice president at Columbia Records in New York. “She called him the 'idea man.' "
Harvey always had ideas aplenty for books, and boundless energy for writing.
“Even at the beach he would have a clipboard with him, with stacks of paper, and he would be writing," said his son Frederic J. Frommer, who collaborated with his father on some books and is head of the sports business practice at Dewey Square Group in Washington, D.C.
“My dad was always working, always hustling, trying to find the next new project," Frederic added in an interview. “In his later months, he was telling me he had this idea for a double biography of Ted Williams and Joe DiMaggio. He was determined to write one more book."
Early on, Myrna entered the family writing business to help refine Harvey's creativity.
“When he started his writing career, she was his incredible editor. She read everything he wrote," Frederic said. “He was cranking out a book a year. Not everything was smooth, and she would polish everything. She was an incredible asset to him all those years."
Harvey's solo books included “A Yankee Century," “Baseball's Greatest Managers," “Remembering Yankee Stadium," and “Remembering Fenway Park." “Red Sox vs. Yankees: The Great Rivalry" was among the books he and Frederic coauthored.
Other oral histories Myrna and Harvey cowrote included “Manhattan at Mid-Century," “It Happened in the Catskills," and “Growing Up Jewish in America."
The oral history books were “my favorite kind of writing," Harvey once wrote in a letter that their other son, Ian Frommer, a mathematics professor at the Coast Guard Academy in New London, Conn., quoted from in his eulogy. Those books, Harvey added in the letter, were the “most intellectually challenging, and working with her is fun."
Harvey Frommer was born Oct. 10, 1935, the son of Max Frommer, a cab driver, and Fannie Wechsler, a homemaker, and grew up in Brooklyn's Williamsburg neighborhood.
Myrna Katz was born March 29, 1939, and grew up in Brooklyn's Bensonhurst section, a daughter of Gertrude Bernstein, a homemaker, and Abraham Katz, a furrier — both Russian immigrants.
Myrna and Harvey went to New York University as undergraduate and graduate students. He finished with a bachelor's degree, master's, and doctorate, she with a bachelor's and a doctorate.
No matter where they lived, no matter where they worked, no matter what they wrote, “they were both Brooklyn kids, through and through," Frederic said. “They always had that Brooklyn vibe, that Brooklyn sensibility, that Brooklyn accent."
Harvey, however, broke ranks with the borough and the Brooklyn Dodgers to become a lifelong St. Louis Cardinals fan, in part to emulate Stan Musial, the team's star through his youth.
“Even when he got sick, he would talk about the fate of his own cancer and the fate of the Cardinals almost with the same level of anxiety," Frederic added.
Though baseball had been a passion since boyhood for Harvey, his marriage helped guide him toward a career writing about the sport. “My mom's side was much more intellectual and valued the written word more," Frederic said. “My mom's side really rubbed off on my dad."
After a stint as a sportswriter in Chicago for a wire service, Harvey served in the Army National Guard. He taught at a high school and at City University of New York while he and Myrna raised their children on Long Island.
Myrna was a high school teacher, a book editor, and college teacher before they moved to New Hampshire and began teaching at Dartmouth.
“My dad was an iconoclast, a rebel, an outlaw, and a storyteller," Jennifer said in her eulogy.
Harvey once recalled that along with the usual grades, as a teacher, he sometimes handed out “other ones, like 'C+ -.' What the heck did that mean?" Ian said in his eulogy. “Or my favorite, 'F+++.' Did that mean you failed but in a great way?"
In the introduction to “New York City Baseball: The Golden Age, 1947-1957," Harvey spoke of the many interviews he conducted for that book — his seventh.
“I did not know it then, but I was working as the oral historian I would become, disguised even to myself," he wrote. “And the great strength of 'New York City Baseball' and many of the other books I have created rests on the oral history, the multitude of voices and memories I was able to reach and record."
In addition to their three children, Harvey and Myrna leave her sister, Caroline Katz-Mount of Jersey City, N.J., and six grandchildren.
A service has been held for Harvey, and private services will be held for Myrna.
Memory played a starring role in all their books, from co-written oral histories, such as “It Happened on Broadway," to oral histories Harvey penned alone, such as “Where Have All Our Red Sox Gone?"
Myrna also appraised the insistent tug of memories in a 1979 essay for The New York Times, when the family moved to a larger suburban home. She considered herself “ruthless" when ridding their house of items ideal for garage sales, but she lingered over courtship letters to and from Harvey and their children's school papers.
“They will all go on with me from this house to the next, the very baggage of myself," Myrna wrote.
“From every corner of a house well lived in come the treasures of our day," she added. “Wrapped in tissue paper and enclosed in cardboard, the most amorphous and most permanent thing of all — the time of our lives — is ready to come along to a new address."

Texto completo: Awkward silences are common when baby boomers get together at parties. Beyond the grandkids or aging parents, everything else worth talking about seems to have happened so long ago. But a guaranteed icebreaker, at least for me, is to dig deep into my hippie past and announce, “I was at Woodstock. ”
A few folks roll their eyes, but Woodstock usually sparks a nostalgic if curious conversation. “I wanted to go but my parents wouldn’t let me” is a common reply.
I did go, and now, 50 years later, those three days of peace and music remain as real as the downpour that drenched us moments after Joe Cocker finished his version of “With a Little Help from My Friends. ”
Not to minimize the woes of the millennials who endured the fraudulent Fyre Festival in the Bahamas in 2017, but at least they had makeshift shelters, cellphones and credit cards before the thing was canceled.
We were ill-prepared for Woodstock
The conditions for the 400,000 of us at Max Yasgur’s farm were far worse: At least three torrential downpours produced a clingy, blob-like mud that came alive as you trudged through the muck, pulling off sandals, sucking down sneakers and swallowing up picnic baskets whole.
Blazing hot August days turned to shivers, the crowd shaking not to the music but to the chill of cold Catskills nights. Our clothes still soaked, we huddled by a bonfire just beneath the stage as Ten Years After played “I’m Going Home” on Sunday night.
Despite a few makeshift food stands (one was famously burned down), finding anything to eat was a daily “do you have a spare muffin?” ritual. Portable toilets were clogged in the worst ways imaginable.
Very few of us brought tents (sleeping bags and backpacks weren’t yet standard issue in suburban New York), and the few previous music festivals of note — Monterey Pop in California, the Atlanta International Pop Festival — had either normal seating or controlled areas for blankets and folding chairs.
Our festival was a national spectacle
Totally unprepared for Woodstock’s ticketless anarchy, my girlfriend and I slept under trees, using clothes stretched on sticks as makeshift tents. Thousands slept together in the woods along the “Groovy Way” path, whether in relationships or not.
Of course there was no internet, no way to communicate with the outside world beyond enduring the long lines at a few pay phones. When we did call our freaked out parents — I was a 21-year-old college student — we didn’t realize that The New York Times, the New York Daily News and newsman Gabe Pressman on WNBC were treating the festival as a natural disaster. My parents calmed when I assured them that despite what they were hearing, Woodstock was “groovy. ”
My brother and I had driven the family’s 1968 Chevy up the New York State Thruway, parking it on a lawn already packed with cars. My girlfriend, Eileen, now my wife, had taken a bus and somehow met us near the medical tent. No one ever collected our tickets.
Marijuana and LSD abounded, but it didn’t take drugs to realize we were in a new American landscape. If the moon landing a few weeks earlier had been, as Time magazine called it, a “triumph of the squares,” this “gathering of the tribes” at Woodstock would be the high point of the 1960s counterculture.
The crowd, the people, us, it turned out, was to be the story — sharing, dancing, chanting, skinny-dipping, surviving. It was wonderful in its misery.
We were given oatmeal one morning by famed hippie Wavy Gravy’s Hog Farm collective, a psychedelic bus playing Grateful Dead bootlegs as women, of course braless, swayed to the music.
The tiny stage, so far away at the bottom of a natural amphitheater, had no giant video screens, no way to see the performers. Only the superb sound system conveyed the power of acts such as Janis Joplin, The Band, Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, The Who, Jefferson Airplane and, best of all, Sly and the Family Stone.
Festival was shrouded in rumor
I remember one woman, someone’s date (an archaic notion in the hippie paradise), looking completely out of place in a bright suburban pantsuit and halter top, hair coiffed and her back angrily turned from the stage. She wanted to go home, but of course she couldn’t. Once you got there, Woodstock was for keeps.
The festival wasn’t heavily hyped — another sign of how times have changed. A modest ad in The Village Voice, some ticket sale ads on the radio. You had to be in on the 1960s rock scene to even know it was happening.
Rumors abounded: The Beatles would be there. The Rolling Stones were flying in. Bob Dylan, who lived in the real town of Woodstock 60 miles away, would make a surprise appearance. None did.
Waiting on the Woodstock babies
As many as three babies were said to have been born at Woodstock. Singer John Sebastian, who says he was tripping during his performance, told the crowd, “That kid is going to be far out. ”
Years later, when I became a reporter, I and other journalists tried to track down the Woodstock babies, but local hospitals had no records of a birth; neither did medical staff working the festival.
To this day, no one has ever come forward as a “Woodstock baby. ” If any do exist, happy 50th birthday! I bet you’re far out.

U.S. weakens Endangered Species Act

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - The Trump administration Monday announced it would change the way the Endangered Species Act is applied, significantly weakening the nation's bedrock conservation law credited with rescuing the bald eagle, the grizzly bear and the American alligator from extinction.
The changes will make it harder to consider the effects of climate change on wildlife when deciding whether a given species warrants protection. They would most likely shrink critical habitats and, for the first time, would allow economic assessments to be conducted when making determinations.
The rules also make it easier to remove a species from the endangered species list and weaken protections for threatened species, a designation that means they are at risk of becoming endangered.
Overall, the new rules would very likely clear the way for new mining, oil and gas drilling, and development in areas where protected species live.
Interior Secretary David Bernhardt said the changes would modernize the Endangered Species Act and increase transparency in its application. "The Act's effectiveness rests on clear, consistent and efficient implementation," he said in a statement Monday.
Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement the revisions "fit squarely within the president's mandate of easing the regulatory burden on the American public, without sacrificing our species' protection and recovery goals."
The new rules are expected to appear in the Federal Register this week and will go into effect 30 days after that.
Environmental organizations denounced the changes as a disaster for imperiled wildlife.
David J. Hayes, who served as a deputy interior secretary in the Obama administration and is now executive director of the State Energy and Environmental Impact Center at the New York University School of Law, said the changes would "straitjacket the scientists to take climate change out of consideration" when determining how to best protect wildlife. "We all know that climate change is now the greatest threat ever to hundreds of species," Hayes said.
A recent United Nations assessment, some environmentalists noted, has warned that human pressures are poised to drive 1 million species into extinction and that protecting land and biodiversity is critical to keep greenhouse gas emissions in check.
Climate change, a lack of environmental stewardship and mass industrialization have all contributed to the enormous expected global nature loss, the United Nations report said.
Ever since President Richard M. Nixon signed the Endangered Species Act into law in 1973, it has been the main U.S. legislation for protecting fish, plants and wildlife and has acted as a safety net for species on the brink of extinction. The peregrine falcon, the humpback whale, the Tennessee purple coneflower and the Florida manatee all would very likely have disappeared without it, scientists say.
Republicans have long sought to narrow the scope of the law, saying it burdens landowners, hampers industry and hinders economic growth. Bernhardt wrote in an op-ed last summer that the act places an "unnecessary regulatory burden" on companies.
They also make the case that the law is not reasonable because species are rarely removed from the list. Since the law was passed, more than 1,650 have been listed as threatened or endangered, while just 47 have been delisted because their populations rebounded.

In Indonesia, President's Son Faces Questions About Father's Interests

Texto completo: JAKARTA, Indonesia -- Donald Trump Jr., visiting Indonesia's capital on Tuesday to promote two Trump-branded resorts, defended his father, President Trump, and their family's company against allegations that their global business presented conflicts of interest for the president.
The president's son, an executive vice president of the Trump Organization, said that the company had walked away from deals that could have made tens of millions of dollars so as not to create the appearance of any improprieties.
"We made a very conscious decision of the family not to do that right now," he told reporters. "We have turned down a lot of deals."
He also defended his father against any suggestions that the family's international business interests could affect his foreign policy.
"He wouldn't make decisions on a country based on a real estate deal," Mr. Trump said. "I would like to shut down that nonsense right here."
Mr. Trump was in Jakarta for a private event with wealthy prospective buyers to promote the sale of residential units at two planned luxury resorts in Indonesia that have yet to be built.
He and his billionaire business partner, Hary Tanoesoedibjo, chairman of the MNC Group, held a news conference to extol the virtues of the two Trump-branded resorts, one in Bali and the other at Lido, south of Jakarta. The resorts will include hotels, golf courses and residential units.
After Mr. Trump was elected president in 2016, he said in a Twitter post that he would embark on "no new deals." But the Trump Organization said it was keeping the Indonesia projects because Mr. Trump had signed binding contracts with Mr. Hary in 2015.
Mr. Trump initially reported receiving between $ 2 million and $ 10 million for the projects. The agreement does not call for the Trump Organization to put up any money.
The two projects have been slow to progress.
Mr. Trump Jr. and Mr. Hary were vague on specifics Tuesday, and reporters were not shown a promotional video for the projects that was shown to guests at the event.
But Mr. Hary said he expected both projects to be completed in three years and valued them together at $ 1.7 billion.
The Trump International Resort, Golf Club and Residences Bali is planned for the site of the former Nirwana Pan-Pacific Hotel overlooking an iconic temple, Tanah Lot, a popular tourist destination. Building near the sacred site is controversial, but Mr. Hary has promised to abide by Bali's strict setback and height regulations.
The Nirwana was demolished last year to make way for the new project. A reporter who visited the site in April saw no sign that construction had begun.
Trump International Resort, Golf Club and Residences Lido, to be built about 45 miles south of Jakarta, is to be part of a larger project known as Lido City, which is to include a theme park, hospital, restaurants and other facilities. The 7,400-acre project is billed as a "Live, Work and Play destination."
Mr. Hary said work on the Lido golf course was 80 percent complete and that construction of the resort buildings would begin after it was finished. He offered no similar details for the Bali project.
Last year, the MNC Group said it would receive $ 500 million in financing from an arm of Metallurgical Corporation of China, a state-owned construction company, to build the theme park.
The deal falls under the umbrella of China's Belt and Road Initiative, an ambitious plan to spread money and influence by financing infrastructure and other projects worldwide, a high priority for China's leader, Xi Jinping.
Mr. Hary said the theme park and the Trump resort were not connected and that China would not provide financing for the Trump-branded project.
According to an MNC presentation in February, the Lido project is slated to have a 120-room hotel, an 18-hole golf course designed by the professional golfer Ernie Els, and a complex of 438 luxury villas and condominiums.
The Bali resort is to include 368 luxury condos and villas, a 150-unit hotel and an 18-hole golf course designed by the golfer Phil Mickelson.
Mr. Hary, who heads his own political party, the United Indonesia Party, or Perindo, was a candidate for vice president in 2014 and has talked of running for president. But he backed President Joko Widodo in his successful re-election campaign this year.
He insisted that his business and political activities did not overlap. "The business with the Trump Organization has nothing to do with my political career," he told reporters.
There have been local media reports that Mr. Hary's daughter, Angela Tanoesoedibjo, may be in the running for a position in Mr. Joko's new cabinet. The president's office has not confirmed that she is under consideration.
Even so, Mr. Hary's partnership with the American president appears to have produced little political benefit for either Mr. Trump or Mr. Hary, Indonesia's vice president, Jusuf Kalla, said last year in an interview with The New York Times.
The vice president, whose term ends in October, noted that Mr. Trump's business interests in Indonesia were not huge, relatively speaking, and said that Mr. Hary had not influenced diplomatic ties with the United States.
Indeed, Mr. Trump's behavior has baffled many Indonesians who follow events in America.
"Many think he is weird, an unusual president," Mr. Jusuf said. "Let's see how a president controls a country with Twitter."
In recent years, the projects in Indonesia have been small revenue generators for the Trump Organization, producing just $ 210,000 in 2018, according to President Trump's 2018 financial disclosure, released in May.
The event in Jakarta comes as the Trump Organization has publicly struggled to keep the family business growing in the two and a half years since Mr. Trump moved into the White House.
In the United States, the Trump Organization has backed away from plans to start two new hotel brands, Scion and American Idea.
It has also seen the removal of the Trump name from a half a dozen properties, including Trump SoHo and Trump International Hotel and Tower in Panama City, Panama.
Even new projects are delayed. Trump Tower Punta del Este in Uruguay is already nearly three years behind schedule.
But the Trump Organization has continued to push ahead, particularly with the small number of international projects that had already been under contract before Mr. Trump was elected president.
Besides the project in Uruguay and a recently completed building in Manila in the Philippines, the other major ongoing international projects include a second golf course in Dubai, several residential towers in India and the two projects in Indonesia.
Donald Trump Jr. has been the lead salesman for the Trump Organization's projects in Asia, an assignment that brought him last year to New Delhi, Kolkata, Pune and Mumbai in India.
That trip generated controversy when he was scheduled to give what sounded like a policy speech on relations between India and the United States. But the topic of the speech was ultimately changed, and he proclaimed that the trip to India was about family business, not foreign policy.
In Jakarta, Mr. Trump said that the Trump Organization's decision to forgo big business opportunities overseas was not being properly recognized.
"We could have kept doing deals," he said. "The media is never going to give us credit."

Texto completo: Antolín López Aguilar , un ciudadano guatemalteco de 23 años, intentó el 3 de diciembre de 2017 cruzar la frontera de Nogales, Arizona, para entrar en territorio de EEUU. Pero Matthew Bowen , un agente de la Patrulla Fronteriza que dos semanas antes había definido a los inmigrantes como él “infrahumanos”, y “salvajes asesinos”, interceptó el intento.
El agente fue acusado posteriormente de golpear y herir al migrante con un vehículo del servicio de Aduanas y Protección Fronteriza (CBP, por sus siglas en inglés) cuando este trató de escapar de él y de otros compañeros que trataban de detenerlo. El joven fue hospitalizado tras el accidente.
Ahora, Bowen reconoce que trató de atropellarlo. “Lo golpeé de manera intencional con fuerza desmesurada” , aseguró en una declaración recogida en documentos de una corte federal y citada por The New York Times y otros medios. El abogado del agente, Sean Chapman, confirmó a EFE que su cliente admitió ser culpable de esos hechos.
Bowen agregó en su declaración que sus actos “no estaba justificados” y violaron los derechos de López-Aguilar “protegidos por la Constitución de EEUU”.
Tras el accidente, el migrante fue sentenciado a 30 días de prisión por tratar de entrar ilegalmente al país, según el diario The Arizona Republic. The New York Times dice que se desconoce lo que pasó después con él.
Este y otros medios aseguran que el agente se enfrentaría a hasta un año de prisión y podría ser multado con 100.000 dólares cuando una corte determine en octubre la sentencia por el caso. El abogado dijo a EFE que a cambio de la admisión de culpabilidad y de renunciar a su posición en la Patrulla Fronteriza, Bowen evitará el juicio en su contra y quedará en libertad provisional.
El agente, que estuvo trabajando de patrullero desde 2008, fue suspendido de empleo y sueldo a partir de su procesamiento judicial en junio de 2018, según algunos medios.
El caso de Matthew Bowen cobró relevancia nacional en mayo de este año, cuando se supo que, dentro del proceso por el intento de atropello del migrante guatemalteco en la corte de distrito de Tucson, Arizona, salieron a la luz mensajes de corte racista y agresivo contra los inmigrantes enviados por Bowen a otros agentes fronterizos anteriormente a ese hecho.
En estos mensajes, el agente se refería a los inmigrantes con expresiones como “escoria”, “repugnante basura infrahumana” que “no merece ni ser astillas para prender un fuego”. Según su abogado, lo que se dice en ellos no es extraordinario, y responde a sentimientos “habituales entre los patrulleros de Tucson”.
Posteriormente, sin embargo, el abogado aclaró que sus explicaciones concernían sólo a la palabra “tonc”, usada en los mensajes para referirse a los inmigrantes, y que se sospecha que puede ser una onomatopeya del sonido de un agente golpeándoles con una linterna en la cabeza. Otra interpretación podría ser el acrónimo “temporalmente fuera de su país nativo” (escrito en inglés).
The New York Times asegura que la corte determinó que los mensajes enviados antes del accidente no se podían considerar relevantes para el caso. Pero una juez estableció que a partir de la fecha del intento de atropello, los mensajes de Bowen que pudieran referirse a este asunto o con contenidos racista sí lo serían.
El día después del accidente, Bowen confesó en un mensaje a un compañero que sí había usado una camioneta Ford F-150 para intentar detener a un migrante, pero que solo había sido “un pequeño empujón”.
El agente fue acusado también de falsificar un documento enviado al jefe del Sector de Tucson de la Patrulla Fronteriza y en el que “declaró falsamente que no estaba seguro si su vehículo contactó a López-Aguilar, y que nunca tuvo la intención de golpear, asustar o entrar en contacto con el hombre que huía del agente”. Tras su admisión de responsabilidad, los fiscales acordaron desestimar esta acusación, dice The Arizona Republic.
En el pasado, Bowen ya había sido acusado de usar fuerza excesiva sin motivo para realizar arrestos en al menos cinco ocasiones.

Maduro estaría reprimiendo a miembros de las fuerzas armadas de Venezuela

Texto completo: Miembros de las fuerzas militares venezolanas estarían siendo reprimidos por órdenes de Nicolás Maduro.
De acuerdo con el NEw York Times, el régimen de Maduro ha usado el aparato represivo del Estado contra sus propias fuerzas de seguridad para mantener el control sobre estas. La reciente muerte del capitán Rafael Acosta Arévalo es uno de los ejemplos.
“El abuso contra los oficiales ha crecido porque representan una amenaza real para el Gobierno de Maduro”, indicó el general Manuel Cristopher Figuera , exdirector de Inteligencia de Venezuela, quien desertó en abril y vive en EEUU, en un artículo publicado este martes por el New York Times.
Indica además el rotativo que de acuerdo con denuncias de varias organizaciones, como la Coalición por los Derechos Humanos y la Democracia , que señala que hay 117 oficiales, entre activos y retirados, detenidos en cárceles venezolanas.
El artículo subraya el caso de Acosta Arévalo, que murió a finales de junio bajo custodia del Estado venezolano por su supuesta implicación en una conspiración para dar un golpe de Estado , lo que fue condenado por EEUU.
Trump congela dinero y bienes del gobierno de Venezuela en EEUU, incluyendo PDVSA
El Gobierno de EEUU culpó al presidente Maduro y sus “asesores cubanos” por la muerte, a la vez que reiteró el apoyo al pueblo venezolano, según un mensaje publicado el pasado 1 de julio por la secretaria adjunta de Estado de EEUU para Latinoamérica , Kimberly Breier, en su cuenta de Twitter.
El Times recuerda que el militar fue sepultado el 10 de julio, en contra de los deseos de su esposa y rodeado de guardias de seguridad en una operación controlada por el Gobierno.
También de que los cinco familiares a los que se les permitió asistir no pudieron verlo porque su cuerpo estaba envuelto en un plástico marrón.
De acuerdo con el rotativo neoyorquino, algunas secciones del informe de su autopsia, que fueron filtradas, señalan que Acosta sufrió un traumatismo por fuerza contundente y electrocución , y que las autoridades han admitido el uso de fuerza excesiva en su caso.
El Gobierno venezolano detuvo a dos militares en relación con su muerte y señaló que los oficiales usaron fueron excesiva cuando el capitán se resistió al arresto, recuerda el Times.
Igualmente cita en el artículo los casos de otros militares que fueron torturados como el de Juan Carlos Caguaripano, un capitán de la Guardia Nacional que en 2017 dirigió un asalto fallido en una base militar, quien sufrió lesiones en los testículos debido a los golpes que recibió en la cárcel.
El preso más conocido de Venezuela y un plan de fuga planeado al milímetro
El artículo asegura que en los últimos dos años, a medida que se agrava la escasez de alimentos por el derrumbe de la economía petrolera, las fuerzas de seguridad del Estado han llevado a cabo por lo menos cinco operaciones para derrocar o asesinar a Maduro.
El Gobierno asegura que ha frustrado al menos una docena más de complots, incluido el plan con el que se vinculó a Acosta y otros cinco detenidos, lo que el Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) , la organización política de Maduro, utiliza para justificar la vigilancia constante, detenciones arbitrarias y las torturas a los que considera sus enemigos.
Entre los vigilados, los 160.000 soldados que conforman las Fuerzas Armadas de Venezuela, señala además al Times al citar denuncias de Naciones Unidas.
Destaca también que la Coalición por los Derechos Humanos, con sede en Caracas y que representa a varios de los militares arrestados, ha documentado 250 casos de tortura cometidos por las fuerzas de seguridad venezolanas contra oficiales militares, sus familiares y activistas de la oposición desde el 2017.
Estos abusos fueron dados a conocer el pasado mes en un informe publicado por Michelle Bachelet, alta comisionada para los Derechos Humanos de la ONU.
Asimismo, el artículo apunta que aunque Maduro ha tratado de garantizar la lealtad de los altos mandos militares con promociones y contratos lucrativos, los oficiales de rango medio y bajo y sus familias se ven cada vez más afectados por la crisis.
“El hambre llegó a los cuarteles y se infectaron con disidencia”, dijo al diario Ana Leonor Acosta , abogada de la Coalición, quien asegura también que las Fuerzas Armadas están llenas de paranoia, desconfianza y división.

Texto completo: I filled the dropper from the bottle and then - one, two, three, four and five - I placed five drops of the CBD oil under my tongue. Then I carefully settled onto the couch, turned on "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy on Netflix and checked my watch.
I wasn't supposed to swallow the stuff for two minutes.
I hoped I wouldn't drool all over my shirt.
Your local lab rat
As soon as I began this month learning about CBD oil (cannabidiol), a hemp oil that's become popular as a kind of health supplement, I went out and bought a couple of sample packages of CBD oil soft gels.
I got different strengths and started using them, generally after CrossFit workouts.
Among the many reported properties, CBD was supposed to help with inflammation.
Sometimes, my knees get sore. I chalk it up to spending a couple of decades chronically overweight, sitting at a desk, with the bulk of my cardio activity being a run to the coffee pot to grab the occasional free donut.
Muscles get weak with little use.
It takes time to build up strength, and my knees don't bother me nearly as much as they did when I first stepped inside CrossFit WV in late December. Back then, I was wearing knee braces under my jeans to work and icing my knees pretty much every night.
These days, I treat my aching knees like a normal person. When they bother me, I take a couple of aspirin or a cheap, nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drug. But I hoped the CBD would be like magic and - poof - my knees would feel like they did when I was 17.
The results?
The short version is I took the pills, and nothing happened. Nothing at all. I tried one pill at the lowest dose, tried two pills at a higher dose and tried two pills at the highest dose from the packages I'd purchased.
Nothing happened. I felt no different.
I wasn't even sleepy or extra hungry, two of the potential side effects. Not that I'd notice. I'm always sleepy and extra hungry.
Maybe I was doing this wrong, I thought, so instead of going to a store that also sold CBD along with vitamins, beer, hair care products and lawn ornaments, I stopped in at Green Infusion, on West Washington Street, in Charleston.
The store is one of many shops specializing in CBD products that have opened up in the past couple of years.
I met Susan Heater, who was sitting in a chair while keeping an eye on the store. In the middle of an oppressively hot Friday afternoon, the place was empty except for the two of us. Susan, a friendly, motherly type who reminded me a little of my Aunt Barb, showed me around.
I told her which alleged effects of CBD interested me: anti-inflammation/pain reduction and anxiety relief.
"But here's the thing, I said. "I'm a skeptic. The New York Times basically said this stuff was a sugar pill - an expensive sugar pill. So, we have two main schools of thought. It's either magic or it's hokum.
She nodded. She'd heard that before and showed me a couple of pricey products that might do what I wanted. There were different blends with different strengths, and it was all keyed to the individual.
I nodded. Uh-huh.
"Maybe you should talk to the owner, she said.
"Yeah. Is the owner around? I asked.
"He's at the other store, she told me. "On Capitol Street.
Heater gave me her boss' card and directions, so I drove across town to ambush Robert McComas, owner of Green Infusion, with a bunch of questions.
McComas didn't seem to mind and told me to look around.
While I gawked politely at the range of products that had nothing to do with me, a restaurant worker from up the street came in and asked a few questions about the CBD, particularly about the THC content.
Some CBD has a miniscule amount of THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), the psychoactive compound in marijuana. It's legally allowed because it's a trace amount - not enough to get anyone high - though it potentially could show up on a stringent drug test.
"Well, that's fine by me, the guy in the kitchen staff shirt said, laughing. "I don't get drug tested no more.
He wanted the stuff with the tiny bit of THC in it.
McComas explained that CBD is a set of cannabinoids taken from the hemp plant, but THC is a cannabinoid, too. Some research suggests it could be helpful in treating a few medical conditions, but McComas said as far as medical benefits went, the cannabinoids worked best together.
"Ideally, you'd get the best results from the complete plant, he said.
He said that people are starved for cannabinoids, that prior to the early 1900s, people got cannabinoids generally through their food. It was mixed in with what farm animals ate. It was also used in a wide variety of medicines and treatments, but then fell out of favor.
"Big drug companies didn't like it, McComas said. "They wanted everybody to use heroin.
Heroin was developed and marketed by the drug company Bayer as a nonaddictive substitute for morphine in the late 1800s. Initially, it was used in cough syrup and sold over the counter, as most drugs were then.
Within a couple of years, everybody with any sense figured out Bayer's wonder drug might be one of the worst things ever to be unleashed on humanity, though it took generations to put any controls on it. By then, the evil genie was out of the bottle and was never ever going back in.
I explained I'd tried to use some pre-packaged doses of CBD, but felt nothing, no change.
He shrugged. Not everything worked with every person. There could be a lot of variance with effect and how much CBD was needed to get any result.
Trying again
McComas said it might just be my preferred method of delivery.
You can smoke, vape, drink and eat CBD, but these were all second best.
"Actually, a suppository works best, he told me.
I frowned and shook my head.
"Nope, I said. "Nobody pays me enough for that one.
He laughed. Green Infusion doesn't even sell it. Second best, he said, was vaping or smoking.
Vaping is better than smoking, since it didn't irritate the lungs, but they both got the chemical into the blood system fast and efficiently, he said.
"Not going to do that either, I said. "I quit smoking around 10 years ago and I'm never doing that again.
He shrugged. Good for me.
The next best way was to take the CBD oil under your tongue - just a few drops on the soft flesh and the compound would somehow seep into your veins.
Fine, I said, and bought a 500 mg strength bottle of Dragonfly CBD oil, a local brand and the cheapest of the product line.
McComas said the bottle might not get me through the whole month, but would definitely work for the next couple of weeks.
He told me if I had any questions, I could check back and hoped I would to tell him how it went.
From the store, I took my tiny bottle of CBD oil and met someone for coffee and pleasant conversation that turned into dinner and strained cross examination.
While we were eating, I got a case of nerves and began flailing around for things to say, which turned into a string of desperate, dumb questions served with a side of queso dip.
A bit early, we went our separate ways.
She went home while I walked to my car, kicking myself for being awkward, but still being present enough to notice the crazy guy wandering Charleston's streets on a Friday night, whacking things with a pink, aluminum baseball bat.
At home, I texted her. She responded. Maybe the evening hadn't gone completely off the rails, but I still felt edgy. I'd have blamed the coffee, but I hadn't had any. I'd stuck with bottled water.
I made a second dinner, washed dishes, ran the vacuum and walked the dogs.
At 10 o'clock at night, I decided it was as good a time as any to try the CBD oil. I placed the prescribed five drops under my tongue, held it for two minutes and then swallowed.
The taste wasn't unpleasant. It reminded me of cheap "Green Goddess salad dressing.
I texted my dinner companion, "First dose taken. So far, no flying monkeys or talking furniture.
A few minutes later, she asked me what it felt like.
I thought about it for a second. Something was significantly different.
"I don't know if it's suggestion or if it's an actual effect, but I think I'm less anxious than I was just a few minutes ago, I texted back.
That couldn't be right.

Texto completo: NEW YORK - It was the weekend that shaped the image of a "Woodstock Generation. And that image would echo, appeal and provoke for generations to come.
To many who went or wished they did, the pivotal festival of "peace and music 50 years ago remains an inspiring moment of counterculture community and youthful freethinking.
"We went for the music and found something so much more, and so much more important - camaraderie, says Karen Breda, who was 17 when she went to Woodstock. She recalls feeling part of "a generation that felt like nothing could stop us. Peace. Love. The whole thing.
Some other Americans saw Woodstock as an outrageous display of indulgence and insouciance in a time of war. And some didn't look to Woodstock to celebrate their own sense of music and identity.
"There was no one baby boomer generation. There was no one approach to what Woodstock meant, says David Farber, a University of Kansas professor of American history. But Woodstock became an "aspirational vision of what countercultural youth thought they could achieve in the United States.
Breda didn't go to Woodstock looking for a societal vision. She was fresh out of high school and liked rock concerts, and the three-day lineup was packed with acts including The Who, Jimi Hendrix, Jefferson Airplane and Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young.
After lying to her parents about her destination, Breda arrived from Boston to find a mind-boggling mass of people, tents, blankets, pot smoke, patchouli and underpreparedness.
Organizers had sold 186,000 tickets; ultimately an estimated 400,000 people showed up for the festival on farmland in Bethel, New York, about 80 miles northwest of New York City.
Space, water and toilets were in short supply. Security was thin. Rain and mud abounded. Breda and her friends slept in their car after getting separated from another vehicle carrying their camping supplies. It was a trek to get near the stage.
But what she remembers most was happening in the crowd - concertgoers meeting each other, sharing what they had, playing guitars together.
At a time of bitter protests over the Vietnam War, Woodstock "seemed to transcend the anger that clearly a lot of people were feeling. It was about being together. It was about helping out someone that needed something, says Breda, now a nursing professor at the University of Hartford in Connecticut. "The music spoke for us.
Concertgoers weren't the only ones struck by the fellow-feeling and calm in the crowd - despite scores of drug arrests, medical problems ranging from cut-up bare feet to LSD freakouts, and two deaths, one from a heroin overdose and another when a teen was run over, according to The Associated Press' reporting from the time.
There were no reports of violence, and a local police chief called the crowd "the most courteous, considerate and well-behaved group of kids he'd encountered in his career. Max Yasgur, the dairy farmer who leased his land to the festival, said meeting them "forced me to open my eyes.
He added: "I think America has to take notice.
It did. Often with scorn.
Many Americans saw Woodstock as a spectacle of spaced-out, skinny-dipping, promiscuous hippies cavorting in squalor - with "little more sanity than the impulses that drive the lemmings to march to their deaths in the sea, as a New York Times editorial put it (while allowing that "the freakish-looking intruders behaved astonishingly well).
And for some, Woodstock would serve as an enduring symbol of the divides of the Vietnam War - on one side a throng of young people gathered for "peace and music, on the other more than a half-million of their peers fighting in Vietnam.
"I'm sure it was a cultural and pharmaceutical event. I was tied up at the time, the late Sen. John McCain famously said in 2007.
His remark - an allusion to his 5 1/2 years as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam - got a standing ovation from a Republican presidential primary debate audience. The former Navy pilot would later earn the nomination.
Two years later, the Veterans of Foreign Wars' magazine marked Woodstock's 40th anniversary with a cover story spotlighting some 109 service members who died in Vietnam during the festival and "are never lauded by the illustrious spokesmen for the Sixties Generation.'
The Woodstock audience did include at least one Vietnam veteran, snapped in a well-known photo . Performers included Country Joe McDonald, a Navy veteran who served mainly in Japan. His anti-war "I Feel Like I'm Fixin' To Die Rag became a memorable Woodstock moment.
"Some people alluded to peace and stuff, but I was talking about Vietnam, McDonald said in a phone interview.
The song's profane introductory cheer "is an expression of our anger and frustration over the Vietnam War, which was killing us, literally killing us, said the singer, who helped spearhead the creation of Vietnam veterans' memorial in Berkeley, California, in the 1990s.
On the same day his band, Country Joe & the Fish, played at Woodstock, another audience of thousands was in a Harlem park for a concert with its own sense of community and yearnings to challenge the status quo. Headliner Nina Simone delivered a set infused with songs of black empowerment and a militant poem that asked black people "are you ready to instigate social change.
The show was part of the Harlem Cultural Festival, a concert series that would later be dubbed a "Black Woodstock.
Over six summer Sundays, an estimated 300,000 people in total gathered to see acts including Stevie Wonder, Gladys Knight & the Pips and - like the upstate Woodstock crowd - Sly and the Family Stone.
"It was like a mini-Woodstock to a lot of people, says Ethel Beatty Barnes, who saw the Sly and the Family Stone concert that July, when she was an 18-year-old New Yorker.
Her mother wouldn't let her go to Woodstock. But Beatty Barnes feels the city-sponsored Harlem festival, which was showcased in two network TV specials, showed people didn't have to go far to come together around music.
"It was embarking onto what do we have already here where we can have people gather?' says Beatty Barnes, who became a Broadway actress and singer. "It was a really great thing.
A half-century later, the Harlem Cultural Festival's anniversary is being marked with events including a concert in the same park, hosted by rapper and activist Talib Kweli. It's part of Future X Sounds, a socially conscious concert series.
Meanwhile, four days of concerts and events are planned at the Woodstock site, now the Bethel Woods Center for the Arts.
The lineup includes 1969 performers Santana and John Fogerty, but the arts center has made clear it isn't hosting a freewheeling festival: Spectators will need tickets and checkpoint travel passes to get to the site. Plans for a sprawling commemorative Woodstock 50 event elsewhere collapsed amid permitting and other problems .
Thinking back, Breda rues that "subsequent generations didn't have the opportunity to experience something that I consider to have been so beautiful.
But, she says: "It feels like something that could never happen again.

Texto completo: Epstein, awaiting sex trafficking charges, dies of apparent suicide
Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced financier who was awaiting federal sex trafficking charges in a Manhattan jail, died Saturday from an apparent suicide, according to authorities. Epstein, 66, an investment banker who counted President Donald Trump and former President Bill Clinton among his powerful connections, had pleaded not guilty to charges of drug trafficking and allegedly sexually abusing dozens of underage girls. Epstein was placed on suicide watch less than three weeks ago after he was found in his jail cell with injuries to his neck. But he was removed from suicide watch just six days later, according to the New York Times. Attorney General William Barr said he was "appalled" to hear about Epstein's suicide, adding that his death "raises serious questions that must be answered. "
President Donald Trump re-tweeted a no-evidence conspiracy theory Saturday trying to link Epstein's death to former President Clinton, drawing heavy criticism from Democratic presidential candidates and his own adviser's husband. "The President of the United States is a nut job," tweeted George Conway, an attorney married to Trump counselor Kellyanne Conway.
Simone Biles lands the first-ever double-twisting double somersault
Simone Biles continues to prove she’s the best gymnast in the world, and at the U. S. Gymnastics Championships this weekend, she’s soaring toward her sixth national title. Biles made history on the balance beam Friday, becoming the first gymnast to land a double-twisting double somersault. With a 1. 75-point lead after Friday, the first of two days of competition, Biles was in place to win another championship and extend her streak of winning every meet she’s entered since nationals in 2013. Nationals for women continue Sunday night at 8 p. m. ET on NBC.
Manhunt over: An escaped Tennessee inmate is captured

Watson was serving a 15-year prison sentence for especially aggravated kidnapping. Johnson, 64, was the first Tennessee Department of Corrections employee to be killed in the line of duty in 15 years.

Universal canceled a film where the wealthy hunt rural Americans
Universal Pictures is canceling the release of "The Hunt," a film that President Donald Trump seemingly criticized earlier this week. The film, which was set for release in September, sparked controversy due to its subject matter in the wake of recent mass shootings. The film follows a group of wealthy elites who hunt people in rural America for sport, according to Rotten Tomatoes and The Hollywood Reporter. In a statement, Universal said that "we understand that now is not the right time to release this film. " In tweets Friday, Trump labeled Hollywood as "racist," describing a "movie coming out" that he said aimed to "inflame and cause chaos. "

Amid 'the noise,' try Morrison, visit to free zoo, 'Desiderata'

Texto completo: Today, three bite-sized columns rolled into one. \
1. Reading Toni Morrison, at last
Toni Morrison died Monday at the age of 88, prompting an outpouring of praise for her as a groundbreaking, truth-telling writer and human being.
In The New York Times, Dwight Garner wrote that she "brought a freight of news about black life in America (and about life, period) to millions of readers across the globe. Much of this news was of the sort that, in terms of its stark and sensitive awareness of the consequences of racism, opened an abyss at one's feet and changed the taste of the saliva in one's mouth."
In the midst of the postmortem praise, a couple of people asked me to recommend one of Morrison's novels since, they said sheepishly, they hadn't read her. I had to confess, sheepishly, that I haven't read her either.
Over the years, I've been dazzled by interviews with Morrison. I've quoted her. I've read many books and writers who are associated with her. But I haven't read her books.
Now I plan to. I'm going to start with "Beloved," the book that won a 1988 Pulitzer Prize.
I take inspiration from Tarell Alvin McCraney (the Steppenwolf Theatre ensemble member who wrote the story that was the basis for the movie "Moonlight"). Shortly after her death, he tweeted:
"Some will try to make you feel unworthy cuz you didn't read her work before she passed, because you hadnt seen her interviews or done deep dives on her essays; They jealous. They will never get to discover her again, here's your chance."

2. Communing with the plants and animals
On Friday morning I took a walk through Lincoln Park Zoo, one of those places in Chicago that proves the world is more than argument and mayhem. The zoo is free, and with its big trees and exuberant flowers, feels more like a park.
On Friday, as on most days, there were people of every skin tone and all ages there. I saw kids who had come in on school buses from the South and West sides, an elderly couple speaking Chinese, Hispanic families speaking English and Spanish. There were groups of kids of various races, all playing together.
At one point, I rounded a bend where a crowd was gathered. I approached the fence to see what was going on. I gasped.
A giraffe!
I've seen that giraffe a million times, and still I gasped. Standing there with all the other giraffe gawkers, I was reminded of nature's power to calm us down and bring us together.
How often we forget this basic principle: When you're convinced you just can't bear the world anymore, go out into it. Find the plants and animals. Let them put us humans into perspective.

3. Rereading 'Desiderata'
At the end of my senior year in high school, I went to live with the family of my friend Marge. In the bedroom we shared there was a poster on the wall, a poster that must have been owned by 86.2% of all teenagers of that time, "Desiderata."
It's a prose poem that begins:
"Go placidly amid the noise and the haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence. As far as possible, without surrender, be on good terms with all persons."
I always admired how the words "without surrender" were tucked into the uplift, as if to say: There will be times that good terms with all persons is impossible.
I hadn't thought about "Desiderata" in years until Paul Meincke ace former reporter for ABC-7, posted it on Facebook. He said he'd found it while going through old papers. Rereading it, I remembered why it was so popular.
"Desiderata" was written in the early 1920s by a man from Terre Haute, Indiana, named Max Ehrmann. It became wildly popular in the 1960s and '70s. A spoken-word version made it big in the U.S., Canada and Australia. A Spanish version rose to the top of the Mexican charts.
Even in its heyday, it was easy to mock. The National Lampoon, for example, did a parody.
But there was a reason that "Desiderata" inspired people as diverse as Morgan Freeman, Leonard Nimoy, and my high school friends.
Here are a couple of its closing lines:
"And whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life, keep peace in your soul. With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world."

Texto completo: An activist, journalist, author, historian, science writer and entrepreneur are in the lineup of The University of Southern Mississippi's fall and spring University Forum series for 2019-2020.
To celebrate the passage of a constitutional amendment securing women's right to vote, University Forum has joined with Hattiesburg's 19th Amendment Celebration Committee to bring these speakers – all women – to the Hattiesburg campus, incorporating the theme "University Forum: A Year of Speakers; A Century of Progress."
"A hundred years ago, women across America spoke out and demanded that their right to vote be recognized," said Andrew Haley, director of University Forum. "Each of these women demonstrate the power of women's voices in shaping contemporary conversations about issues that affect our lives, from school violence to global pandemics to sexual harassment.
"Although this year's forum was inspired by the past — the topics our speakers will be talking about will change how you think about the future."
The schedule of speakers, their presentations, and program locations includes the following:
Fall 2019 Sept. 17: Samantha Fuentes, a Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting survivor and activist, "Conversations with Samantha Fuentes: Uplifting the Voices of the Silenced," 6:30 p.m., Bennett Auditorium
On Feb. 14, 2018, 17 people lost their lives after a gunman opened fire on the students, faculty, and staff of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Fuentes was among the wounded.
She was left with shrapnel permanently embedded in her legs and behind her eye and currently manages symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.
But Fuentes' story of strength and courage began before surviving one of the deadliest school shootings in United States history. She has endured bullying, racist attacks, physical abuse, and domestic abuse. Transforming tragedy into action, she has become an advocate for those who have been silenced and works to remind us that we have the power to change the world.
Oct. 29: Tena Clark, Grammy-winning producer and entrepreneur, "Southern Discomfort," 6:30 p.m., Bennett Auditorium
Clark — a Mississippi native and Southern Miss alumna — is a Grammy-winning producer and entrepreneur. She began her career as a drummer and engineer in rural Mississippi before she was discovered by Stevie Wonder.
Over the course of her career, Clark has written and produced for Aretha Franklin, won a Grammy for her work with Natalie Cole, and has collaborated with artists such as Leann Rimes, Dionne Warwick, Chaka Khan, and Maya Angelou.
A pioneer in the field of creating sound for corporate branding, she is the CEO and chief creative officer of DMI Music & Media Solutions and has developed promotions for McDonald's, AMC Theatres, and Walgreens.
In addition to her work in music, Clark is a civil rights activist and a champion for women's rights. Her recent memoir, "Southern Discomfort," is a "Southern gothic tale of growing up in 1950s Waynesboro — a lesbian raised by a womanizing father, an alcoholic mother, and a household of African-American help whom she'd sooner call family." (Kirkus Review)
Nov. 12: Sonia Shah, science journalist, "Pandemic," 6:30 p.m., Thad Cochran Center Ballrooms
Shah is an investigative journalist who writes about science, human rights, and international politics. Her work has been published in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Scientific American, and Foreign Affairs. Shah's most recent book, "Pandemic: Tracking Contagions from Cholera to Ebola and Beyond," explores the origins of epidemics and draws parallels between the story of cholera and the pathogens that threaten humankind today.
"Pandemic" was a finalist for the 2017 Los Angeles Times Book Prize in science/technology, the New York Public Library's Helen Bernstein Book Award for Excellence in Journalism, and the National Association for Science Writers' Science in Society Award. It was also a New York Times Book Review Editor's Choice. Shah has been featured on CNN and her TEDTalk, "Three Reasons We Still Haven't Gotten Rid of Malaria," has been viewed over one million times. Shah is currently working on her fifth book, "The Next Great Migration."
Spring 2020 Feb. 11: Angie Thomas, author of young adult fiction, "The Hate U Give: Finding Your Activism," 6:30 p.m., Thad Cochran Center
A Mississippi native, Thomas writes young adult literature. Her debut novel, "The Hate U Give," was a New York Times bestseller and won the Boston Globe-Horn Book Award, a Coretta Scott King Honor, a William C. Morris Award, and was on the National Book Award Longlist.
In 2018, a film adaption of "The Hate U Give" was released starring Amandla Stenberg. Thomas' second novel, "On the Come Up" was published in February 2019 and is already slated to be adapted into a film.
Thomas — a former teen rapper — places authenticity and visibility at the forefront of her work. In her novels and speeches, she champions diversity in literature and the politics of finding one's voice.
March 24: Marjorie Spruill, historian, "Votes for Women: The Story of the Nineteenth Amendment," 6:30 p.m., Bennett Auditorium
A professor emeritus at the University of South Carolina, Spruill is a historian acclaimed for her work on the American women's rights movement. Her book, "New Women of the New South: The Woman Suffrage Movement in the Southern States," explores the lives of eleven of the most prominent leaders of the women's suffrage movement in the South and their views on race and states' rights.
Her most recent book, "Divided We Stand: The Battle Over Women's Rights," delves into the rise of the modern women's rights movement in the 1970s and the way it contributed to the polarization of American politics.
Spruill is a former Southern Miss history professor and served as the University Forum director from 1986 to 2000. She is the first University Forum director to be asked to return as a forum speaker.
April 7: Jodi Kantor, Pulitzer-winning journalist, "Breaking the Sexual Harassment Story that Helped Ignite a Movement," 6:30 p.m., Bennett Auditorium
In October 2017, investigative journalist and author Kantor was part of a reporting duo that broke the story of decades of sexual abuse allegations against Harvey Weinstein — a prominent figure in the film industry. Their work helped spark the #MeToo movement and has led to new laws and standards of accountability concerning sexual harassment.
In 2018, Kantor, along with her colleague Megan Twohey and the New Yorker's Ronan Farrow, was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service. Kantor has written about the aftermath of the Weinstein story in "She Said: Breaking the Sexual Harassment Story that Helped Ignite a Movement."
Previously, Kantor covered Obama's 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns, and wrote a best-selling book, "The Obamas," that delved into the behind-the-scenes challenges Barak and Michelle Obama faced as they became President and First Lady. Kantor is currently a contributor to "This Morning" on CBS.

Texto completo: "Why would anyone want to buy anything online?"
This was the question that Guy Haskin Fernald, at the time an undergraduate student in computer science at Swarthmore, remembers hearing when he began work on one of the world's first e-commerce websites, NetMarket, in 1994. It sounds ridiculous today, but at that time, only academics and geeks used the internet; the rest of us did not -- and we shopped at the mall.
Mr. Fernald's question was answered 25 years ago on Sunday, after he helped open NetMarket and what is widely considered the world's first secure e-transaction took place.
Why that transaction happened at that moment -- not before or after -- is as much about technological progress as it is about politics and business in the early 1990s. If that first transaction portended a new world of commerce, it was also constrained by the blinders of 1994.
The mid-90s were a heady time. The internet, with all its promise, was just emerging, but it was coming on rapidly. The National Science Foundation had created NSFnet, the backbone for networks that make up the internet, in 1985. The number of hosts connected to the network exploded from 2,000 that year to two million less than a decade later.
Technological progress meshed with political revolution. The Cold War had ended just a few years earlier. The West had won because free markets and free societies seemed to reinforce one another. E-commerce expressed that newfound optimism about civil liberties and economic growth.
As the United States rebounded from the 1991 recession, the United States government, with a Democratic president and Democrats in control of Congress, sought to encourage growth while balancing the budget and embracing free trade across the globe. Policymakers rejected access fees, limited platform liability and, crucially, legalized public-key encryption. The Clinton administration, which was at first conflicted, eventually took very deliberate decisions to liberalize and defend the commercial internet.
The first e-commerce seller through NetMarket's portal was a small CD shop in New Hampshire with the appropriate name Noteworthy. The first buyer was another Swarthmore student, Phil Brandenberger, who logged on to NetMarket's website to buy a Sting CD. He paid for it with a credit card, a mundane process today, but in 1994 it was so futuristic that it warranted an article in The New York Times.
For the rest of us to trust e-commerce sites took some time.
Early e-commerce advocates emphasized the free in free trade. The first building blocks of online commercial infrastructure were, in large part, free. Many key technologies had their roots in academia and cyber-counterculture: open-sourced operating systems like Unix, server software like Apache, security protocols like Secure Sockets Layer and programming languages like Java made many aspects of the online store possible. The basic foundation of the internet, the packet-switched network protocol called TCP/IP, had existed for two decades, but it took these new technologies, which were built on top of it, to create applications like browsers.
For e-commerce to succeed required overcoming a contradiction built into TCP/IP: If the packets of information moving around the internet were open, how could you safely transfer financial information? The answer was public-key encryption, which was, at that moment, moving from a tightly regulated Cold War weapon into the public sphere.
Early access to strong encryption came from activists who created ways for civil rights activists to secure their communications from repressive governments. The technology, known as Pretty Good Privacy, was not easy to use. When Netscape released a form of public-key encryption, Secure Sockets Layer, in its browser in 1995, the process was easy and hidden away. The open internet could be secured, allowing credit card numbers, as well as other sensitive information, to be transferred with ease.
E-commerce helped keep us hidden from governments through encryption, but it also pushed us to be visible to businesses as we shopped. The web cookie, pioneered by Lou Montulli of Netscape, created a unique identifier every time a browser connected to a website. The cookie allowed us to have online shopping carts, but it also set the stage for us to be tracked across the internet. E-commerce legitimated encryption in a way that even governments could not resist, but also fostered consumer tracking in a way that we couldn't either.
The business infrastructure of the early 1990s made e-commerce possible in ways beyond the encryption. The early 1990s also marked the moment when credit card securitization really took off. In 1990, 1 percent of American credit card debt was securitized. By 1997, 51 percent was. Electronic payments, made possible through credit cards, were easier than ever.
If credit cards enabled checkout, then supply chain management made delivery possible. During the 1970s, Walmart had achieved its market breakthrough by computerized inventory and logistical management, and then in the 1980s other corporations, trying to keep up, began to manage their supply chains. With e-commerce still in its earliest phases, business thinkers were already hard at work considering how to use data to optimize their now global supply chains.
The 1994 Marrakesh Agreement, which established the 123-nation World Trade Organization in 1995, made those flows smoother than ever before. This increased economic interconnectedness, lack of any major wars, and the relative political stability of the mid-90s, quite anomalous in human history, made up the right geopolitical mix to enable the technical innovations behind e-commerce to come together. E-commerce seemed to go hand in hand with the triumph of Western democracy and logistical capitalism.
Today, of course, we know that there is no such determinism to either the internet or e-commerce. There is, however, a similar underlying problem to the one faced in 1994: a lack of trust. Consumer privacy and transactional security remain challenges for e-commerce globally, and it is not clear that all of it will end well. Here in the United States, we continue to struggle with how to balance privacy and commerce to preserve both civil liberties and free trade. The old struggles of capitalism and society continue in a new guise.
If we are a bit less blinded to the shortcomings of e-commerce than we were in 1994, we also remain guardedly optimistic, at least if our rising online spending reflects our beliefs. If the early days of e-commerce depended on trust, then the future of e-commerce depends less on the next technology than on how we choose to design and deploy that technology in a trustworthy fashion, just as we did in 1994.
Louis Hyman is a professor of history and the director of the Institute for Workplace Studies at Cornell, where Kwelina Thompson is a graduate student. They are co-authors of "the History of E-commerce," a research study by Cornell and PayPal, from which this essay is adapted.

VOICE OF THE PEOPLE; Trump's words, far from comforting

Texto completo: Seaford, L.I.: Exactly what kind of comfort could our
president possibly provide to the communities of Dayton and El Paso?WhenRepublicans claim thatthey are
prepared to combat gun violence,they are blowing
smoke in the face of allAmericans. Mitch McConnell
and his GOP have watched over 20 years of civilians and police being slaughtered by gun violence and have done nothing.
This only proves they can live with the status quo.Can we?
Bob Bascelli
Bronx: DonaldTrump's reading off a teleprompter and
mouthing those words written for him means nothing. It's
pure bull! He does not believe one word of condemnation of
white supremacists, white domestic terrorists,the alt-right
and others ofthatilk. Putin must be having a good laugh. He
w
PaulineGraham Binder
They are listening, too
Bronx: "In one voice, our nation must condemn racism, bigotry and white supremacy," the president told us on Monday morning. Does he, or his speechwriter, want us to listen to his words, take them to heart, and act on them? If yes, why tell us that it is outrageous to believe that some people - among them folks who own assault rifles - also listen to, take to heart, and act on other words that he has uttered, time and again, that openly, or in thinly disguised terms, exhort people to act violently toward others?
Miriam Levine Helbok
Look in the mirror
Manhattan: As Trump was decrying the massacre in "Toledo" (I'm assuming he meant Dayton), he declared: "Hatred warps the mind, ravages the heart and devours the soul." Could there be any better proof of this statement than the man himself?
Anne Stockton
Media fail
Bronx: The Fourth Estate is the information highway for the people. When the media is compromised by politics, be it right or left, it does an injustice to the nation. The New York Times recently changed a headline which read "Trump Urges Unity Vs. Racism" to "Assailing Hate But Not Guns" after pressure from anti-Trumpers. The fact that the news media can be politically influenced is despicable. Where do we turn to for the facts? Who can we trust to report the news accurately? It doesn't matter what your political preferences are, when media sets out to manipulate public option, it's an affront to our democracy.
Al D'Angelo
Lesser of two evils
Narragansett, R.I.: Outlaw guns and only outlaws will have them. Maybe that is better than what we have now? Jeff Tkacs
Take it or leave it
Mt. Sinai, L.I.: The white nationalists of this country have to get it into their thick heads that the 19th century is long past. They must either adapt and assimilate into our "melting pot" modern American culture or leave - it's a simple choice and they won't be missed. Karl Bean
The upper hand
Whitestone: Voicer Kalan Wood-Vincent is absolutely right that any Democratic candidate debating Trump will lose. But the reason is that there's a double standard. Democrats have to rely on dignity, unity, facts, documentation and reality. Trump can fire up his base with racism, bigotry, sexism, ignorance and plain ol' bulls-t.
Robert LaRosa
Don't resist
Manhattan: To Voicer Pamela Carter: You are correct. This tragedy was avoidable. All Eric Garner had to do is comply with a lawful order and put his hands behind his back. If this were the case, I am sure that no force would have been used and the outcome would have been different. It's time we stop blaming police officers and start looking at the contributing factors that leads to injuries, mainly lack of compliance during an arrest. Jose Rodriguez
A hypothetical
Yonkers: Just curious. What would happen if some miscreant with a bucket filled with water or some other unknown substance, e.g. bleach, acid, lye, etc., attempted to douse an officer with the unknown contents of the bucket and the officer, unsure of the pending danger, felt his well-being was at stake, drew his or her weapon and fired upon the douser? Would the officer be justified in using this force? How would prosecutors view this? The community? The media?
Thomas J. Mullen
Mercy
East Rockaway: Ditto Voicer Rhonda Castellani! Early mornings, it's my solace and comfort to solve the Daily News crossword puzzles while enjoying a cup of coffee. I look forward to this part of the day and it gets me out of bed with joy and aspiration! Lately, however, the puzzles are designed as if they are impossible to crack without Google or some other digital devices! Please, whoever styles them, ease up a bit and return to the patterns we used to have for many yeas prior! Tanya Cabrera
Standing together
Manhattan: Thank you, Voicer Rhonda Castellani, for writing your letter regarding the recent changes in this paper's Crossword II. It definitely has evolved negatively into something other than a traditional crossword puzzle! They should rename it "Crack The Code!" Burton Schein
And the polls say
Tarrytown, N.Y.: NYPD Commissioner James O'Neill should take an anonymous survey of 1,000 police officers asking them this question: If Officer Daniel Pantaleo gets fired, will they take PBA head Patrick Lynch's advice and call a supervisor every time they encounter a suspect who resists arrest as Garner did?
Jack Culkin
Hey, Teach
Dumont, N.J.: Bravo to you, Voicer Susan Caprio, for speaking the truth about what constitutes good teaching! I am a retired teacher who, like you, always tried my very best to create a learning environment in which my students, no matter their race, religion, etc. felt welcome, safe, and, if I did things right, developed a genuine love of learning. Teaching is an art and what makes a difference is not the color of educator's skin, but rather his or her sincerity, preparedness and true passion for this most noble of professions. Enough of this divisive and unfounded rhetoric; let good teachers do what they love doing! Have a wonderful school year, Ms. Caprio! I have no doubt that your students are in capable hands.
Jeannie McDermott-Weldin
Irresponsible parents
Middletown, Del.: Voicer Bill Brown wants automakers to install more equipment on their cars to help parents who forget that they have kids in the back seat. While I applaud his thoughtfulness, I don't think it should be required equipment on all new cars. While I realize that kids are the future of this world, parents must be responsible for them. They should put a Post-it note on their car dashboard, set an alarm on their cell phone, put something important in the back seat. Maybe automakers could make a free app. Don't make the general public pay for an over-engineered solution that only applies to a few.

Texto completo: Every month the podcast universe seems to expand exponentially, both in terms of listeners and programming. But that rapid growth makes keeping up with all the new shows -- let alone discerning what's worthy of your time -- even harder. So we're going to help with that.
Each month, we'll be assembling a mix of the latest releases, looking in particular for things that don't necessarily make it onto the "New and Notable" section of your listening app. We'll bring you a fresh mix, across genres and styles, of the most intriguing new shows in the medium. Here's what you may have missed so far this summer.
'Pang!'
'Los Angeles'
"Pang!" is an experiment in the dynamic power of the podcast medium as it endeavors to answer the question, "What does hunger sound like in America?" The first episode, "Los Angeles," is an audio drama in the style of old-time radio plays. First adapted for the stage, and now for headphones, this play is based on the oral history of an American family living in hunger. As you hear gut-wrenching performances depicting the life of a single mother of nine and her uncle's struggle to hold onto the family home of 70 years, you might wonder how a play that barely mentions food scarcity could answer that original question. Yet the second episode, which drops Monday, pivots into reality with interviews with the actual family members that this play was based on, who will "teach us how to hear hunger in every moment" of their story. The rest of this monthly series will give the same treatment to families below the poverty line in Miami and Cedar Rapids, Iowa.
'Bandtastic'
'Seabass of Earth'
For kids with a goofy sense of humor, Himalaya Media presents a science fiction musical podcast about "the most popular band in the universe." This intergalactic group, assembled by a super-intelligent spaceship named D.E.B.R.A. and her less intelligent robot sidekick, R.A.N.D.Y., travels to new planets to solve problems through song. Band members include a 12-year-old Earth boy named Seabass who can turn anything into an instrument, a synthetic singer named Synthia, a harmonizing three-headed sage, and a dinosaur D.J. who can only say "Yeah!" Each episode stays under 15 minutes and can be enjoyed by parents listening along.
'Backspin'
' Setting the Stage '
This podcast from the Wisconsin radio station 88Nine Radio Milwaukee seeks to answer one question: Who recorded Milwaukee's first hip-hop song? Turns out, it's more of a mystery than a Google search can solve. The hosts of "Backspin" -- the station's D.J. and music director -- take a look at the history of hip-hop before it got to Wisconsin, and interview M.C.s, D.J.s and musicians to figure out when it first arrived. Learn all about how the music genre left the coasts and took on a new cultural expression in the Midwest.
'Incel'
' Bluepilled AF. '
Unlike Islamic State jihadists and white supremacists, incels -- short for involuntary celibates -- are not, as a group, preaching hatred by promising a path to redemption or salvation through violence. Yet violence has flared, most notably in the Isla Vista, Calif., massacre of 2014 and recently in Toronto. In "Incel," a 10- part series of conversations with members of the community, the filmmaker Naama Kates explores their backgrounds, rationalizations and hopes. Kates takes a deep dive into what happens to a community like this as it is deplatformed -- that is, banned from mainstream social networks and internet services and relegated to the darkest corners of the deep web. She explores how the media has positioned incels at odds with the outside world, further distancing them and amplifying their echo chamber. In later episodes, Kates will talk to top posters and moderators of incels' online communities about the violence these internet subcultures can beget and, most importantly, why.
'Larger Than Life'
' King of the Street '
After the breakout success of "Dirty John," the Los Angeles Times's podcast studio has consistently churned out gripping investigative series. While its newest mystery, "Room 20," is enjoying a lot of attention at the top of the "Most Listened To" charts, the studio also released last month a biographical investigation of the street racer and peacemaker "Big Willie" Robinson. "Larger Than Life" tells the story of Robinson, a Green Beret who fought in Vietnam and, on his return to Los Angeles, used drag racing to unite even the most entrenched enemies. The outsized friend-to-all was featured in songs, movies, and was even said to be asked to play Darth Vader -- yet for some reason he has been largely forgotten in the seven years since his death. This seven-part series tells us how Robinson was able to forge peace amid chaos and violence and, ultimately, why he faded into obscurity.

'Locked'
' I'm Not a Monster Like Most People Think '
In the opening scene of this investigation from Boise State Public Radio and Mountain West News Bureau, Adree Edmo, a 27-year-old transgender woman in an all-male prison, composes a note making clear that what she is about to do is not a suicide attempt. It is, instead, what she feels she must do to her body in order for it to match her gender identity. The rest of the "Locked" podcast is the story of Edmo's lawsuit against the state of Idaho for the right to sex reassignment surgery. This reported narrative grapples with the issues of health care rights and access for transgender inmates. An impending ruling by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals could have widespread implications for the broader incarcerated L.G.B.T.Q. community, and the podcast will update when it lands.
'The Secret Lives of Black Women'
' Being a Black Face in a White Space with Bärí A. Williams '
There is a lot of compassion, reflection and affirmation in this two-friends-interview-a-guest-style podcast from the comedian/writer Charla Lauriston and the producer/writer Lauren Domino. Their mission is to reveal the secrets of daily and spiritual survival that allow black women to thrive in a society built on the premise that they should not. Lauriston and Domino are honest about their struggles with anxiety, depression and fury, and talk with their guests, like Tarriona "Tank" Ball, front woman of Tank and the Bangas, about their shared experiences and ways of healing. The first episode, featuring the lawyer and tech executive Bärí A. Williams, gets into the gentrification of Oakland; "diversity hires" and the homogeneity of the tech world; workplace microaggressions; and the constant barriers black women must face to simply do their jobs.
'Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend Mini-Series'
' Deep Dive with Dana Carvey '
Conan O'Brien's interview podcast show may not be exactly new -- he has already had over 30 hilarious, surprisingly profound conversations with comedy celebrities from his TV show who he'd like to be friends with in real life. But this six-episode series, "Deep Dive," is pure joy as O'Brien and the "Saturday Night Live" alumnus Dana Carvey riff, trade impersonations and nonsense words, and, as promised, go deep. The first episode starts with Paul McCartney (Carvey) reaching out to George Harrison (O'Brien) in the afterlife and struggling to explain President Trump, Kanye West, Kim Kardashian and Instagram.
'Tabloid: The Making of Ivanka Trump'
' Who Is Ivanka? '
Before her father's presidential win, Ivanka Trump was known as a New York City party girl, a beautiful, blonde heiress who frequently appeared on the pages of the tabloids dancing to DMX or along the runways of fashion shows. Vanessa Grigoriadis, the New York magazine journalist and host of "Tabloid," grew up in some of the same circles as Ivanka, and finds herself unable to square the fun, cool-girl socialite from the tabloids with the "icy fembot" adviser to President Trump. Grigoriadis interviews many in Ivanka's sphere, including her mother, Ivana, to determine whether Ivanka is her father's victim or his mini-me. This Luminary premium podcast will likely only be enjoyable to those who are critical of Trump, but the first episode can be heard for free here.

Texto completo: City conflict of interest rules clearly bar Mayor de Blasio and his family from ordering police detectives to help move Chiara de Blasio out of an apartment in Brooklyn, ethics experts told the Daily News.
City law says it is a violation of the city charter "for any public servant to use city letterhead, personnel, equipment, resources, or supplies for any noncity purpose."
A former high-ranking official with the city Conflicts of Interest Board batted down the excuse de Blasio spokeswoman Freddi Goldstein offered to The New York Times - that the involvement of the officers was "strictly voluntary."
"Volunteering is completely irrelevant," said the former board official, who asked for anonymity. "If they volunteered, it can't be on city time."
The News reported Sunday that De Blasio ordered members of his security detail to help his daughter with the move, which sources said was carried out under cover of night.
De Blasio has said The News' story was "unfair" - but he hasn't denied its details.
Good government advocate Susan Lerner, executive director of Common Cause New York, called for a probe of the incident.
"It's something the Conflicts of Interest Board should take up," said Lerner. "It's such a simple and straightforward rule that it should not be ignored."
Lerner and the former COIB official said it's premature to say for sure the move violated conflict of interest rules because all the facts haven't been made public - but they agreed that the rules are clear.
"You are prohibited from using your office for private gain, either for yourself, a family member or your business," the former official said. "You're also prohibited from using city resources or personnel for any non-city purpose."
A COIB spokesman declined to comment on whether the agency is probing the matter.
NYPD spokesman Phil Walzak said Thursday the move of Chiara de Blasio's belongings from her former basement apartment in Sunset Park to Gracie Mansion was investigated by Deputy Commissioner of Intelligence and Counterterrorism John Miller, who determined "that no improper conduct or inappropriate use of department resources occurred."
Walzak earlier this week suggested to the Times that asking cops to haul Chiara de Blasio's personal effects was more practical than hiring movers who would have had to undergo a background check before being allowed into Gracie Mansion.
"That doesn't cure the fact that you can't use city personnel for a private interest," the former COIB official said.
The Conflict of Interests Board has punished other officials for asking city workers to perform personal tasks.
Former NYPD Commissioner Bernard Kerik was fined $2,500 in 2002 for asking three city cops to research his mother's murder for his autobiography. And former city Correction Commissioner William Fraser resigned that same year after being fined $500 for having three corrections officers repair a leaky liner on his home swimming pool.
If Chiara de Blasio asked for a small favor, the rules might not come into play, said City Council member Joe Borelli (R-S.I.).
"If she just asked for help moving a heavy box, I don't think anyone would care. But it sounds like it may be more," Borelli said. "COIB has levied fines against hundreds of city employees for using city resources to assist in their personal chores. There must be one standard."
Sal Albanese, a former City Councilman who ran for mayor in 1997 and 2013, cited the controversy to highlight his belief that mayors should not appoint board members to COIB.
"It should be a more independent entity," Albanese said. "It really does give the appearance of impropriety."
Whether the move itself is deemed by COIB improper or not, sources familiar with it are fuming over the fact that it was allowed to take place.
"It's a joke," said one former cop. "If we get caught shopping on duty [we get in trouble]. Everything involving him, everything, gets swept under the rug."

Harvey Weinstein Started Selling His Real Estate About Six Months Before His Downfall; The movie producer put three homes up for sale in early- and mid-2017 and later sold a total of seven for an estimated $22.8 million more than he paid for them.

Texto completo: Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein began selling off personal real estate about six months before the publication of two articles that enumerated a flood of sexual-misconduct allegations against him, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of property records and people familiar with the transactions.
The purge resulted in the sale of six homes by Mr. Weinstein between October 2017 and April 2018 for an estimated total of $55.9 million. Another one of his homes is for sale. And in April 2019, he sold a commercial office space he owned with his brother and Weinstein Co. co-founder Robert. Robert Weinstein didn't respond to requests for comment.
Leslie Cohen closed on her purchase of one of Mr. Weinstein's Connecticut homes just three days before the publication of a New York Times article detailing his alleged sexual misconduct. She said that when she saw the article, she was upset and felt "deceived" that no one involved in the transaction warned her what was about to happen. Agents involved in the deal said they didn't know about the article.
Mr. Weinstein is scheduled to go on criminal trial in New York on Sept. 9. Prosecutors have accused him of raping a woman at a Manhattan hotel in 2013 and forcibly performing oral sex on another woman in 2006. Mr. Weinstein has pleaded not guilty to the criminal charges and has denied all accusations of nonconsensual sex. His lawyers are negotiating an approximately $45 million settlement that would resolve sexual-misconduct lawsuits against Mr. Weinstein.
The residential sales yielded an estimated $17.8 million more than the purchase prices paid by Mr. Weinstein, according to public records. The commercial office space brought $5 million more than the price the Weinstein brothers paid. The home Ms. Cohen bought in October 2017 sold for almost twice what Mr. Weinstein paid for it. But his Amagansett home, which he listed in April 2017, sold in November 2017 at a $1.65 million loss. Two of Mr. Weinstein's residential properties and the commercial office condo sold for below market value, according to local agents, but combined, they still garnered a hefty return for Mr. Weinstein.
Such a flurry of sales isn't unprecedented, especially following a death, divorce or bankruptcy, said Andrew S. Whiteley, an agent at William Raveis. But Mr. Weinstein's move to sell so many properties is much rarer. "I've never seen anyone do that," said Christoper Riccio, a New York-based real-estate agent.
A spokesman for Mr. Weinstein declined to comment on any of his specific real-estate transactions and said, "This is nothing other than Harvey Weinstein consolidating his property ownership to help make his divorce settlement a smoother matter, and to pay his legal counsel."
Here is a timeline of the sale of Mr. Weinstein's properties and of some of his legal and business complications.
April 2, 2017—LISTED

Profit (All profit figures are before fees, commissions and profit-sharing with other property owners): $775,000. According to court documents, Mr. Weinstein shared the proceeds of the sale with his first wife, Eve Chilton. Mr. Weinstein and Ms. Chilton, his former assistant, were married from 1987 to 2004 and have three children. Ms. Chilton couldn't be reached for comment.
Buyer: Leslie Cohen, a Westport designer and developer
"I don't know if I would have bought it at all," said Ms. Cohen, who closed on the purchase three days before the New York Times article was published.
Fate of the home: Ms. Cohen sold it in June 2018 for $1.425 million to the next-door neighbors, New York physician Arturo Constantiner and his wife, Caren Constantiner. Dr. Constantiner said their decision to purchase the house wasn't impacted by Mr. Weinstein's prior ownership of the property, but he thought Ms. Cohen paid too much for it. According to Westport building permits, the Constantiners demolished the home in the fall of 2018. The lot is vacant.
October 5, 2017
The New York Times article is published.
The article "came as a surprise to everybody, including us. Everybody took a deep breath and thought, 'I hope we can move this,'" said Beate V. Moore, Sotheby's International Realty, one of the listing agents for Mr. Weinstein's Hamptons family home.
October 8, 2017
Weinstein Co.'s board of directors fires Mr. Weinstein. He retains his ownership equity.

October 10, 2017
The New Yorker publishes an article detailing additional allegations against Mr. Weinstein.
The same day, Ms. Chapman announces she is leaving Mr. Weinstein. The couple, who have two children, eventually agreed on a $20 million divorce settlement.
October 13, 2017
Property: Hamptons family home
Mr. Weinstein takes the home off the market, but Ms. Moore and the Sotheby's team continue to market it privately, according to Ms. Moore.
November 15, 2017—SOLD
Property: Hamptons family home
Sold for: $10 million
List price: $12.4 million
Purchased: $11.65 million in 2014
Loss: $1.65 million
Buyer: Taisho Holdings LLC. Ms. Moore declined to identify the buyers behind the entity, but said some potential buyers were worried about being dragged into the headlines. "Some people will just say, 'I'm walking away from this,'" said Ms. Moore.
February 2, 2018—SOLD
Property: Westport, Conn., family home
Location: Beachside Avenue
Sold for: $16 million
List price: N/A, off-market sale
Purchased: Two adjoining parcels for $8.25 million in two separate transactions in 1994 and 2000 with Mr. Weinstein's first wife, Ms. Chilton
Profit: $7.75 million
What: 8 bedrooms in main house, plus two additional homes, 6 acres, main house renovated in mid-1990s for roughly $1.2 million, movie theater.
Mr. Weinstein kept the property in the divorce from Ms. Chilton and married Ms. Chapman there in 2007, with a fireworks display launched from a barge on Long Island Sound. In 2012, the couple held a fundraiser on the property for President Barack Obama's re-election.
Buyer: Andrew Bentley, who owns at least two other homes on Beachside Avenue. He didn't respond to requests for comment.
Fate of the home: The terms of the deal allowed Mr. Weinstein to continue living on the property until February 2019, Mr. Weinstein's lawyers said in court. Mr. Bentley has applied to demolish all three structures on the property. As of late July, the two smaller structures had been torn down, but the main house was still standing. Andrew S. Whiteley, of William Raveis, a local broker who wasn't involved in the sale, says he has spoken with Mr. Bentley about his plans, which are to resell the lots with either one or two spec houses on them.
"It isn't what modern buyers are looking for. There is probably some stigma to owning Harvey's house," said Mr. Whiteley, on why the homes are being demolished.
March 19, 2018
Weinstein Co. files for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.

West Village townhouse PHOTO: Allison Scott/The Wall Street Journal

Fate of the home: Under renovation
The scandal "didn't hurt the price at all. When you have such a prime piece of real estate, someone's gonna do it," said Christopher Riccio, a real-estate agent who wasn't involved in the deal but has sold a number of West Village townhouses. Few, he said, have ever sold for more than $25 million.
March 30, 2018—SOLD
Property: West Hollywood condo
Sold for: $940,000 to Colton Thorn, a Los Angeles interior designer, who will use it as an office and studio, according to Mr. Gorelick of Compass, the buyer's agent. Mr. Thorn didn't respond to requests for comment.

Purchased: $910,000 in 2015
Profit: $30,000. Mr. Gorelick said he and his client didn't know who the seller was until the deal was already in escrow, at which point Mr. Weinstein asked Mr. Gorelick through an attorney to accept a reduced commission. Mr. Gorelick refused, he said.

Texto completo: Have we become a dangerous country?
Uruguay seems to think so. Its Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued an alert after the El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, shootings over the weekend for Uruguayan nationals traveling to the United States. It advises they "take extreme precautions in the face of growing indiscriminate violence, mostly hate crimes, including racism and discrimination, which killed more than 250 people in the first seven months of this year."
Blaming the "indiscriminate possession of firearms by the population," it recommends everybody, but particularly children, avoid shopping malls, theme parks, religious activities, and cultural and sporting events. It warns about cities such as Detroit, Baltimore and Albuquerque, "among the 20 most dangerous in the world."
Venezuela piled on - not entirely credibly, given U.S. efforts to remove that country's regime - by recommending Monday that its citizens postpone travel to the United States or take "extreme precautions" given the "violence and crimes of indiscriminate hatred" perpetuated by "the supremacist elite that holds political power in Washington."
The Japanese are spooked, too: Japan's consulate in Detroit warned this week that its nationals "should be aware of the potential for gunfire incidents everywhere in the United States," which is a "a gun society," the Los Angeles Times reported.
Mexico, which lost several of its citizens in the El Paso massacre, even announced that it is considering legal action because the United States isn't adequately protecting Mexican nationals in the United States. Its Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced "a series of legal, diplomatic and protective measures to guarantee justice for the victims of the shooting and to protect the rights of Mexican communities in the United States." It will confer with other Spanish-speaking countries with similar concerns.
Suddenly, we're the banana republic, and the rest of the world is warning about the dangerous and hate-filled place under President Trump's administration. Pretty soon they'll be warning visitors to boil drinking water and to take preventive antibiotics.
But that's how it's been lately. In 2017, the New York Times reported, the Canadian and British governments updated their warnings to travelers about violence after the Las Vegas massacre. In 2016, when Trump's anti-Muslim rhetoric on the campaign trail was accompanied by an increase in anti-Muslim violence, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain cautioned its citizens about demonstrations against police violence, CBS News reported. The Bahamas advised young men to "exercise extreme caution" in "interactions with the police."
New Zealand warns visitors to the United States that "a number of politically motivated attacks have occurred," and, citing the Las Vegas shooting, cautions about "active shooter incidents" and "higher incidence of violent crime and firearm possession."
Germany warns of terrorist attacks, "an increased risk of politically motivated violence," and easy access to firearms. It also cautions about "long distances" to hospitals and says "treatments are expensive."
Britain, too, warns that "medical treatment is expensive" and cautions about "indiscriminate" terrorist attacks and border crime and drugs.
Canada warns about gang violence and says "even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time."
Now, where would they get such ideas about the United States?
Well, maybe it's because the president of the United States has been declaring to all the world that gangs and illegal aliens have "overrun" the border and flooded the country with drugs. American cities are so "dangerous," "filthy" and full of rodents that "no human being" would want to live in them. The leadership of the FBI is "corrupt" and the Justice Department is so dubious that "Justice" must be put in quotes. There is "no border security," there are "killers coming in and murderers coming in," and "deadly sanctuary cities" release "dangerous criminals." American carnage!
That vision of America, as outlined by Trump, is largely fiction. But our friends around the world would be justified in warning their citizens about certain realities of Trump's America.
Foreign nationals should take extreme precautions in Trump's America. So should the rest of us.
Dana Milbank is a columnist with the Washington Post Writers Group.

Texto completo: It is hard for me to read some of the reaction to a derided New York Times headline without a smirk, a sigh and a forlorn shake of the head.
The controversy begins with the paper’s original headline Tuesday over a Page 1 story describing President Donald Trump’s statement on the weekend mass murders in Dayton and El Paso. "TRUMP URGES UNITY VS. RACISM," the headline declares. It was changed for later editions to "ASSAILING HATE BUT NOT GUNS."
Critics on the left, led by New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez retweeting a veiled criticism from statistics guru Nate Silver, declared the original headline as evidence of the Times’ — and by extension, all mainstream media’s — caving to the right. Critics on the right, led by the usual crowd on Fox News and the president himself, declared the change to be evidence of the Times’ — and by extension, all mainstream media’s — caving to the left.
Advocates of both sides declared it evidence that the newspaper could not be trusted. A Twitter campaign was mounted, presumably uniting the opposing forces against a common enemy, to encourage people to cancel their subscriptions to the Times. This all struck me as ridiculous and shortsighted.
Neither side made reference to the story the headline described, which, it is probably relevant to note, had way more than 280 characters and which, while no objective reader could find it particularly balanced, conveyed a thorough description of the issues it addressed with substantial and substantive commentary from many points of view.
Why, I wonder, are we so eager, so quick, so hungry to bend any opportunity into a sweeping political generality?
It’s not that headlines aren’t important or that editors don’t approach them with care. They are and we do. Even before the Daily Herald’s designers had begun framing out Tuesday’s front page, editor John Lampinen emphasized that we must take care not to ignore the president’s emphatic and clear condemnation of racism in whatever headline we came up with. (Ours, by the way, was "Trump condemns racism, focuses on mental illness.") But headlines are just one component in the telling of a story. They are a summary, produced — as a Times deputy managing editor wrote in describing the evolution of the headline in question — under the twin pressures of time and space, and they are not especially conducive to expressing nuance.
The truth is that both New York Times headlines are correct. It’s equally true that the second more completely describes the story. It’s also true that neither summarizes the whole story. What’s troubling is that both were so easily transformed into irrelevant talking points for the right and left.
And what’s most true — what’s really behind my smirk and my sighs — is that it is such utter nonsense to decry The New York Times as untrustworthy because of a headline. Those who want to define the paper as liberal can find plenty of evidence. Those who want to claim that the Times cost Hillary Clinton the election by focusing on her emails will not be deterred by disputation. But it is utterly ludicrous to suggest that you will not be well-informed and thoroughly engaged if you actually read The New York Times. Or The Washington Post, for that matter, or The Wall Street Journal or many other newspapers, large, medium and small, that qualify as whatever mainstream means.
Will you come across phrases, descriptions, opinions, news judgments and, yes, headlines that bother you? Yes, you will. Unless you rely on a single news source that shares your views and your thinking entirely, you will sometimes be angered and disappointed by things you see or read. But, you will not be better informed by abandoning some reliable news source. To the contrary, if you want to be better informed, you will add to your sphere of information.
So smirk sometimes. Roll your eyes occasionally. But be bigger than the rare annoyances and shortcomings you encounter. You’ll be better for it and more knowledgeable regarding the events and issues you care about.

Texto completo: Trump says he’s likely to commute Blago sentence: President Donald Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Wednesday that he is likely to commute former Gov. Rod Blagojevich’s sentence. Blagojevich has served about half of a 14-year federal prison sentence for corruption that included seeking to sell an appointment to the Senate seat Barack Obama vacated to become president. "I thought he was treated unbelievably unfairly; he was given close to 18 years in prison. And a lot of people thought it was unfair, like a lot of other things — and it was the same gang, the Comey gang and all these sleazebags that did it. And his name is Rod Blagojevich," the president said, according to a tweet from New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman.
Ex-MSU dean sentenced: LANSING, Mich. — William Strampel, 71, a former Michigan State University dean with oversight of now-imprisoned sports doctor Larry Nassar, was ordered Wednesday to serve up to a year in jail after being convicted of neglect of duty and misconduct in office that stemmed from claims he sexually harassed students.
Pakistan, India feud deepens: ISLAMABAD — The political crisis over the disputed territory of Kashmir escalated Wednesday when Pakistan said it would downgrade its diplomatic ties with India, expel the Indian ambassador and suspend bilateral trade with its regional rival.
Cyntoia Brown freed: NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Cyntoia Brown, 31, championed by celebrities as a symbol of unfair sentencing, was released early Wednesday from the Tennessee Prison for Women, where she had been serving a life sentence for killing a man who had picked her up for sex at 16. Kim Kardashian West, Rihanna, Snoop Dogg and LeBron James had lobbied for Brown's release, calling her a sex trafficking victim.
Astrophysicist found dead: ATHENS, Greece — Greek search crews have found the body of British scientist Natalie Christopher, 34, who went missing while on holiday on the Aegean island of Ikaria, in a ravine near where she had been staying, authorities said Wednesday.
Third governor in 6 days: SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — Justice Secretary Wanda VÃ¡zquez became Puerto Rico’s new governor Wednesday, just the second woman to hold the office, after weeks of political turmoil and hours after the island’s Supreme Court declared Pedro Pierluisi’s swearing-in a week ago unconstitutional.
House panel sues for testimony: WASHINGTON — The House Judiciary Committee took another step toward possible impeachment proceedings, filing a lawsuit in federal court on Wednesday aimed at forcing former White House counsel Donald McGahn to testify about his interactions with President Donald Trump.
Hotel arsons investigated: HONOLULU — Hawaii authorities were investigating three fires that were intentionally set in different high-rise resort hotels near Waikiki Beach over the past few days, officials said Wednesday. A blaze on Monday caused $1.8 million in damage at the 25-story Waikiki Beachcomber by Outrigger. The fire was near a storage room on the 14th floor.
Parking lot van fire kills girl: MINNEAPOLIS — A 70-year-old man camping in a Walmart parking lot put a hot cook stove in his van, causing it to catch fire and spread to another van, burning two young sisters and killing one of them, authorities said Wednesday. Prosecutors charged Roberto Lino Hipolito of Long Beach, California, with second-degree manslaughter and two counts of negligent fire, all felonies.
Trejo helps save baby: LOS ANGELES — Actor Danny Trejo, 75, played a real-life hero when he helped rescue a baby trapped in an overturned car after a collision at a Los Angeles intersection. Authorities say two cars crashed Wednesday in the Sylmar neighborhood.

Texto completo: What's on TV
THE WOLF OF WALL STREET (2013) 7:40 p.m. and 11:20 p.m. on FXM. Audiences will have to wait until the New York Film Festival opens in September to see "The Irishman," Martin Scorsese's much-hyped return to the gangster crime genre. For now, they can revisit this movie, the director's lampooning of white-collar crime. Leonardo DiCaprio stars as the real-life former stockbroker Jordan Belfort, seen here as the yacht-riding, wine-gulping figurehead of a brokerage firm whose lifestyle is fueled by fraud. Along with a partner played by Jonah Hill, he rides a roller coaster of bad form that culminates in a Quaalude-impaired Lamborghini ride. "From its opening sequence -- a quick, nasty, unapologetic tour through its main character's vices and compulsions, during which he crash-lands a helicopter on the grounds of his Long Island estate and (not simultaneously) shares cocaine with a call girl in an anatomically creative manner -- to its raw, chaotic finish, 'The Wolf of Wall Street' hums with vulgar, voyeuristic energy," A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times. "This movie may tire you out with its hammering, swaggering excess," he added, "but it is never less than wide-awake."
FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS (1998) 10:45 p.m. on Showtime. A similar kind of addled excess (and, perhaps, fetishization of bad behavior) can be found in this movie, Terry Gilliam's take on Hunter S. Thompson's formative book of gonzo journalism. Johnny Depp stars opposite Benicio Del Toro in a hallucinatory spree through Sin City. Like "The Wolf of Wall Street," its drugged-out sequences can inspire laugher and nausea in equal measure.
What's Streaming
WU ASSASSINS Stream on Netflix. San Francisco's Chinatown becomes a martial arts battleground in this new series, which mixes a healthy dose of science fiction into its swinging and kicking. The plot centers on Kai (played by the Indonesian martial arts movie stalwart Iko Uwais), a San Francisco chef who gets bestowed with mystical powers and a mission to save the world from super-criminals. The first episode sees Kai going from slinging shrimp out of a food truck to dodging a baseball bat in the space of about two and a half minutes.
BELOVED (1998) Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. The eminent novelist Toni Morrison, who died this week at 88, won a Pulitzer Prize in 1988 for her novel "Beloved." In this adaptation of that post-Civil War story, Oprah Winfrey plays Sethe, a former slave, opposite Danny Glover as Paul D, another former slave who is Sethe's friend and eventual lover. The adaptation was directed by Jonathan Demme, who "succeeds uncannily well in bringing the novel's pulse to the screen," Janet Maslin wrote in her review for The Times. "Though this 'Beloved' begins slowly and sometimes reveals its earthbound side," she added, "it accelerates into a gripping, wildly imaginative film that's not quite like any other."

Labor has its work cut out for it

Texto completo: Whether organized labor in the United States is sounding a terminal death rattle or showing signs of a resurgence depends on one's perspective.
On the one hand, union membership continues to suffer a long-term decline, especially in the private sector -- it's down to less than 11% overall from its peak of nearly 35% in the late 1950s.
On the other, organized labor has notched some notable victories in recent years, including the fight for $15, which prompted California, Massachusetts and cities such as Los Angeles and Seattle to move their minimum wage to or at least toward $15 an hour.

Teacher strikes in 2018 brought higher wages and improved working conditions for teachers in such locations as West Virginia, Oklahoma and North Carolina -- long considered unpromising grounds for labor activism.
On the whole, however, things are not looking up. That's the theme of Steven Greenhouse's new book "Beaten Down, Worked Up: The Past, Present, and Future of American Labor," which was officially published Tuesday.
"One of the reasons I wrote the book is to sound the alarm that there's been a real decline of worker power overall," Greenhouse, who spent some two decades covering labor for the New York Times, told me recently. "Things have tilted very much in favor of corporations and the wealthy instead of workers." Congress enacted a huge tax cut for the rich in 2017, but hasn't budged on moving the federal minimum wage above $7.25.
"We're seeing Donald Trump, who promised to help workers, taking away overtime protections and scrapping the fiduciary rule to protect workers' 401(k)s. Young Americans don't understand the importance of unions and worker power."
Even if the 2000s are a period of less than unalloyed glory for organized labor, we may be entering another golden age of labor historiography. Greenhouse's book comes on the heels of historian Erik Loomis' book "A History of America in Ten Strikes," which we wrote about in February. (They cover some of the same events, including the Flint sit-down strike against General Motors in the mid-1930s and the disastrous PATCO strike of air traffic controllers in 1981.)
They're filling a gap left since the heydays of Melvyn Dubofsky in the 1990s and Irving Bernstein of UCLA, whose three volumes of U.S. labor history in the 20th century appeared from 1960 to 1985.
Greenhouse's book chronicles the rise of organized labor in the first half of the 20th century and its dizzying fall in the following decades. The rise was fueled by a worker solidarity born of the atrocious working conditions of garment sweatshops in New York, punctuated by lethal episodes such as the Triangle Shirtwaist Co. fire of 1911, which took the lives of 146 workers, including 123 women. The New Deal brought concrete protection for collective bargaining through the National Labor Relations Act of 1935.
Wartime employers negotiated for labor peace in the name of efficient production of materiel, and the economic prosperity that followed the end of World War II gave employees and employers alike an incentive to build on mutual goodwill.
Walter Reuther, a target of the infamous River Rouge assault by Ford Motor Co. thugs in 1937, had become head of the United Auto Workers' General Motors department.
Reuther and GM boss Charlie Wilson reached a groundbreaking five-year contract in 1950 -- the "Treaty of Detroit" -- including then-unusual pension and health benefits. As Greenhouse observes, the contract became a building block of the postwar American middle class.
The dream eventually faded. Greenhouse, like Loomis, sees the PATCO strike as a dismal turning point for American labor. Since history is written by the victors, the public impression of the striking air traffic controllers is of grasping workers who flouted federal law forbidding government employees to walk off the job while demanding a contract far more generous than other employees could win.
There's plenty of truth in the impression, but what is generally forgotten today is that the controllers worked under unbelievably stressful conditions and that the Federal Aviation Administration had reneged on promised improvements. Still, PATCO misplayed a bad hand. The union never took steps to win fellow aviation unions, much less the public, over to its side.
The all-important Air Line Pilots Assn. crossed PATCO's picket lines, which shattered its hopes of bringing air traffic to a halt. The public was irked by the inconveniences of flight delays and cancellations in the first days of the strike, and treated President Reagan as a savior when he got air travel back up to speed in short order, using military air controllers, renegade PATCO members and supervisors.
Most destructively, PATCO misjudged Reagan, who needed to show firmness in the first major crisis of his fledgling administration. He threatened to fire every striker -- and did so. "The union walked straight into the firing squad and Reagan was happy to oblige them," Greenhouse says.
PATCO's failure didn't only damage itself. The sea change in management treatment of organized labor reverberates to this very day. "That really emboldened managements to get tough. They saw the president of the United States bust a union and thought, 'Why can't we do the same thing?' " The strike "really changed the mood and the methods that management used in dealing with their unions and their workers."
Things have only gotten worse since then. "In no other industrial nation do employers fight so hard
to defeat, indeed quash, labor unions," Greenhouse says.
Even foreign employers that coexist peacefully with labor at home have been confounded by corporate and political hostility to unions in the U.S. Volkswagen discovered that in 2014, when it took a hands-off approach -- in fact, even a positive approach -- to an effort by the United Auto Workers to organize a VW plant in Chattanooga.
"Volkswagen considers its corporate culture of works councils a competitive advantage," a VW executive said at the time. But Tennessee's Republican establishment, in the form of Gov. Bill Haslam and Sen. Bob Corker, a former Chattanooga mayor, picked up the slack, even threatening the company with retribution if the unionization vote succeeded. It failed, narrowly, as did a second vote this June.
The consequence of this four-decade trend is the loss of the worker's voice in the workplace and American politics. Opinion polls show that an overwhelming majority of Americans favor a higher minimum wage, paid sick days and paid family leave, but they're not happening at the federal level because organized labor's voice is drowned out by the money and political clout of corporations.
The glimmers of hope come from union movements that attract popular backing and "achieve gains not just for themselves but for the public at large," such as the teacher strikes. "Successful strikes beget, encourage and inspire other successful strikes," Greenhouse says.
Another piece of the puzzle is politics. The Democratic Party neglected the ties with organized labor that had been forged in the New Deal, which Greenhouse argues contributed to the electoral disaster of 2016. In that election, he observes, Hillary Clinton lost three states -- Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania -- that had been traditional labor strongholds. "If unions hadn't grown so weak and the Democratic Party had done more to keep unions from declining, maybe they would have won those three states."
Indeed, union membership in Wisconsin, once the fount of progressive political thought, declined from 15% in 2008 to 8.1% in 2018, bringing the rate from above the national average to below the national average in a single awful decade.
An increased awareness of the consequences of unions' decline, such as income inequality, stagnant wages and deteriorating working conditions, seems to be energizing the Democratic candidates for president. But the road back to labor's health will be a long one.

Democrats Need a New Jobs Message; Debunking claims about U.S. workers.

Texto completo: Trade fights are making investors nervous and executives reluctant to build new plants, but the U.S. jobs machine is still humming. And a popular liberal gripe about the labor market turns out to be false.
On Tuesday the Labor Department reported that the number of U.S. job openings remains at a historically strong level—7.3 million at the end of June. Christopher Rugaber of the Associated Press reported :
Despite the flat readings in job openings and hiring, the figures point to a still-healthy job market. There are nearly 1.3 available jobs for every unemployed person. Historically, those out of work outnumbered open positions. The current figures indicate that businesses remain hungry for workers, a sign they are confident the economy will keep growing.
One might question whether the jobs machine can keep creating new opportunities while businesses remain so concerned about trade. But Democratic politicians have been raising other objections. Now the always insightful Aparna Mathur of the American Enterprise Institute explains why they're wrong:
Despite the steady positive news in the monthly jobs report, a recent talking point, oft-repeated, is that too many people are holding two or three jobs in order to make ends meet. Rep. Tim Ryan brought this up during the recent Democratic debate arguing that "the economic system…now force(s) us to have two or three jobs just to get by." In the earlier debate, Senator Kamala Harris suggested that the low unemployment rate is not cause for celebration since for many Americans, this still meant working "two or three jobs" in order to make ends meet. Similar sentiments were expressed by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), who during a PBS interview said "Unemployment is low because everyone has two jobs. Unemployment is low because people are working 60, 70, 80 hours a week and can barely feed their family." ... these statements are inaccurate, both because they reflect a poor understanding of how the unemployment rate is measured, and because they exaggerate the phenomenon of multiple jobholding in the US.
...The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) measures the unemployed by counting the number of people who are jobless, available for work, and have actively looked for a job in the prior 4 weeks. This means those working a part-time or full-time job are not counted as unemployed. The same person holding multiple jobs does not bring down the unemployment rate any more than that person holding one part-time or one full-time job does.
More importantly, the phenomenon of multiple jobholding itself is not widespread... multiple jobholding has been associated with periods of both high and low unemployment. Over the period for which BLS collects data, multiple jobholding peaked between 1995 and 1996 (6.2 percent of the population)... the multiple jobholding rate has continually declined. As of 2017, it was 4.9 percent.
...Furthermore, are people actually working "60, 70, 80" hours per week? ... Data show that, among workers with multiple jobs, the vast majority are managing either one full-time job and a secondary part-time job or two part-time jobs. Only a tiny fraction (4 percent) work two full-time jobs. If we extrapolate their average daily work hours to a full week, multiple jobholders work an average of 42.95 hours per five-day workweek, relative to 39.7 hours for single jobholders, though they are also more likely to work on the weekends.
Even before reaching a general election, candidates for the Democratic nomination will likely have to refine their jobs message and explain how they are going to maintain America's extremely healthy labor market. A new Economist/YouGov survey out today finds that among Democratic primary voters, 21% approve of President Trump's handling of the economy.
***
Something About de Blasio
The latest Economist/YouGov poll also demonstrates, consistent with other polling, the remarkable ability of New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio to alienate voters. While fewer than 60% of respondents in the survey know him enough to form an opinion, a full 42% already have an unfavorable view of the mayor. Among Democratic candidates, this puts Mr. de Blasio in a tie with Sen. Bernie Sanders for the highest percentage of voters expressing a negative view. But Mr. Sanders is well known and has nearly as many voters expressing a positive view, whereas just 17% have a favorable view of Mr. de Blasio.
A report this week in the New York Times suggests that many Gotham residents have come to the same conclusion as voters nationwide. Matt Flegenheimer writes that the "mayor turned quixotic presidential candidate seems sick of his city — and the feeling is mutual." Members of the city's press corps seem to be feeling the same way. Here's how Mr. Flegenheimer begins his account:
Aides to Bill de Blasio have long observed that he seems to grow happier with each mile of distance from the city he leads, and when the New York mayor arrived in South Carolina one Saturday in May, he had an air of weightlessness about him. His run for president, announced two days earlier, came with an overnight makeover that had the City Hall press corps tittering: fresh navy sneakers, de-fuzzed sideburns, pants that fit. A sprig of white chest hair curled skyward beneath de Blasio's open collar as he patrolled a nearly empty library in Columbia, S.C., looking like a brand ambassador for divorced dads trying to get back out there.

Texto completo: MINNEAPOLIS - It all started in 1999 with a playful little teapot with a red whistle at the spout.
Some critics wondered if the masses would appreciate it as "good design," especially in places like Peoria. The teakettle, designed by postmodern architect Michael Graves for Target, didn't immediately fly off the shelves. But soon, it became a hot seller, along with other items like a toilet bowl brush and a chess set, and the concept of design partnerships took off.
Others retailers have copied the idea to varying degrees of success. But two decades later, the high-low design collaboration remains one of the hallmarks of Target and has cemented its reputation as a purveyor of cheap-chic goods.
Target has done more than 175 of them - some big multiyear ones, others small and for a limited time - since first linking up with Graves.
Some have been so popular that they crashed its website. Remember Missoni in 2011 or Lilly Pulitzer in 2015?
Others have had a more tepid reception, ending up on the clearance rack, but still made headlines. Think the partnership with Neiman Marcus that flopped back in 2012.
Now Target is celebrating the 20th anniversary of that first collaboration by reissuing iconic pieces from 20 previous partnerships, including Graves, Missoni and Lilly Pulitzer as well as Philippe Starck, Isaac Mizrahi, Anna Sui and Jason Wu.
The anniversary collection, which will hit stores and its website on Sept. 14, will include nearly 300 items priced from $7 to $160, with most items under $50.
The company won't reveal the actual pieces that will be part of the collection for another couple weeks to build up the anticipation.
Target also has commissioned a book and documentary about its 20 years of democratizing design that will be released this fall, and the Cooper Hewitt Museum in New York City will have an exhibit about it, too.
While these design collaborations were an important ingredient in Target's ascent 20 years ago when they were still more of a novelty, executives and experts alike say they continue to be just as crucial, if not more so, to Target today.
"They're these periodic 'wow' moments that are so true to the brand," said Target CEO Brian Cornell. "The reaction it leads to from the guest - they love those moments. It's a reminder we bring this element of style that's accessible and affordable to guests across the country."
While they're not a big enough piece of Target's overall business to make or break a quarter, he said they help drive awareness of Target, traffic to its stores and its website, and keep the brand on trend.
In 1999 when Target first partnered with Graves, the chain was still adding hundreds of stores and expanding to other parts of the country. It was a $21 billion retailer with 851 stores in 41 states. Its main competitors were Kmart, which was then known for its blue-light specials, and Walmart, which was all about everyday low prices.
The design collaborations helped further distinguish Target from that pack at that time, said Wendy Liebmann, CEO of WSL Strategic Retail.
"They elevated what a big-box mass retailer was all about," she said. "It wasn't only about low prices. It was this notion that even if you are potentially lower income you were worthy of good design. That was a very big statement and a differentiating position for a popular-priced retailer to take in those days."
Today, Target has matured, its growth has slowed and it is opening far fewer stores. It's a $75 billion company with 1,853 stores in all 50 states. But the competition has gotten more fierce with more retailers selling many of the same items - and not just in stores, but also online, led by Amazon, said Liebmann.
"We see in our research how shoppers are willing to buy anything anywhere," she said. "Today, differentiation and expecting more is more important than ever before."
The seeds of Target's first design partnership with Graves were planted, curiously enough, during the restoration of the Washington Monument in the late 1990s.
Target, which had contributed $6 million to the project, asked Graves to design the scaffolding. Graves was 64 years old at the time, a renowned architect and designer who lived in Princeton, New Jersey, but who had little name recognition outside of certain circles.
A Target executive had told Graves, "We've been knocking you off for years," Graves said to the New York Times at the time. "So why not go right to the source?"
That young Target executive, a vice president in home decor, was Ron Johnson, who went on to have a high-profile career as head of Apple's retail stores and short-lived stint as CEO of J.C. Penney.
The idea of such a partnership wasn't completely new. Kmart had already hooked up with Martha Stewart on a line of sheets and towels. But the difference was that Target knew that Graves was a not a celebrity many would know.
Graves' initial collection of 150 kitchenware items was so successful that it was soon expanded to more than 500 items. It went on to be one of Target's longest-running design partnerships, sunsetting in 2013, two years before Graves died.
It was followed by other collaborations with designers such as Philippe Starck, who re-imagined baby products; Todd Oldham, who tackled dorm accessories; and Isaac Mizrahi, who offered womenswear. Makeup artist Sonia Kashuk's partnership with Target is still going strong.
In later years, Target managed to tap up-and-coming designers such as Proenza Schouler and Joseph Altuzarra before they hit the big time as well as more well-known brands such as Hunter.
These days, most of Target's partnerships tend to be for a limited time. The more popular ones, such as Missoni and Lilly Pulitzer, can lead to such frenzies that stores are mostly sold out within hours. Its most recent collection with Vineyard Vines sold out online within a day.
Now that Target in the past few years has refreshed its portfolio of private-label brands, such as its blockbuster kids' clothing line Cat & Jack, the design partnerships also have the added benefit of bringing more attention to its other new in-house brands, said Carol Spieckerman, a retail consultant.
"The overall effect is to freshen up the floor and take away some of the predictability that was beginning to plague Target," she said.

Texto completo: Headnote 'OF COURSE HE'S RACIST'
Democratic candidates for president excoriated President Donald Trump and his Republican allies anew Monday in frustration over rampant gun violence, the racist and divisive culture they accuse him of fostering, and his early-morning suggestion to tie background checks on gun purchasers to immigration legislation.
After a taxing weekend filled with frayed nerves, anger and tears, Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio and former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas, who hail from the states where two gunmen killed 31 people this weekend, strongly condemned Republican inaction.
Speaking with CNN on Monday morning from Dayton, Ohio, where one of the shootings killed nine people, Ryan demanded that Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the majority leader, "do something." . "People are getting killed in the streets in America, and nobody is acting," Ryan said.
O'Rourke, who is from El Paso, Texas, where the other shooting killed 22 people, continued to focus on a question he had been asked late Sunday about whether there was anything Trump could do to make things better in the wake of the shootings.
O'Rourke, who remained equal parts upset and incredulous, said in an interview Monday morning on MSNBC's "Morning Joe" that the president had exhibited "open racism" - an "invitation to violence."
"Anyone who is surprised" by the violence, O'Rourke said, "is part of this problem right now - including members of the media who ask, 'Hey Beto, do you think the president is racist?'
"Well, Jesus Christ, of course he's racist," he said. "He's been racist from Day 1."
Ryan and O'Rourke were just two of several Democratic primary contenders who expressed continued outrage about the shootings and the strains of white nationalism some said emanate from the White House. Authorities in Texas have said the El Paso shooter wrote a manifesto posted online that railed against immigrants and that said the attack was "a response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas."
"We have a president who actively demonizes racial and religious minorities, who coddles Nazis and Klansmen, and who wields white supremacy as a political weapon," Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont said Monday.
On Monday morning, Trump said on Twitter that "We cannot let those killed in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, die in vain" and called on Republicans and Democrats to come together to pass background checks, potentially combined with immigration reform legislation - a stipulation that would make Democrats likely to oppose it.
In additional comments later Monday, Trump condemned white supremacy but did not repeat his call for background checks. Instead, he called for stronger action to address mental illness and argued that the internet can "radicalize disturbed minds."
"Mental illness and hatred pulls the trigger," he said, "not the gun."
That contention, said Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., was Trump's attempt "to avoid truth."
"There's mental illness&hate throughout world, but U.S. stands alone w/high rate of gun violence," Klobuchar said on Twitter. "When someone can kill 9 people in a minute, that gun should never have been sold."
Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts also took issue with Trump's framing of the situation.
"White supremacy is not a mental illness," she said Monday afternoon. "We need to call it what it is: Domestic terrorism. And we need to call out Donald Trump for amplifying these deadly ideologies."
Warren and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York were among the candidates who called on McConnell to bring lawmakers back into session to vote on gun safety measures. In a CNN interview, Gillibrand called Trump's suggestion that gun measures be tied to immigration reform "absurd."
"He's linking the issue of basic, common-sense gun reform, that we should be going back into the Senate today to vote on, with this issue of immigration because, again, he continues to try to demonize people seeking asylum," she said.
Gillibrand was also one of a few candidates who turned Trump's remark that white supremacy should be condemned back on him. She reposted a video of Trump's speech with a comment of her own: "We have been. Now it's your turn."

DAYTON, NOT TOLEDO; Trump, Biden both misspeak on locations

Texto completo: President Trump misidentified the site of a mass shooting in Ohio in his remarks to the nation a day after a gunman killed nine and wounded 27 in one of Dayton's most popular nightlife neighborhoods.

If we are able to pass great legislation after all of these years, we will ensure that those who were attacked will not have died in vain. May God bless the memory of those who perished in Toledo, the President said while concluding his remarks. May God protect them. May God protect all of those from Texas to Ohio.

The victims he is referring to died in a shooting early Sunday in Dayton, a city about 150 miles south of Toledo.

Democratic presidential challenger Joe Biden also made some verbal miscues on the same topic.

Mr. Biden at a fund-raiser on Sunday referred to the tragic events in Houston today and also in Michigan the day before, according to a pool report cited in the New York Times. He meant El Paso and Ohio.

He later corrected himself, the report showed.

The Dayton gunman, identified by police as Connor Betts, 24, of Bellbrook, Ohio, was clad in body armor and armed with a high-powered rifle when he opened fire on people gathered in and around a popular establishment called Ned Peppers Bar, police said.

It's pretty obvious the president misspoke this morning, and that happens to all of us from time to time. Nevertheless, Toledo is happy to accept his prayers, even if they were meant for Dayton, Toledo Mayor Wade Kapszukiewicz said in a statement Monday. As mayor, my prayer is that our leaders in Washington finally summon the courage to do something - frankly, anything - to stop the senseless mass slaughter that continues to occur in our country.

Mr. Kapszukiewicz, a Democrat, said the United States is the only nation where mass shootings happen so frequently and again urged lawmakers to take action to prevent future tragedy.

We are the greatest nation on Earth, and we can do anything when we put our minds to it, he said. Americans are desperate for a solution. If only our leaders in Washington felt the same urgency.

Toledo City Council President Matt Cherry, also a Democrat, said Mr. Trump has not delivered for Toledo's working families and can't even tell us apart from our neighbors.

Mark Wagoner, Lucas County Republican Party chairman, did not respond Monday to a request for comment.

Texto completo: A former mayor is accused of Boy Scout abuse. The Dayton gunman's ex-girlfriend opens up about warning signs. And America is too dangerous for some foreign countries.
Here's the news you need to know Tuesday.
But first, $50,000 raised by neighbors: A New Jersey man with special needs owed thousands in back taxes. His neighbors paid it off in an act of kindness.
Hundreds say Boy Scouts of America failed to shield kids from sex abuse
A lawsuit against the Boy Scouts of America says hundreds of former Scouts came forward with previously unreported sex abuse claims. The suit, filed Monday, says lawyers identified 350 abusers not in the Boy Scouts’ disciplinary files – citing that as evidence the organization hid the extent of the scandal. In total, lawyers said they have nearly 800 clients who were abused while Scouts. The accused tend to be men of stature in their communities: police officers and members of the military, teachers and a mayor. Several cases reviewed by USA TODAY suggest the Boy Scouts of America could have done more to prevent abuse.
Ex-girlfriend of Dayton shooter says she saw his dark side
A former girlfriend of the man who went on a shooting rampage outside a bar in Dayton, Ohio, said a number of warning signs led her to break up with the 24-year-old. Caitlyn “Adelia” Johnson, 24, dated the gunman briefly last spring, NBC reported. She told The (Toledo) Blade the two bonded over struggles with mental illness. At first, Johnson found him "kind of charming" and intelligent. But she soon learned he had a dark side: Johnson said he showed her footage of a mass shooting on their very first date.

Countries tell citizens to avoid USA over shooting concerns
Foreign countries warned their citizens about traveling to the USA after a weekend of violence left 31 people dead in two separate mass shootings this weekend. The Venezuelan government issued a statement urging its citizens to postpone trips to the USA after the “recent acts of violence. ” The Uruguayan government issued a similar release warning citizens about increasing hate crimes fueled by “racism" in the USA. The alerts from the two Latin American countries came after it was discovered that the El Paso shooter posted a manifesto saying that the massacre was in response to an “invasion” of Hispanics coming across the border.
Heroes emerge: Glendon Oakley Jr. is being called a hero after the El Paso shooting, but he says attention is on the wrong person: "The focus should not be on me, it should be on what happened in Ohio and what happened in Chicago and what happened [in Dayton]," Oakley Jr. said as he fought back tears.
Next month, 10 new laws will loosen restrictions on public gun possession in Texas, allowing guns in mosques, churches and school grounds.

¿Por qué acusan a la publicidad de Trump en Facebook de estar ligada a la masacre en El Paso?

Texto completo: Un nuevo reporte deja en evidencia la relación entre la retórica que maneja el presidente Donald Trump y las palabras del asesino de El Paso consignadas en el manifesto que dejó antes del tiroteo.
La investigación de The Hill concluyó que la campaña del presidente Trump ha colocado miles de anuncios en Facebook desde enero de este año advirtiendo de una “invasión” en la frontera sur de Estados Unidos.
Los más de 2000 anuncios se publicaron entre enero y mayo y muestran cómo la campaña del presidente se ha aprovechado de un lenguaje que los críticos califican de racista y xenófobo para obtener apoyo político.
“La crisis en la frontera sur es aún peor de lo que la mayoría entiende”, dice un anuncio, publicado por primera vez en enero.
“Hice MÚLTIPLES viajes a la frontera para mostrar la verdadera invasión que ocurre, pero los demócratas y los medios de comunicación falsos simplemente no me escuchan” .
El uso de la palabra “invasión”, ha sido objeto de duras críticas en los últimos días después de que apareció en un manifiesto escrito por el asesino de El Paso, Texas. Patrick Crusius supuestamente escribió que el ataque, que mató a 22 personas, fue una respuesta a una “invasión hispana de Texas”.
El uso repetido de la campaña de Trump de la palabra “invasión” en los anuncios de Facebook fue informado por primera vez por The New York Times el lunes.
Otro anuncio de la campaña de Trump, publicado por primera vez en Facebook en febrero, acusa a los demócratas de no negociar de buena fe la financiación del muro fronterizo propuesto por el presidente, diciendo que “LA OBSTRUCCIÓN es mucho más importante para ellos que SU SEGURIDAD”.
“¡Tenemos una INVASIÓN! Entonces estamos CONSTRUYENDO EL MURO para DETENERLO. Los demócratas nos demandarán. ¡Pero queremos un PAÍS SEGURO! ”, Dice el anuncio.
La campaña de Trump ha invertido millones de dólares en publicidad digital, particularmente en Facebook, y los datos del sitio de redes sociales muestran que los anuncios que usan la palabra “invasión” representan solo una pequeña fracción del total de anuncios comprados por la campaña, reportó The Hill.
Según datos de la firma digital demócrata Bully Pulpit Interactive entre el 5 de enero y el 27 de julio, la campaña gastó $8.7 millones en publicidad en Facebook
Además de los anuncios de Facebook, Trump ha mencionado repetidamente una llamada invasión en la frontera sur durante manifestaciones de campaña y en Twitter.

Resumen: A day after the S&P 500 endured its largest decline of the year, stocks bounced back to end higher, helped in part by China stabilizing its currency.

Texto completo: Traders on Tuesday brushed off fears of a worsening trade war with China that had sent U. S. stocks spiraling down just a day before. China’s move to stabilize its currency helped to calm jittery investors.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up around 312 points, or 1. 2%, to nearly 26,030, while the Standard & Poor’s 500 rose 37 points, or 1. 3%, to almost 2,882 on Tuesday. The Nasdaq, which suffered the worst blow on Monday, finished 107 points, or 1. 4%, higher at 7,833.
“Reading the headlines that came out overnight, it seems China wanted to show they really aren’t manipulating their currency,” said Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management LLC in Minneapolis. “That eased investors’ minds. ”
The stage appeared set on Tuesday for further declines after the Treasury Department declared China a currency manipulator after trading closed on Monday. Stock futures initially dropped around 1. 5% Monday evening.

Technology stocks, which bore the brunt of Monday’s sell-off, helped drive the market’s broad gains Tuesday. Apple rose 1. 3% and Microsoft added 1%. The companies get significant revenue from China and have been highly sensitive to swings in the trade dispute.
Communications services companies also notched solid gains. Facebook added 1. 5%.
Industrials also rose. Aircraft components maker TransDigm jumped 13. 7% after raising its profit forecast and delivering solid quarterly earnings.
Energy stocks dropped along with the price of crude oil. Materials sector stocks also fell.

The gains on Tuesday were not enough to erase the year’s worst losses from the previous day when the Dow dropped 2. 9%, the S&P 500 plunged 3% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq plummeted 3. 47%.
“The news flow is very fluid,” Ripley said. “The real worry in front of investors is how much further will this trade war escalate. ”
Investors dumped stocks Monday after a sharp decline in China’s currency ignited fears that the country was retaliating against President Donald Trump’s latest tariff vow. China allowed the yuan to drop to seven per U. S. dollar, an 11-year low and a politically sensitive level, while its central bank blamed the devaluation on "trade protectionism. ”
News that the country also planned to halt purchases of all U. S. agricultural goods further fueled the sell-off on Monday.
Last week, Trump vowed to enact 10% tariffs on the remaining $300 billion of Chinese imports from Sept. 1. Many of these goods would directly hit American consumers.

Texto completo: Clothing -- especially dressy clothing -- should not simply be worn. It often requires alterations or D.I.Y. hacks to look as good as possible. And, crucially, garments should be cared for, especially when they are costly or beloved. Here are some things to consider. BONNIE WERTHEIM
ALTERATIONS: If you've purchased a piece that doesn't fit quite like a glove, or you have a well-worn outfit that's due for some fixes, you might want to visit a tailor or a dry cleaner who performs alterations ahead of your event. Before you just walk into the nearest shop, it's worth asking friends for recommendations: Once the fabric is cut, it can't really be restored. Wherever you go, make sure you drop off the garment at least three weeks before you need to wear it.
SHAPEWEAR: Let's start by saying that everyone's body is wonderful and nothing must be done to make it look good in a dress. But, if you would like your clothes to lay smooth and flat on your person, there are plenty of things you can buy. The folks at Spanx and Commando produce seamless undergarments that are virtually undetectable underneath even the slinkiest dresses.
TAPE: If, after the alterations and shapewear, something about your outfit still feels precarious, there's always good old tape. Kim Kardashian proudly uses it to secure her dresses and decolletage, and she says gaffer tape works best. There's also fashion tape and toupee tape, which are really just two types of double-sided tape with fancy names.
IRONING AND STEAMING: Creases can put a wrinkle in anyone's plans to look great, so before you go out, consider ironing or steaming your outfit and putting it on a hanger so that it retains its polished appearance. Our friends at Wirecutter, a reviews site owned by The New York Times, recommend Maytag's M400 iron for those who are in the market. Handheld steamers are a great investment, too, as they travel well and work like a charm.
ACCESSORIES: Have you thought about jewelry? What tie you'll wear? How you'll carry your necessities? Whether you'll need a coat, and which one to wear? These questions are best addressed at least a week prior to the event, so you have time to shop or borrow from a friend if needed.

2 largest U.S. newspaper chains set to combine

Texto completo: Gannett, GateHouse deal expected to bring savings amid industry decline
America's two largest newspaper publishers will merge in an effort to combat declining circulation and plunging advertising revenue, but will still face pressure to cut costs at hundreds of already cash-strapped publications around the country.
The $1.4 billion purchase of McLean, Va.-based Gannett by GateHouse Media, based in Pittsford, N.Y., will create a conglomerate that will own more than 250 daily newspapers and hundreds of weekly and community papers. The new company will retain the Gannett name and will have publications in 47 states, reaching more than 145 million unique online visitors each month.
Executives from both companies in a news release extolled the deal as an opportunity to slash up to $300 million in annual overhead costs within 24 months while "continuing to invest in newsrooms" - creating journalism they hope can attract more digital subscribers and advertisers at a time when the United States employs thousands fewer journalists than it did a decade ago.
But the efficiencies wrought by the merger also may result in publications that rely less on local reporters and more on USA Today-type stories produced or edited remotely and published in dozens of the company's publications. Journalists across the country fretted over whether the deal would mean a wave of layoffs.
In a memo Gannett sent to employees Monday that was acquired by The Washington Post, management noted employees' concerns about layoffs. The memo said Gannett expects there will be "some duplication and overlap in roles" and that over the coming months, executives will review "how the operations of our organizations will come together."
The deal may also mobilize other newspaper chains, including McClatchy and Tribune Company, to pursue their own mergers in a battle for big advertising dollars.
Rick Edmonds, a media business analyst at the Poynter Institute, said other media companies will be looking to cut costs and consolidate. Edmonds noted talk of deals between McClatchy and Tribune.
"Even if it's a tough climb, you're better off with more scale and particularly with some of the savings of not having to do human resources and all of that in two separate companies," Edmonds said.
GateHouse's parent, New Media Investment Group, will purchase Gannett for $12.06 in cash and stock per share. Media executive Paul Bascobert has been named chief executive of the combined company. Gannett's board unanimously approved the deal, which is expected to close by the end of the year.
"Uniting our talented employees and complementary portfolios will enable us to expand our comprehensive, hyperlocal coverage for consumers, deepen our product offering for local businesses, and accelerate our shift from print-centric to dynamic multimedia operations," Michael Reed, chairman and chief executive of GateHouse's parent company, said in a statement.
The deal will be financed by a line of credit from Apollo Global Management. Executives on an investor call said they have requested approval from federal regulators and that it is also subject to approval from shareholders.
Analysts say the combined company could generate hundreds of millions of dollars in savings from reduced overhead and more efficient printing and distribution, which could help stave off the effects of an industry in deep decline.
The combined company will also enjoy an expanded digital platform that executives are expected to pitch as an attraction to advertisers. GateHouse publishes 156 daily newspapers and 464 community newspapers, reaching more than 22 million people each week.
Gannett remains the country's largest publisher by circulation, led by its flagship USA Today and publications including the Arizona Republic, Indianapolis Star and Louisville Courier-Journal.
"Bigger is better if you're going after digital reach," said Doug Arthur, an analyst at Huber Research. "So, there will be a lengthy conversation around how this is going to be a digital powerhouse."
Greater digital ambitions aren't likely to prevent more short-term newsroom cuts, which have ravaged the local news industry in recent years. Whatever the ownership structure of newspapers, so many of them have closed in recent years that there are at least 1,800 fewer newspapers in the United States than there were in 2004, according to a study by the University of North Carolina.
Employment in the newspaper industry fell about 47 percent between 2008 and 2018, a decline worse than coal mining over approximately the same period.
Most recently, the Youngstown Vindicator, a locally owned Ohio paper, closed shortly after its 150th anniversary. Its owners said they had lost money in 20 of the previous 22 years. Several other once-daily papers have reduced their print schedules to four or even three days per week in an effort to save money.
Aside from national brands such as The Washington Post, the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal - which have sold millions of digital subscriptions - no newspaper owners have been immune to the need to cut costs in the face of declining subscriptions and advertising rates.
As of the start of 2018, daily newspapers in the United States numbered 1,277 with a circulation of 29.2 million, according to the latest data from Editor & Publisher.
"The newspaper industry is going to have to consolidate," said Michael Kupinski, an analyst at Noble Financial. "You need scale to transition to the digital future, and so cutting out costs through consolidation of facilities and distribution facilities is very important."
Jane Hall, a professor of journalism and media studies at American University, said she worried about the viability of local newspapers whose parent companies respond to stockholders' wishes, even at the risk of letting competitive journalism slip by the wayside.
"The business model is under duress, and the urge to consolidate and the pressure to consolidate and only look at the bottom line in a very shortsighted way is growing," Hall said. "I find this depressing."
Gannett recently fended off a hostile acquisition attempt from Digital First Media, the hedge-fund-backed chain that sells off newspapers' real estate and cuts newsroom jobs more aggressively than most other owners. Digital First argued that Gannett ought to ditch its efforts at growing its digital audience and prioritize cost savings. Gannett and GateHouse both instituted layoffs earlier this year and have indicated in public filings that cost savings will be an ongoing focus.
Most newspapers still derive the majority of their revenue from printed ads and print subscriptions, both of which have been in decline for years. Digital ads remain a minority of the revenue pie, primarily because the competition for advertising is dominated by tech giants such as Google and Facebook and because digital ads sell for mere fractions of the cost of the print kind.
Proposed solutions to the problems - generally focused on cost-cutting - have sometimes worsened them by turning off readers. The weaker newspapers get, the more readers and advertisers abandon newspapers, leading to the next round of cuts. It has also complicated publishers' efforts to sell digital subscriptions: With weakened newsrooms, digital newspapers often offer less to justify the cost of paying for the news.
Ever since Gannett four years ago spun off from Tegna, its broadcasting arm, it has been looking to grow through mergers or acquisitions, with little to show for it.
"I think Gannett is looking for some sort of solution to its future," said Arthur, of Huber Research. He said the chain could save a few hundred million dollars up front by eliminating duplicate management and back-office positions in departments such as human resources, technology, finance and accounting.
In some cases, the combined company could save money by printing its newspapers at one facility instead of two, and by combining and centralizing copy editing, design and daily print layout functions. Further savings might result from volume discounts on the company's massive purchases of paper and ink.
But newspaper companies have been employing similar corporate machinations in search of a solution for local news for more than a decade, with no end to the industry's problems - particularly in small-town and rural America - in sight.
"If you're not The Washington Post, the New York Times, hopefully the L.A. Times and to a lesser extent the Dallas Morning News or the Chicago Tribune, this has become sort of a death spiral," Arthur said.

The El Paso shooting shouldn't distract from the immigration crisis, even if Democrats want it to

Texto completo: Now that President Trump has condemned “white supremacy” for the 80th time in his first term, is it still okay to oppose the infinite numbers of unvetted migrants illegally crossing our southern border?
At the White House on Monday, Trump addressed the two mass shootings over the weekend in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio. The former was perpetrated by someone who was apparently obsessed with “unchecked corporations” engaged in a “takeover” of the U.S. government, the automation of jobs, and also an internet theory about a deliberate attempt to replace native-born white Americans with immigrants.
You’ll hear almost nothing from the news media about those first two prongs of the shooter’s deranged motivations because they can’t be explicitly tied to Trump. That third one about the immigrants, however, is everywhere and, naturally, is already being used by Democrats and liberals as a way to hush up anyone who objects to the United States functioning as a welfare net for all of Central America’s sick and poor.
Just look at the very first paragraph of a Washington Post story published Sunday evening about the El Paso shooting. Keep in mind that this is a news story, not an opinion piece:
President Trump has relentlessly used his bully pulpit to decry Latino migration as 'an invasion of our country.' He has demonized undocumented immigrants as 'thugs' and 'animals.' He has defended the detention of migrant children, hundreds of whom have been held in squalor. And he has warned that without a wall to prevent people from crossing the border from Mexico, America would no longer be America.
Three paragraphs later, the story, by Philip Rucker, says “the question surrounding the president is no longer whether he will respond as other presidents once did, but whether his words contributed to the carnage.”
Ah-ha! There it is. So the president’s legitimate warnings about hundreds of thousands of migrants dumping themselves in to our care, needing food and medicine, all courtesy of the American taxpayer, might be to blame for the nearly two dozen people shot dead by a maniac in El Paso.
That’s what the media have been pushing for years now. Somehow, it never pans out.
The guy wrote in what was allegedly his “manifesto” laying out his motives that his views on immigration and all the rest of his obsessions “predate Trump and his campaign for president.” He explicitly said that he blamed both Republicans and Democrats for mass immigration.
And yet the New York Times worked itself into a sticky mess attempting to link the shooter to the White House. The paper’s editorial board declared Sunday evening that the country has “a White nationalist Terrorist Problem." Even while acknowledging that the Trump connection was essentially nonexistent, the New York Times still put forth that “white nationalism has attained a new mainstream legitimacy during Mr. Trump’s time in office.”
How is that? Because, the paper said, Fox News hosts sometimes talk about problems caused by the obscene numbers of foreigners overwhelming our border. And remember, Trump sometimes watches Fox News! That's as strong as the argument gets.
Democrats and liberals want to shut down the immigration debate because it's not a winning topic for them. And what better reason to call it case-closed than a mass shooting by a lunatic preoccupied with automation, corporations, and immigrants?
Okay, well, Trump has said the magic words and, once again, condemned “white supremacists.”

"In one voice, our nation must condemn racism, bigotry, and white supremacy,” he said at the White House.

Great, we’ve checked that box. There’s no reason now that normal people can’t continue opposing the influx of Central Americans bum-rushing the border.

Texto completo: After several hours of downtime, 8chan, the online message board that appears to have been used by the suspect in the El Paso mass shooting to post an anti-immigrant manifesto, was again accessible for a few hours Monday, then back down again.
“8chan is coming back online around the world,” a message on the site read as of 10 a.m. Pacific time. “Shout out to our team working hard in the background to restore services.”
Sunday night, 8chan said on its Twitter account that it would be down for the next 24 to 48 hours after Cloudflare dropped it as a customer. San Francisco-based Cloudflare provides support against denial-of-service attacks on websites, so its move opened up 8chan to attacks that could take the site offline.
Calling 8chan a “cesspool of hate,” Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince said in a blog post: “The rationale is simple: they have proven themselves to be lawless and that lawlessness has caused multiple tragic deaths.”
The suspect in Saturday’s El Paso shooting that killed 22 people and injured more than 20 others, 21-year-old Patrick Crusius, is believed to have posted on 8chan a screed titled “The Inconvenient Truth,” in which he rails against immigrants and said the rampage was meant as a response to an “invasion” of Hispanics into Texas. The writing praises the suspect in another mass shooting who posted an anti-Muslim manifesto on 8chan: the man who carried out the attacks at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand in March, which killed 51 people.
The suspect in the Poway synagogue shooting in April, in which one person died and three people were injured, is also believed to have posted a manifesto on 8chan in which he complained about Jewish people.
“What these killers want to do is inspire the next, and 8chan is the place to do that,” said Oren Segal, director of the Center on Extremism at ADL, in an interview Monday.
Segal said he wasn’t surprised that 8chan was back up, and that it would be tough to keep it or similar platforms offline for long. He cited the Daily Stormer, a white supremacist website, and Gab, a far-right social network, as examples of extremist sites that have persisted online despite running into technical obstacles.
“The reality is that there is a market for this hate and extremism online,” he said.
Prince, the CEO of Cloudflare, said as much in his blog post: “While removing 8chan from our network takes heat off of us, it does nothing to address why hateful sites fester online.”
There were reports that 8chan — which spun out of 4chan after that online message board was deemed to infringe on free speech in the wake of the sexist Gamergate controversy a few years ago — has already switched to a new domain name registrar, and a new host for its site. Epik, which is also known to host Gab, was 8chan’s new host. After public pressure from people such as Alex Stamos, adjunct professor at Stanford University and former Facebook security chief, the company that leased servers to Epik cut it off.
That company, Voxility, said Monday on Twitter in response to Stamos and others who announced its ties to Epik: “We are all in the same team here! Thank you for the support and for the notes. The 3rd party hoster is blocked completely.”
Fredrick Brennan, creator of 8chan, told media outlets including the New York Times that he stopped working with 8chan’s current owner last year.
“Shut the site down,” Brennan told the Times. “It’s not doing the world any good. It’s a complete negative to everybody except the users that are there. And you know what? It’s a negative to them, too. They just don’t realize it.”
Brennan told the Washington Post that 8chan’s owner, Jim Watkins, makes little money from the site. Watkins, a U.S. military veteran and web entrepreneur who now lives in the Philippines, would not comment to the Washington Post.
In a press conference Monday, President Donald Trump, whose racist rhetoric is being blamed for inciting violence against immigrants, said, “We must shine light on the dark recesses of the internet and stop mass murders before they start. The perils of the internet and social media cannot be ignored.”
Trump has repeatedly spoken of immigrants “invading” the United States.
“According to Facebook’s ad archive, Trump has run around 2,200 FB ads since May 2018 mentioning the word ‘invasion’,” tweeted Natalie Martinez, researcher for Media Matters for America. “Scrolling through, all of them seem to be about immigration.”

Texto completo: MOSCOW -- Andrei Chernikov, an information-technology specialist from western Ukraine, was near the end of Yuval Noah Harari's book "21 Lessons for the 21st Century" when he stumbled onto something that concerned him directly -- a description in the "Post-Truth" chapter of how Russia's government in 2014 attempted to hide its invasion of Ukraine and annexation of Crimea.
Mr. Chernikov, 35, was reading a hard copy of the book in Ukrainian, but when he switched to the Russian e-book version on his tablet, the same chapter contained different material. Instead of events in Crimea, it began with an analysis of President Trump's statements to illustrate the proliferation of fake news in the modern world.
"The difference between Ukrainian and Russian languages texts powerfully exposes the stated issues," Mr. Chernikov wrote in a Facebook post that quickly went viral.
Other discrepancies emerged, causing an uproar in Ukraine, Russia and beyond. The New York Times found that the Russian version of the book was heavily censored, with mentions of the fighting in Ukraine and Crimea removed and criticism of the Russian government toned down or cut, among other changes. The Russian version didn't mention any of the changes.
In one instance, Russia was replaced with Hungary as a country that is experimenting with new types of non-liberal democracy and dictatorship. The sections which described Russia as an "ideologically bankrupt country" where "oligarchs monopolize most of a country's wealth and power" were removed, as was the description of Russian President Vladimir V. Putin as a leader with "no global worldview."
For Mr. Chernikov, the omission of Russia's invasion of his country was particularly stinging. "People who perished in eastern Ukraine are buried 150 meters away from where I live," he said in a phone interview from his home in Ivano-Frankivsk. "What I am worried about here is that the authoritarian regime has implemented itself in Russia in full."
Following the outcry, Mr. Harari, in an interview, tried to explain what happened.
He agreed to omit the mentions of Mr. Putin's announcement about Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea, he said, seeing it as a necessary compromise to make the book available to Russian readers.
"I really faced a dilemma whether to change these examples and publish the book or to leave them in and publish nothing," Mr. Harari said. "I would never agree to write something which is not true, and I would never agree to change the main message of the book."
Still, he was troubled to learn of other changes that he had not approved. For example, in the original book's dedication, Mr. Harari references his husband, noting that "I only know how to write books. He does everything else." But in the Russian translation, "husband" was changed to "partner."
"If that's true, I'm really furious," he said. "I'm openly gay. I go around the world speaking about it."
Mr. Harari also was surprised to learn that his description of Russian aggression in Crimea in other sections of the book had been altered. He said he would contact his Russian publisher to object to the changes that he didn't authorize, and he worries that the attention the book is drawing could increase scrutiny.
The Russian publisher, Sindbad, declined to comment, saying that its main editor is away from Moscow and will be unavailable for several weeks.
Mr. Harari, an Israeli historian and philosopher, rose to prominence with the English translation of his 2014 best seller, "Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind." He followed up with a sequel, "Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow" and then published "21 Lessons for the 21st Century," a collection of essays that explores the technological and political problems humanity must solve in the coming decades. In a review for The New York Times Book Review, Bill Gates called the book "fascinating" and praised Harari for sparking "a crucial global conversation about how to take on the problems of the 21st century."
Mr. Harari's works are published in more than 50 languages, and he holds world rights to his books, which allows him to approve or decline requests for translation rights.
Foreign publishers often make changes when translating books, typically to make them more accessible to readers in other countries or languages. Publishers sometimes censor sensitive material without notifying the authors, who don't discover the changes until readers point them out.
Andrew Solomon was infuriated to learn that the Chinese translation of his 2001 book about depression, "The Noonday Demon," left out his references to being gay, despite a provision in his contract stating that he had approval over any changes from the original. He only learned of the changes after PEN America, a free-speech organization, checked the translations against the originals of several books as part of a report on Chinese censorship.
"The dishonesty of the publisher was as troubling as the censorship," Mr. Solomon said. He's since rescinded translation rights from that company and sold them to another publisher in China that will release an unexpurgated edition.
Although censorship has been declared illegal in Russia, the situation with Mr. Harari's book reminded many of Soviet-era methods. For instance, Ernest Hemingway's "For Whom the Bell Tolls" was published for the first time in 1968 with at least 20 cuts, according to Russian researchers. More recently, "Rocketman," a movie released earlier this year based on the life of Elton John, had gay scenes cut from the Russian version, according to film critics.
Mr. Harari said that in general, he is in favor of making changes in order to reach a global audience, as long as those changes don't undermine the substance of his arguments. "We are living in a more complicated reality, and it's important to reach people in nondemocratic societies," he said. "And for that you have to make compromises."
Yet some reform advocates see such compromises as a setback. Natalia Arno, the president and founder of the nonprofit Free Russia Foundation, said she felt it was hypocritical of Mr. Harari to write about "post-truth" and information manipulation, then omit his reference to disinformation coming from the Kremlin.
She added that he was wrong to think that the only way to reach Russian readers was to alter the book when bootleg translations of banned books and articles are common. "If this book was prohibited in Russia," she said, "many more Russians would read it."

Texto completo: "The Last Five Years," a contemporary musical about a disintegrating marriage, tells its simple story in 14 songs, via an interesting and unusual structure.

Now at the Station Theatre in Urbana, where it opened Thursday night, the musical by composer/playwright Jason Robert Brown opens with Cathy singing "Still Hurting," about the breakup of her marriage to Jamie, an aspiring novelist. She proceeds to sing of the love affair from its end to its beginning, while Jamie, a novelist, sings of it chronologically, or from beginning to end. They meet in the middle, at their wedding.

The musical, with its simple set -- a small black table, two chairs and large photographs on the wall showing the couple in happy days Ð offers an intimate, some say voyeuristic, portrayal of a doomed love between a confident young Jewish novelist and an aspiring Gentile actress (one song Jamie sings is titled "Shiksa Goddess") whose career doesn't take off as his does.

The one-act musical premiered in 2001 at the Northlight Theatre in Skokie and then went off-Broadway the following year. Time magazine named it one of the best 10 shows of 2001, while The New York Times called it a"modest musical with a huge following." A film adaptation was released in 2014.

Fans who spoke to the Times about "The Last Five Years" have used some of its song lyrics in marriage proposals and wedding toasts (let's hope those unions had better luck). Another playwright admired the structure of the piece, saying it ingeniously tells of one person in a relationship going in one direction and the other going the opposite way. Indeed.

Director Chelsea Collier, in a first production at the Station, double-cast the musical, with David French and Jenna Kohn on odd dates, and Bryan Goode and Mariana Seda on even-numbered dates. The double-casting was wise; the songs, as do many contemporary show tunes, are somewhat difficult, with no hooks, and require stamina of the singers. In this production, they are backed by a four-piece combo: Jon Faw, guitar/bass; Barbara Hedlund, cello; Collin Jung, violin; and Ty Tuttle, piano.

French and Kohn sang the roles on opening night, when I saw the musical. In his Station debut, French displays great presence; he comes off as feeling quite comfortable on stage and has the confidence to pull off the character, described by some as arrogant. He also articulates well the song lyrics.

Kohn, a junior in the acting program at the University ofIllinois, also is a likable performer, aptly getting across the insecurities of her character. She perhaps had the more difficult task of opening the play with a sad ballad about the breakup of hers and Jamie's relationship. She later shone in the upbeat "A Summer in Ohio," earning hearty applause from the audience.

However, I had a hard time discerning some of the lyrics of the songs she sang. Perhaps it was the microphone or the pitch at which she was required to sing. I had no trouble, though, understanding French.

The two meet again on stage at the end of the 90-minute musical (there is no intermission) to sing "Goodbye Until Tomorrow/I Could Never Rescue You." Cathy is happy and glowing; Jamie is sad and disappointed. It makes for an effective and moving ending.

Epstein became lost in his own perversely tragic fantasy

Texto completo: The more we learn, the more Jeffrey Epstein resembles an evil comic book character for the developmentally arrested intellectual — the charming-but-lurid mastermind with a plot to take over the world by impregnating scores of women on a remote desert estate.
Last Wednesday, The New York Times reported that the financier/convicted sex offender/philanthropist — and now accused sex trafficker — is also a "transhumanist," who had big plans for humankind. Epstein apparently told one scientist that he hoped to seed the human race with his own DNA by impregnating 20 women at a time at his New Mexico ranch, named "Zorro."
Transhumanism is the theory that the human population can be enhanced through technologies such as artificial intelligence and genetic engineering. Or eugenics by any other name. Epstein seems to have believed that he was that rare breed that ought to be replicated.
The carriers of Epstein’s apparently rarefied spermatozoa wouldn’t be the younger, underage sexual partners he allegedly prefers. Instead, according to the Times’ reporting, his maternal vehicles would be adult women whose intellectual qualifications would have been established through academic achievement.
For salon dinners he hosted at his Manhattan manse, Epstein often invited scientists as well as a sampling of attractive, accomplished women. Some of the scientists theorized that the women were being vetted as potential candidates for Epstein’s very special black book, according to the Times.
One can only imagine the conversations at such soirees: So, Penelope, what do you think of transhumanism? Oh, you do? And how do you like the desert air?
The male invitees weren’t your run-of-the-mill scientists but were some of the most renowned, innovative minds in research and academia. Among them was Steven Pinker, the Harvard cognitive psychologist and popular science author, who seems to have seen through Epstein, calling him an "intellectual impostor." Pinker told the Times that Epstein would abruptly shift topics and make juvenile remarks. To the layman’s eye, such behavior suggests a purposeful deflection when the topic at hand is reaching a point beyond the speaker’s comfort range.
Others on Epstein’s guest lists apparently were seduced by his charm and intellect, as well as his wealth, which he reportedly dangled as bait for funding-starved researchers. He was generous, often donating to a variety of interests and causes, including the Clinton Foundation. But he wasn’t convinced that helping the starving masses was productive in the right sense, arguing that providing food and health care to the poor would only heighten the risk of overpopulation.
Pinker, who said he was present when Epstein floated this idea at a gathering at Harvard, dissented, arguing that the evidence points to the contrary. Gods don’t like to be contradicted, and Pinker was thereafter told he’d been "voted off the island" and banished from future gatherings.
Speaking of which, Epstein’s private island in the Caribbean — which he dubs "Little St. Jeff’s" — is of renewed interest thanks to an NBC News report last week. Apparently, a blue-and-white striped, block-shaped building on it bears no resemblance to the octagonally shaped design that had been approved for a music hall, according to permit records.
What the structure does resemble, however, is a pharaoh’s headdress. Might this have been intended as a mausoleum for Epstein’s remains? That is, other than his head and penis, which he reportedly wished to have frozen. Also a fan of cryogenics, believing that frozen human parts and bodies could be resurrected in the future, Epstein is no ordinary bloke. Indeed, he is a perversely tragic figure.
Burdened with supra-human fantasies and the means to explore them, it seems that Epstein became lost in his own fable. Wandering the skies in his private jet, enamored of his own mind and image, he forgot that he was merely mortal and may have flown too close to the sun. Confined now to a jail cell (with further punishment perhaps to come) — and removed from his luxurious kingdom, his freedom and the company of luminaries who suffused his ego with admiration — his suffering must be immense.
And so richly deserved.

Texto completo: Visual artists have connected with Ferguson in the most intimate way possible.
They've painted boarded-up windows and used artifacts from the protests in their work. And everything from that plywood street art to recent sculptures, paintings and more has been exhibited in museums here and across the country.
In November 2014, after news that a grand jury declined to indict the police officer who shot Michael Brown, some protesters broke windows on South Grand Boulevard. More than 140 artists came to help.
"We're just letting the artists be creative and create a message of unity and support on South Grand," Rachel Witts, South Grand Community Improvement District executive director, told the Post-Dispatch.
But not everyone appreciated the painted boards in Ferguson.
"It's an attempt to whitewash the pain the community has suffered," one said.
Organized exhibitions came as early as October 2014, when Freida Wheaton rallied contributors for "Hands Up, Don't Shoot: Artists Respond," shown in more than a dozen galleries. Some 100 artists contributed to the event presented by the Alliance of Black Art Galleries.
(Similarly, in Brooklyn, more than 600 proposals arrived after the nonprofit space Smack Mellon called in 2015 for art addressing racism, police violence and social justice.)
"All art galleries, especially ones located on universities, have a responsibility to address topical issues that are going to be important to their community and their students," Terry Suhre, director of Gallery 210 at UMSL, said in 2014 to KWMU.
The following February, a picture book for kids showed some of the plywood artwork. "Painting for Peace in Ferguson" was written by Carol Swartout Klein. She followed that book, a local bestseller, with a similar coloring book. And by 2016, many of the plywood boards that had been saved were put on display in various venues.
A different art exhibit created controversy in 2016 for the Contemporary Art Museum St. Louis.
Kelley Walker, who is white, had altered images of black civil rights protesters and black women with streaks of toothpaste and chocolate. Artists called for a boycott of the works, which had been made before the shooting of Brown.
Many onlookers said anger over the exhibit grew because a question-and-answer session with Walker, and the museum's chief curator, left residents feeling the replies were terse and didn't explain the art's purpose.
Artist Damon Davis wrote then that some of the works were particularly inappropriate considering "the current climate of race in St. Louis -- knowing this is the epicenter of this new incarnation of the Civil Rights Movement."
The curator, Jeffrey Uslip, resigned.
Last year, the Contemporary had an exhibition by African American artist Sanford Biggers, who titled one of the sculptures on display "BAM (for Michael)." Biggers now has an even bigger sculpture, about 8 feet tall, honoring Brown in Montgomery, Ala., at the Legacy Museum: From Enslavement to Mass Incarceration.
While in St. Louis, Biggers met Brown's mother, Lezley McSpadden. A CAM news release quoted Biggers: "When she said 'thank you for thinking about my son,' my honest response was that I have never stopped."
In September, the Contemporary will again include artwork with a reference to Ferguson, but it seems to indicate that artistic references may be becoming more subtle. Bethany Collins uses the text of the U.S. Department of Justice's report on blind-embossed paper artworks, which require up-close scrutiny to read.
Collins is "interested in the intersection of race and language," says curator Wassan Al-Khudhair. The exhibition, which opens Sept. 6, isn't about Ferguson per se, but it's part of the museum's effort to "show the work of artists who are finding ways to talk about what is currently happening," she says, and connects local and national concerns.
Last fall, the St. Louis Art Museum's popular exhibition of Kehinde Wiley paintings featured local residents, one of whom wore a cap emblazoned with "Ferguson."
Wiley had gone to the town and to north St. Louis to "street cast" his models. He definitely wanted a Ferguson link, says Hannah Klemm, assistant curator of modern and contemporary art.
Although Wiley had not told models what to wear when he invited them to pose for photos, the Ferguson cap would end up helping "brand the show visibly as being connected to Ferguson," Klemm says.
When the paintings went on display, the models and their families came to the historic, traditional venue and felt more welcome than they might have in the past, she says.
Klemm says other visiting artists have also asked to be taken to see Ferguson. She says today's New York artists seem more aware of things happening in midsize cities and are referencing it in their work.
She believes interest in "socially oriented black art" continues to build among museum curators.
In 2016, Julie Mehretu exhibited her painting "Conjured Parts (eye), Ferguson" in New York, and the next year, a gallery there featured St. Louis artist Kahlil Robert Irving, whose tabletop creations included cut-up headlines about Michael Brown.
A new exhibition has also opened at the famous Guggenheim. The show's work was inspired by the death of a black man at the hands of police.
It's not about Brown, however, but a student named Michael Stewart and involves paintings from the 1980s by Jean-Michel Basquiat. ChaÃ©dria LaBouvier, an independent curator, is the first black woman to organize a solo exhibition at the Guggenheim, writes the New York Times.
It's impossible not to link that exhibition to the artistic responses to Brown's and others' more recent deaths. When one of the Basquiat paintings was on display at Williams College in 2016, a news release said:
"Thirty-three years after Basquiat painted 'Defacement,' the work takes on new critical resonance. At a time when the reality of extrajudicial violence against black Americans is at the forefront of national conversations, Basquiat's painting is a reminder of the long-standing history and continued reality of such violence."
It seems that Brown's and others' recent deaths have inspired art museums to look not only forward but also back.

Texto completo: President Trump was wrong to personally attack Rep. Elijah E. Cummings, D.-Md., a man widely respected by both Democrats and Republicans alike. But Trump was absolutely right when he called Baltimore "dangerous," "filthy" and "rodent infested" — that is, if you can believe what you read in the "failing New York Times."
In March, the Times Sunday magazine published a heart-rending story entitled "The Tragedy of Baltimore," which chronicled the precipitous decline of the city. It described how then-Mayor Catherine Pugh (D) toured the Highlandtown section of southeast Baltimore, as community leaders showed her a block where prostitutes gathered and there were piles of uncollected garbage and a liquor store that allowed drunks to congregate while pretending to wait for the bus. "'Watch your step,' someone called out as the group neared a dead rat," the Times reported.
The city's "regression has been swift and demoralizing," the Times wrote, adding that officials have "struggled to respond to the rise in disorder, leaving residents with the unsettling feeling that there was no one in charge." One resident contrasted the tourist-friendly Inner Harbor with her West Baltimore neighborhood, where, she said, "we're all bolted in our homes, we're locked down."
Residents are locked down with good reason. In 2017, Baltimore had 343 homicides, a new record for killings per capita — more than New York City, which has 14 times Baltimore's population. In 2018, there were 309 homicides, and so far in 2019, there were 171 homicides as of July 11 — up from 147 homicides at the same time last year. Baltimore is quite literally experiencing "American carnage."
While the national poverty rate has dropped from 14.8% to 12.3% since 2014, Baltimore's remains virtually unchanged at 22.4%. Children are trapped in failing schools that can't teach them to read or do math at grade level. No wonder Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., once compared Baltimore to "a Third World country" and said it is "a community in which half of the people don't have jobs [and] in which there are hundreds of buildings that are uninhabitable." This is happening in Maryland, the richest state in the country. Talk about income inequality!
Pointing out these facts is not racist. It is also not racist to say that no one would want to live in these conditions — we should all agree that no one should have to. Nor is it racist to point out that this human tragedy is the responsibility of Baltimore's leaders, and the direct result of five decades of Democratic rule. Democrats have held a lock on the Baltimore mayor's office since 1967. They run the city council, the school system, the sanitation system, the housing authority and police department, and they represent the city in Washington. Gov. Larry Hogan (R), only the second Republican governor of Maryland since 1969, does bear some responsibility. But Baltimore is a deep-blue city in a deep-blue state; its plight is almost entirely a Democrat-created disaster.
Trump is wrong to attack Cummings for conducting vigorous oversight of conditions on the southern border; as chairman of the House oversight committee, that is his job. But Democrats want to have it both ways. They want to criticize what they see as inhumane conditions in U.S. detention facilities (and give a pass to those like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who outrageously compare those facilities to "concentration camps") but then call Trump a racist for criticizing inhumane conditions in Baltimore.
The irony is, Democrats are in large part responsible for both situations. For months they refused to provide the emergency funds Trump requested to address the surge in border crossings, which left U.S. facilities on the border under-resourced and overwhelmed. And for years they have ruled Baltimore as a one-party fiefdom as the city turned into an island of despair amid a sea of prosperity.
The tragedy of Trump's presidency is that he should be championing the people of Baltimore rather than using their plight to attack one of his critics.

Beaten Down, Worked Up
Steven Greenhouse
Knopf; 416 pp., $27.95

--
In the early 1990s, Los Angeles faced a turning point. Many of the aerospace and manufacturing jobs that had boomed during and after World War II, feeding a large, prosperous middle class, had evaporated.
Low-wage service jobs -- dishwashers, janitors, home-care aides, hotel housekeepers -- were exploding, often filled by African Americans and immigrants from Mexico and Central America.
In the wake of the fiery 1992 riots, two labor organizers, children of farmworkers, launched a scrappy new group to battle poverty and inequality. Over the following decades, the Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy (LAANE) would gather unions, community groups, environmentalists, immigrant advocates and clergy into one of the most powerful forces in the city.
In his sweeping new history, "Beaten Down, Worked Up: The Past, Present, and Future of American Labor," Steven Greenhouse devotes a detailed chapter to LAANE, as "an extraordinary incubator of pro-worker ideas" and a model for what he calls "a new and different labor movement."
The group championed the nation's broadest living-wage law; invented the concept of "community benefits agreements," forcing big developers to hire locally and build low-income housing; and, with political muscle, helped raise pay and benefits for some 120,000 workers from hotel maids to garbage haulers and construction laborers.
But even as labor grew stronger in Los Angeles, Greenhouse writes that unions across the country have been decimated by fierce pushback from corporate executives, by anti-labor Republican officials from the Reagan era to the Trump administration, and by lawsuits and legislative attacks funded by the billionaire Koch brothers and other right-wing magnates.
In the 1950s, more than a third of U.S. workers belonged to a union. Today membership is down to 10.5% of the workforce.
For corporations, it may be the best of times. Profits are soaring after massive tax cuts for businesses and wealthy stockholders. Labor, environmental and job safety regulations have been gutted.
For workers, it may be the worst of times. Unemployment is down but average hourly pay, adjusted for inflation, remains below what it was in 1973. Four in 10 adults lack enough savings to pay a $400 emergency expense, according to the Federal Reserve. And the United States remains the only industrial nation that fails to grant workers the right to paid sick days, vacation or maternity leave.
Greenhouse, a former labor reporter and foreign correspondent for the New York Times, builds a persuasive case that the inability of workers to engage in collective bargaining has markedly shifted power to corporations, fueling the nation's exploding inequality.
CEOs at the biggest corporations now make 312 times more than the average worker, up from 20 times more decades ago.
"Millions of Americans know little about what unions have achieved over American history," Greenhouse writes. "Labor unions, and their ability to create a powerful collective voice for workers, played a huge role in building the world's largest, richest middle class."
"Beaten Down, Worked Up" paints vivid portraits of labor champions, from the firebrands of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union in the early 20th century, to the African Americans who led the 1968 sanitation workers strike in Memphis where Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated, to the multiethnic organizers -- Latino, black, white -- of Las Vegas' Culinary Workers Union, who have raised wages for 57,000 hotel and casino workers in recent decades.
Beginning in the 1970s, stiff competition from abroad battered U.S. industry from steel mills to automakers to electronics factories and garment manufacturers. Globalization spurred American companies to force labor concessions that weakened members' attachment to their unions. And they moved operations overseas.
Decades of economic turmoil set the stage for Trump's 2016 victory as he tapped into blue-collar resentment with ferocious trade-war and anti-immigrant rhetoric. Trump followed through with punishing tariffs on goods from China and other nations. But on basic labor issues, Greenhouse writes, the Trump administration "has repeatedly sided with business over workers. It has scrapped numerous job safety regulations ... and rolled back a rule that extended overtime pay to millions more workers." Trump appointees successfully pushed the Supreme Court to limit worker class-action suits and curb the clout of public employee unions.
If labor's predicament seems dire, its future may lie in a new approach -- organizing low-wage workers whether or not they can be unionized. LAANE's success is one example. Greenhouse describes others: the Fight for $15 movement, funded by the Service Workers International Union, mounted a global campaign to raise pay at McDonald's, and then branched out to support minimum-wage hikes in cities and states across the country, benefiting some 22 million workers.
Those efforts may be having an impact. Public approval of unions has risen to 62%, the highest level since 2003. But the path forward for a diminished labor movement is far from clear. "In the balance," Greenhouse argues, "is the future of our economy and our democracy."

The Communal Power of a Real Job

Texto completo: The conservative blueprint envisions a flourishing society built upon a foundation of strong families and communities, buttressed by a free market. But cracks in that foundation are widening, the structure is swaying, and market forces are providing little support. In response, conservatives are turning their focus to workers.
This response emerges from an insight that I like to call the working hypothesis: that a labor market in which workers can support strong families and communities is the central determinant of long-term prosperity and should be the central focus of public policy. Genuine prosperity depends upon people working as productive contributors to their society, through which they can achieve self-sufficiency, support their families, participate in their communities, and raise children prepared to do the same. And it is the labor market that determines where, how, by whom and at what price most work gets done.
The labor market's outcomes, like any market's, depend on the conditions in which it operates. Crucially, while a labor market left alone will seek an efficient equilibrium, economic theory never promises that the equilibrium will be a socially desirable, inclusive one. A genuine conservatism values markets as powerful mechanisms that foster choice, promote competition and deliver growth, but always in service to the larger end of a cohesive society in which people can thrive. Observing that deficiencies in the labor market's outcomes have become acute, conservatives are beginning to ask which conditions are leading to those outcomes and how to change those conditions.
The Republican senators Marco Rubio and Josh Hawley are in the vanguard of that effort. Read Mr. Rubio's report from May, "American Investment in the 21st Century," which interrogates the business sector's failure to make long-term investments in the nation's economic future. Or watch Mr. Hawley's maiden speech on the Senate floor, also from May, in which he excoriated the "new aristocrats" who "seek to remake society in their own image: to engineer an economy that works for the elite but few else." Instead, Mr. Hawley said, "we need a society that offers rewarding work for every worker who wants it, wherever she is from, whatever degree he might have, whether their ambition is to start a business or to start a family."
Intuitively, progressives might seem the likely vindicators of workers' interests. But the serious structural changes that the labor market needs will entail real trade-offs with other priorities that progressives see as more important.
Consider the constellation of issues emphasized thus far in the Democratic Party's presidential primary: free college and health care, relaxed or nonexistent immigration enforcement, and various "Green New Deals" whose explicit goal is suppression of the energy-producing and -consuming sectors that form the backbone of the blue-collar economy. Such policies are more likely to harm than benefit workers, in their capacity as workers. Offers to help come typically as redistribution to compensate for what people can no longer accomplish themselves.
The appeal of redistribution is its promise of painless progress. Yes, the winners have to compensate the losers. But so long as they pay their taxes, they can structure society however they like. Actually changing the conditions that weaken the labor market and harm those left behind, by contrast, requires real concessions from the people commanding society's cultural, economic and political heights.
Conservatives will be the advocates for such concessions because theirs is the perspective that sees no alternative, while progressives will more likely be attracted to the possibility that some novel configuration of society could work just as well. Conservatives will tend to view human nature and abilities as a constant to which policy must adapt, while progressives will see greater potential for transformation. Progressives will trust social and economic progress to provide the foundation for a healthy society, while conservatives will argue that a healthy society must instead provide the foundation for any progress.
In some cases, this will lead conservatives in directions they might already lean. The United States has cleaned its air to the point that Brussels, headquarters of the European Union, would be our dirtiest city. Recognition of the enormous social value of well-paying jobs for less-educated workers in manufacturing, construction and resource extraction argues for tolerating more of the pollution that comes with them.
In other cases, conservatives will head in new directions or even reverse course. Our society's intensive commitment to the college pathway might make sense if we plan to have the one-fifth of students who move smoothly from high school to college to career take care of everyone else. But an insistence that workers throughout the labor market share in productivity growth will shift the education system focus from college completion to alternative pathways from high school to productive careers.
Conservatives' longstanding hostility toward organized labor will give way to an emphasis on reform. The 1930s-style unions mandated by the National Labor Relations Act have passed their expiration date, but new forms of organizing through which workers can support one another, engage with management and contribute to civil society should be a conservative priority.
Rather than focus safety-net debates on budget savings, conservatives will ask how to use existing budgets better -- for instance, by transforming at least some portion of the safety net into a wage subsidy delivered directly into each low-wage paycheck, encouraging less skilled workers to enter the labor force and businesses to employ them. Mr. Hawley proposed such a work credit in his successful campaign to unseat Claire McCaskill.
And yes, conservatives will bring a skepticism of unfettered international trade and immigration to the discussion as well. If the emphasis is on a healthy labor market, rather than merely rising consumption, then borders matter. Few things could benefit American workers more than forcing companies to rely on them -- something progressives always acknowledged in their calls for greater worker power, until it began conflicting with other priorities.
More trade is good, if that trade is balanced. But huge trade deficits represent supplies of foreign workers entering the United States market from afar with no commensurate rise in foreign demand for what American workers produce. Immigration, likewise, can be constructive -- if those immigrants enter segments of the labor market where native workers are doing well. But if a lack of economic opportunity for less-educated Americans is seen as one of society's great challenges, allowing yet more less-educated workers to enter the labor market won't make sense.
Mr. Rubio has co-sponsored legislation with Senator Tammy Baldwin, a Wisconsin Democrat, to confront China's unfair trade practices and held hearings and published research on its industrial policy. This past week, Mr. Hawley and Ms. Baldwin co-sponsored legislation that would require the Federal Reserve to close the trade deficit by taxing foreign purchases of American assets.
Political realignments occur when core values collide with changed conditions, creating rifts that both divide longstanding alliances and bring new sets of constituencies and concerns into contact. The one underway in America is frequently mischaracterized as pitting an "open" progressive side that favors desirable things like trade, immigration, the environment and college against a "closed" conservative side that finds them scary. But the actual divide is between a progressive enthusiasm for pushing ahead and a conservative concern about restoring fractured foundations.
Most conservatives see value in all those "open" priorities too, but their nonnegotiable starting point is a cohesive society built on work, family and community. Their task is to persuade enough Americans that building higher should be contingent on first establishing the strength of a sturdy base.

Texto completo: China is receiving oil shipments from a larger number of Iranian tankers than was previously known, defying sanctions imposed by the United States to choke off Tehran's main source of income, an investigation by The New York Times has found.
The Times examined the movements of more than 70 Iranian tankers since May 2, when the American sanctions took full effect.
Twelve of the tankers loaded oil after May 2 and delivered it to China or the Eastern Mediterranean, where the buyers may have included Syria or Turkey. Only some of those 12 tankers were previously known to have recently delivered Iranian oil, and an analyst said the scale of the shipments documented by The Times investigation is greater than what had been publicly known.
The continued flow of oil underscores the difficulty the Trump administration has had in using sanctions to bring Iranian oil exports to zero after breaking with allies and partners on Iran policy. The Obama administration had worked with China, Russia and three European allies on the 2015 agreement intended to restrict Iran's ability to pursue a nuclear program. President Trump's decision to withdraw from the deal and to impose sanctions was opposed by those countries.
"You can't make these kinds of threats if you can't operationalize it," said Richard Nephew, a scholar at Columbia University and a former White House and State Department official who helped enforce Iran sanctions during the Obama administration.
"It adds up to a decision that makes them look weak and feckless," he added. "That shows there are limitations to U.S. power. China and other places are prepared to say, 'No, we're not going to follow the U.S. lead."'
The Times reviewed data from MarineTraffic and Refinitiv, two ship-tracking services, as well as satellite imagery from Planet Labs and analysis from shipping and energy experts.
"U.S. sanctions have not stopped Iran from moving oil to the Mediterranean and Asia," said Noam Raydan, an analyst at ClipperData, which tracks global crude shipments.
It is not illegal under international law to buy and haul Iranian oil or related products. The Trump administration's oil sanctions, which mainly went into effect last November after the United States pulled out of the Iran nuclear agreement, are unilateral. The administration granted eight governments permission to continue buying Iranian oil despite the sanctions, but ended those exceptions on May 2.
Foreign companies that ignore the sanctions and do business with American companies or banks risk being punished by the United States.
American officials have said that sanctions are aimed at cutting off money to the Iranian government to force leaders there to make political change, transform their foreign policy and offer more concessions on the country's nuclear and missile programs.
While Iran continues to export oil, the sanctions have had a substantial impact. In April 2018, before Mr. Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal, Iran exported 2.5 million barrels of oil per day. One year later, that figure was at one million. And in June, after the end of the exceptions or waivers, ships in Iranian ports loaded about 500,000 barrels per day, according to Reid I'Anson, an energy economist at Kpler, a London-based company tracking seaborne commodities.
Since the sanctions came into full effect on May 2, low-level hostilities between Iran and the United States in the Persian Gulf have increased, despite attempts by European nations to ramp down tensions and get Iran to comply with the nuclear deal, which it had been doing until it breached limits on nuclear fuel last month.
The State Department said any new purchase of Iranian oil after May 2 would be subject to sanctions. "Our firm policy is to completely zero out purchases of Iranian oil," it said.
Japan and South Korea, fearful of secondary sanctions imposed by Washington if they do business with Iran, have complied with the American sanctions. Turkish officials said in late May they are halting imports of Iranian oil but do not agree with the American sanctions.
In July, the British marines and port authorities in Gibraltar seized a supertanker that they said was carrying crude oil from Iran to Syria. Though the Europeans do not endorse the American sanctions on Iran, the shipment violated European Union sanctions against Syria.
The Trump administration is starting to intensify sanctions enforcement to try to end the exports to China, which continues to be the largest buyer of Iranian oil. On July 22, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced sanctions against Zhuhai Zhenrong, a Chinese state-owned enterprise, and its top executive, Li Youmin, for "violating U.S. restrictions on Iran's oil sector."
"We have a pretty good bead on where these ships are moving around," Mr. Pompeo told Bloomberg TV on July 25. "Wherever we find violations, we will do our level best to enforce them completely and thoroughly."
But that does not satisfy some Republican members of Congress who are national security hawks.
"While I'm glad the administration sanctioned an initial round of Chinese actors, it must step up strong enforcement to deter Chinese and other foreign actors from violating U.S. sanctions against Iran," said Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida. "The Iranian regime has blatantly shipped millions of barrels of oil to China."
To really tighten the screws on China, the Trump administration would need to punish the People's Bank of China or other Chinese banks that engage in transactions with the Central Bank of Iran, Mr. Nephew said. The United States could also penalize the energy giant Sinopec, which, like Zhuhai Zhenrong, also imports oil from Iran. But sanctioning the banks or Sinopec would have far-reaching consequences for global trade and deepen the divide between Washington and Beijing.
The two nations are already embroiled in a bitter trade war and at odds over global security issues, and Mr. Trump is eager to reach a trade deal with President Xi Jinping of China.
A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang, said on July 19 that the Trump administration's "maximum pressure" campaign against Tehran was the "root cause of the current tensions" involving Iran and that Washington should "correct its wrongdoing."
Before the end of the sanctions exceptions on May 2, China had been importing 500,000 barrels of Iranian oil per day. In the past month, China's imports have dropped to about 360,000 barrels per day, according to Kpler.
The National Iranian Tanker Company, which is specifically targeted by American sanctions, owns or manages 11 of the 12 tankers.
In the case of Devrez, an Iranian-managed oil-product tanker, its owner was listed as Great Sparkle Investments Ltd., which is registered in Hong Kong but has an office in Mumbai, India, according to the International Maritime Organization website. The tanker likely discharged its cargo in early June, Mr. I'Anson said.
When they travel, Iranian tankers sometimes turn off their automatic identification system, making them harder to track, said Tom Kenison, an analyst at FGE, an energy consultancy.
Several Iranian tankers stopped reporting their positions after they crossed the Suez Canal, but shipping data suggests they unloaded their cargo in the Eastern Mediterranean. Destinations could include Syria or Turkey, analysts said.
The Times was able to estimate when and where a tanker offloaded its cargo by using data for each ship's position and draft, or how high it was riding in the water. The draft indicates whether a ship is loaded.
Some of the Iranian ships have been previously identified in reports by Reuters, Bloomberg, and TankerTrackers.com, which uses satellite technology to monitor ships.
Since June, at least three ships have taken iron ore from Iran to China, Mr. I'Anson said, which could also be a violation of American sanctions.
Other Iranian tankers are waiting in the Persian Gulf loaded with crude oil, ready to move when they can find a buyer, he said. Iran is selling some of the oil at a discount.
Some countries watching the continuing imports of Iranian oil by China might start pressuring the Trump administration to grant them exceptions, Mr. Nephew said. Or they might decide to just go ahead and buy the oil, perhaps in secret. In June, after a meeting with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan, President Hassan Rouhani of Iran said Mr. Abe told him "Japan was interested in continuing to buy Iran's oil."

An underdog to get selected for Team USA just two weeks ago, Donovan Mitchell now looks like one of its best players

Texto completo: Two weeks ago, Donovan Mitchell looked unlikely to make the Team USA roster for September’s FIBA World Cup.
Mitchell ranked fourth or fifth among Team USA shooting guards in terms of experience, behind Houston’s James Harden and Eric Gordon, Washington’s Bradley Beal, and Portland’s C.J. McCollum. If the 22-year-old Jazzman was to make the 12-man squad, it needed to be on the back of his defensive efforts as a role player.
“The thing that we’re looking for is defense, and he has the ability to be a real factor,” Team USA Jerry Colangelo said then. "That could be the best way for him to make a roster spot, is to play incredible defense.”
But then, in a hurry, everything changed. Over the course of a few days, every single shooting guard on the roster ahead of Mitchell pulled out of the competition. Harden said he wanted to “spend the remainder of the offseason to focus on preparing for the retooled Rockets.” Gordon followed suit with his Houston teammate, and McCollum chose to do the same for Portland. Meanwhile, Beal will miss the tournament due to the expected birth of his child.
The upshot? Mitchell now looks like the expected starter for Team USA at the shooting guard spot, as training camp opens in Las Vegas on Monday. Daily practices will try to get USA’s team gelling as they ramp up for international basketball’s second-biggest tournament behind the Olympics, including a televised scrimmage game on Friday.
The two-guard isn’t the only weaker-than-expected position for USA Basketball, though. Other stars that have withdrawn from the competition include Portland’s Damian Lillard, Los Angeles’ Anthony Davis, Philadelphia’s Tobias Harris, Cleveland’s Kevin Love, Detroit’s Andre Drummond, Denver’s Paul Millsap, and even role players like the Clippers’ Montrezl Harrell and New Orleans’ J.J. Redick. Meanwhile, elite players like LeBron James, DeMar DeRozan, LaMarcus Aldridge, Karl Anthony-Towns and others rejected invites earlier in the process, skipping withdrawal entirely.
Instead, Team USA figures to be headlined by backcourt players Kemba Walker and Mitchell carrying the scoring load, with Kyle Lowry — returning mid-camp from a thumb surgery — and Marcus Smart behind them. The bigger wing candidates are headlined by Khris Middleton, Jaylen Brown, and P.J. Tucker, while Harrison Barnes, Thaddeus Young, Kyle Kuzma, Julius Randle compete for spots at the four. The team also has to choose between some internationally-unproven centers: Myles Turner, Bam Adebayo, and Mason Plumlee.

Of those on the roster, there’s only one player who made one of the 15 All-NBA slots: Walker. Only Walker and Khris Middleton were named as All-Stars, and only Walker, Mitchell, and Randle scored over 20 points per game in the NBA last season. Colangelo, though, says he isn’t worried about the overall level of Team USA:
“I think we’re going to be fine,” Colangelo told the New York Times. "Out of this — I don’t want to call it adversity — out of these circumstances comes opportunity for the young guys. Some young guys who I think are ready to bust out.”
Mitchell isn’t the only Jazzman who will start in the FIBA World Cup. Rudy Gobert, of course, figures to start and play a huge role for France, while Joe Ingles will be a big part of Team Australia, the “Boomers," as Australians call their national basketball team. Miye Oni was also named to Nigeria’s 44-man preliminary roster list. Bojan Bogdanovic won’t participate for Croatia because they failed to qualify for the event.
But Gobert and Ingles too will be leading somewhat weakened squads. Dante Exum won’t play for Australia due to the knee injury he’s still recovering from — though he is expected to be ready by the start of the Jazz’s training camp. Ben Simmons is also out for Australia, as are NBAers Thon Maker and Ryan Broekhoff. France hasn’t had as many withdrawals, but still is without some of its signature figures: Tony Parker and Boris Diaw are gone after retirement, big men Ian Mahinmi and Joakim Noah aren’t on the roster, and Joffrey Lauvergne is injured.
There should also be plenty of Jazz-on-Jazz battles to watch down the stretch of games. Team USA plays two separate exhibition games against Australia in Melbourne on August 22 and 24, pitting Mitchell and Ingles against each other. Then, once the event actually begins in China on August 31, Australia and France look poised for a critical matchup at the end of the competition’s group phase, for either seeding or qualification to the knockout tournament.
USA Basketball is certainly still favored in the knockout stages, but anything is possible there. Mitchell has faced the bright lights of the NBA Playoffs before, but this summer, he figures now to have an opportunity to show he can carry a load on an international stage.

Texto completo: D.A. Pennebaker, the groundbreaking documentary filmmaker best known for capturing pivotal moments in the history of rock music and politics, including Bob Dylan’s 1965 tour of England and Bill Clinton’s first presidential campaign, died Thursday at his home in Sag Harbor, New York. He was 94.
His death was confirmed by his son Frazer Pennebaker.
Pennebaker was part of a close-knit group of pioneering filmmakers in the 1960s who helped bring cinéma vérité to the United States. Michael Moore, presenting Pennebaker with an Oscar for lifetime achievement in 2012, said Pennebaker, along with Robert Drew, Albert Maysles and Richard Leacock, had “invented nothing less than the modern documentary.”
The key development in that invention was the advent of synchronous-sound cameras, which allowed the filmmakers to move more freely with and among their subjects, and to do away with the postproduction voice-over model of narrative. “You wanted to drive the stories by what people said to each other,” Pennebaker once said, “not by what you thought up on a yellow pad.”
In 1965, Dylan’s manager, Albert Grossman, approached Pennebaker about following the singer on a British tour.
“I didn’t really know much about Dylan,” Pennebaker told the AV Club in a 2011 interview. “I had heard one of his songs on the radio.”
“Dont Look Back,” the ensuing movie, is regularly cited as one of the best documentaries ever made. Between brief performance clips, Pennebaker’s camera follows Dylan as he antagonizes the press (“I don’t need Time magazine,” he tells a Time reporter), outruns mobs of fans and loudly types over the voice of Joan Baez while she gently sings in a hotel room. The movie, in black and white, begins with an oft-imitated scene in which Dylan flips through a series of cardboard placards that display the lyrics of his song “Subterranean Homesick Blues.” That opening was Dylan’s idea.
Critic Pauline Kael pointed out in the New Yorker in 1968 that the entire movie was more complicated (and compromised) than some viewers might appreciate. “Sequences that in a Hollywood movie would have been greeted with snickers — like Bob Dylan in the throes of composition — got by because of the rough look,” she wrote. “Audiences seemed to accept the new cinéma vérité convention that the camera was an intruder in the idol’s life, though it must have been obvious that Dylan had arranged to star in this film.”
Pennebaker had absorbed these techniques in 1960 while working on the crew of “Primary,” directed by Drew, which followed Hubert Humphrey and John Kennedy as they campaigned in Wisconsin for the Democratic presidential nomination. Decades later, while preparing to make “The War Room,” about Bill Clinton’s 1992 presidential campaign, Pennebaker found that politicians had become decidedly less accessible and more wary.
“I could see right away that you couldn’t actually occupy space with a person who intended to become president in a very interesting way,” he told the AV Club. “They were constrained to act; as soon as the camera appeared, they had to pretend to be something else.”
Pennebaker focused instead on George Stephanopoulos, James Carville and other then-little-known (and less camera-shy) operatives. The result, Janet Maslin wrote in the New York Times, was “a revealing film and an invaluable document.”
His political films are now part of the canon, but the scenes from Pennebaker’s catalog that still circulate most widely are of pop culture figures in action: Jimi Hendrix lighting his guitar on fire in “Monterey Pop”; Elaine Stritch in “Original Cast Album: Company,” exhausted and straining to record “The Ladies Who Lunch” while Stephen Sondheim and others look on in despair; Dylan showing up the softer-edged singer Donovan in a hotel room crowded with their hangers-on; and actor Rip Torn attacking Norman Mailer with a hammer at the end of “Maidstone” (1970), one of three eccentric movies directed by Mailer, for which Pennebaker served as a cameraman.
Mailer’s films from that era are mostly notable as oddball vanity projects (in the Times, Vincent Canby called “Maidstone” “a very mixed bag” that “doesn’t make a great deal of sense”), but Pennebaker’s relationship with the author would pay dividends down the line. In 1971, he accepted Mailer’s suggestion that he film a panel discussion that Mailer was holding at Town Hall in Manhattan. The topic would be the state of feminism.
Mailer was his pugnacious self as he battled with, among others, author Germaine Greer and journalist Jill Johnston before a raucous audience. At one point two women from the audience took the stage and kissed and groped Johnston, an activist for lesbian rights, before all three tumbled to the floor.
The footage of the night remained on a shelf for nearly a decade, but when it was released as “Town Bloody Hall” in 1979, it was called a remarkable time capsule of a colorful moment in New York’s intellectual and cultural history. Filmmaker Chris Hegedus, Pennebaker’s third wife (they married in 1982) and creative partner, edited the footage, which she once called “incredibly rough.”
“There was so much sexual tension going on between Norman and Germaine in it,” Hegedus said, adding, “I almost edited it as a love story, in a certain way.”
Pennebaker liked to maintain the image of a journalist for hire. Discussing the genesis of his 1989 documentary about rock band Depeche Mode (“Depeche Mode 101”), he said, “Somebody called us up and said, ‘Would you like to film Depeche Mode?’ and I sort of said, ‘What’s that?’”
Donn Alan Pennebaker, known as Penny to friends and colleagues, was born July 15, 1925, in Evanston, Illinois, to John Paul Pennebaker, a commercial photographer, and the former Lucille Levick.
He served in the Navy and studied engineering at MIT and Yale. After working as an engineer for about a year, he was shown “N.Y., N.Y.,” a short, impressionistic color film by his friend Francis Thompson chronicling “a day in New York,” as the subtitle says. “In about 15 minutes I saw right away that filmmaking was what I was going to do for the rest of my life,” Pennebaker said in a 2006 interview about that moment.
Thompson’s work motivated Pennebaker to complete the color documentary short “Daybreak Express,” not quite six minutes of footage of elevated train tracks along Third Avenue in Manhattan. Opening against a blazing orange sunrise, the film is set to music by Duke Ellington.
Pennebaker would go on to work with Drew making films for Time-Life before branching out to make his own features.
His many other films include close-up looks at David Bowie (“Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars,” from 1973), John Lennon (“John Lennon & the Plastic Ono Band — Live in Toronto ’69”) and Jane Fonda (“Jane,” from 1962, when she was 25 and enduring a starring role in a flop on Broadway).
In addition to his son Frazer (a producer of many Pennebaker documentaries), Pennebaker is survived by his wife, Hegedus; seven other children, Stacy Pennebaker, Linley Pennebaker, Jojo Pennebaker, Chelsea Pennebaker, Zoe Pennebaker, Kit Pennebaker and Jane Pennebaker; 13 grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.
A public memorial service will be held in the fall in New York City, according to his son.
Pennebaker believed that the best documentary films were those in which the filmmaker’s presence is least felt.
“If you’re setting up lights and tripods and you’ve got three assistants running around, people will want to get you out as fast as they can,” Pennebaker told Time in a 2007 interview. “But if you go the opposite way, if you make the camera the least important thing in the room, then it’s different. I’ve left it on the floor. Sometimes, I’ll shoot with it on my lap. Other times, I’ll put it on a table and turn it on. You don’t make it a big issue.”

DEMOCRATS DON'T CARE ABOUT BALTIMORE

Texto completo: The president got bored last weekend and decided to see if he could make Democrats defend one of the most dangerous, mismanaged places in the country. And of course, he could. It wasn't hard. He just sent a flurry of tweets criticizing the city of Baltimore and Rep. Elijah Cummings. br data-css-regions-fragment-of="1299">
President Donald Trump called Baltimore a "disgusting, rat and rodent invested" hellhole, a "corrupt mess" that "no human being" would want to live in. A lot of people who've never been to Baltimore claimed to be deeply offended by those remarks. One person who seemed to agree with them was former Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh. Just last year, she said things were so bad you could "smell the rotting rats."
The mayor did not explain why she hadn't cleaned things up. That footage of her remarks got almost no attention when it ran on a local news station. Neither did the recent story about Baltimore's deputy policy commissioner getting robbed at gunpoint by four thugs while out to dinner with his wife. People weren't talking about that over dinner in Georgetown. If there's one thing virtually everyone in Washington aggressively doesn't care about, it's Baltimore. It's 40 miles and an entire world away. You could live your whole life in D.C. and never visit or think about Baltimore.
Then, last weekend, orange Mussolini weighed in on the subject, and suddenly Baltimore became holy ground, a sacred city of light that only an infidel would disparage - an infidel or, perhaps - and this will not surprise you - a racist. Because honestly, only a hardened bigot would criticize a place as awesome as Baltimore. That was the media consensus over the weekend.
Republicans still get red in the face when CNN calls them racist, but they shouldn't. The whole thing is a campaign tactic, dreamed up by the Democratic National Committee. Once the Russia conspiracy imploded, Democrats and their lackeys in the media moved to the only other message they have: "Shut up, racist." It didn't work in 2016 for Hillary Clinton, but they're hopeful it will this time. We'll see.
Meanwhile, Baltimore - the actual city, not the metaphor - could desperately use some attention. If anything, Mr. Trump's tweets underplayed the crisis. Last year, the city recorded 309 homicides, a rate of more than 50 per 100,000 people. If Baltimore were a country, it would have the fourth-highest murder rate in the world, barely below Venezuela.
Or think of it this way: Last week, the left denounced Mr. Trump for reaching a deal with Guatemala that declares the country a "safe" location for asylum seekers. Guatemala, they said, has too much crime and too many gangs to be considered safe; making people stay there is a human rights violation.
And yet, Baltimore's murder rate is double that of Guatemala. In almost any way a city can be a disaster, Baltimore qualifies. More than 22% of the city lives in poverty. Almost 65% of children grow up in single-parent households. The schools are a catastrophe. In 2017, one-third of Baltimore's high schools had zero students proficient in math. That's right. In 13 of Baltimore's 39 high schools, not a single student - not one - was proficient in math. You'd think that would be a national scandal.
Bernie Sanders visited Baltimore a few years ago, and to his credit, he was shocked: "Anyone who took the walk that we took around this neighborhood would not think you're in a wealthy nation. You would think that you were in a third-world country."
Looks like Bernie must be a white supremacist. Actually, he's just an old-fashioned liberal. That's how Democrats used to think; If they saw misery and urban decay, they wanted to fix it.
Modern progressives are different. Progressivism isn't about helping the people beneath you; it's about establishing your moral superiority.
Democrats support the status quo in Baltimore. It doesn't bother them. That's not surprising. They created modern Baltimore. The city hasn't had a Republican mayor in more than 50 years. Things really began to fall apart after the 2015 riots. The Obama administration imposed a consent decree on the city's police department that radically restricted its ability to protect citizens. Not surprisingly, crime exploded.
Mr. Cummings, by the way, praised that consent decree. He's very much part of the problem.
From her taxpayer-funded vacation in Italy, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi defended Mr. Cummings - and Baltimore. Ms. Pelosi grew up in the city. Her father and her brother were mayors of Baltimore. But like most rich progressives, Ms. Pelosi herself is long gone. She's got a winery in Napa now. She's not interested in going back to Baltimore. Like most Democrats, she finds it easier to just lecture other people about it.

Not-so-great Democratic debates

Texto completo: So, who won the Democratic debates?
My vote is for Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. Sure they were both on Day 1, but nobody on Day 2 came close.
Unless you figure that Joe Biden triumphed by failing to fall down. Some of his answers might have been a bit muddled, and he sort of faded off after the first hour. But expectations were so low, that was like clearing a high hurdle.
Everybody looked forward to his meeting with Kamala Harris, who had tortured him so effectively in Debate 1. "Go easy on me, kid," Biden told her when they shook hands. It was either typical nice-guy Joe or yet another moment of Not Getting It by a former vice president who doesn't know you don't call a female member of the U.S. Senate "kid."
You pick.
Biden had a double challenge. The progressives were laying into him about his Mr. Moderate agenda, and everybody was reminding him of his sometimes-grimy decades of life as a classic Senate deal-making insider. All that history, from Biden's perspective, was washed away in his eight years of hanging around with Barack Obama.
"We're in a battle for the soul of America," he said in one of his best moments, which just involved repeating something he tells his audiences all the time. If Donald Trump got re-elected, Biden warned, "the America we know will no longer exist."
The specter of You Know Who was looming behind everything. Everybody knew that the only thing that really mattered was getting rid of Donald Trump, who was having a rather typical week of doing his best to ruin the country.
For instance, the nation learned that his pick for director of national intelligence was an extremely conservative congressman whose greatest qualifications were six months on the House Intelligence Committee and a super deep dedication to Trump.
And the president signed a bill funding care of 9/11 responders, taking the opportunity to mention his own alleged role post-terror attack.
"And I was down there also, and I'm not considering myself a first responder," he said modestly. "But I was down there. I spent a lot of time down there with you."
The man was looking out a window from his luxury quarters uptown. And bragging on the radio that with the World Trade Center gone, his building on Wall Street was the tallest building downtown.
And even that wasn't true!
OK, enough. We're thinking about the Democratic debates.
Twenty candidates over two days, and only a handful of them had any real business being on the stage. Listening to Bill de Blasio rant and preen, the nation got a good hint of why no mayor of New York has ever been elected president. Harris totally failed to live up to expectations and sort of floundered on the health care front.
The star of the first night was Warren. ("We're not going to solve the urgent problems that we face with small ideas and spinelessness.") As a result, some Biden backers are talking of recruiting her as their vice-presidential nominee. This is a problem both for those who believe Warren deserves to be first and those who believe a national ticket should ideally include at least one person under the age of 70.
Anybody stand out on Night 2? Well, Cory Booker did a good job of defending himself against Biden's attacks on his record as mayor of Newark, New Jersey. "Mr. Vice President, there is a saying in my community - you are dipping into the Kool-Aid and you don't even know the flavor," he rejoined at one point. It was not the most impressive part of his argument, but it was pretty much the best quote of the night. Except for Kirsten Gillibrand's announcement that the first thing she'd do as president is "Clorox the Oval Office."
Let's have another debate with just Warren versus Biden. And maybe we'll throw in Booker and Bernie Sanders. Sanders was the other top first-night performer. And definitely the loudest of the field of 20. Is that a good thing? If voters are looking for change, will they be excited about a guy who's really into shouting? It certainly made an impact - Rep. Tim Ryan came out of the Tuesday round remembered mainly for telling Sanders, "You don't have to yell."
We've still got 10 more debates to go. The next round is scheduled for September, in a week that begins with Grandparents Day and ends with a full moon. Perhaps Warren, Biden and Sanders will show the audience pictures of their grandchildren while Pete Buttigieg will suggest that he is young enough to be one of them. Then Biden can point out that would happen only if his parents and grandparents were married in their teens.
Then comes the full moon. Who do you think will be the surviving contender most likely to howl?
At the end, two ways of looking at this week's debates. They weren't, well ... stirring. Viewers on CNN who made it through the nearly five hours deserved a medal reading, "I stayed awake until Jake Tapper said good night."
On the other hand, you had 20 candidates, and at least a dozen or so seemed as if they'd be pretty good chief executives. And 20 of whom would be a huge improvement on the status quo.

Wittliff lands the papers of John Rechy

Texto completo: The Wittliff Collections at the Texas State University has picked up the complete literary papers of internationally acclaimed El Paso-born writer John Rechy, a pioneer of American, LGBTQ and Chicano literature.
“John Rechy is a literary legend and is one of the greatest writers to come from the American Southwest,” said David Coleman, director of the Wittliff Collections, which also holds the papers of Cormac McCarthy, Sandra Cisneros and recently deceased archive namesake, Bill Wittliff. “Rechy carefully maintained his literary papers from the very beginning of his career and the breadth and depth of the resulting collection is extraordinary. This archive will nourish the significant and ongoing scholarly interest in Rechy for generations to come.”
Rechy, who has always resisted categorization and still bristles at labels, made a literary splash in 1963 with the publication of his first novel, “City of Night,” which portrayed a gay street hustler. The hit for Grove Press came out seven years before the Stonewall riots brought acute attention to other pre-Stonewall LGBTQ literary forerunners such as Adrienne Rich and Gore Vidal, who called Rechy “one the few original American writers of the last century.”
“City of Night” has never gone out of print. Literary critic Edmund White called it “a classic American novel.”
Rechy’s books have been translated into 20 languages. The Los Angeles Times dubbed him “a prophet of liberation.”
The Mayan-influenced “Pablo,” a novel Rechy wrote when he was 18, was finally released in 2018, initiating another wave of interest in his work.
Although he wrote frequently about the Chicano condition for the Texas Observer and other publications, Rechy was not always fully embraced by Chicano activists. Still, critic Héctor Calderón wrote that Rechy is “one of Mexican-American literature’s founding authors.”
Born in El Paso in 1931, Rechy is the author of 17 books, many of them published in the 1960s and ‘70s. He is the first novelist to receive the PEN Center-USA’s Lifetime Achievement honor.
Artists as varied as David Bowie, Jim Morrison, Bob Dylan, Tom Waits, David Hockney and Gus Van Sant have attested to Rechy’s influence.
Among his other books, “The Sexual Outlaw: A Documentary” was listed by the San Francisco Chronicle as one of the 100 most important nonfiction works of the last century. The New York Times recently included the same book in a short list of works that influenced Generation X.
Still Rechy has remained an outsider’s outsider.
“Today,” he once said, “I find myself a ‘Texas writer’ left out of discussions of Texas writers, a ‘Chicano writer’ omitted from anthologies of Chicano writers, a ‘California writer’ ignored in books about California. And even though I am excluded from several anthologies of homosexual writers, I am often designated as ‘a gay writer.’”
His papers, stored in dozens of boxes, include drafts of his books, stories and articles, as well as voluminous correspondence with friends, editors and publishers. Among the artifacts are Rechy’s classic leather jacket and Tony Lama boots.
Rechy said about the Texas State acquisition: “Having my archives — reflections of a whole life — reside in the Wittliff Collections, so rich in history and modern life captured by a diversity of voices, is, for me and my work, a return home, the grand home where we belong.”

Rockland twins' death makes activist 'mad as hell' over safety issues

Texto completo: Kristie Reeves-Cavaliero lives in Austin, Texas. But for the past week, she couldn't stop thinking about a family across the country in Rockland County that she never met — Juan and Marissa Rodriguez and their children.
Nearly 1-year-old twins Luna and Phoenix Rodriguez died last Friday after they were left in their father's hot car for eight hours while he was at work at the James J. Peters VA Medical Center in the Bronx. Juan Rodriguez, a 39-year-old Iraq War vet, told police he "blanked out" and thought he had dropped them at day care.
"We are having a lot of PTSD triggers from this case," said Reeves-Cavaliero.
The Texas pharmacist is a mother of twins now. But the case has haunted her and her husband, Brett Cavaliero, for a deeper reason.
Their daughter, Sophia Rayne Cavaliero, or Ray Ray, died in 2011 at age 1 after being left in a hot car. Brett Cavaliero thought he dropped her off at day care on his way to work. But he hadn't. She was found in the back of his truck three hours later. But it was too late.
Reeves-Cavaliero can't believe such senseless and awful loss is still happening.
"Our child died eight years ago, when she died she was about about the 498th case since 1998," said Reeves-Cavaliero, who has become an advocate for any and all methods that could prevent more heat stroke deaths of babies left in cars. "Since her death we're up to almost 800 kids — there have been more than 300 kids who have died since my child died.
"As a parent who's worked tirelessly with the child safety advocates and the politicians, it just makes me mad as hell," Reeves-Cavaliero said.
Preventing hot-car deaths The Cavalieros established Ray Ray's Pledge, which encourages day care providers to call a parent if a child has not been dropped off. Forgotten day care dropoff is the No. 1 source of child hot car deaths.
Social media comments have questioned if the twins' day care, located in Yonkers, had called about the their absence. Family and friends have said they didn't, and have not named the provider.
Reeves-Calaviero said that in most states, there is no mandate for child care providers to call about absences, which is done in K-12 schools.
No such mandate could be found in New York State Office of Children and Family Services regulations.
Child Care Resources of Rockland, which provides support and training for childcare providers and referrals for families, strongly recommends providers have a policy addressing absences, CCRR Executive Director Vicki Caramante said. "Reach out to a family if a child is absent without the program being notified," Caramante said. "Our staff is available to help programs write these policies and procedures."
Other measures can be taken to keep kids safe.
On the federal level, the HOT CARS Act — for Helping Overcome Trauma for Children Alone in Rear Seats — would mandate that new vehicles come with alert systems to remind drivers if a child is left in the backseat.
A state bill mandating backseat detection devices for vehicles sold in New York will be introduced this week by Sen. David Carlucci, D-New City. "The technology is available. Automotive manufacturers are already putting them in certain models," Carlucci said. "Everyone thinks it will never happen to them, but it does. That's why we need to ... make this technology standard in all new cars."
There are also several apps and other devices that remind drivers to check the back seat.
Alfredo Angueira, a friend of Juan Rodriguez since their days at SUNY Albany, said he's been surprised by how much technology exists to prevent this kind of tragedy.
"You can turn on your air conditioner from your cellphone," Angueira said. "In this day and age, this is not necessary anymore."
Fifty-two children died after being left in hot cars in 2018, the highest number of vehicular heatstroke deaths in the last 21 years, according to noheatstroke.org. So far this year, 24 children have died; Phoenix and Luna Rodriguez were the 22nd and 23rd fatalities.
Accident or crime It was Angueira who first mentioned to Juan Rodriguez the concept of Forgotten Baby Syndrome – a neurobiological state in which a person's brain believes a child is no longer in the backseat of a vehicle. "He hadn't heard of it."
Rodriguez, the New York Times reported, called David Diamond, a University of South Florida professor who is an expert of Forgotten Baby Syndrome, to find out more.
Angueira was not surprised that Rodriguez, who has a master's degree in social work, went to a primary source to research what had happened. "Finding out information behind a condition is basically what he's done his entire career," Angueira said. "I think any one of us, your mind is going to search for answers. This isn't you, you love your children, what happened?"
Rodriguez was arrested Friday and jailed, Now out on bail, he was in court Thursday morning in the Bronx. Rodriguez has been charged with two counts of second-degree manslaughter and two counts of criminally negligent homicide, both felonies, as well as two misdemeanor counts of endangering the welfare of a child. While the Bronx District Attorney is still weighing whether to send the case to a grand jury, Rodriguez' lawyer has said the DA should not charge him because it was an accident. The case was adjourned until Aug. 27.
Parents are charged with a crime about 50% of the time when a child dies in a hot car, according to Amber Rollins, director of Kids and Cars, a Kansas-based organization that is dedicated to saving the lives of children in and around cars.
"Juan being charged brings back so much how they treat the parents," said Reeves-Cavaliero, whose husband was investigated in Ray Ray's death but not charged. "The last thing that this family needed was for this guy to be arrested at a time like that."
Angueira said that Juan and his family had not been focused on the criminal case. "He's dealing with his mental state, his wife's mental state," Angueira said. Everything else, he said, is "tertiary."

Texto completo: Osama bin Laden's son Hamza, heir apparent to leadership of the militant group al-Qaida, is dead, according to U.S. officials.
He was killed sometime in the past two years, during the Trump administration, but officials waited to confirm his death, The New York Times reported.
In February, the State Department said Hamza bin Laden was emerging as the new leader of the terrorist group and offered a $1million reward for information on him.
He was about 30 years old and based somewhere near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border.
"He has released audio and video messages on the Internet, calling on his followers to launch attacks against the United States and its Western allies, and he has threatened attacks against the United States in revenge for the May 2011 killing of his father by U.S. military forces," the State Department said at the end of February.
But Hamza bin Laden had already been killed by February – although his death had not been confirmed by U.S. military and intelligence agencies, according to the Times.
The U.S. government had a role in Hamza bin Laden's death, but it remains unclear what that role was.
Officials discussed the matter anonymously because it involved sensitive information and intelligence gathering, the Times reported.
President Donald Trump declined to comment Wednesday about bin Laden's reported death.
Bin Laden's last known public statement was released by al-Qaida's media arm in 2018, NBC reported. In that message, he threatened Saudi Arabia and called on the people of the Arabian Peninsula to revolt.
He was born around 1989. His father moved to Afghanistan in 1996 and declared war against the United States. Hamza, who moved with him, appeared in al-Qaida propaganda videos, NBC reported.
Hamza bin Laden was married to the daughter of Mohamed Atta, the lead hijacker in al-Qaida's attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on Sept. 11, 2001.
His father was killed by U.S. Navy SEALs in Pakistan in 2011. Letters found by the Navy SEALs during the raid on his hideout showed that Hamza had asked his father to train him to follow in his footsteps. Osama bin Laden fathered at least 20 children with half a dozen wives and was himself the 17th of 52 children.
Despite Hamza bin Laden's death, al-Qaida is still a problem for the West, said Nathan Sales, a counterterrorism expert at the State Department.
"Al-Qaida has been relatively quiet. This is a strategic pause, not a surrender," he said in a briefing Feb. 28, after the State Department announced its reward.
"Al-Qaida is not stagnant. It's rebuilding," he said.

Texto completo: Regulators have determined that North Carolina Children's Hospital is in compliance with federal rules but markedly changed since doctors, department heads and a top administrator expressed concerns three years ago about patients undergoing heart surgery there.
Inspection records released on Thursday cited no deficiencies with the hospital's operations. But a spokesman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversaw an investigation with the state health agency, said the institution's heart surgery program "is significantly different than it was during 2016-17."
The North Carolina secretary of health had called for the investigation after a May article in The New York Times gave a detailed look inside the hospital during those years. In secret audio recordings provided to The Times, cardiologists grappled with whether to keep sending patients to their own hospital for surgery and pressed administrators to provide mortality data they said they had not been able to get for several years.
The health secretary dispatched investigators from the state's Division of Health Service Regulation. They were on site at the hospital for about two weeks in June and later conducted interviews with doctors before preparing a report for federal regulators.
State regulators are authorized to act on behalf of the federal government, performing inspections to make sure hospitals meet certain health and safety standards. Failing to meet those standards can put an institution's Medicare and Medicaid payments at risk.
The C.M.S. spokesman said investigators looked at patients' medical records and other documents, conducted interviews with current and former staff members and patients' relatives, and observed operations at the hospital.
Inspectors concluded that the heart surgery program was substantially different from years earlier, the spokesman said, though he would not provide additional details.
UNC Health Care, which runs the state-owned hospital and is affiliated with the University of North Carolina, has defended its surgery program, describing it as "very strong" today while denying any past problems affecting patient care.
Administrators told The Times that hospital leaders had conducted a "thorough internal investigation" of the pediatric heart surgery program in 2016, determining that "criticism of the program was found to be unsubstantiated." They attributed any perceived problems to "a dysfunctional group" in 2016 that sowed mistrust and created "team culture issues."
The hospital system said on Thursday it had nothing more to add.
After the article was published, UNC temporarily suspended its most complex heart surgeries -- a measure some doctors had urged years earlier -- and introduced several initiatives to "restore confidence" in the program, including creating an external advisory board made up of medical experts from other hospitals.
The hospital also committed to publicly releasing its mortality data for pediatric heart surgery going forward, something it had refused to do in past years. At one point, the data was not available even to cardiologists, who said they wanted it to help them decide where to refer patients. The hospital has said it did not have the information at the time.
UNC Health Care eventually released its past mortality data two weeks after The Times's investigation -- and after a yearlong legal battle in which The Times sued to get the information it had sought under the state's open records law. The hospital system and the university have since agreed to pay The Times's legal fees as part of a settlement in the case.
The data showed that the death rate at UNC was especially high among children with the most complex heart conditions -- nearly 50 percent.

Apollo Chief Says Link To Epstein Was Limited

Texto completo: Leon D. Black, whose Apollo Global Management is among the world's largest private equity firms, has gone to great lengths to distance himself from Jeffrey Epstein, the wealthy financier accused of sex trafficking.
In an email to employees last week and a quarterly earnings conference call and a letter to investors in the firm's funds on Wednesday, Mr. Black described his relationship with Mr. Epstein as one largely limited to tax strategy, estate planning and philanthropic advice.
"I want to emphasize that Apollo has never done any business with Mr. Epstein at any point in time," Mr. Black said in his letter, a copy of which was reviewed by The New York Times.
Most important, he wrote, "I was completely unaware of, and am deeply troubled by, the conduct that is now the subject of the federal criminal charges brought against Mr. Epstein."
But so far, Mr. Black has not discussed a company that he and his four children -- as well as Mr. Epstein -- invested in three years after Mr. Epstein pleaded guilty to a charge of soliciting prostitution from a minor in Florida. Mr. Epstein's financial advisory firm took a roughly 6 percent equity stake in Environmental Solutions Worldwide in 2011. Two of Mr. Black's sons serve on the board of the company, which makes emission control products, according to the company website.
A spokeswoman for Mr. Black did not have a comment.
In the weeks since Mr. Epstein's arrest in July, Mr. Black has found himself in the thorny situation of having to explain his personal business dealings with Mr. Epstein.
"Neither Mr. Epstein nor any company controlled by him has ever invested in any funds managed by Apollo," Mr. Black said in the letter.
He also denied a report, published by Bloomberg, that he had given Mr. Epstein access to Apollo's senior executives. "No other Apollo employee ever engaged Mr. Epstein or used his professional services," he wrote.
Even so, investors have taken note. One of the nation's largest public pension funds, the California Public Employees' Retirement System, or Calpers, planned a call with Apollo on Thursday to discuss Mr. Black's letter and some issues it still wants clarity on, said Wayne Davis, a Calpers spokesman.
"Clearly, we need an understanding about what the letter said and what has been in the news," Mr. Davis said. "Reputational risk is very important to us because it will impact the bottom line and that will impact us." He declined to comment further Thursday night.
Mr. Black is one of the few Wall Street and corporate titans to have issued formal statements on their connections to Mr. Epstein, who pitched himself as an investment wizard who catered to a who's who of corporate America.
But Mr. Epstein's longtime image lacks substance. In reality, he had only a few relationships on Wall Street. The most important was Leslie H. Wexner, the billionaire founder of the L Brands retail empire, which included Victoria's Secret and The Limited. For nearly two decades, Mr. Wexner gave Mr. Epstein broad and unfettered powers to invest his personal fortune -- which in turn helped Mr. Epstein become fabulously wealthy.
Mr. Black, a widely respected figure on Wall Street, was also an important connection for Mr. Epstein. The two met in the late 1990s, and Mr. Epstein soon began working for Mr. Black. Over the next 15 or so years, including after Mr. Epstein's guilty plea in 2008, the two men met at Mr. Epstein's palatial townhouse in Manhattan, according to people who were there.
Mr. Black also put Mr. Epstein on the board of his family foundation, according to public charitable filings. Those documents show that Mr. Epstein stayed on the board of the Debra and Leon Black Foundation until 2012, well after he pleaded guilty in Florida. Mr. Black has described that as a paperwork error; he said Mr. Epstein stepped down in 2007, the year before his plea.
"On a few occasions," Mr. Black wrote, "I donated money to certain charitable organizations with which Mr. Epstein was affiliated, and he made contributions to certain charitable organizations that are meaningful to me."

Bulletproof Sign Needed to Protect New Emmett Till Memorial

Texto completo: Headnote But Lacking Similar Shields, Gunfire Overcomes the Innocent from CA to Philly
The heinous murder of 14-year-old Emmett Till, tortured by a tandem of whites in Mississippi in 1955, remains the preeminent example cited by Black parents in efforts to safeguard their children from falling prey to similar situations of racially-motivated hatred and violence.
Yet despite its historical significance for all Americans, especially Blacks, more than 50 years passed before a series of markers would be erected throughout the Delta in 2007, including the very spot along the Tallahatchie River where fishermen discovered Emmett's mutilated body still tied to a cotton-gin fan, honoring both Emmett's short life and his death - the spark which many believe ignited the Civil Rights Movement.
However, with their anger unabated, thieves destroyed the signs less than one year later - riddling subsequent replacements with rounds of bullets time and time again - until those leading the memorial resolved to erect a bulletproof marker earlier this year in June. Amazingly, hatemongers would attack the sign once again, July 26 - this time their efforts failed.
"To drive up and see it like that, I was sad," Patrick Weems, a founder of the Emmett Till Interpretive Center in Sumner, Miss, said to a New York Times reporter. "When we finally replaced it, it was an amazing feeling that this sign that had been obliterated was finally restored."
Weems attributes the decades of reticence and inactivity following Emmett's death to the prevailing attitude among those in the region to forget the crime had ever occurred. But lesser voices could not be silenced, including Simeon Wright, the youth's cousin who, at the age of 12, witnessed the kidnapping from the bedroom the two had shared.
Wright, who spoke several times with this reporter over the years, died in 2018. However, his wife, Annie, attended a ceremony unveiling the current sign on June 21.
And while no one has been charged with the latest act of vandalism, Weems says he'd rather emphasize the way people have come together in support of the preservation of Emmett's story as shared in the markers.
"This is a story about a local community - Black and white, Republican and Democrat, plantation owners and former sharecroppers - that came together and took responsibility," he told reporters, adding that over the years, the signs have been stolen, marked with Klan graffiti, tossed in the river and showered with acid.
Today a bulletproof metal marker, close to 600 pounds, stands in honor of the slain teen and Weems says, "We have moral responsibility to make sure that the sign keeps getting put back up."
GUNMAN'S BIGOTRY ATTRIBUTED TO SHOOTING SPREE AT FESTIVAL
Authorities reported on Monday that Santino William Legan, 19, who killed three including a 6- and 13-year-old boy and girl, respectively, at the Gilroy Garlic Festival on Sunday, July 28, had just four days earlier created an Instagram account criticizing the event, "paving more open space to make room for hordes of mestizos [those of mixed descent, commonly white and Hispanic of white and Native American], highly-visible participants at the popular northern California food festival, also saying that he had a plan in store for them.
Legan, wielding a semi-automatic rifle and wearing tactical gear, also injured over a dozen others before three police officers already on the scene, killed him less than one minute after he began shooting into the crowd of thousands as they ran for safety.
It has also been alleged that he had an affinity for a white supremacist text, "Might is Right," published in the late 1800s, which advocates anarchy, denounces Christianity and asserts that whites must rule over people of color.
In addition, authorities confirm that Legan had legally purchased the weapon used in the shooting three weeks earlier in Nevada.
Victims, 12 at the most recent count, ranged in age from 12 to 69 years old - the third fatality being a man in his 20s. Gilroy Police Chief Scot Smithee said the swift response of officers on duty at the festival, which did not have security cameras on the premises, preempted what could have been a far worse outcome for the annual outing in the town located 30 miles south of San Jose.
Despite the recent posting, police say they still are unsure of the shooter's motive.
"It seems this was a random act but we've got a long way to go before we can determine what his motivations were," Smithee said during a press conference on Monday.
Meanwhile, the FBI continues to seek further knowledge that would unveil Legan's ideological leanings, affiliations and motivations.
SHOOTINGS ON RISE IN CITY OF BROTHERLY LOVE
And while officials have yet to rule out racism as a cause, Philadelphia citizens have been plagued by a recent onslaught of shootings including back-to-back weekends of unprecedented violence.
Both occurring in June, the first weekend yielded a total of 28 shooting victims, five of whom died, while the second weekend ended with 11 wounded, all males, who had been attending a street party held to support recently-unveiled anti-violence measures.
The City of Brotherly Love has recorded 631 shooting victims in the city since the start of the year, an increase of 6 percent over the same period last year, according to police statistics.

Texto completo: Los fiscales no han decidido, de momento, su próximo paso en el caso penal contra Juan Rodríguez, padre ex militar que encontró muertos a sus gemelos tras supuestamente dejarlos olvidados por ocho horas en su auto al irse a trabajar en un hospital en El Bronx (NYC), el viernes 26 de julio.
“Estamos hablando con la oficina del fiscal de distrito para transmitirles lo que creo que saben y entienden. Que fue una tragedia horrible y terrible “, dijo el abogado de Rodríguez, Joey Jackson.
Rodríguez compareció hoy en el tribunal penal de El Bronx para una breve audiencia en la que los fiscales le dijeron al juez que “no se ha tomado ninguna acción del gran jurado” en este momento, informó a New York Post la portavoz de la Fiscalía del Distrito, Patrice O’Shaughnessy.
“Todavía estamos investigando”, dijo.
Rodríguez, que está en libertad bajo fianza, sigue acusado de dos cargos de homicidio involuntario y dos cargos de homicidio por negligencia criminal en las muertes del 26 de julio de sus gemelos Luna y Phoenix de un año de edad.
Si se presenta el caso, un gran jurado finalmente podría decidir acusar al veterano de la guerra de Irak.
Su próxima cita en la corte es el 27 de agosto. Su esposa, Marissa A. Rodríguez, ha estado a su lado, afirmando que fue un “accidente” horrible.
“Mi cliente está desconsolado”, dijo Jackson. “Ciertamente comprende la gravedad de lo que ocurrió. Su familia comprende la gravedad de lo que ocurrió. Son fuertes, resistentes y superarán este momento difícil”.
Rodríguez (39) es un Trabajador Social Clínico con licencia y también un veterano del ejército que sirvió en Irak. En el hospital “James J. Peters VA” en Kingsbridge asiste a otros ex combatientes sin hogar y enfermos.
“¡Mis bebés están muertos! ¡Maté a mis bebés!”, gritó al descubrirlos muertos y con espuma en la boca en su automóvil .
Quedó en libertad tras pagar una fianza de $100 mil dólares, en un caso que ha impactado al país, pero que no es una excepción.
Médicos y autoridades han recordado que desde 1998 alrededor de 440 menores en todo el país han muerto de golpes de calor después de ser olvidados en automóviles, generalmente no por falta de amor, sino por cómo funciona la memoria humana, según el doctor David Diamond, profesor de psicología en Florida a quien Rodríguez ha consultado tratando de explicar lo sucedido, según The New York Times.
No criminal case at this time against Juan Rodriguez, the father involved in twins' hot car death in the Bronx. He'll be back in court at the end of the month. https://t.co/YMAXUGIyQA

Texto completo: I got an email a couple of days ago from Apple. It was a receipt for three albums from the Apple Store. I don’t buy music anymore because my son put me on his Apple Music plan, where the whole family, including his sister (my daughter), gets to listen to pretty much all the music in the world for $15/month.
I reported it to Apple, and they asked me to check with other family members to make sure one of them hadn’t ordered it. Knowing the answer before I asked the question, I reported back to Apple, and they sent me an email about six hours later saying they’d determined that it had been a phishing email, “designed to trick users into visiting a website.”
Phishing has a bad name, and it came to everyone’s attention when that’s what allowed the Russians to hack into the DNC email accounts, which most likely contributed to Donald Trump winning the election. But every time we’re triggered to visit a website, in a way we’ve been phished. For me, it might be an email with the day’s top stories from the New York Times. A photo of something irresistibly cute or gruesome. A tweet from Trump or Rachel Maddow, a notification from Facebook, a text message from a friend. All are designed to maneuver me away from whatever I’m doing and turn to what the sender wants me to do: pay attention.
And pay I do. If time is money, I’m donating way too much of it to interests other than my own. In the last five minutes, it was a link to the promise of a photo of a yellow-plumed dancing cockatoo (I thought it might be another Trump sighting), an email link to the My Fonts website so I could look at the featured font of the day, an article about a greenhouse stolen from an Arroyo Seco elementary school, which was a double whammy because I learned the facts but also got an emotional turbo-charge from the ensuing outrage I felt. This is not to mention the text message from a friend trying to arrange brunch and, one minute later, a robo call! My anthropologist husband calls it digital cannibalism, and I’m afraid it’s feasting on most of our brains. No-see-ums are small phish compared to this.
In noticing this over the next few days, I became aware that there are some things I voluntarily give my attention to: my family and friends, for instance. Also I live near the park, so runners from the Taos High track teams pass by every once in a while. One day this week it was a mix of boys and girls, ripples of conversation rising from the tight pack of 10 or so runners. I watched and listened to the natural sounds for as long as they’re within eye and earshot.
Plus, I’m committed to being at the Unitarian Congregation every week. Whether it’s for a service, which usually stimulates intellectual and spiritual responses, or a sharing circle, devoted to listening to each other, church is one of the few places I go to give my attention, not be robbed of it.
If you see yourself like me, as an overphished pond, try for one morning to cultivate your mind rather than let others harvest from it. Or to mix up an already tangled metaphor, don’t allow every e-passerby to throw its worm into it your pond or to skim their fly across its surface. See if you can keep your focus and not jump out of the pond to take the bait, which comes with a hook.
My dad taught me to fish when I was a very little girl. He warned me about suckers: “They’re easy to catch but they eat from the bottom of the pond, so throw ’em back.” Keep that image of a bottom feeder in mind the next time something tries to grab your attention. Ask yourself: “Shall I claim my pond as my own, or react like a sucker?”
When I saw how hard it was, I realized I’m addicted to feeding at the bottom. Time to rise.
Barbara Scott is president of the Unitarian Congregation of Taos.

Texto completo: Osama bin Laden's son, Hamza, heir apparent to leadership of the militant group al-Qaida, is dead, according to multiple U. S. officials.
He was killed sometime in the past two years, during the Trump administration, but officials took some time to confirm his death, The New York Times reported.
In February, the State Department said Hamza was emerging as the new leader of the group and offered a $1 million reward for information on him. He was thought to be about 30 years old and based somewhere near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border.
"He has released audio and video messages on the Internet, calling on his followers to launch attacks against the United States and its Western allies, and he has threatened attacks against the United States in revenge for the May 2011 killing of his father by U. S. military forces," the State Department said at the end of February.
However, Hamza had already been killed by February – although his death had not yet been confirmed by U. S. military and intelligence agencies, according to the Times.
The U. S. government had a role in the Hamza bin Laden's death, but it remains unclear what that role was. Officials provided scarce details on when and where his death occurred, discussing the matter anonymously because it involved sensitive information and intelligence gathering, the Times reported.
When asked by reporters on Wednesday about bin Laden's reported death, President Donald Trump declined to comment.
Hamza bin Laden's last known public statement was released by al-Qaida's media arm in 2018, NBC reported. In that message, he threatened Saudi Arabia and called on the people of the Arabian Peninsula to revolt.
He is believed to have been born around 1989. His father moved to Afghanistan in 1996 and declared war against the U. S. Hamza, who moved with him, later appeared in al-Qaida propaganda videos, NBC reported.
He was 'brainwashed': Osama bin Laden's mom speaks out in interview
Hamza was married to the daughter of Mohammed Atta, the lead hijacker involved in al-Qaida's attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on Sept. 11, 2001.
His father was killed by U. S. Navy SEALs in Pakistan in 2011. Letters found by the Navy SEALs during the raid on his hideout showed that Hamza had asked his father to train him to follow in his footsteps, and that the elder bin Laden was preparing him for the role.
Osama bin Laden was believed to have fathered at least 20 children with half a dozen wives and was himself the 17th of 52 children. The letters uncovered in the raid after his death suggest that Hamza was one of his favorites.
Despite Hamza's death, al-Qaida is still a problem for the West, according to Nathan Sales, a counterterrorism expert at the State Department.
"Al-Qaida . . . has been relatively quiet. This is a strategic pause, not a surrender," he said in a briefing Feb. 28, after the State Department announced the reward for information on Hamza's whereabouts.
"Al-Qaida is not stagnant. It's rebuilding. And it continues to threaten the United States and its allies. . . . Make no mistake, al-Qaida retains both the capability and the intent to hit us," Sales said.

Sorry, but we're going to have to deport Baltimore There's not enough room in this country for both the city and the president.

Texto completo: I'm sorry to be the one to say this, but somebody has to: We are going to have to deport Baltimore.
I'm not naive. I know that deporting the Maryland city, which itself is one of America's busiest ports, will be a logistical headache. And yet, it could not be clearer that Baltimore has no place in President Trump's America.
The president recently described Baltimore as a "corrupt mess" and a "disgusting," "very dangerous" and "filthy place" that "ranks last in almost every major category" and is "the Worst in the USA" where "no human being would want to live."
It's easy to see why Trump feels this way. Everything that Baltimore is, Trump is not, and vice versa. There isn't enough room in this country for both of them. Consider:
Baltimore is a city of letters, home of Edgar Allan Poe, Upton Sinclair, H.L. Mencken and Tom Clancy; Trump dishoners English in unpresidented ways.
The Second Continental Congress met in Baltimore in the winter of 1776, and Baltimore's Samuel Chase signed the Declaration of Independence; Trump says the Continental Army "rammed the ramparts, it took over the airports, it did everything it had to do."
Baltimore is where Francis Scott Key penned "The Star-Spangled Banner" while detained with prisoners of war on a British warship; Trump says, "I like people who weren't captured."
Baltimore produced New York Yankees great Babe Ruth; Trump says of himself: "I was the best baseball player in New York."
Steel from Baltimore's Sparrows Point built the Golden Gate and George Washington bridges; Trump almost built a tower in Moscow.
Baltimore is the "Charm City"; Trump has insulted 598 people, places and things on Twitter over the past four years, per a New York Times tally, and he once shoved the prime minister of Montenegro.
Baltimore's blue crab is the world's finest and its aquarium world-famous; Trump's top seafood dish is McDonald's Filet-o-Fish.
Baltimore occupies a key place in African American history, with ties to Thurgood Marshall, W.E.B. Du Bois and Frederick Douglass; Trump says Douglass is "an example of somebody's who's done an amazing job and is being recognized more and more."
Baltimore's Little Italy produced Mayor Thomas D'Alesandro Jr. and his daughter, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi; Trump eats pizza with a fork.
The Baltimore Orioles were one of the charter franchises of the American League, and Camden Yards the inspiration for the modern ballpark; Trump promised to start a baseball league and failed to deliver.
Baltimore's Cal Ripken Jr. is called the Iron Man for his record-setting endurance; Trump took a golf cart while other world leaders walked during a Group of Seven summit in Sicily.
Baltimore Colts (and later, Ravens) fans have been unfailingly loyal through good times and bad; Trump paid hush money to Stormy Daniels.
Baltimore's Johns Hopkins is one of the world's top medical institutions; Trump says windmills cause cancer.
To be fair, there are a few areas in which Baltimore and Trump have some common ground: Baltimore, in the early 19th century, was the first American city to embrace gas lighting; Trump, in the early 21st century, embraces gaslighting. Baltimore inspired "Hairspray" and "The Wire"; Trump gave us "The Apprentice." Baltimore, in Trump's telling, is a "rat and rodent infested mess"; Trump's Mar-a-Lago was cited for 78 health-code violations over three years.
But these are the exceptions.
It should be obvious that Baltimore and Trumpism are fundamentally incompatible. If we are truly to Make America Great Again, we will have to send Baltimore back where it came from - in this case, Ireland. (Baltimore is named for the second Lord Baltimore of the Irish House of Lords, Cecil Calvert, the first Proprietor of the Province of Maryland.) Also to be deported are other portions of the country Trump has recently deemed unsuitable: Cincinnati, Detroit and New York (Trump had tweeted that nonwhite congresswomen from these cities should "go back" to the "totally broken and "crime infested places from which they came"), and now San Francisco (Trump, in a tweet Sunday, said Pelosi's district is "failing badly").
Some will mourn Baltimore when it is gone. I, however, will take some advice from Baltimore's favorite son.
Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Baltimore!
Quoth the Raven "Nevermore."

What comes next for Puerto Rico?

Texto completo: 'We woke up!"
That's how my friend Nelly Cruz, a publicist in San Juan, explained the massive street protests that led to the resignation of Puerto Rico's feckless and corrupt governor last month.
A lot of my fellow Puerto Ricans had not expected such an awakening in our lifetimes. There was just too much to overcome -- too much political neglect and corruption and graft and abuse of power. Among the Puerto Rican people, there was too much poverty and despair and political lethargy.

And yet, improbably, hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans took to the streets, and 15 days later, Gov. Ricardo A. Rossello, the 40-year-old son of a former governor, agreed to step down. Since his July 25 resignation, his constitutionally designated successor, Justice Secretary Wanda Vazquez has refused to step up and others in the line of succession have quit, or been fired or arrested. On Wednesday, Rossello named Pedro R. Pierluisi, who formerly represented the island in Congress, his new secretary of state, a role that means he will likely take over as governor when Rossello's resignation becomes effective on Friday.
But heady and exciting as the whole thing has been, the most important days are to come. The next few months will tell whether the crisis will devolve into political chaos or lead to fundamental changes, and which it will be is far from certain.
Puerto Rico's next chapter won't be written on a blank slate. The revolt comes after 15 years of economic crises that have included a massive debt load, a bankruptcy and restructuring plan and new austerity and budget rules imposed by a fiscal oversight board.
The island is still struggling to recover from the devastation of Hurricane Maria in 2017, something made more difficult because of an inept government response and the disdain shown for the island and its residents - who are American citizens -- by President Trump.
The current upheaval grew out of more recent scandals. First came revelations in late June of an "institutional mafia" operating in the Treasury Department. Days later, in a separate case, two top former Cabinet members were indicted on federal corruption charges.
The lid was blown off on July 13, when private text messages involving the governor and his inner circle were leaked. Hundreds of pages revealed plots to manipulate public opinion and crude comments against LGBTQ advocates, victims of Hurricane Maria and a variety of women. (In the messages, the governor called former New York City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito a "whore.")
Public outrage about the scandals was immediate and widespread, touching every sector of the island's 3.2 million people as well as Puerto Ricans on the mainland. Led by throngs of young people, popular music stars and women's groups like Colectiva Feminista and Victoria Ciudadana, the protests spilled over expressways, neighborhoods and the protest's epicenter, the streets leading to La Fortaleza, the governor's mansion, in Old San Juan.
So now what?
Some fear that the federal oversight board, known as the junta, will expand its powers over the island. Some fear that chaos and instability will drive more Puerto Ricans to leave and tourists to stay away.
Everyone agrees that change is essential, but it is unclear who can steer that change.
For now, the island's two largest political parties have little credibility. The protesters who rose up so effectively have little trust in any status quo politician, even Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz of San Juan, who plans to run for governor in 2020.
Carmen Haydee Rivera, an English professor at the University of Puerto Rico, believes whatever happens next is in the hands of the younger generation. "They are the driving force."
Some political watchers are looking to Alexandra Lugaro, who ran for governor as an independent in 2016 and is affiliated with the progressive Victoria Ciudadana, or citizens' victory, movement. She "may be one of the emerging leaders of Puerto Rico," said Jorge Duany, director and professor of the Cuban Research Institute at Florida International University.
Lugaro received only 175,000 votes in the 2016 election, or about 11%, but that was the biggest showing for an independent candidate in decades. Her path won't be easy. The island has a long tradition of passing power back and forth between the Partido Nuevo Progresista, which advocates statehood for the island, and the Partido Popular Democratico, which does not. But some Puerto Rico watchers believe the recent demonstrations have changed the calculus entirely.
In the long term, Puerto Ricans must deal with the festering problem of the island's status. Since it is neither a state nor an independent nation, its residents cannot vote in presidential elections, though they are citizens, and the island has no vote in the U.S. Congress.
Andres W. Lopez, a San Juan attorney and political insider, hopes that will soon be addressed. "Puerto Rico must use its newfound power to change its unequal relationship with the United States," he told me. "The emerging voices are clamoring for justice and for change. The future will bring about the full equality of statehood ... or independence. "
I hope he's right. I left Puerto Rico as a teenager to attend private school in the United States and have never lived there full time since. But like all Puerto Ricans who left, I want my birthplace to thrive. For me, Puerto Rico's status has always been at the heart of its intractable problems. It needs to become independent, or at least an American state. To be a colony in the 21st century is an anachronism.
But before tackling that, the island must decide whether the recent exuberant demonstrations will lead to longer term change and better leadership. And that is something only the island's residents can decide.

Texto completo: What's on TV
THE FATE OF THE FURIOUS (2017) 7 p.m. on FX. "Look out! Watch those people!" That line is yelled midway through this movie by the actress Nathalie Emmanuel. At the time, her character -- a hacktivist named Ramsey -- is careening through the New York City air in the passenger seat of a Mercedes-Benz that has been equipped to shoot harpoon-like projectiles. So the line rings out as somewhat unexpectedly conscientious. The chase, which includes Dwayne Johnson plowing through fallen scaffolding in a beefed-up pickup and culminates with a circle of vehicles firing their harpoon-things into a muscle car driven by Vin Diesel, also encapsulates the way this series taken the gas-guzzling action it introduced nearly two decades ago and, with each iteration, pushed matters even further over the top. "As the cars zig and the story line zags, these sequences grow baroque, defying reason and gravity, which have progressively come under siege in this franchise," Manohla Dargis wrote in her review of this most recent movie in the series for The New York Times. " To chart out that increasing aversion to the laws of physics yourself (or to prepare for the spinoff, "Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw," out this weekend), see also FAST & FURIOUS (2009) and FAST FIVE (2011), airing at 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. on Syfy.
NO ONE SAW A THING 11 p.m. on SundanceTV. Ken Rex McElroy had developed a reputation as a brutal and dangerous town bully by July 10, 1981, when he was shot and killed in broad daylight in front dozens of residents in Skidmore, Mo. Every witness, except for McElroy's wife, said that they didn't see who was responsible -- a show of solidarity with the killer that resulted in nobody getting charged with the murder. This mini-series looks back at the case, which remains unsolved.
What's Streaming
DOWN IN THE DELTA (1998) Stream on Hulu and Vudu; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. A young mother (Alfre Woodard) is sent by her mother (Mary Alice) from their Chicago home to the Mississippi Delta in this, the poet Maya Angelou's lone foray into feature film directing. "'Down in the Delta' may be an impossible dream, a cinematic Hallmark card of familial togetherness," Stephen Holden wrote in his review for The Times. "But the vision it offers is still a dream worth dreaming."
JACKIE BROWN (1997) Stream on Netflix; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. Quentin Tarantino's follow up to "Pulp Fiction" stars Pam Grier as a money-smuggling flight attendant whose life gets complicated after she's caught by the government. In her review for The Times, Janet Maslin wrote that "for all its enthusiasm, this film isn't sharp enough to afford all the time it wastes on small talk, long drives, trips to the mall and favorite songs played on car radios." But Tarantino devotees may view those elements as virtues.

Texto completo: A New York Times investigation published in May revealed that the University of North Carolina was not routinely publicly reporting its mortality outcomes to The Society of Thoracic Surgeons, which tracks mortality data nationally, and that its performance has waned in recent years.
Transparency in reporting is a priority for the pediatric surgery program at UW Hospital, which has continued to improve its mortality rates and sees patients from throughout Wisconsin and the country.
Dr. Petros Anagnostopoulos, the chief surgeon at American Family Children's Hospital, spoke to the Cap Times about his work, its challenges and how he strives to improve outcomes for patients.
What drew you to this work?
I always liked taking care of kids. Originally I thought I wanted to be a pediatrician, but then I liked surgery and I liked the heart. I wanted to be a heart surgeon a transplant surgeon 'and then when I did my cardiac pediatric surgery rotation, it all came together and I decided to go for that.
With infant and children's hearts, you're operating on something that is sometimes as small as a walnut.
How do you physically do that?
It is through a lot of training through a lot of years. The post-graduate training to become a cardiac surgeon was 11 years after I finished medical school, so there is a lot of training involved. Then you have to have the right mentorship when you're starting for the first several years of your career, to be in an environment that is nurturing. It's a highly technical field, but more important than the technique is the correct decision-making.
The thinking, the diagnosis, there is no field in medicine that is so collaborative. It is extremely important that you have a great system and you are surrounded by people who support you and challenge you to make you better and you make them better, too.
How have the mortality outcomes in pediatric heart surgery changed over the last 20 years?
Through training and experience, outcomes in our field are incredibly improved to what they were 20 years ago. Not only the technology, but the people, the training, the ways that the knowledge is being disseminated and the openness of our societies and the training programs have also improved outcomes.
What did you take away from the New York Times' report on high mortality outcomes for pediatric heart surgery at University of North Carolina Hospital?
I think what comes out from this report is that when you take care of open heart surgery for babies and children, there is a need of having institutional resources and a team-oriented approach. That commitment has to be there in human capital and in infrastructure and in technology. We are fortunate at the University of Wisconsin to have this commitment from everybody, from the academic chairs to the administration of the hospital, to the physicians to continue to support the program and invest in this program.
At the same time, you need to be transparent in your outcomes, so if there are opportunities for improvement to therefore then critically look at the quality of the service and have a very organized way or process towards improvement. I think the pressure is there for us to be better and perform better, not us meaning the University of Wisconsin, but our society.
And I think what that (report) shows is that a team is as weak as its weakest link. When their communication breaks down, when the people don't trust each other, when the infrastructure has not been updated, all it takes is a few broken links in the system to not do well. Bad outcomes happen to everyone but it is the willingness to identify problems that can raise all boats.
Where are UW's mortality rates today for the surgeries you perform?
When our mortality rates get updated for 2018, you're going to see that our mortality dropped even more. We are one of the safest places to do surgery in the upper Midwest.
This is a big debate in the profession right now because people are trying to figure out if this star classification is something that hurts or helps when it comes to assessment.
For general heart surgery, it is very complicated and no patient is the same as the other patient. One question we're all struggling with is, with the star classifications and the way it's used right now, is it a source of confusion for the public. Is it fair? What are our outcomes? What is the risk that we're taking? Is it misleading?
There is no question in my mind that the systems will continue to get better and that the transparency is the name of the game. The people need to know that when they come here, here is the quality of the surgery this place has done so that there are no hidden skeletons.

Texto completo: El magnate Jeffrey Epstein, acusado de tráfico sexual de menores , tenía planes científicos de gran alcance.
De acuerdo con el New York Times, Epstein tenía contactos con reconocidos hombres de la ciencia con el fin de desarrollar varios proyectos. Uno de ellos era impregnar mujeres con su ADN en Nuevo México. El reporte revela que el multimillonario era un entusiasta del transhumanismo , un movimiento que tiene el “fin de transformar la condición humana mediante el desarrollo y fabricación de tecnologías ampliamente disponibles, que mejoren las capacidades humanas, tanto a nivel físico como psicológico o intelectual”.
Las íntimas fotos que muestran el gusto sexual de Jeffrey Epstein por las niñas
La idea de Epstein era reclutar mujeres jóvenes y “guapas” para inyectarles su “semilla”. Esto indica que era simpatizante de la eugenesia, una filosofía en la que se buscan humanos “más fuertes, sanos e inteligentes”.
De acuerdo con el Times, Epstein también tenía interés en la criónica , una práctica científica que busca la preservación de humanos a bajas temperaturas con el objetivo de tratarlos médicamente y reanimarlos en el futuro. Una de las fuentes del Times dijo que Epstein buscaba que congelaran su cabeza y su pene.
Epstein enfrenta la cadena perpetua por sus delitos. El 25 de julio fue hallado semiinconsciente en su celda.

An Originalist Libel Defense; Justice Brennan might have stumbled onto a standard that comports with the Constitution.

Texto completo: A federal judge in Kentucky dismissed high-school student Nicholas Sandmann's libel suit against the Washington Post last week. That's no vindication of the newspaper's skewed reporting on the teen's run-in with American Indian activist Nathan Phillips on the National Mall in January. But it's a vindication of the First Amendment's limitations on state libel law, which have come under scrutiny of late, including from President Trump and Justice Clarence Thomas.
Mr. Sandmann and his peers were targeted by a Twitter mob, and the Post joined in portraying him as the villain in a "white privilege" morality play. Mr. Sandmann claimed the Post had defamed him by repeating Mr. Phillips's claim that Mr. Sandmann had physically "blocked" him. That judge held that was an opinion, not a factual claim, and therefore shielded by the First Amendment.
That conclusion may be debatable, but the First Amendment's protection of opinion shouldn't be. It is the legal expression of America's "national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open," as Justice William Brennan put it in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan (1964), which established that the Constitution imposes limits on state libel law.
Mr. Trump said in 2016 that he wanted to "open up" libel laws, and in February Justice Thomas wrote a solo opinion arguing that Sullivan departs from the Constitution's original meaning. He has a point: Brennan's reasoning is all policy. For decades, originalists like Justice Antonin Scalia have criticized it as an exercise of raw judicial power. Yet there's a good originalist case for limits on libel law.
Sullivan established that government officials suing for defamation must demonstrate that the defendant either knew that the defamatory statements were false or acted with "reckless disregard" for their accuracy—a standard confusingly known as "actual malice." Later decisions extended the requirement to all "public figures," whether or not they hold office.
Sullivan made it far more difficult for plaintiffs to win libel suits, even for statements that are false and seriously damaging. That price is worth paying, the justices reasoned, to provide breathing room for "uninhibited, robust, and wide-open" debate of public issues, given that inadvertent falsehoods are inevitable. Critics blame Sullivan for declining journalistic standards—including the Post's mobbing of Mr. Sandmann and his classmates.
But that's all policy. What about the law?
Sullivan was right to recognize the Constitution's relevance in libel cases. It doesn't matter that libel suits are brought by private parties, rather than the state, because it is the state's law that imposes the liability. If the First Amendment precludes a statute imposing fines for speech criticizing government officials, why would the constitutional analysis be different for a law that awards money to a plaintiff?
And while it may be that "the freedom of speech" recognized by the First Amendment does not protect defamatory speech—which was Scalia's view and apparently is Justice Thomas's—no one seriously argues that a state can punish any speech it wants, free from constitutional scrutiny, merely by labeling it "defamation." That means the court has to define the term somehow.
For all Justice Thomas's criticism of Sullivan, he doesn't take issue with its conclusion that the Constitution limits the reach of libel law. His beef is with the actual-malice standard. And that's where things get complicated.
To begin with, he doesn't say what he thinks the proper constitutional standard should be. He observes that judge-made common law provides the "backdrop" for understanding the First Amendment's guarantees of freedom of speech and the press, and he cites cases showing that the adoption of the First and 14th amendments "did not abrogate the common law of libel." That suggests he would have courts scrutinize libel claims for whether they comport with the historical understanding of defamation—if so, the speech would be unprotected. As he notes, it was black-letter law at the time of the framing that a libel plaintiff didn't have to assert actual malice at the outset of the case.
But plaintiffs often did have to prove actual malice to prevail. The law recognized circumstances in which a libel defendant could assert a "qualified" or "defeasible" immunity from damages and thereby put the plaintiff to the burden of proving "express" or "actual" malice under more or less the same standard Sullivan prescribed. One musty treatise, published in 1877, reports such immunity applies whenever the speaker has a "legal, social, or moral" duty to comment on another's character, fitness or conduct, including in matters of business, crime, morality or religion. Moreover, libel claims concerning government officials' conduct were often subject to the actual-malice standard, as were claims for punitive damages. Sullivan's reasoning was loose, but it didn't fashion actual malice out of whole cloth.
And it may be that Justice Thomas's understanding of the First Amendment is wrong. What if "the freedom of speech" does protect defamation? There was no reason for it to be excluded. James Madison's view was that freedom of speech should be understood as a broad natural right, not a specialized legal concept. The only other appearance of "speech" in the Constitution is the Speech or Debate Clause, which completely immunizes members of Congress from liability for legislative speech. The federal government had no general authority to punish or regulate libel. No one expected in 1789 that the First Amendment would apply to state law, and it didn't until it was incorporated under the 14th Amendment.
Yet this poses a conundrum: Imposing so strict a rule on the states would abolish libel laws altogether. Among the ways a court might reconcile the First and 14th amendments, actual malice has the benefits of historical pedigree, practical experience, and balancing vigorous public debate with at least some compensation and deterrence.
Modern originalism is young, and answers to these questions of original meaning often involve some doubt. Yet the Sullivan court might have stumbled onto a standard that comports with the Constitution.

Texto completo: The best piece of advice I've ever heard about being a journalist is from the investigative reporter Amy Goodman, who has worked in Nigeria and East Timor, among other places. Goodman said this: "Go to where the silence is and say something."
That sentence hung in my mind while reading "Our Women on the Ground: Essays by Arab Women Reporting From the Arab World," a stirring, provocative and well-made new anthology edited by the Lebanese-British journalist Zahra Hankir. It's a book that banishes all manner of silences.
Hankir invited 19 Arab and Middle Eastern sahafiyat -- female journalists -- to detail their experiences reporting from some of the most repressive countries in the world. The result is a volume that rewrites the hoary rules of the foreign correspondent playbook, deactivating the old clichés. Each of these women has a story to tell. Each has seen plenty.
Some of these journalists work (or have worked) for establishment media outlets like the BBC, NPR, The Financial Times, Bloomberg, Al Jazeera, The Washington Post and The New York Times. Others are freelance photographers, or small website operators.
They hail from, among other places, Egypt, Syria, Morocco, Yemen, Iraq, Lebanon, Sudan and Libya, though many also have a foot in the Western world. There's a lot of self-scrutiny in this volume. A sub-theme is the guilt many of these reporters feel over their own relative privilege, the fact that their own families are safe while the people they write about tend to live in poverty and in terror.
"Our Women on the Ground" has many aspects to it -- it's about ambition, harassment and misogyny, sex, family, bravery, politics, religion, history, broken lives and double lives -- but at bottom it imparts a pervasive sense of fear and loss. There are two harrowing deaths before we are 30 pages in.
The first is that of a young Syrian woman, a philosophy graduate named Ruqia Hasan, who was abducted and killed by ISIS for her outspoken posts on social media. She knew what was coming. She wrote on Facebook: "While they will cut off my head, I'll still have dignity, which is better than living in humiliation." Her story is delivered by Hankir, in her introduction.
The second is that of The New York Times's Beirut bureau chief Anthony Shadid, who died at 43 in 2012, apparently of an asthma attack, while reporting in Syria. The author of this powerful and rueful essay is his widow, Nada Bakri, who has also reported for The Times.
Bakri, like nearly all the writers in this book, does not hold back. After Shadid's death, she writes, "I quit journalism, left my home in Beirut and moved thousands of miles away from everyone I knew and everything familiar. Along the way, I became someone I don't recognize."
Many of these essays are about trying to work in dangerous circumstances, doubly so for women. As Zaina Erhaim writes in her essay: "I am a Syrian; a woman who lived in the most masculine of spaces; a journalist in a land of warlords; a secularist living among different kinds of extremists." She adds: "I would be a great target, someone a fighter would be proud to have killed."
There are accounts here of reporting from war zones and, for example, of being embedded with the United States military during the Iraq War. When these journalists were unable to be on the scene, they became skilled at scanning social media, especially YouTube videos, and gleaning information from those sources. Another kind of silence this book charts is the one that arrives when a source goes dark, because they've keen killed or forced out of their homes.
There are places these journalists can go that men cannot: kitchens and hair salons, to name two. In her essay, Hannah Allam, an NPR national security reporter who worked for McClatchy newspapers during the Iraq war, suggests that reporters ignore so-called women's stories at their peril.
Noting that on an average day at the height of the Iraq war, it was common for 80 men to die from car bombs, Allam writes: "Consider those numbers for a moment: 80 dead men meant 80 new widows and dozens of newly fatherless children. Every day." These women needed to become providers.
There is a good deal of gallows humor in "Our Women on the Ground." There are high spirits; several romances are recounted. There are many, many stories of frightening and unwanted attention from men. Yet in her essay, Donna Abu-Nasr, Bloomberg's Saudi Arabia bureau chief, catches some of the absurdity that can be in the air, too.
"Often, while I was stuck in traffic, young men would slam Post-its or papers with their mobile phone numbers scribbled on them on the window of my car," she writes. "That was one way to pick up women. Another was to go to the mall and throw the little slips of paper at the feet of women covered head to toe in black."
The optimism that attended the Arab Spring in the early 2010s slowly evaporates in these essays. Things grow worse, not better. About the Syrian crisis that began in 2011, Hwaida Saad, a reporter for The New York Times, notes: "Ideas changed, and so did faces -- many of which grew beards. On the radio, jihadi songs replaced those of Elissa. Innocence gradually disappeared."
The Palestinian writer and free-press advocate Asmaa al-Ghoul recalls some of the romance that attended the early days of the Arab Spring protests. "We thought that we were going to change the world," she writes. "How I pity the generation that will have to go out to do it all over again."

Texto completo: Thomas J. Barrack Jr., a Los Angeles-based investor and informal adviser to President Trump, sought powerful positions in the Trump administration in 2017 while pushing a U.S. nuclear energy policy in the Middle East that could benefit his company, according to a new report by congressional Democrats.
The allegations detailed in a report released Monday by the House Oversight and Reform Committee come weeks after Barrack was interviewed by federal prosecutors about his work for foreign clients.
Together, the inquiries intensify the spotlight on the longtime Trump friend, who played a central role in raising big-dollar contributions for the president's campaign and inaugural committee. Multiple federal probes have been examining possible foreign influence on Trump's campaign including through donors to his inaugural committee, which raised a record $107 million.
Barrack requested the June interview with the public integrity unit of the U.S. attorney's office in Brooklyn, which was first reported by the New York Times, after prosecutors began examining his business ties to the Middle East, according to his spokesman Tommy Davis.
Barrack has not been accused of wrongdoing, and Davis said prosecutors have informed him they have no further questions for him.
A spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office declined to comment.
In its new report, the House Oversight committee alleges that Barrack sought to leverage his relationship with Trump in an effort to promote corporate interests, including his own. Over the years, he has done significant real estate deals with investors in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar.
During the 2016 campaign, for example, Barrack shared the draft of a speech then-candidate Trump planned to give on energy with an associate in Dubai, who then sought input from officials in the region. Barrack then passed along their suggestions to Trump's campaign chairman, Paul Manafort.
"This is probably as close as I can get without crossing a lot of lines," Barrack wrote in a May 13, 2016, email cited in the report.
The report concentrates on the period from January to May 2017, when it says Barrack sought to be named to several administration posts - including special envoy to the Middle East and ambassador to the United Arab Emirates. (Barrack has said he preferred to remain an outside adviser.)
All the while, House investigators wrote, Barrack advocated on behalf of Saudi interests seeking to obtain U.S. nuclear technology and took steps to see that his company, Colony NorthStar, would profit from the proposals he was advancing. The report notes that, despite this advocacy, Barrack did not register as a foreign lobbyist.
White House officials did not respond to a request for comment.
Barrack aides have said that he was not advocating on behalf of foreign entities in his dealings with Trump officials and did not act improperly.
In a statement Monday, Barrack spokesman Owen Blicksilver said that the investor has been cooperating with the House investigation. "Mr. Barrack's engagement in investment and business development throughout the Middle East for the purpose of better aligned Middle East and U.S. objectives are well known," Blicksilver said, adding that Barrack's "consistent attempts to bridge the divide of tolerance and understanding between these two great cultures is etched in the annals of time. This is not political, it is essential."
A February report by the House panel said that members of the National Security Council and other senior White House officials objected to plans pushed by key administration officials to sell nuclear power plants to Saudi Arabia.
In its latest report, House Oversight investigators described more frequent and wide-ranging conversations between top administration officials, including Trump, and private companies with an interest in transferring U.S. nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia.
Barrack, who has known Trump for decades and served as his top campaign fundraiser, was a key conduit, according to the report, which cites thousands of documents turned over in recent months by private-sector companies and government agencies.
"The Trump Administration has virtually obliterated the lines normally separating government policymaking from corporate and foreign interests," the committee's chairman, Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), who has been under fire from Trump in recent days, said in a statement.
"The American people deserve to know the facts about whether the White House is willing to place the potential profits of the President's personal friends above the national security of the American people and the universal objective of preventing the spread of nuclear weapons," he added.
The Trump administration has allowed U.S. nuclear energy companies to share sensitive technological information with Saudi Arabia, but has so far not approved the full transfer of nuclear technology to the kingdom.
GOP members of the Oversight panel rejected the conclusions of the Democratic majority.
"The evidence currently before the Committee does not show impropriety in the proposed transfer of nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia," the Republicans said in a minority report released last week.
"Chairman Cummings and Oversight Democrats are obsessed with investigating every decision made by the Trump White House - especially when it involves a member of the First Family," the GOP report said. "In this case, however, the evidence before the committee simply does not substantiate the allegation leveled," against the administration.
The majority Democratic report notes that one of the power-plant manufacturers that could benefit from a nuclear deal, Westinghouse Electric, was the subject of interest from several potential investors, including IP3, a group of former top military officials with whom Barrack and onetime national security adviser Michael Flynn were in close contact.
IP3 issued a statement late Monday criticizing the report for linking "misunderstandings with conspiracy theories and allegations to create an arbitrary and contrived story that doesn't reflect the reality that occurred."

Texto completo: El mes pasado, Steven Romero celebró su sexto cumpleaños en Legoland en California. El domingo por la tarde, fue asesinado a tiros en el Festival del Ajo Gilroy en el norte de California.
En total, tres personas murieron y 13 resultaron heridas en el tiroteo , dijeron las autoridades. Se desconocen las identidades de las otras dos víctimas.
La policía disparó en apenas un minuto y mató al sospechoso que portaba un rifle de asalto, según un comunicado de la ciudad de Gilroy. Este lunes el atacante fue identificado como Santino William Legan . Se desconocen los motivos del crimen.
“No hay nada que realmente pueda hacer, además de tratar de estar con él hasta que pueda colocarlo en su lugar de descanso”, dijo el padre de Steven, Alberto Romero, a NBC Bay Area.
“Mi hijo tenía toda la vida por vivir y solo tenía seis años. Esto es todo lo que puedo decir.”
Romero estaba en casa con su hija de 9 años cuando se enteró del tiroteo. Steven había ido al festival con su madre y su abuela, que también resultaron heridas.
Romero dijo que la madre de Steven recibió dos disparos en la mano y cree que la abuela recibió un disparo en la pierna.
“Ojalá que detengan a los atacantes”, dijo Romero.
Justo después del tiroteo, Romero publicó una foto de Steven en Legoland, pidiendo a la gente que dé información sobre el tiroteo. Su cuenta ahora es privada.
Describió a su hijo como un niño enérgico que acababa de graduarse de la guardería y estaba a solo unas semanas de ingresar al primer grado.
Estaba “siempre feliz y siempre queriendo divertirse”, dijo Romero, mientras mostraba fotos del pequeño.
Entre los heridos estaba Lesley Sánchez, de 15 años, una porrista de la escuela secundaria Gilroy que estaba como voluntaria en el festival , según informaron miembros de la familia a The New York Times. Le dispararon en la cadera, pero pudo recibir visitas en su habitación del hospital el domingo por la noche, dijeron.
Julissa Contreras, una testigo que dijo que era una ex cadete de la policía, dijo en una entrevista el domingo por la noche que vio a “tu hombre blanco promedio” disparando lo que parecía ser un rifle semiautomático, “simplemente yendo de izquierda a derecha y disparando a quienquiera que podía, honestamente “.
“Definitivamente disparó más de 30 rondas”, dijo. “Fue como ininterrumpido, con dos, tres, cuatro disparos por segundo”.
Contreras describió al hombre como de unos 30 años, vestido con una gorra, gafas de sol deportivas y lo que parecía ropa de estilo militar.
“Parecía que podría trabajar en seguridad privada”, dijo. “Pero tenía como correas y clips, y estaba completamente preparado para lo que estaba haciendo. Absolutamente”.
Gilroy se encuentra a unos 30 kilómetros al sur de San José. El tiroteo tuvo lugar durante el Festival del Ajo Gilroy, un evento anual de tres días en Christmas Hill Park. Gilroy, de aproximadamente 60,000 habitantes, es un importante productor de ajo y hogar de trabajadores agrícolas y personas que se desplazan a empleos de tecnología.

DAN COATS TO STEP DOWN AS INTEL CHIEF

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump announced on Sunday that Dan Coats will step down as the director of national intelligence after a tenure in which the two were often at odds over Russian election interference, North Korea and the president's own attacks on the intelligence community.
"I am pleased to announce that highly respected Congressman John Ratcliffe of Texas will be nominated by me to be the Director of National Intelligence," Mr. Trump tweeted. "A former U.S. Attorney, John will lead and inspire greatness for the Country he loves. Dan Coats, the current Director, will be leaving office on August 15th. I would like to thank Dan for his great service to our Country. The Acting Director will be named shortly."
Mr. Ratcliffe has been a staunch defender of Mr. Trump. As a member of the House Judiciary Committee, he sharply questioned Robert Mueller, the former special counsel, at last week's hearing.
Mr. Coats had long been expected to depart of his own accord, an administration official said, but he ended up staying on longer so it would not seem as if he was forced out during a time of conflict with Mr. Trump. In a meeting last week, Mr. Coats told Mr. Trump and Vice Pres-ident Mike Pence that he was ready to move on.
Mr. Coats, who helped devise President George W. Bush's compassionate conservative agenda, had been an important link between the Trump administration and the Republican establishment. With Mr. Coats gone, those ties, at least on national security matters, are likely to weaken.
But Mr. Trump's grip on the Republican Party has only strengthened, and he has long since demonstrated that members of the party's establishment need his support far more than he needs theirs.
Mr. Trump had weighed firing Mr. Coats since he took issue with the president's assertions, after a 2018 meeting in Finland with President Vladimir Putin of Russia, that challenged the intelligence community's conclusions that Moscow interfered in the 2016 presidential race.

The homework for next class: The Mueller report

Texto completo: Walter Isaacson is an award-winning historian and history professor at Tulane University, where he teaches a course called "The History of the Digital Revolution, From Ada [Lovelace] to [Mark] Zuckerberg." Last semester, he said, he assigned the report from former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III - mainly Volume I - so students could learn how Facebook and Twitter were used by Russians and others to "polarize American society and influence our election."
"We discussed exactly what the Internet Research Agency did, who helped them, how the social networks responded, what could be done to prevent interference in the future, and what Facebook and Twitter should do," he said.
Isaacson is not the only educator to use the report - officially titled "Report on the Investigation into Russian Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election" - as a focus of discussion in class. Teachers and professors have used it in history classes and in government, law, political science and other courses in high school, college and law school.
Meanwhile, a host of book clubs have been formed to read, learn about and discuss the report, which has been a bestseller. One can be found on the website Muellerbookclub.com, which is conducting online readings and discussions of the report. PolitiFact, a nonpartisan fact-checking website, has its own free book club, which does weekly readings from the report, with analysis provided by PolitiFact journalists.
And on a website called Fatherly.com, a digital media brand for dads, writer Patrick A. Coleman urged parents to use the Mueller report to teach their kids about democracy. He wrote:
"Depending on political affiliation, politically-minded parents across America are either feeling dismayed or justified by the release of the largely toothless Mueller report. But as emotionally invested as some parents were in the findings of the special counsel, there's a very measured and nonpartisan lesson worth teaching kids at this inflection point in Trump's chaotic presidency. The Mueller report shows, if nothing else, the mechanisms of democracy at work. Even as pundits fume or gloat on cable news, the system is proving out."
For those educators who want to use the report but aren't sure how, there is new material to help from the News Literacy Project, a national education nonprofit that offers nonpartisan programs to teach students how to distinguish truth from fiction in the digital age. Published in the Sift - the News Literacy Project's weekly guide for educators on digital literacy - the material offers discussion and activity ideas.
Thomas E. Patterson, a professor of government and the press at Harvard University, wrote a 121-page abridged version that, he said, is far more accessible for students, teachers and everybody else than the 448-page redacted version that was publicly released. His book is titled "Summary of the Mueller Report, for Those Too Busy to Read It All," and the proceeds are being used for social media advertisements to bring the work to a wider audience.
The New York Times's Learning Network turned it into a teaching moment for educators under this headline: "Learning With: 'The Mueller Report Is 448 Pages Long. You Need to Know These 7 Key Things.' " Atop the article is this warning: "Note to teachers: The main article includes a curse said by the president."
And teachers are creating their own lessons.
Daniel Lynch is a history and social sciences instructor at the private Marlborough School in California, for grades seven through 12. In an Advanced Placement U.S. History course he was teaching, Lynch said he created a lesson on the Mueller report on the day it was released publicly in April.
"Since there was very little time between the release and our class (about an hour)," he wrote in an email, "I decided to make the lesson a review of impeachment and historic impeachment controversies and then transition to the current controversy."
First, he said, they reviewed the impeachment process and looked at impeachment controversies involving Presidents Andrew Johnson, Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton. (Nixon resigned before he could be impeached; the other two were impeached by the House but not convicted by the Senate.) Then students began to look for sources on the Internet about the release of the Mueller report and later drew Venn diagrams comparing and contrasting the three presidents' experiences with impeachment.
"We talked about bias and point-of-view of various news outlets and decided as a class to focus on the BBC's live blogging about the report as the best source for our purposes," he said. "For homework, students had already found and read an article from what they thought was a reputable source on obstruction of justice allegations against Trump based on information already in the public record. As a class, we listed the allegations already out there and added details coming out from the Mueller report."
The students "loved" the lesson, he said.
At Missouri Southern State University, William K. Delehanty is an associate professor of political science. He said that last semester he led a class discussion focused on how the Mueller report related to other instances of legal problems for presidential authority.
"In general," he said, "the American presidency is an institution that has grown in authority over time, and some students focused a great deal on the problem of unconstrained presidential authority, particularly in a political system designed to constrain and limit authority.
"Students were also interested in the notion that a sitting president could not be indicted," he said. "We spoke at length about how this may give the impression that the presidency (as an office) is above or outside of the legal restrictions that apply to other institutions and the agents within them."
The report has quickly become a useful tool for law professors.
At the University of Virginia's law school, Professor Saikrishna Prakash said he used the report last semester in a class titled "Presidential Powers" - and his students "were very interested" in it. He said he asked them to read portions of the legal discussion about obstruction of justice and its application to the presidency.
"It raises the question about the extent to which Congress can criminalize the use of presidential powers," he said. "It also raises the question of whether a federal employee can declare the president committed a crime. Finally, it also raises the question of whether Congress did in fact mean for the obstruction statutes to apply to the president."
Also at the University of Virginia law school, Professor Charles Barzun and a colleague plan to use the report for their seminar "Rule of Law and Threats to It" this fall, a school spokesman said. At Florida's Stetson University College of Law, Professor Ellen S. Podgor is planning to teach a new course this fall called "The Mueller Investigation & Beyond."
David Alan Sklansky, a law professor at Stanford University, said he thinks "students should read the report for the same reason everyone in America should read it."
"It describes the findings of a really important investigation, and it has been widely mischaracterized, including by the president and by the attorney general," he said.

Texto completo: Ken Burns, the documentary filmmaker famous for his PBS American history films such as “The Civil War,” “Vietnam” and “Baseball,” says he wants to encourage a new generation of historical documentarians.
His new Next Generation Angels awards honor the top student documentary filmmakers from the National History Day competition.
He’ll host student winners — including Donegal High School rising senior Taylor Barton — in Washington this fall for film screenings, an awards ceremony and tours of archives at such facilities as the American Film Institute and the Library of Congress.
The Better Angels Society is a nonprofit that raises money for Burns and future documentary filmmakers to continue producing historical films.
Burns’ next film, “Country Music,” which explores the history and impact of the American musical genre, airs on PBS starting Sept. 15.
Via email, Burns answered a few questions about the student awards and the future of documentary film.
What impact do you hope your Next Generation Angels Awards will have on the future of documentary filmmaking?
Young people are doing incredible work in every space.
We’re hoping this further encourages them to focus on historical documentaries as an art form and a key way to further expand civic engagement and conversation.
Why do you feel participating in National History Day is important for students — even those who don’t plan to make history their career?
National History Day is one of our greatest civic initiatives.
It’s smart and fun, and it recognizes that historical awareness is a critical way to think, regardless of what you decide to do for a living.
What were your early influences or school projects that led you to make historical documentaries as a career?
I always thought I would be a feature filmmaker.
It wasn’t until Hampshire College that I turned to documentary filmmaking, in part because of the influence of the great still photographer Jerome Liebling.
What’s your general assessment of the subject matter and quality of the National History Day/Next Generation Angels Awards documentary winners this year?
We were all greatly impressed by the range of topics and the execution.
What do you plan to talk about when the winning high school filmmakers come to Washington this fall?
I plan to talk to them about their art and about how they can stay focused, keep working and avoid rigidity.
Has the role of documentaries changed during this current period of American history, when various segments of society seem to be operating from different sets of facts, and during which the news media’s “first draft of history” is mistrusted by many?
First, I think that journalists have done a phenomenal job in a very difficult time.
What the New York Times and Washington Post — and local newspapers around the country – do daily is a miracle.
Documentaries have never been more impactful. There’s a huge audience and appetite for documentary narratives of all kinds.
Do you feel that mistrust of the media has or will have any impact on citizens’ view of historical documentaries?
No. I think people are smart and thoughtful.
While perhaps they are more wary than ever given the amount of punditry that tries to pass as journalism, I think there is always an interest in — and appreciation of — strong historical scholarship and storytelling.
What can viewers expect to learn from “Country Music” in the fall, and why should those who aren't country music fans watch it?
I hope that they listen to the stories and to the stories that the songs tell us, the universal stories we all share.
It’s an amazing ride, a true art form, and it tells us so much about our country and what makes us so unique. All of us.

Brodi Ashton: If you flip the bird and no one is around to see it, does it make the driver you targeted any less of a jerk?

Texto completo: It was safe to say, I had the rage of the road. But it might not be for the usual reasons that come to mind.
The other day, I was in a left turn lane. The car in front of me turned left, and it looked like I had a clear path. I barely tapped on the gas when I saw a car coming toward me. I stepped on the brake. I had moved maybe two inches.
I was not in his way yet. Even so, I put my hand up so he would know that I saw him.
I know it was a “him” because I could see his face. As he went through the intersection, he pointed a finger at me, and then did an exaggerated wag back and forth, like he was Dikembe Mutombo denying a basket.
He had passed by before I could respond. All he saw was an apologetic wave.
I couldn’t believe it. I had just been finger-wagged for doing something totally responsible like stopping and waving. Not only that, it had been by a slick guy in a red and black sports car, with chrome in all the right parts. The car, not the man.
The car was definitely compensating for something — probably small shoes.
So here’s where my rage crept in to my heart like a bowling ball thrown by Nolan Ryan. (What’s that, you say? Two sports analogies in one column? You bet your Dr. Dunkenstein’s, I did.)
The man passed by before I was able to give him the finger. This affected me in a way that I had not expected. I like to think of myself as an even-keeled person, although previous boyfriends would disagree. But most other people who know me, I think, would say I wasn’t necessarily quick to anger.
And yet, I wanted to turn my car around, chase his stupid overly chromed car and hair down, and explain to him that had I known he would be a jerk, I would not have waved. I would have given him the bird, because I’m a quick draw when it comes to a well-deserved bird.
Which, if you have to track down a driver and explain to him your intentions of flipping of the bird, and how you had gone from gracious driver to raging lunatic but he didn’t have the chance to see it, the obscenity might lose its power. Kind of like explaining why a joke is funny. Middle fingers shouldn’t have to be explained after the fact.
So I took some deep breaths and thought about my therapist’s advice when I told her of my fantasy to leave everything behind and change my name to Phyllis and move to Tahiti.
She forced me to follow through on that scenario. How would you pay for it? Would you sell your house first? What about your kids? That one always brings me back to reality.
So, back to the road rage. What if I turned around and followed him? What if I got him to stop so I could explain the sheer terror that should have rained down on him by me giving him the bird?
Probably not a good idea.
So I found solace in going home to my kids and insisting that from now on, they call me Phyllis. At least this way, there wouldn’t be any violence.

Texto completo: Sumaq opened quietly in February in the same plaza as Five Guys and Firehouse Subs off Santa Barbara Boulevard, and since then the restaurant has been offering diners a taste of South American cuisine. Husband-and-wife owners Francisco and Roxana Oller hail from Chimbote, in northern Peru. Opening the restaurant was a long-held dream for them, especially Francisco.
"Francisco loves to cook," Roxana said, "and he always wanted for the locals here to get to know Peruvian food."
Before the couple opened the restaurant, they ran a market in the same plaza, which they still own. The market sells products from different Latin American countries, as well as meat and prepared ceviches. Francisco's success with his ceviche dishes in the market gave him the inspiration to expand into a full-service restaurant.
Peruvian cuisine features influences from Asian and European cultures. Diners will see a mix of these on Sumaq's menu, from the Chinese-influenced fried rice dishes known as chaufas to Italian-inspired pesto over fettuccine to Spanish-style paella. The menu also highlights Peruvian ceviches, from the mixto with lime-marinated fish, green mussels, shrimp and calamari to the leche de tigre with the same marinated fish in a yellow Peruvian hot pepper sauce.
"All of our dishes, from our appetizers and ceviches to our desserts, are made with ingredients imported from Peru," Roxana said.
"That gives it a unique, authentic flavor."
The word "sumaq" comes from Quechua, the native language of the Incas. It has a range of meanings, including beautiful, delicious, pretty and friendly. Sumaq the restaurant appears to be all those things. Plus sporks.
Sporks?
"It's perfect for eating ceviche," said a young woman behind the counter. "There are the pieces you have to poke and the juice you have to sip."
She was right — the spork was perfect for navigating the chunks of raw seafood heaped into the bowl and also slurping up the leche de tigre sauce made from lime juice, garlic and Peruvian peppers.
Diners also dive into plates of lomo saltado, Peruvian stir-fry. From the kitchen, the smells of grilled meat wafted into the dining room.
"We love hearing our customers tell us how much they enjoyed their meals and seeing them time and time again," Roxana said.
"It motivates us to continue improving."

Texto completo: "I have deep concerns that Chief Hull will bring the inhumane conditions and dehumanizing behavior I witnessed at the southern border to Metro Detroit."
U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib
D-Detroit, in a statement
The head of Border Patrol in El Paso, Texas — who drew criticism this year over conditions for migrants in his care — has been transferred to Detroit, where he will lead the federal law enforcement agency in Michigan and some other northern states.
Aaron Hull, the chief patrol agent for Border Patrol in the El Paso sector in western Texas, will start Monday as the interim chief patrol agent for the Detroit sector on temporary duty assignment, according to an official with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP).
The official said that "multiple members of the Border Patrol's senior leadership team are currently rotating on" temporary duty assignments "in both Headquarters roles and senior field positions nationwide."
The Detroit sector includes all of Michigan, Ohio, Illinois and Indiana. The area he is responsible for has 863 miles of international border with Canada.
Hull has drawn criticism for how Border Patrol has housed migrants in the El Paso area, which has seen an influx of migrants, mainly from Central American countries. Earlier this year, the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General issued an alert about what it called "dangerous overcrowding" in migrant centers in the El Paso area that Hull oversaw.
U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Detroit, and 13 other members of Congress visited Border Patrol centers in El Paso and Clint earlier this month and described what they said were poor and unsanitary conditions. Tlaib told the Free Press that the migrants she met in the Border Patrol centers seemed scared, with some unable to shower or get clean water and medical attention.
On Friday evening, Tlaib released a statement to the Detroit Free Press on Hull, saying she was concerned about his transfer to Detroit.
"I am concerned that we have a chief that has been trained to address the humanitarian crisis at the border in a way that would hurt our communities at home," Tlaib said. "I personally toured CBP Station 1 and the Clint facility with Chief Hull. ... Chief Hull has done the bidding of this Administration with intolerable consequences for immigrants, and even to the detriment of his own agents. I witnessed agents breaking protocol in front of Chief Hull while on my tour, which makes me concerned he allows bad behavior to continue without accountability.
"I have deep concerns that Chief Hull will bring the inhumane conditions and dehumanizing behavior I witnessed at the southern border to Metro Detroit."
NBC News, which first reported the news of Hull's transfer to Detroit, said Hull is known as a "law and order" Border Patrol chief, according to a Department of Homeland Security official. A New York Times report said "Hull is known among colleagues as tough and law-enforcement oriented," citing two Homeland Security officials.
The transfer of Hull has caused some concern among regional immigrant advocates. Lynn Tramonte, director of the Ohio Immigrant Alliance, said Hull's transfer to Detroit is "very bad news for Ohio & Michigan."
Border Patrol did not comment beyond a statement saying that Hull will be sent to Detroit.
In an interview with CNN earlier this month, Hull said, "I would dispute that the conditions are so bad as have been reported."
After the visit of Tlaib and other members of Congress, Border Patrol said in a statement that the migrants are getting three meals a day and clean drinking water. A Border Patrol spokesman said they have invested "in additional restroom and shower facilities, hygiene products, increased medical support and expanded transportation capabilities."
While the Detroit border area does not face the type of influx seen at the southern border, it has sizable immigrant and minority communities who have expressed concern about how Border Patrol in Michigan operates. Latinos, including those who are U.S. citizens and born in the U.S., have said they are targeted by Border Patrol.
Almost one in three people processed by Border Patrol agents in Michigan are U.S. citizens, according to data obtained by the ACLU. About 82% of foreign citizens stopped by Border Patrol are Latino, the data showed. Less than 2% of foreign citizens stopped in Michigan have a criminal record.
Another issue in Michigan with Border Patrol is that the entire state is considered part of a 100-mile zone near a border that allows federal immigration agents additional powers in all of Michigan to search people or vehicles.
The ACLU has expressed concern that Border Patrol in Michigan has enhanced powers that can be used to target minorities. Latinos have expressed concern about being profiled by Border Patrol in Detroit at Amtrak train stations and Greyhound bus stops.
Border Patrol officials have said they do not target people based on their ethnicity.
"It is the policy of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to prohibit the consideration of race or ethnicity in law enforcement, investigation and screening activities, in all but the most exceptional circumstances," CBP spokesman Kris Grogan said last year.
U.S. Rep. Andy Levin, D-Bloomfield Township, who visited a Border Patrol detention center in McAllen, Texas, earlier this month, said he would be open to meeting with Hull.
"I really want to hear and make sure we are fully respecting immigrants and we are protecting our borders in a way that respects everyone's rights," Levin told the Free Press Friday.
Tlaib added in her statement: "I grew up in a northern border community and have watched the growing militarization of our southwest Detroit neighborhoods. We must protect our residents from being targeted and becoming victims of the broken system. CBP has a culture that dehumanizes immigrants, and excuses about a lack of resources and funding are flimsy and certainly no justification. Our communities and the families in them cannot truly be safe if CPB is not held accountable."
In fiscal year 2018, Border Patrol made 1,930 apprehensions in the Detroit sector, compared to 31,561 apprehensions in the El Paso sector, which includes western Texas and New Mexico, according to Customs and Border Protection.

"I have deep concerns that Chief Hull will bring the inhumane conditions and dehumanizing behavior I witnessed at the southern border to Metro Detroit."

Texto completo: A woman who said she was sexually abused as a child by a pastor at one of the country's most prominent evangelical megachurches sued the church on Friday, alleging gross negligence and seeking more than $ 1 million in damages.
The case against the Village Church -- which is based in Flower Mound, Tex., outside Dallas, and is led by Matt Chandler -- is perhaps the most high-profile current lawsuit alleging child sexual abuse in the Southern Baptist Convention. It comes as the largest Protestant denomination in the United States has vowed to address widespread sexual abuse in its congregations.
The suit alleges that the church was "willfully negligent" in its failure to protect a child in its care from being sexually assaulted. It also says the church is liable for the actions of the pastor, who was removed from the staff last year. The woman is seeking damages after she says the abuse caused emotional distress, including an ongoing struggle with depression.
"No one has ever apologized to her, 'Hey we are so sorry we failed to protect you.' That is what has stuck with me this entire time," said Christi Bragg, the young woman's mother.
Matthew Tonne, the former children's minister, was indicted by a grand jury in November and arrested in January on charges of sexually molesting Ms. Bragg's daughter in 2012, when she was 11. Mr. Tonne, whose lawyer has said his client had been falsely accused, faces a forthcoming criminal trial.
The family said the Village has failed to provide them with sufficient answers and support since they told church leaders about the abuse in February 2018.
The Village has "not yet to date demonstrated a good faith desire to resolve this," said Boz Tchividjian, a lawyer representing the young woman, who is now 18. "We have provided ample opportunity and ample time for that. We have hit a brick wall, and at that point in time we had to make the difficult but necessary decision to press forward to filing the lawsuit."
Mr. Chandler and a lawyer for the Village, Dustin Gaines, did not respond to requests for comment after the suit was filed.
The suit outlines an extensive timeline of events, first reported in an investigation by The New York Times last month.
The suit states the Mr. Tonne was able to access and abuse the plaintiff at a Village summer camp for children because her cabin was also the location for some adult staff meetings. Both male and female adults were present at these meetings, in violation of the church's own policies about people of the opposite sex in children's cabins, the suit says. On the night of the alleged assault, the suit says that Mr. Tonne met with other adults right outside the girls' room, giving him the opportunity to enter her room and sexually violate her.
The suit also alleges that the church was not forthcoming to the young woman and the congregation about the reason Mr. Tonne was removed from its staff last year.
The Village has stated repeatedly that Mr. Tonne was removed for alcohol abuse, rather than because of the criminal investigation into whether he had sexually abused a child. When church officials decided to remove him, Mr. Chandler told congregants last month, "we had not been informed that he was the accused."
But the lawsuit states that the Braggs had told a Village staff member by then that Mr. Tonne was a suspect.
The suit alleges that the church has not taken "independent efforts to ascertain whether Tonne abused any other children under its care and supervision." The Village has not stated publicly if it has conducted an independent investigation.
When the Southern Baptist Convention met in Alabama last month, the denomination created a committee to evaluate allegations against churches accused of mishandling abuse. Roger S. Oldham, a spokesman for the convention's executive leadership, said that the committee's first order of business was to elect a leader, which it did on Monday, and that it is "formulating a plan of action."
Mr. Chandler briefly interrupted his summer sabbatical to address the Braggs' allegations at the convention, and then at the Village in a sermon the following Sunday. He disputed that the church had mishandled the case, and stated that he had met with the Bragg family, which Ms. Bragg said was "simply not true."
Since coming forward last month, the Bragg family said they have lost close friendships and that their daughter has been bullied. The day Mr. Chandler disputed their experience at the convention was "a day of trauma for us as a whole family," Ms. Bragg said.
The Southern Baptist Convention's top leaders, who promised last month to fix the way churches address sexual abuse, have not commented on the Braggs' case.
The State of Texas protects churches and other charitable organizations from damages in lawsuits by capping their maximum liability at $ 500,000, according to a 1987 law. But the limit does not apply to acts that are "intentional, willfully negligent, or done with conscious indifference or reckless disregard for the safety of others."
The lawsuit alleges that the damage cap does not apply because the church was "willfully negligent" in its failure to protect a child in its care from being sexually assaulted.

Marvel Studios unveils diverse film lineup

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES - Marvel Studios has generated more than $22 billion in global ticket sales since 2008. Its 23 movies during that period have turned minor comic-book characters like Iron Man and Rocket Raccoon into cultural touchstones. Even "Ant-Man" was a hit.
But for months Marvel played coy with fans, not to mention rival studios and Wall Street, about its future projects.
On Saturday night, the studio finally unveiled what was coming next: a slate of interconnected movies and streaming-service shows that emphasizes diversity on both sides of the camera. The lineup includes the first openly LGBTQ superhero in a Marvel film, a superhero who is disabled and a film anchored by an Asian superhero.
The films and TV shows will either push Marvel further into the stratosphere or at long last reveal the studio's limitations. Until now, Kevin Feige, Marvel's fanboy-in-chief, has focused almost entirely on movies. But the Walt Disney Co., which owns Marvel, is now counting on him to also make must-watch shows for its Disney Plus streaming service, which is scheduled to go live Nov. 12.
And he will have to do it without some of Marvel's most popular characters, including Iron Man and the Hulk, who are taking much-needed rests.
Feige announced Marvel's new projects during an evening presentation at Comic-Con International, an annual fan convention in San Diego that attracts 140,000 people.
Scarlett Johansson will headline "Black Widow," reprising her role as a spy and superassassin from earlier Marvel films like "Captain America: Civil War." Fans have long pressed Marvel to give the character her own movie (and sell more related merchandise). "Black Widow," directed by Cate Shortland, will be released in theaters in May.
Angelina Jolie, Kumail Nanjiani, Salma Hayek, Brian Tyree Henry and Richard Madden will star in "The Eternals," a film scheduled for November 2020. It will focus on mysterious immortals, one of whom is deaf. The movie's director, Chloe Zhao, is Chinese and known for little-seen art films like "The Rider," which collected $2.4 million worldwide last year.
Marvel will also seek to replicate its theatrical success with "Black Panther," which featured a majority Black cast, by adding a standout Asian superhero to its cinematic universe. "Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings" will star a Chinese Canadian actor, Simu Liu, in the title role. Awkwafina will join him in the film, which is scheduled to be released in theaters in February 2021. "Shang-Chi" is being directed by Destin Daniel Cretton, the Japanese American filmmaker known for the 2013 indie film "Short Term 12."
Marvel's coming slate also includes "Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness" (May 2021) and "Thor: Love and Thunder" (November 2021). In a major twist, Natalie Portman will return to the "Thor" series as a female version of the god of thunder. The fourth "Thor" installment will also find Tessa Thompson reprising her role as Valkyrie; Thompson confirmed during the Comic-Con presentation that her character will have a lesbian narrative.
"As new king, she needs to find her queen," Thompson said. "That will be the first order of business."
Feige said he was also working on a new version of the vampire thriller "Blade," this time starring Mahershala Ali, and a new "Fantastic Four" movie, along with "Captain Marvel 2," "Black Panther 2" and "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3." Those films are expected to start arriving in 2022.
The next batch of Marvel movies - Phase 4 in the studio's vernacular, with "Spider-Man: Far From Home" wrapping up the previous phase - will feature storylines that overtly extend to smaller screens, a first for Feigs's operation. Until now, Marvel-branded TV" shows Iike "Jessica Jones" and "Agents of 5.H.I.E.LD." have been made by a lesser Marvel division.
"our of the five shows that Feige is working on for the Disney Plus app, all previously announced, focus on "Avengers" characters Tom Hiddleston is reprising his vilainous role in "Loki" (2021). Elizabeth Olsen will reprise her ethereal Scarlet Which character in "WendaVision" (2021). Anthony Mackie will return as the Falcon n "The Falcon and the Winter Soldier" (2020). And Jererry Renner stars in "Hawkeye" (2021).
A fifth series, "What If... ?" (2021), is animated. It focuses on new versions of pivotal moments from old Marvel movies.

Texto completo: René Samaniego, detective de NYPD que fungía como el principal cómplice en la red de prostitución y apuestas de su colega Ludwig Paz y su esposa dominicana Arelis Peralta, fue sentenciado ayer a una pena de 2 a 6 años de prisión.
Los tres ya se habían declarado culpables por el caso, que involucraba a más policías y operaciones en al menos ocho burdeles y salones de belleza en Brooklyn, Queens y Long Island, en uno de los peores escándalos policiales en los últimos años en Nueva York.
Samaniego (44) cobraba $500 dólares semanales por el soborno, detalló The New York Times.
Ronald Hollie, juez de la Corte Suprema de Queens, impuso la sentencia luego de que el ex policía se declarara culpable de dos cargos de intento de corrupción empresarial.
“Este acusado tomó un juramento para proteger y servir cuando entró al NYPD, en lugar de ello tristemente, escogió la ambición sobre el honor”, dijo el fiscal asistente John Ryan, citado por NY1 Noticias. “Ensució la placa que portaba para llenar sus bolsillos con efectivo”.
Samaniego fue acusado de ayudar al ex detective Paz, avisándole cuando habría operaciones de la policía en los lugares donde funcionaba la operación de prostitución y juego ilegal.
“Este oficial disminuyó el trabajo de decenas de miles de otros policías honestos y éticos”, denunció el comisionado James O’Neill.

Investigan a ex policía por heridas en cuello de Jeffrey Epstein, y a su novia como cómplice de sexo con menores

Texto completo: Es posible que las heridas en el cuello que llevaron al detenido magnate Jeffrey Epstein al hospital, hayan sido causadas por otros preso y no un intento de suicidio o de llamar la atención para que le aprueban la libertad bajo fianza, como se había sugerido inicialmente.
La noche del martes Epstein (66) fue descubierto en el suelo por guardias del Centro Correccional Metropolitano, en el Bajo Manhattan, donde está recluido sin fianza por cargos de tráfico sexual. Lo llevaron a un hospital por lesiones en el cuello y al regresar a prisión fue puesto en vigilancia suicida, informó New York Post.
La policía ha interrogado como sospechoso del posible ataque a Nicholas Tartaglione (51), un ex policía arrestado y acusado en 2016 por el asesinato de cuatro mexicanos en Chester (NY), en medio de una conspiración por narcotráfico.
“Las marcas son más consistentes con ser estrangulado que con colgarse”, dijo una fuente. Las especulaciones se mantienen porque Epstein se ha negado a cooperar con los investigadores.
Tartaglione afirmó que no escuchó nada y que no fue responsable de las lesiones de Epstein, según los reportes.
Epstein está alojado en la unidad “10 South”, un bloque de seis celdas conocido como el “ala del terror” porque es donde se encuentran los presos federales más peligrosos de la ciudad , incluidos presuntos terroristas.
Allí estuvo alojado hasta ser sentenciado la semana pasada el narcotraficante Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán. “El lugar es tan asqueroso”, había denunciado el abogado del mexicano, Jeffrey Lichtman.
Al mismo tiempo, la relación personal de muchos años de la británica Ghislaine Maxwell con Epstein ha generado dudas sobre lo que ella pudo haber sabido sobre las denuncias de tráfico sexual .
Ahora, miles de páginas de documentos sellados derivados de su relación están a punto de hacerse públicas, anunció The New York Times.
Fotografías de Maxwell con diversas personalidades han circulado por años en la prensa, incluyendo su presencia en primera fila en la boda de Chelsea Clinton en 2010.
Su papá, el ex presidente Bill Clinton, fue uno de los primeros en distanciarse de Epstein a través de un comunicado luego de su detención el 6 de julio en el aeropuerto Teterboro (NJ), al regresar de París en un vuelo privado.
También ha salido a flote la vieja amistad del acusado con Donald Trump. El escándalo de abuso sexual de menores ya causó la renuncia del Secretario del Trabajo, Alex Acosta, el único latino en el gabinete, debido a que fue él quien, siendo fiscal en Miami, negoció el acuerdo de culpabilidad en 2008 que mantuvo a Epstein libre hasta ahora.
En medio del escándalo, trascendió que NYPD también falló en supervisar la libertad condicional de Epstein.

Ghislaine Maxwell was Jeffrey Epstein’s girlfriend. She was also called his “fixer.” One of his accusers called her his madam. And now with Epstein under federal indictment, there are mounting questions about what she knew about his alleged predation. https://t.co/FF8eL2rhG3

Texto completo: René Samaniego, detective de NYPD que fungía como el principal cómplice en la red de prostitución y apuestas de su colega Ludwig Paz y su esposa dominicana Arelis Peralta, fue sentenciado ayer a una pena de 2 a 6 años de prisión.
Los tres ya se habían declarado culpables por el caso, que involucraba a más policías y operaciones en al menos ocho burdeles y salones de belleza en Brooklyn, Queens y Long Island, en uno de los peores escándalos policiales en los últimos años en Nueva York.
Samaniego (44) cobraba $500 dólares semanales por el soborno, detalló The New York Times.
Ronald Hollie, juez de la Corte Suprema de Queens, impuso la sentencia luego de que el ex policía se declarara culpable de dos cargos de intento de corrupción empresarial.
“Este acusado tomó un juramento para proteger y servir cuando entró al NYPD, en lugar de ello tristemente, escogió la ambición sobre el honor”, dijo el fiscal asistente John Ryan, citado por NY1 Noticias. “Ensució la placa que portaba para llenar sus bolsillos con efectivo”.
Samaniego fue acusado de ayudar al ex detective Paz, avisándole cuando habría operaciones de la policía en los lugares donde funcionaba la operación de prostitución y juego ilegal.
“Este oficial disminuyó el trabajo de decenas de miles de otros policías honestos y éticos”, denunció el comisionado James O’Neill.

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO - Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes has become one of the company's biggest problems.
In recent weeks, Hughes, who left the social media giant in 2007 and cashed out his nearly $500 million worth of stock, has been making the rounds in the nation's capital, visiting a dozen lawmakers and regulators at the Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission and other agencies that are interested in examining whether Facebook has amassed too much power.
In some of those meetings, he and his collaborators have presented a 39-page slide deck that makes a point-by-point legal case for breaking up the social network, drawing on decades of antitrust law precedent.
The crux of the case, designed by two antitrust scholars: Facebook's wealth and power and massive user base have pushed it into monopoly territory, and its acquisitions of rivals have squashed competition. More than 2.7 billion people use Facebook or its other platforms, which include Instagram and messaging service WhatsApp, at least once a month, Facebook said Wednesday.
"I hope that my speaking out provides cover to a lot of other folks, whether former employees or current ones, to express ambivalence or concern about what's going on," Hughes said in an interview Thursday. "And I think there's a lot to be concerned about."
Hughes, who helped develop the social media giant with Mark Zuckerberg in their Harvard college dorm, has become a critical weapon to trust busters in a fight that keeps expanding in scope, threatening tech giants including Amazon, Apple and Google with potential new regulation or even a breakup. Just this week, the Justice Department said it was opening a new, expanded inquiry targeting "market-leading online platforms."
Hughes has become one of the most powerful in a new breed of antagonists to Facebook: a former executive who believes he created something that is now harmful to society.
Facebook declined to comment. Some of Hughes's lobbying was first reported by the New York Times.
The growing momentum in Washington to more closely scrutinize the role of tech giants in consumers' lives and the effect on competition - one of the few bipartisan issues emerging among lawmakers and candidates - has often been fueled by private complaints from small businesses and rivals that say they've gotten a raw deal as the massive companies dominate their spaces.
Facebook has argued that it is not a monopoly and should not be broken up. Testifying before Congress in April 2018, Zuckerberg responded to a question about the competition his company faces by pointing out that the average American uses eight apps to communicate with friends.
Hughes started his campaign publicly. After leaving Facebook to volunteer for Barack Obama's presidential campaign, he worked for years in politics and nonprofit organizations, and had a four-year stint as owner of the New Republic. In 2016, he helped found a think tank focused on inequality, the subject of a book he wrote last year. The research prompted questions regarding the dangers of concentrated corporate power.
"I had a very personal realization that I cannot speak to anything that has to do with anti- monopoly work without wrestling with my own past," he said. "The huge monopoly power is why I have the financial resources that I have."
Hughes wrote a widely read New York Times op-ed this summer arguing that the company he helped found should be broken up.
Soon after, he was contacted by two prominent antitrust scholars, Scott Hemphill of New York University Law School and Tim Wu of Columbia Law School. The two academics and longtime collaborators had been developing an argument for breaking up Facebook in the form of the slide presentation. To them, the purchase of Instagram and WhatsApp represented a "plain vanilla violation of antitrust law, just low-hanging fruit," Wu said in an interview. They began to pitch lawmakers and regulators together.
Academics and lawmakers who have worked with Hughes say he has been helpful in explaining the motivations and viewpoints of key players at Facebook, including Zuckerberg - although Hughes said he has no specific inside knowledge.
After House lawmakers embarked on a broad antitrust investigation of Facebook and its fellow tech giants in June, one of the first people they consulted was Hughes, said Rep. David N. Cicilline (D-R.I.), the chairman of the antitrust panel on the House Judiciary Committee. Hughes quietly paid a visit to members of the House's top competition-focused panel this month, meeting with lawmakers and their staff members to pitch many of the issues he raised in his op-ed.
He presented his views as a former Facebook insider, something that lent credence to his arguments, Cicilline said.
"It's remarkable and significant to me and my colleagues that someone with such a role in creating the company has the capacity and courage, really, to say, 'We have some challenges, some things to look at,' " he said.
The case Hughes and academics lay out in their presentation centers on the Sherman Act, the government's primary law for investigating and penalizing anticompetitive practices.
The law prohibits acquiring another company with the main purpose of getting rid of a potential or an actual competitor.
Facebook was doing just that when it acquired Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014, the team argues. While Instagram was still tiny, Zuckerberg identified its explosive growth on mobile phones as the obvious antidote to Facebook's largely desktop product. Mobile was considered a clear weakness for Facebook as the company headed into its initial public offering in 2012.
Hughes's feedback shaped the scholars' case, as he helped them understand how executives in Silicon Valley view competition: It tends to be measured by viral growth rather than by size, said Hemphill, the New York University professor. At the time, the two professors were working on a roadshow, which they asked Hughes to join.
While Instagram was small, it was growing rapidly. "That must have been terrifying" for Facebook, Hemphill said. "It helps bring home the threat, the observability of the threat and the intensity of it."

Besieged governor of Puerto Rico says he will resign

Texto completo: Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rosselló said late Wednesday he will resign Aug. 2 after nearly two weeks of furious protests and political upheaval touched off by a leak of crude and insulting chat messages between him and his top advisers.
Demonstrators had filled the streets outside Rosselló's official residence throughout Wednesday evening and night, awaiting an address he had pledged to make at 5 p.m. The final announcement, however, did not come until almost midnight, with a Facebook post.
The flag-waving, chanting protesters erupted in cheers at the news.
Hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans have been outraged by the online chats between Rosselló and his advisers and have protested for nearly two weeks demanding his resignation.
In the chat, participants discussed the awarding of government contracts in ways that some observers called potentially illegal. They also insulted women and mocked constituents, including victims of Hurricane Maria. Rosselló called a female politician a "whore," referred to another as a "daughter of a bitch," and made fun of an obese man with whom he posed in a photo.
On Tuesday, officials announced that a Puerto Rico judge had issued search warrants for the cellphones of government officials involved in the chat as part of an investigation. One of the search warrants said officials used the chat to transmit official and confidential information to private citizens in potential violation of ethics laws.
More than a dozen government officials have resigned since the chat was leaked earlier this month, including Rosselló confidant and chief of staff Ricardo Llerandi, former secretary of state Luis Rivera Marín and former chief financial officer Christian Sobrino, who also held five other positions.
A report issued Wednesday by a special committee given the task of investigating whether legislators could proceed with an impeachment process against Rosselló recommended that Puerto Rico's House of Representatives do so. It is unclear if there are enough votes to do so.
In line to succeed Rosselló is Wanda Vázquez, the secretary of justice.
But Vázquez has a number of powerful political opponents, complicating any succession. She has been the island's secretary of justice, the equivalent of a state attorney general, since January 2017. She is a member of the New Progressive Party, like Rosselló, who appointed her. She worked as an attorney specializing in domestic and sexual violence before her appointment to the top post at the commonwealth's Department of Justice. She was appointed to lead the office of women's affairs in 2010.
Some women's groups opposed Vázquez during her seven years as the head of the island's women's affairs office. She was supposed to serve a 10-year term, but she left early to become secretary of justice.
“A lot of feminist groups were very critical of Wanda Vázquez," said Saadi Rosado of the Feminist Collective, an advocacy group. “She failed to address gender violence issues and was another piece of government bureaucracy."
Her relationship with the legislative branch is fraught, to say the least. Her time as secretary of justice has been punctuated by criticism that she has dragged her feet on investigating controversies involving members of her own party. She has clashed especially with Thomas Rivera Schatz, the president of the Senate. Vázquez came under intense legal scrutiny herself last year amid ethical complaints filed by the Office of the Independent Special Prosecutor. In November, Vázquez faced allegations that she had improperly intervened on behalf of her daughter and son-in-law in a housing dispute.
In fact, a new term was trending on Twitter in Puerto Rico on Wednesday, echoing protesters' demands for Rosselló to resign: #WandaRenuncia.

Warren Kanders Resigns From the Whitney Board After Months of Artist and Activist Protests

A little over a week after an explosive essay in Artforum inspired revived acts of dissent against a member of the board of trustees at the Whitney Museum of American Art, the New York Times reports that the embattled executive in question, Warren B. Kanders, has stepped down as vice chairman of the museum. Kanders is the owner of Safariland, a company that manufactures body armor, weapon holsters and tear gas grenades and that has been the subject of intense scrutiny from the protest group Decolonize This Place for months. Safariland is suspected of having provided U.S. Border Patrol officers with tools used to temporarily disable and harm migrants attempting to enter the country. Recently, new evidence has emerged that Safariland products may have been used against protesters in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and at the boundary between Gaza and Israel.
These are tear gas canisters used against protesters in San Juan. They were made by Safariland, owned by Warren Kanders.

Over the past weekend, eight artists who are currently being featured in the Whitney Biennial, including Korakrit Arunanondchai, Meriem Bennani, Nicole Eisenman, Nicholas Galanin, Agustina Woodgate and Eddie Arroyo, announced that because of the museum’s continual relationship with Kanders, they wanted their work withdrawn from the show. When Observer visited the Whitney on Monday to check out the Biennial’s status , it was unclear how the pieces in question were going to be taken down, or how their sudden absence was going to be articulated to visitors. Presumably, Kanders’ resignation makes all of this a moot point, and the work by the artists who expressed interest in withdrawing will remain.
In his resignation letter to the board, which was obtained by the New York Times , Kanders expressed frustration that the voices calling for his accountability were ultimately louder than he could withstand. “Unfortunately, the targeted campaign of attacks against me and my company that has been waged these past several months has threatened to undermine the important work of the Whitney,” he wrote. “I joined this board to help the museum prosper. I do not wish to play a role, however inadvertent, in its demise.”
Interestingly, Kanders’ wife is also involved in this episode: while she was formerly a chairwoman on the Whitney’s painting and sculpture committee, Allison Kanders apparently resigned today along with her husband. Hopefully, a precedent such as this will give power brokers pause before underestimating the force of the collective–and what it can do when it is adequately deployed. After all, earlier this month, the Louvre removed the opioid-poisoned Sackler name from its walls.

Alexander Neef Named Director of Paris Opera

Texto completo: Founded in 1669 by Louis XIV, and with a modern-day budget of over 200 million euros, the Paris Opera is one of the oldest and most powerful music-theater companies in the world. But it has struggled to find a successor to Stéphane Lissner, its director since 2014.
An extended search ended on Wednesday, when the company announced that Alexander Neef, the general director of the Canadian Opera Company in Toronto, would take on the position, starting in 2021.
"It's a pretty emotional day, obviously," Mr. Neef, who was born in Germany, said in a telephone interview from Santa Fe, N.M., where he is also the artistic director of Santa Fe Opera. "It's a big honor and a big responsibility."
Widely admired for his work in Toronto, Mr. Neef, 45, is no stranger to the Paris Opera, where he was casting director from 2004 to 2008, working under his mentor, Gerard Mortier. He also held positions alongside Mortier at the Salzburg Festival and the Ruhrtriennale, and during Mortier's brief time leading New York City Opera.
"What I really look forward to," Mr. Neef said, "is reconnecting with the people" in Paris, where he will oversee both the opera and ballet sides of the company.
The appointment was welcomed by many in France. "It is a very good choice," Christian Merlin, a critic for the newspaper Le Figaro, said in an email.
"For the first time, it won't be a position for a man at the end of his career," Mr. Merlin added, saying that Mr. Neef's relative youth could allow for a long tenure and the implementation of needed reforms.
"The other advantage is that he knows both the European and American systems," Mr. Merlin said, "so both government subsidies and private finance, which is very useful today in our vulnerable economic context."
Mr. Neef helped make Toronto an operatic destination, attracting top singers like Sondra Radvanosvky and staging ambitious productions. Last year, he presented the premiere of Rufus Wainwright's "Hadrian," which tells the story of the Roman emperor's love affair with Antinous, a young Greek man, and included a gay sex scene, an unusual occurrence on the opera stage.
"It's 2018, and it's our job to tell these stories," Mr. Neef said at the time in an interview with The New York Times.
Mr. Neef said on Wednesday that President Emmanuel Macron of France interviewed him for 45 minutes a few weeks ago for the directorship, which is officially a presidential appointment.
"For someone who is running a country, I found it incredible he took so much time," said Mr. Neef.
He added that it was too early to provide definite plans for his tenure, but that he wanted to expand the company's work on 21st-century operas and new commissions, and also to explore French operas.
"It's about identity, to really look at the French repertoire," he said. "Not in an encyclopedic way, but showing the right pieces and the forgotten pieces, to keep that part of the heritage alive."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: La ciudad de Los Ángeles no había visto tal brutalidad en décadas: asesinatos con machetes, bates de béisbol, cuchillos, tubos de metal; pandilleros que torturan a sus víctimas hasta la muerte y luego les sacan el corazón.
El fiscal del gobierno federal asignado al distrito centro de California, Nick Hanah, reveló el pasado 16 de julio los atroces crímenes de la Clica Fulton, la fracción más violenta y numerosa de la pandilla MS-13, también conocida como la Mara Salvatrucha.
La acusación contra 22 miembros de la Clica Fulton enlista crímenes que van desde el vandalismo, el tráfico de drogas y la extorsión hasta el asesinato de siete personas, seis de los cuales eran inmigrantes. Todos han sido detenidos y se encuentran bajo custodia, reportó el diario The New York Times.
Las detenciones han sido resultado de más de un año de investigaciones que involucraron a agencias federales, estatales y locales.
“Ya hemos sacado de las calles a casi dos docenas de personas asociadas con el brazo más violento de la MS-13 en Los Ángeles, donde se cree que la pandilla asesinó a 24 personas en los últimos dos años”, dijo Hanah en un comunicado de prensa.
Al jurado, sin embargo, sólo se le presentaron los casos de siete víctimas de homicidio, reportó el diario citado.
Los pandilleros llevaban a sus víctimas al Bosque Nacional de Los Ángeles. En una ocasión, secuestraron a un miembro de otra pandilla y lo ahogaron, posteriormente lo llevaron al bosque y allí lo descuartizaron, le arrancaron el corazón con un machete y arrojaron sus restos a un barranco. Su crimen había sido rayar una pinta o grafiti de la Clica Fulton.
Para entrar a la pandilla, los posibles nuevos reclutas tenían que probar su valor asesinando a un enemigo o adversario de la MS-13.
Aunque esto podía variar desde un miembro de otra pandilla hasta un indigente con la mala suerte de cruzarse en su camino, como sucedió con un hombre sin hogar que vivía en un parque “controlado por la pandilla”, dijo Hanah.
La mayoría, 19 de los 22, son inmigrantes indocumentados de entre 19 y 24 años y no tiene más de cinco años que llegaron al país. Recientemente, dijo el fiscal Hanah, la pandilla aumentó sus filas y su actividad criminal “con el flujo de jóvenes migrantes provenientes de Centroamérica”, reportó la cadena británica BBC Mundo.
“La mayor tragedia en estos casos es que estos jóvenes víctimas probablemente dejaron sus países de origen con la esperanza de que en los Estados Unidos encontrarían seguridad y prosperidad”, dijo la Fiscal del Distrito del Condado de Los Ángeles, Jackie Lacey.
“En cambio, estas víctimas tuvieron la desgracia de cruzar caminos con pandilleros violentos que se aprovecharon de las vulnerabilidades de su experiencia de inmigrante”.
Pero, a pesar del recrudecimiento de la violencia de pandillas como la Clica Fulton, en general, hay menos homicidios hoy Lós Ángeles que en la década de los años 90, cuando las pandillas dominaban , señaló a BBC Thom Mrozek, portavoz del Fiscal General del Departamento de Justicia para el distrito centro de California.

Facebook fined $5 billion by FTC, must update and adopt new privacy, security measures

Resumen: The Federal Trade Commission says Facebook will be a safer social network due to the agency's $5 billion settlement over privacy violations.

Texto completo: Facebook must adopt new protections for data users share on the social network and pay a record-breaking $5 billion fine as part of a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission.
The social networking giant must expand its privacy protections across Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, and adopt a corporate system of checks and balances to remain compliant, according to the FTC order.
Facebook must also maintain a data security program, which includes protections of information such as users' phone numbers.
The FTC's order also curbs CEO Mark Zuckerberg's oversight in privacy and security matters, with the requirement Facebook create a new privacy committee with independent board members who cannot be removed without a two-thirds shareholder vote. Zuckerberg and designated compliance officers each must submit individual quarterly compliance reports to the FTC.
Big tech: Facebook, Google, Amazon, Twitter likely facing review from Justice Department
Additionally, a third-party assessor will monitor Facebook's privacy-related decisions going forward.
The commission approved the settlement with a 3-2 vote, with the dissenting commissioners wanting tougher action taken against Zuckerberg.
But the order achieves more than the FTC could have achieved by going to court, says chairman Joe Simons and the commissioners Noah Joshua Phillips and Christine Wilson, who approved the settlement in their lengthy statement.
"The Order significantly diminishes Mr. Zuckerberg’s power – something no government agency, anywhere in the world, has thus far accomplished," the statement says. "The provisions of this Order extinguish the ability of Mr. Zuckerberg to make privacy decisions unilaterally by also vesting responsibility and accountability for those decisions within business units, DCOs (digital compliance officers), and the privacy committee. "
Previously, the FTC’s highest fines were to Google, which paid $22. 5 million in 2012 and Upromise, which paid $500,000 in 2017.
Facebook agreed to the settlement with the agency over allegations it broke a previous agreement over privacy protections. "In reaching the settlement, Facebook has agreed to pay a $5 billion penalty, which is one of the largest in history. But even more important, Facebook will make some major changes to how it builds products and operates as a company," the company said in a statement.
This settlement concludes a year-long FTC investigation, prompted by the 2018 Cambridge Analytica scandal. Facebook suspended the data analysis and political consulting firm in March 2018 for improper access to user data. That move came after The New York Times and The Observer said Cambridge Analytica had access to 50 million profiles and used them to target ads during the 2016 presidential election campaign. At the time, Facebook said it knew the firm had violated its policies by obtaining and secretly passing on the data, which users had agreed to share with a personality prediction app.
The FTC also announced separate settlements with Cambridge Analytica, its former CEO Alexander Nix, and Aleksandr Kogan, an app developer who worked with the company. The actions allege Cambridge "used false and deceptive tactics to harvest personal information from millions of Facebook users" and all face restrictions on future business.

Recovery center official pleads guilty in fentanyl case

Texto completo: Monitor staff
A celebrated member of a New Hampshire drug recovery center has pleaded guilty to transporting fentanyl across state lines, court documents revealed this week.
Jeffrey Hatch, listed by his resume as the Chief Business Development Officer for Granite Recovery Centers, pleaded guilty on Friday to using a phone to facilitate the distribution of 1,500 grams of fentanyl, according to a plea agreement registered in the U.S. District Court in Concord.
In July 2017, Hatch used a phone to coordinate a 1,500-gram shipment from Lawrence, Mass., to his home. He was part of a network of dealers and users captured in a sting operation in Manchester, the documents say.
Hatch is no longer an employee of GRC, which operates 12 recovery centers around the state.
But his presence there set off a minor political flap earlier this month after Vice President Mike Pence canceled a July 2 appearance at Granite Recovery Center headquarters. At the time, neither Pence nor the White House explained the cancellation.
But according to reports in Politico and the New York Times, Pence canceled the trip after learning that Hatch – who was set to be on stage at the event – was facing the distribution charge.
In a statement, Granite Recovery Centers CEO Eric Spofford said Tuesday that he and other staff members were unaware of Hatch's actions, and that Hatch “was terminated immediately upon learning of this situation yesterday.”
“I am shocked, disappointed, and heartbroken,” Spofford said.
For Hatch, it's a stunning fall within a career marked by resurrection. A former NFL offensive lineman for the New York Giants, Hatch had a brief but dazzling run cut short by a back injury that derailed his momentum. Recovery led him to pain medicine, which set off an addiction that would persist for years.
“People say it's a slippery slope; not for me,” Hatch said in an interview for Speakers for Change, a website that once promoted him as an inspirational speaker. “For me it was a cliff, and I jumped off.”
A biography of Hatch featuring that interview has since been deleted by Speakers for Change.
Hatch was able to overcome his addiction, and the battle would lead him to a life in recovery – first in Derry and eventually in Salem, for Granite State Recovery.
But he never left his experience behind. He shared it around the country, making speaking appearances in schools and community centers everywhere from Hartford, Conn., to Jackson, Miss., as recently as 2016.
Court records, however, paint a darker portrait. In 2017, in the early days of a proliferation of fentanyl in the Granite State, federal, state and local law enforcement groups were circling a distribution between Lawrence, Mass., and New Hampshire, according to Hatch's plea agreement. They identified the main person distributing the drugs and several of that distributor's couriers, and they established the pattern: large flows of cash into Lawrence; large shipments of fentanyl back north.
Eventually, through the help of an undercover officer in Manchester, police were able to arrest the main distributor, execute a search warrant, and pick up at least one of that distributor's couriers, according to the plea agreement. That courier was Jeff Hatch.
Hatch had been coordinating and carrying out the trips. On the morning of July 25, Hatch arranged a pick up of 1,500 grams of fentanyl from his distributor and brought the drugs back to his New Hampshire house. Later that day, police arrested the distributor in Manchester, and eventually Hatch as well.
Hatch faces a maximum four-year prison sentence and a potential fine of up to $250,000.
On Tuesday, Spofford, Hatch's former boss, stressed that the arrest does not reflect on the work on his organization.
“Granite Recovery Centers has over 200 of the most dedicated passionate people that go above and beyond to fight in the mission against addiction every single day,” Spofford said. “The actions of one do not discredit the amazing work they all do.
“Addiction is insidious,” Spofford continued. “This illness (affects) people from all walks of life. From the inner city poor to CEOs, lawyers and doctors. This situation highlights why those of us on the front lines need to remain vigilant and must battle every day against addiction and the opioid epidemic.”

GOP now a personality cult

Texto completo: The tragedy of today's Republican Party lies partly in how far it has tumbled from its heights.
This is the party of Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt. It is the party that built interstate highways, championed family planning, founded the Environmental Protection Agency, opened relations with China, confronted the Soviet Union and managed the collapse of Communism.
It is the party that under Ronald Reagan welcomed refugees. It is the party of men who exemplified decency like George H.W. Bush and adherence to a moral compass like John McCain.
At a rally in 2008, McCain corrected a questioner who called Barack Obama untrustworthy and an "Arab." "No, ma'am," McCain told the crowd. "He's a decent family man, citizen, that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues."
Today, that Grand Old Party has devolved into a personality cult surrounding a racist demagogue who incites a mob to chant about a Somali-American member of Congress: "Send her back!"
Elected Republican officials - with a very few brave exceptions, like Rep. Will Hurd of Texas - protest the label "racist," but not the racism. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell even says that President Donald Trump is "on to something."
Yes, Trump is on to something: He has seized on the ugly nativist streak that runs through the anti-Catholic riots of 1844, the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, the internment of Japanese-Americans in 1942. Most men grow after becoming president; Trump has not only shrunk but has also miniaturized party elders with him.
The collapse of the Republican Party is not just about this month's fecklessness, however, and as The Economist noted in a recent cover article, this is a "global crisis in conservatism": From Australia to Britain, Italy to Brazil, "the new right is not an evolution of conservatism, but a repudiation of it."
Conservatism historically embraced institutions, honored personal morality and disdained personality cults; now it has latched on to charismatic, dissolute nuts who overthrow institutions, like Boris Johnson of Britain, Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, and our own Donald Trump.
A recent analysis in The Times by Sahil Chinoy found that the Republican Party is far to the right of mainstream conservative parties in Britain, Canada and Germany, and to the right even of groups like the National Rally (formerly the National Front) of France. On the international spectrum, the GOP is not a center-right party but an extremist force.
Think of how the Republican Party used to define itself: pro-family, tough on fiscal policy and strong on national security.
On family policy, Republicans tore children from immigrant parents at the border and are now trying to rip apart health insurance for 21 million Americans. If the Republicans' lawsuit to overturn the Affordable Care Act wins, 133 million Americans will also lose protection for pre-existing conditions.
The Republicans sued to end the health insurance law because of a revulsion for Obama, and they are incoherent about the consequences. When a judge asked the Justice Department lawyer, August E. Flentje, if a stay should be lifted so that Obamacare would be dismantled immediately, he sounded horrified, saying, "We think it's great the stay is in place."
On fiscal policy, Republicans disgraced themselves in 2009 during the Great Recession when not a single GOP member of the House of Representatives backed a desperately needed fiscal stimulus. To spite Obama, Republicans were willing to let Americans lose jobs, homes and savings, supposedly because of their concerns about deficits.
Then under Trump, those same Republicans approved a tax break that was far costlier, with the benefits disproportionately going to corporations and zillionaires. This year, the administration expects the budget deficit to surge to $1 trillion (which means we are terribly positioned for a recession), but those fiscal hawks are silent. They proved themselves unprincipled opportunists.
On national security, Republican firmness toward Russia disintegrated the moment it was needed, when Russia interfered in the 2016 elections. The Obama administration shared intelligence about Russian interference with 12 congressional leaders in September 2016, seeking a bipartisan warning (including those running elections around the country) about Russia's actions. Republicans led by McConnell blocked any serious response, thus enabling Russia's assault on American democracy.
Meanwhile, we have a president who vigorously defends Russian President Vladimir Putin and jokes with him about getting "rid" of journalists. In polls, Republicans are more than twice as likely to approve of Putin (25%) as of Nancy Pelosi (9%).
Folks, we need a center-right political party in this country. Yet, today's Republican Party isn't the steadying force of the past, but is rather a blood-and-soil movement that stands for nothing larger than one bombastic hothead.
That's why the 2020 election will matter so much. One of America's great political parties has lost its compass and its concern for the issues that once defined it. Only if it is walloped at the ballot box will it, perhaps, wake up and rebuild itself to become again the principled conservative party that America needs.

Sinema knocks it out of the park

Texto completo: You didn't have to spend much time on social media this weekend to know that Kyrsten Sinema had hit her first big-league home run.
All you had to do was search "Kyrsten Sinema" on Twitter and then prepare to scroll and scroll and scroll.
A social platform that daily devours politicians from head to hoof was throwing garlands of unbounded gratitude to Arizona's senior senator.
Republicans were lining up to confess they'd been wrong about Sinema and that pink tutu and now owed her a second look. Some said she was better than recent GOP offerings, the McCain's, the Romney's and the Bushes'.
It was the end of an another week in which Americans screamed at each other, and Sinema was standing out because she had quietly worked across the aisle to try to solve one of the pressing problems in the country.
The U.S.-Mexico border has been besieged with some 390,000 migrants who came with families this year to seek succor in our homeland, according to Customs and Border Protection.
Those numbers have reached some of the highest levels since the United States started tracking such data, reported The Republic's Rafael Carranza,
Sinema has a plan to help relieve the pressure on the border, and she worked with Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisc., and other Republicans and Democrats to iron out the details.
Together they proposed "Operation Safe Return," an initiative that would quickly determine which migrants lack a valid legal claim for asylum so they could just as quickly be ferried back to their homelands.
The idea is raising the hackles of some immigration-rights advocates who fear such speed could result in migrants shipped back to dangerous settings.
However, Sinema's proposal has a countervailing impact that could provide rapid relief to migrants who have valid legal claims.
By sorting out the unworthy you also identify the worthy asylum seekers. And if you can do that, you can get them the hell out of overrun and under-supplied detention centers.
"Families who pass the credible-fear screening would have the chance to claim asylum and be released under alternative-to-detention programs," reports Carranza.
Kyrsten Sinema told us a long time ago she was going to Washington to do things. Her first big splash was a mischievous dive into fashion that assailed the starched shirts on Capitol Hill.
But she has since then quietly gone about her business, leaving Trumpian food fights to others while she works behind the scenes, even meeting with the White House to craft a better border solution.
I've watched Sinema for 20 years. I've seen her march with Mexican immigrants in the streets of Phoenix. While her politics have matured into a work-a-day pragmatism, I'll never believe she lost her compassion for immigrant people. She's been too long in the trenches with them.
However, some on the left shift uneasily at her border proposal and her willingness to work with the other side. Those Democrats should heed the warning of a border authority who served in the Obama administration.
"Polls reflect that most Americans want to see two basic things when it comes to immigration," explained Jeh Johnson, homeland security secretary from 2013 to 2017. "That we are fair and compassionate to those immigrants who have become honest and integrated members of our society (most notably the "dreamers") and that we secure our borders."
Earlier this month in a Washington Post op-ed, Johnson wrote, "We cannot, as some Democratic candidates for president now propose, publicly embrace a policy to not deport those who enter or remain in this country illegally unless they commit a crime.
"This is tantamount to a public declaration (repeated and amplified by smugglers in Central America) that our borders are effectively open to all."
At the end of a week in which much of the national and world news media framed the Republican president as racist, a number of the leading liberal pundits were not bashing Trump. They were warning the 2020 Democrats for president they will lose the election to him if they keep driving into the swampland directly left of sanity.
"Spare me the revolution," wrote liberal New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman. "I was shocked that so many (candidates in the party whose nominee I was planning to support) were ready to decriminalize illegal entry into our country. I think people should have to ring the doorbell before they enter my house or my country."
Show some common sense, wrote Friedman, or Trump is getting four more years.
Common sense in Washington wasn't at the primary debates. It wasn't leading the revolution.
It was ensconced in the Senate office building working out a complicated border problem and no doubt taking a moment to admire its stylish new pumps.

ABOLISH THE DEBT CEILING NEITHER PARTY SEEMS SERIOUS ABOUT REINING IN THE NATIONAL DEBT

Texto completo: Congress is once again facing a looming crisis over the debt ceiling, as it did two years ago, and six years ago, and eight years ago, and ... you get the idea. Instead of staging these tedious fights every few years, Congress has a far better option for dealing with the debt ceiling: Eliminate it altogether.
This largely symbolic act to raise the debt limit is supposed to goad both parties to get serious about reining in the national debt. It hasn't worked out that way. These repeated showdowns only create uncertainty that will ultimately make the debt larger and less sustainable.
This ritual takes place because in 1917 Congress passed the Second Liberty Bond Act, which authorized the Treasury Department to sell whatever bonds it needed to finance World War I provided that the total did not exceed $5 billion. Congress wanted to give the Treasury a free hand to conduct the war, but did not want to relinquish its power of the purse.
All debt issuance since has happened under the authority of that law. For more than half a century, the law more or less served its intended purpose of forcing Congress to exercise spending oversight.
Then, in 1974, Congress passed the Budget Control and Impoundment Act, which created the modern budget resolution process. President Richard Nixon had tried to reduce the size of government simply by not spending all the money Congress had appropriated. Under this law, Congress provides a detailed accounting of appropriations that the president cannot alter. The law also gives Congress the opportunity to shut down the government if a compromise on fiscal policy cannot be reached.
The reconciliation process thus makes the purpose of the debt-ceiling vote - a way for Congress to exercise control over the federal budget - redundant. Not only that, but failing to raise the debt limit is far more dangerous than shutting down the government. Without the ability to issue new debt, the Treasury would not have the ability to pay off old debt as it matures. One option it would have is to temporarily default on its old debt, thereby reducing the nation's overall debt and giving it some room under the limit to issue new debt. It would then use that new debt to repay the old.
That might not sound so bad. But financial institutions around the world depend on income from Treasury bonds to balance their books at the end of every day. The mere possibility of a temporary default can send financial markets tumbling - and, ironically, worsen the deficit.
This happens for two reasons. First, the financial turmoil encourages businesses to delay investment, which in turn slows growth. That reduces tax revenue. Second, the threat of a U.S. default, even a temporary one, may cause some major financial institutions to sell U.S. bonds, which causes the interest rate the U.S. government pays to rise. Fewer revenues and higher interest payments lead to a higher deficit.
And for a true nightmare scenario, consider this: What if, in a fit of insanity, Congress simply refused to raise the debt ceiling for months on end? Then the same crisis that engulfed Greece at the start of the decade could take down the U.S. That possibility, even if extremely remote, adds uncertainty to the Treasury bond market and makes it slightly less stable.
If the debt ceiling were the only way for Congress to conduct budgetary oversight, then perhaps these risks would be worth it. But it isn't and they're not. The budget resolution process can be used with far less disastrous consequences. That means there is simply no point to the debt ceiling at all. Instead of raising it, Congress should abolish it.

Texto completo: We all watched while Eric Garner desperately pleaded with New York Police Department’s Dan Pantaleo to stop choking him. Garner called out 11 times "I can't breathe," each cry with an intensity that made it not just difficult to witness but maddening. I yelled at the TV screen, shouting at the officers to let him go — trying to avoid seeing the inevitable. Garner died because law enforcement refused to see him as a human being who deserved a life. Refused to see him as a father. A husband. A son. A friend. A human being.
On July 16, the world learned that the officer, Pantaleo, would not face any federal charges in connection with the 2014 killing of Garner, and will likely be able to continue his career in the NYPD. Our justice system is still refusing to see Garner's life as one that was worth saving.
People and organizations stepped up to fight for Garner and his family. His daughter, Erica Garner, championed the crusade — #JusticeForEricGarner. She pushed a generation of us to show up for our loved ones. She endorsed Bernie Sanders, who eventually became a very outspoken supporter of the movement during the 2016 election cycle. She was even featured in one of his campaign videos.
She participated in Black Lives Matter protests, she led them, and she supported them. She promised she would fight for her father until he received justice or until she was in her grave. We all admired Erica. Many of us who didn’t know her father built a relationship with him through her work. When she passed away after a heart attack in 2017, we were all devastated. How could this powerful young woman who had been fighting for her father die so damn young? We knew her work would continue through so many people and organizations, and many of us hoped that Erica’s fight and her death would not be in vain.
POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media
More: Des Moines council must reject toothless, embarrassing racial profiling policy
An overhaul would allow us to imagine a world where Garner wouldn't have to sell "illegal cigarettes" to make ends meet. We could build a system in which Erica Garner wouldn't have to fight for her father's legacy and then die too young. All of our community needs would be met, and we would no longer be policed for being poor.
Working toward the overhaul of our current system should remind us that we all deserve to breathe. Eric Garner deserved to breathe. And we will continue to fight for his legacy and for his daughter's — legacies that centered on struggle and hope and justice.

Texto completo: No. 1 overall pick Zion Williamson will not suit up for Team USA this summer after all.
Williamson has withdrawn from USA Basketball's training camp next month, a person familiar with the decision told USA TODAY Sports. They were granted anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about Williamson's plans with the New Orleans Pelicans.
Williamson appeared in just one game in the NBA summer league before being sidelined by the Pelicans as a precaution with a bruised left knee. The 19-year-old had previously been invited to participate in the team's training camp in Las Vegas as part of a 10-man select team — a group of up-and-coming players.
"We want to indoctrinate him in terms of USA Basketball," USA Basketball managing director Jerry Colangelo told The New York Times last month.
Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski said earlier he believed Williamson should have skipped summer league because he wasn't in top shape and former player and TNT analyst Charles Barkley said Williamson needs to shed pounds before the season begins.
Williamson is the latest big name to bow out of Team USA ahead of the FIBA World Cup, which begins Aug. 31. Washington Wizards guard Bradley Beal, Los Angeles Lakers forward Anthony Davis and Houston Rockets guard James Harden are also among those who have removed themselves from consideration for the team in recent days, according to multiple reports.

Texto completo: "Wherever I have gone outside, I have never tried to hide Marion C.I. I never forget No. 125734."
Don King
For an afternoon in 1977, Marion was at the epicenter of the sporting world.
That's what happens when Don King and Howard Cosell, boxing and national television, future world champions and an all-time great are mixed together inside the walls of a prison.
It's a story — a weird story — but it's our story.
And it started in the late 1960s when Marion received a new resident. King, better known then as inmate 125734 according to a story written by Pulitzer Prize winning sports writer Red Smith in The New York Times, was sent to prison for manslaughter, but paroled in 1971.
As he left the gates of Marion Correctional Institution, he vowed to come back.
Some might have taken it one way, but he meant something else. Once on the outside, King made up for lost time. In less than six years, he became boxing's biggest and most famous promoter.
And he fulfilled that promise. He returned to MCI, only this time he brought a few friends with him.
The crowning of U.S. champs In 1976, America was giddy with patriotism while celebrating the Bicentennial, and the country couldn't get enough of boxing. At that year's Olympics in Montreal, five Americans brought home gold medals, while "Rocky" was winning over fans at the box office.
King, who was quickly becoming a major player in the sport, saw the confluence and the connection. He quickly conceived of the idea of a tournament called the United States Boxing Championships that would crown undisputed American champs in all weight classes.
He partnered with Ring Magazine to make it so.
"I needed their reputation and their ratings and their sanction to give validity and authority to the tournament," King told Sports Illustrated.
He then sold the concept to ABC Sports President Roone Arledge, the man better known for constructing the NFL's Monday Night Football franchise. It was to be a centerpiece of programming for ABC's Wide World of Sports show that owned the 1970s sporting consciousness.
One quarterfinal of the tournament was held on the deck of an aircraft carrier off the coast of Florida. Another was held at the Naval Academy. The third installment was the strangest venue yet.
The show was coming to Marion — not to be held in its coliseum, but its prison.
King was indeed coming home.
A captive audience The seven-fight card was set for Sunday, March 6, 1977. An unprecedented 90-minute block would be set up to broadcast at least two matches live from 3 to 4:30 p.m.
It was the first nationally televised live program from a prison, so the logistics were many. MCI is not Madison Square Garden. According to a recap in The Marion Star, to get a TV signal out of the prison, it had to be beamed to a dish atop Central Soya's grain silos in town and then on to WTVN-TV in Columbus where it went international from there.
Cosell was the voice of boxing in the '70s and called the matches.
Beloved former heavyweight champion Joe Louis was ringside, while former Olympic heavyweight boxer Pete Radamacher was a referee and judge.
Other dignitaries were Smith, who was writing his "Sports of the Times" column about the event, as well as the New York Post's Vic Zeigel, AP boxing writer Ed Schulyer and Time Magazine female writer P.J. Phillips among others.
By this time Arledge didn't go on the road much, but the head of ABC Sports was in Marion to make sure it went off without hassle.
The show was not open to the public. Save for the media members and a few local VIPs, the room was packed with MCI's 1,400 inmates. And they were ready to be entertained.
Before the matches, King climbed into the ring wearing a gold jacket over a frilled white shirt and took the microphone.
"I look around and see many familiar faces," Smith reported of King's brief speech. "I am one of you."
The crowd ate it up.
"It is with mixed emotions that I am coming back to what was trauma in my life," he continued. "I am happy and proud to be able to bring back some entertainment for you because you have been part of my life."
The inmates went wild with cheers and applause.
"Wherever I have gone outside, I have never tried to hide Marion C.I. I never forget No. 125734," King said with the crowd going bonkers.
Following King's introduction, in came Louis for a wave, which the inmates heartily appreciated. Then Cosell was introduced as a couple ringsiders held up signs that said, "Finally, Howard is where he belongs," and "Howard got in — will he get out?"
MCI Superintendent Pete Perini was "warmly booed," according to Smith, while prison chaplain Father Fred Furey was cheered. Walter Hampton, head of the parole board, brought a great many jeers upon his introduction, which caused King to tell the crowd, "That's the dude that sprung me."
Boxing at the prison King was sure his captive audience would be entertained.
Art "Tap" Harris, a former world-ranked welterweight from Akron, was in one of the featured bouts. Harris, like King before him, was also an inmate at MCI, serving time for shooting a man in a bar.
Fighting for the third time inside the prison's gates, Harris won by TKO in the fourth round over Johnny Heard of Chicago after Ray Phillips backed out days before the middleweight fight.
"This is my home now," Harris told The Marion Star's Bob Thatcher after winning his 29th straight match. "I wish I had looked better. I've told them I'm the best middleweight. I need some high-caliber fighters to show it. I've got a debt to pay to society, and I feel four-and-a-half years is enough. I hope society feels I should have a chance."
Harris would get out soon enough and resume his career with five more wins before losing his final two pro bouts, first to "Sugar" Ray Seales in 1980 and then to Manning Galloway in 1981.
Back inside the gates of the prison, heavyweights Stan Ward and Kevin Issac did not entertain. After two rounds of circling one another, someone in the crowd yelled, 'Come on! I've only got 20 years!"
Ward won by decision, but another match was lively. Rocky Mosley was knocked down in the first round but rallied to beat Johnny Baldwin when he couldn't answer the bell in the fifth.
Future heavyweight champion Michael Dokes of Akron, competing in just the fourth fight of his career, handled oval-shaped Charlie Jordan, showing flair in doing so.
Featherweight Ruben Castillo earned his 22nd straight win in an eight-round decision over Kenny Weldon, and lightweight Ruby "The Snake" Ortiz of Brooklyn took a unanimous decision over Vinnie DeBerros of Connecticut.
The main event included 18-year-old welterweight phenom and top-ranked Wilfredo Benitez and No. 10 Mel Dennis of Houston.
Benitez was 29-0-1 and recognized as the world junior welterweight champion at the time of his bout in Marion, becoming the youngest world champ in history at the age of 17. He won the eight-round fight at MCI via a decision in what BoxRec.com considered a four out of five star match. Benitez would leave Marion and go on to win two more world titles in two other weight classes in his hall of fame career.
The show was a success across the board.
Plug pulled on tourney But as entertaining as it was in Marion, the U.S. Boxing Championships were on the ropes.
A month later, ABC cancelled televising the series when investigative reports found at least 11 fighters in the tournament had false win-loss records with King associates allegedly buying rankings from Ring Magazine to bolster the boxers' statures.
There were further charges of promised kickbacks from fighters to bookers to get into the tournament, plus lots of other shenanigans.
By May, Sports Illustrated ran a piece spelling out all the trouble associated with the boxing championships, including FBI and IRS probes and a federal grand jury in Baltimore looking into it.
As said, it's a story — a weird story — but it's our story.
And it fittingly came to an end in a prison in Marion, Ohio, in March of 1977.

Texto completo: For an afternoon in 1977, Marion was at the epicenter of the sporting world.
That's what happens when Don King and Howard Cosell, boxing and national television, future world champions and an all-time great are mixed together inside the walls of a prison.
And it started in the late 1960s when Marion received a new resident. King, better known then as inmate 125734 according to a story written by Pulitzer Prize winning sports writer Red Smith in The New York Times, was sent to prison for manslaughter, but paroled in 1971.
As he left the gates of Marion Correctional Institution, he vowed to come back.
Some might have taken it one way, but he meant something else. Once on the outside, King made up for lost time. In less than six years, he became boxing's biggest and most famous promoter.
And he fulfilled that promise. He returned to MCI, only this time he brought a few friends with him.
The crowning of U.S. champs In 1976, America was giddy with patriotism while celebrating the Bicentennial, and the country couldn't get enough of boxing. At that year's Olympics in Montreal, five Americans brought home gold medals, while "Rocky" was winning over fans at the box office.
King, who was quickly becoming a major player in the sport, saw the confluence and the connection. He quickly conceived of the idea of a tournament called the United States Boxing Championships that would crown undisputed American champs in all weight classes.
He partnered with Ring Magazine to make it so.
"I needed their reputation and their ratings and their sanction to give validity and authority to the tournament," King told Sports Illustrated.
He then sold the concept to ABC Sports President Roone Arledge, the man better known for constructing the NFL's Monday Night Football franchise. It was to be a centerpiece of programming for ABC's Wide World of Sports show that owned the 1970s sporting consciousness.
One quarterfinal of the tournament was held on the deck of an aircraft carrier off the coast of Florida. Another was held at the Naval Academy. The third installment was the strangest venue yet.
The show was coming to Marion — not to be held in its coliseum, but its prison.
King was indeed coming home.
A captive audience The seven-fight card was set for Sunday, March 6, 1977. An unprecedented 90-minute block would be set up to broadcast at least two matches live from 3 to 4:30 p.m.
It was the first nationally televised live program from a prison, so the logistics were many. MCI is not Madison Square Garden. According to a recap in The Marion Star, to get a TV signal out of the prison, it had to be beamed to a dish atop Central Soya's grain silos in town and then on to WTVN-TV in Columbus where it went international from there.
Cosell was the voice of boxing in the '70s and called the matches.
Beloved former heavyweight champion Joe Louis was ringside, while former Olympic heavyweight boxer Pete Radamacher was a referee and judge.
Other dignitaries were Smith, who was writing his "Sports of the Times" column about the event, as well as the New York Post's Vic Zeigel, AP boxing writer Ed Schulyer and Time Magazine female writer P.J. Phillips among others.
By this time Arledge didn't go on the road much, but the head of ABC Sports was in Marion to make sure it went off without hassle.
The show was not open to the public. Save for the media members and a few local VIPs, the room was packed with MCI's 1,400 inmates. And they were ready to be entertained.
Before the matches, King climbed into the ring wearing a gold jacket over a frilled white shirt and took the microphone.
"I look around and see many familiar faces," Smith reported of King's brief speech. "I am one of you."
The crowd ate it up.
"It is with mixed emotions that I am coming back to what was trauma in my life," he continued. "I am happy and proud to be able to bring back some entertainment for you because you have been part of my life."
The inmates went wild with cheers and applause.
"Wherever I have gone outside, I have never tried to hide Marion C.I. I never forget No. 125734," King said with the crowd going bonkers.
Following King's introduction, in came Louis for a wave, which the inmates heartily appreciated. Then Cosell was introduced as a couple ringsiders held up signs that said, "Finally, Howard is where he belongs," and "Howard got in — will he get out?"
MCI Superintendent Pete Perini was "warmly booed," according to Smith, while prison chaplain Father Fred Furey was cheered. Walter Hampton, head of the parole board, brought a great many jeers upon his introduction, which caused King to tell the crowd, "That's the dude that sprung me."
Boxing at the prison King was sure his captive audience would be entertained.
Art "Tap" Harris, a former world-ranked welterweight from Akron, was in one of the featured bouts. Harris, like King before him, was also an inmate at MCI, serving time for shooting a man in a bar.
Fighting for the third time inside the prison's gates, Harris won by TKO in the fourth round over Johnny Heard of Chicago after Ray Phillips backed out days before the middleweight fight.
"This is my home now," Harris told The Marion Star's Bob Thatcher after winning his 29th straight match. "I wish I had looked better. I've told them I'm the best middleweight. I need some high-caliber fighters to show it. I've got a debt to pay to society, and I feel four-and-a-half years is enough. I hope society feels I should have a chance."
Harris would get out soon enough and resume his career with five more wins before losing his final two pro bouts, first to "Sugar" Ray Seales in 1980 and then to Manning Galloway in 1981.
Back inside the gates of the prison, heavyweights Stan Ward and Kevin Issac did not entertain. After two rounds of circling one another, someone in the crowd yelled, 'Come on! I've only got 20 years!"
Ward won by decision, but another match was lively. Rocky Mosley was knocked down in the first round but rallied to beat Johnny Baldwin when he couldn't answer the bell in the fifth.
Future heavyweight champion Michael Dokes of Akron, competing in just the fourth fight of his career, handled oval-shaped Charlie Jordan, showing flair in doing so.
Featherweight Ruben Castillo earned his 22nd straight win in an eight-round decision over Kenny Weldon, and lightweight Ruby "The Snake" Ortiz of Brooklyn took a unanimous decision over Vinnie DeBerros of Connecticut.
The main event included 18-year-old welterweight phenom and top-ranked Wilfredo Benitez and No. 10 Mel Dennis of Houston.
Benitez was 29-0-1 and recognized as the world junior welterweight champion at the time of his bout in Marion, becoming the youngest world champ in history at the age of 17. He won the eight-round fight at MCI via a decision in what BoxRec.com considered a four out of five star match. Benitez would leave Marion and go on to win two more world titles in two other weight classes in his hall of fame career.
The show was a success across the board.
Plug pulled on tourney But as entertaining as it was in Marion, the U.S. Boxing Championships were on the ropes.
A month later, ABC cancelled televising the series when investigative reports found at least 11 fighters in the tournament had false win-loss records with King associates allegedly buying rankings from Ring Magazine to bolster the boxers' statures.
There were further charges of promised kickbacks from fighters to bookers to get into the tournament, plus lots of other shenanigans.
By May, Sports Illustrated ran a piece spelling out all the trouble associated with the boxing championships, including FBI and IRS probes and a federal grand jury in Baltimore looking into it.
As said, it's a story — a weird story — but it's our story.
And it fittingly came to an end in a prison in Marion, Ohio, in March of 1977.

Monopoly on information can allow a corporation to control the world

Texto completo: I was talking on the telephone, a land line, with one of my best friends who is fairly sophisticated when it comes to technology. I asked how I could set up earphones to allow me to listen to the television but silence it from the rest of the household.
I am building a new basement television area near a study where both my wife and I work so I wanted to muffle the noise. He explained how with bluetooth it can be easily done with a variety of earphones. End of conversation.
Soon after, I went on my computer to my Facebook page. Popping up twice were advertisements for sound-muffling earphones. I had to read it multiple times to see if I was hallucinating. I knew, of course, that when you order something from Amazon or even visit a commercial page to look up a product you will be quickly targeted for sales purposes.
But in this case I was on the telephone. No one I have spoken to thinks it is likely that someone is listening to my phone conversations. (Except for the National Security Administration, which says it is only on the hunt for potential terrorists!) And I don't believe phone snooping of a commercial sort is happening either. I'm not a grand conspiracy person, but there it was. I was shocked.
In 1966, Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas wrote presciently: "We are rapidly entering the age of no privacy, where everyone is open to surveillance at all times; where there are no secrets from government."
What Douglas couldn't envision was that a small group of corporations would step into the villainous Big Brother role with such an amazing reach in so short a time that they dwarf any spying the government has ever attempted or dreamed about.
When the First Amendment to the Constitution was adopted in 1791, one of the major concerns was to find a way to stop the central governmental authorities from intruding into our lives by controlling our speech, in essence, from trying to control our thoughts. Think it, say it, publish it — and you are protected. No Big Brother can stop you.
And we've largely succeeded. But now, a new central authority has emerged, a corporate presence that lurks everywhere and dominates our lives. Think Facebook, Instagram, Google, Amazon, the monster media monopolists who are now under government scrutiny.
They are too big, too powerful, stomping our competition, and they must violate anti-trust laws. Or so the thinking goes. And they might be too big...
... but so is Walmart and Lowe's, and McDonald's and Time-Warner/Spectrum. Big is the logical way of capitalism dating back to the early 20th century when the government had to break up John D. Rockefeller's oil monopoly because he had snuffed out competition.
The difference with the companies the government has now decided to investigate is that they are not just selling things, not just commercial entities; they are also content providers. Facebook is the biggest news site in the world. Amazon also owns the Washington Post, one of the most important news products in the world.
And Google — well, it brings everything to your fingertips. Can't recall who starred in a movie, just Google it. Google does 63,000 searches per second which translates into 2 trillion searches yearly, 3.8 million searches per minute, 228 million searches per hour, and 5.6 billion searches per day. Google.com is the most visited website in the world.
Add to that Google books, Google maps, Gmail, YouTube, the Android phone. And Google Chrome is now the most used browser in the world. All of that makes Google the most valuable brand in the world, a monopolistic colossus, a surveillance industrial complex.
A British website sums it up: "Never in history has any one entity had such a totality and leverage of information." And it ought to make us nervous.
So, if the government was concerned that this corporate reach might violate anti-trust laws, we should welcome the interest. The problem, predictably, is that President Trump's only concern is how Google depicts him. Its dominant information superhighway seems not to enter his head. Nor do the tricky constitutional question that regulating Google raises.
A week before Google, Facebook and Twitter testified before Congress, Trump tweeted that Google's search engine had "rigged" results to show mostly "bad" stories about him and other conservatives. (There is little evidence of this.)
Trump's chief economic advisor said the White House was "looking into" whether Google suppresses positive articles about the President. "They better be careful because they can't do that to people," Trump declared.
He is wrong. They can do that to people. The media have been doing it to public figures forever. Bill Maher and Stephen Colbert heap it on the Republicans; Tucker Carlson and Rush Limbaugh heap it on the Democrats. Russian bots did it to the Democrats in the last Presidential election. They are the new purveyors of information — and information is protected.
What should trouble the president is that 70% of the world's searches for information — political and otherwise — are done on Google. And we have little information on the algorithms that drive their searches. Of course, Google insists its search is not used "to set a political agenda. We never rank search results to manipulate political sentiment." But how they rank is unclear.
I put the word "idiot" in a search and clicked on images. Trump's photo came up three times in the first 10 images. Some Google transparency would be nice. How does this happen?
As a point of reference, the New York Times has long been criticized for not cooperating with any inquiries on how it makes editorial decisions. And it is their right to keep their process in-house. Still, it would be nice for consumers to understand the news process — whether Google or the mainstream press. You just cannot force them.
The real issue is concentration of power. America has long tried to stop any one person or institution from becoming too powerful. Power belongs in the hands of the people, not the President or Congress or the Google/Facebook/Amazon behemoth. It's just that the constitution, rightly so, prevents meddling with their content.
Trump says Google's bias "will be addressed."
No, it wont. It is unconstitutional to do so, but there's nothing to stop the Justice Department from looking carefully at anti-trust laws. Competition is good in all things, including information gathering and distribution.
In a book on media monopolies author Ben Bagdikian, wrote: "Media products are unique. They do not produce nuts and bolts. They manufacture a social and political world." He is indeed correct. And we need to make sure our view of that world is not controlled by one corporation.

A headline lighter than lunar gravity

Texto completo: front-page flub?

Apollo 11s historic rendezvous with the moon was front-page news around the world.

Men walk on Moon was blasted across the top of the New York Times. In the United Kingdom, The Times had a more measured Man lands on the moon with perfect touchdown.

In Pinellas County, St. Petersburg Times readers awoke Monday July 21, 1969, to a front-page headline that struck a different tone: Moon, Were Onto You.

The pun approach was criticized by some Times staffers, who said it was inappropriate for such a momentous event, said Bob Jenkins, the newspapers then wire desk editor.

Maybe, yeah, we trivialized something too important to make light of, Jenkins, now retired, said in hindsight.

The words, written by wire editor Larry Jolidon, had to be approved by editors well in advance of the moon landing because the Times hot-type machine could not make a banner headline. Instead, it was printed on a strip of paper that was photographed, enlarged and then engraved in a metal strip that was set on the page.

On the night of the moon landing, Times owner Nelson Poynter and the then-editor, Don Baldwin, sat in the newsroom watching the TV coverage. At one point, CBS Walter Cronkite held up a copy of the New York Daily News, which was topped with the same headline as the New York Times.

Poynter and Baldwin exchanged a long look, but it was too late to change the headline, Jenkins said.

If the Times top editors were embarrassed about the headline, it didnt stop them from trying to turn a buck from it.

Over the next few days, the newspaper offered a high-gloss copy of the historic front page as a fine keepsake. The cost was 30 cents, or 60 cents to have it mailed in a protective tube to your home.

Years later, Jenkins came across a coffee-table book of front pages from that day. Moon, Were Onto You was not among them.

Don King, ABC-TV, boxing and a prison

Texto completo: For an afternoon in 1977, Marion was at the epicenter of the sporting world.
That's what happens when Don King and Howard Cosell, boxing and national television, future world champions and an all-time great are mixed together inside the walls of a prison.
It's a story — a weird story — but it's our story.
And it started in the late 1960s when Marion received a new resident. King, better known then as inmate 125734 according to a story written by Pulitzer Prize winning sports writer Red Smith in The New York Times, was sent to prison for manslaughter, but paroled in 1971.
As he left the gates of Marion Correctional Institution, he vowed to come back.
Some might have taken it one way, but he meant something else. Once on the outside, King made up for lost time. In less than six years, he became boxing's biggest and most famous promoter.
And he fulfilled that promise. He returned to MCI, only this time he brought a few friends with him.
The crowning of U.S. champs In 1976, America was giddy with patriotism while celebrating the Bicentennial, and the country couldn't get enough of boxing. At that year's Olympics in Montreal, five Americans brought home gold medals, while "Rocky" was winning over fans at the box office.
King, who was quickly becoming a major player in the sport, saw the confluence and the connection. He quickly conceived of the idea of a tournament called the United States Boxing Championships that would crown undisputed American champs in all weight classes.
He partnered with Ring Magazine to make it so.
"I needed their reputation and their ratings and their sanction to give validity and authority to the tournament," King told Sports Illustrated.
He then sold the concept to ABC Sports President Roone Arledge, the man better known for constructing the NFL's Monday Night Football franchise. It was to be a centerpiece of programming for ABC's Wide World of Sports show that owned the 1970s sporting consciousness.
One quarterfinal of the tournament was held on the deck of an aircraft carrier off the coast of Florida. Another was held at the Naval Academy. The third installment was the strangest venue yet.
The show was coming to Marion — not to be held in its coliseum, but its prison.
King was indeed coming home.
A captive audience The seven-fight card was set for Sunday, March 6, 1977. An unprecedented 90-minute block would be set up to broadcast at least two matches live from 3 to 4:30 p.m.
It was the first nationally televised live program from a prison, so the logistics were many. MCI is not Madison Square Garden. According to a recap in The Marion Star, to get a TV signal out of the prison, it had to be beamed to a dish atop Central Soya's grain silos in town and then on to WTVN-TV in Columbus where it went international from there.
Cosell was the voice of boxing in the '70s and called the matches.
Beloved former heavyweight champion Joe Louis was ringside, while former Olympic heavyweight boxer Pete Radamacher was a referee and judge.
Other dignitaries were Smith, who was writing his "Sports of the Times" column about the event, as well as the New York Post's Vic Zeigel, AP boxing writer Ed Schulyer and Time Magazine female writer P.J. Phillips among others.
By this time Arledge didn't go on the road much, but the head of ABC Sports was in Marion to make sure it went off without hassle.
The show was not open to the public. Save for the media members and a few local VIPs, the room was packed with MCI's 1,400 inmates. And they were ready to be entertained.
Before the matches, King climbed into the ring wearing a gold jacket over a frilled white shirt and took the microphone.
"I look around and see many familiar faces," Smith reported of King's brief speech. "I am one of you."
The crowd ate it up.
"It is with mixed emotions that I am coming back to what was trauma in my life," he continued. "I am happy and proud to be able to bring back some entertainment for you because you have been part of my life."
The inmates went wild with cheers and applause.
"Wherever I have gone outside, I have never tried to hide Marion C.I. I never forget No. 125734," King said with the crowd going bonkers.
Following King's introduction, in came Louis for a wave, which the inmates heartily appreciated. Then Cosell was introduced as a couple ringsiders held up signs that said, "Finally, Howard is where he belongs," and "Howard got in — will he get out?"
MCI Superintendent Pete Perini was "warmly booed," according to Smith, while prison chaplain Father Fred Furey was cheered. Walter Hampton, head of the parole board, brought a great many jeers upon his introduction, which caused King to tell the crowd, "That's the dude that sprung me."
Boxing at the prison King was sure his captive audience would be entertained.
Art "Tap" Harris, a former world-ranked welterweight from Akron, was in one of the featured bouts. Harris, like King before him, was also an inmate at MCI, serving time for shooting a man in a bar.
Fighting for the third time inside the prison's gates, Harris won by TKO in the fourth round over Johnny Heard of Chicago after Ray Phillips backed out days before the middleweight fight.
"This is my home now," Harris told The Marion Star's Bob Thatcher after winning his 29th straight match. "I wish I had looked better. I've told them I'm the best middleweight. I need some high-caliber fighters to show it. I've got a debt to pay to society, and I feel four-and-a-half years is enough.
" I hope society feels I should have a chance."
Harris would get out soon enough and resume his career with five more wins before losing his final two pro bouts, first to "Sugar" Ray Seales in 1980 and then to Manning Galloway in 1981.
Back inside the gates of the prison, heavyweights Stan Ward and Kevin Issac did not entertain. After two rounds of circling one another, someone in the crowd yelled, 'Come on! I've only got 20 years!"
Ward won by decision, but another match was lively. Rocky Mosley was knocked down in the first round but rallied to beat Johnny Baldwin when he couldn't answer the bell in the fifth.
Future heavyweight champion Michael Dokes of Akron, competing in just the fourth fight of his career, handled oval-shaped Charlie Jordan, showing flair in doing so.
Featherweight Ruben Castillo earned his 22nd straight win in an eight-round decision over Kenny Weldon, and lightweight Ruby "The Snake" Ortiz of Brooklyn took a unanimous decision over Vinnie DeBerros of Connecticut.
The main event included 18-year-old welterweight phenom and top-ranked Wilfredo Benitez and No. 10 Mel Dennis of Houston.
Benitez was 29-0-1 and recognized as the world junior welterweight champion at the time of his bout in Marion, becoming the youngest world champ in history at the age of 17. He won the eight-round fight at MCI via a decision in what BoxRec.com considered a four out of five star match. Benitez would leave Marion and go on to win two more world titles in two other weight classes in his hall of fame career.
The show was a success across the board.
Plug pulled on tourney But as entertaining as it was in Marion, the U.S. Boxing Championships were on the ropes.
A month later, ABC cancelled televising the series when investigative reports found at least 11 fighters in the tournament had false win-loss records with King associates allegedly buying rankings from Ring Magazine to bolster the boxers' statures.
There were further charges of promised kickbacks from fighters to bookers to get into the tournament, plus lots of other shenanigans.
By May, Sports Illustrated ran a piece spelling out all the trouble associated with the boxing championships, including FBI and IRS probes and a federal grand jury in Baltimore looking into it.
As said, it's a story — a weird story — but it's our story.
And it fittingly came to an end in a prison in Marion, Ohio, in March of 1977.

Here's how Salinas reacted to Apollo 11

Texto completo: As 19,111 "moonstruck spectators" attended the California Rodeo Salinas July 20, 1969, NASA astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin planted the first steps on the moon, The Salinas Californian reported.
The newspaper's July 21, 1969 front-page included "Moonday" rodeo coverage as well as United Press International stories detailing the Apollo 11 moon landing, which occurred occurred a half-century ago Saturday.
Still, it wasn't just international front-page news — it loomed large in the imaginations of Salinas residents.
"I fully expect man to explore throughout the solar system in the next few centuries," C. E. Dickinson, then-Hartnell College's planetarium director and astronomy instructor, told The Californian.
He stressed Apollo 11's impacts on humanity moving forward.
"Man won't refuse to do what can be done. He has always gone over the hill to see what is on the other side."
"From a scientific standpoint, it is the greatest thing that ever happened," Herb R. Warriner, El Sausal Middle School's science department chairman at the time, told The Californian.
Warriner said he had been "glued to the television set" since Apollo left earth. He reportedly added the astronauts "are worthy of being positive idols for the young and somebody to aspire to be like."
Over half a billion people around the world watched the moon landing.
The New York Times reported 94% of people in the U.S. watching television were tuned into the event. All three major American networks covered the Apollo 11 mission.
When the astronauts landed, The Californian did not print Sunday editions, so residents read about it the next day as the Eagle module left the moon's surface.
A July 21 editorial said the moon landing was "a demonstration of making the impossible possible through the application of mind and resources with single-minded determination."
Prior days, though, gave Salinas readers ongoing coverage not only from the concurrent rodeo, but the NASA astronauts' launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida and their three-day trip to the moon.
A lead-up edition included a full-page landing guide for the Eagle module of Apollo 11, as well as the astronauts' equipment.
Later, readers were notified about former President Richard Nixon declaring "Moon Day" a national and state holiday; this apparently included no home delivery of mail and rescheduled items for the Monterey County Superior Court.
"The Californian will publish as usual," reporters had said for Moon Day.
The newspaper's July 21 top-fold showed Armstrong, astronaut Michael Collins and Aldrin in spacesuits posing in a portrait behind an image of the moon. On page 2, readers learned about how Salinas reacted.
"We hope the conquest (of the moon) can be used for the betterment of world unity," Salinas Mayor G. Sid Gadsby told The Californian.
In The Californian's "Look Out Below" column, only signed by W.M.G.-The Senator, he wrote that he believed the moon landing would inspire dance instructors to teach the "kangaroo hop" as demonstrated by Aldrin on the lunar surface.
"It's a very graceful step and should be a valuable addition to the dance repertoire of the world's youth."
The writer then went on to say it was it was obvious why people were so happy.
"Gravity there is only one-sixth of that of the earth. So we can take our problems to the moon and they'll lose most of their gravity.
"Most people were happy, too, that there were no moon people. They would be sure to be angered by the intrusion and we have enough people in the worlds who don't like us now. Would that we all could settle on the Sea of Tranquility."

Texto completo: “Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.”
-- Matthew 25:40 (King James Version)
No. No more. Not one more word.
Events of the last few weeks have proven, as if proof were necessary, that those who claim that the United States of America is a Christian nation, or a society firmly founded in Judeo-Christian values, are either lying or under the influence of heavy drugs.
Let us, please, hear no more about it.
We can argue over interpretations of our history, of religious principles or the meaning of the First Amendment. But it becomes more obvious with every passing day that, in the words of that grumpy old man in “Hannah and Her Sisters,” "If Jesus came back and saw what’s going on in his name, he’d never stop throwing up.”
There are millions of examples, of course. The one that should have torn it for Americans of any, or no, religious persuasion was the stunned visage of Utah’s Sen. Mike Lee when he was part of Vice President Mike Pence’s delegation to some of the concentration camps for migrants, refugees and asylum-seekers at our southern border.
Both men sought, gained and would hold public office on a platform of fulfilling the mandates of their faith. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for Lee. Pence describes himself as a “a born-again, evangelical Catholic.”
Yet, staring into the faces of people who are about as leastish as one can imagine, it was as if Lee, Pence and company were suffering through a bad movie. No apparent reaction. Certainly no empathy. And no urge to engage in some of that Angry Jesus throw-the-money-changers-from-the-temple rage that would have been appropriate.
The money-changers, in this instance, being the for-profit prison operators who are pulling down $250 to $750 per person per day. Enough, one would think, to scare up some really nice toothbrushes.
The whole idea of for-profit prisons is simply vile. When the government runs a prison, it has an incentive to keep the number of prisoners low to, of nothing else, save taxpayers money. When a for-profit company runs a prison, it has an incentive to bring in more prisoners, and will aggressively lobby government for laws and policies that will help them do that.
The pool video that we saw was of 400 men crowded into a cage, with no room to lie down, complaining of not having a chance to bathe, a claim accompanying journalists said was validated by the smell in the room.
These bozos can’t even put together a proper Potemkin village.
Worse, according to The New York Times report, was that Lee acted as an unofficial translator for Pence during a visit to another facility that held children. Lee speaks Spanish. He did his LDS mission in that same part of the world. So our senator’s deniability is limited.
Well, enough of that. Lee was soon back home in the Senate, putting and releasing a hold on a bill to pay the medical expenses of the thousands of emergency workers and volunteers who were poisoned by their time at the World Trade Center site after the 9/11 terrorist attack.
Some Muslims tried to kill them. A couple of Christians didn’t seem to care. Not a good image of religion.
Meanwhile, of course, there are a good number of Christians who are appalled by the conditions at the border.
And more than a few Jews have taken it upon themselves to protest the policy. Some good old fashioned direct action against ICE facilities was launched by some second- and third-generation descendants of Holocaust victims and survivors who see that, when you say Never Again, you have to really, freaking, seriously mean Never Again. Or it doesn’t count.
The point, the solution, is not for the United States to really be a Christian nation. Or a Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist nation. We have sworn off an official faith, and there’s no way we could all follow the same one.
If you are in the market, though, might I recommend Kurt Vonnegut’s Bokononism. It is based on the idea that its own principles are harmless lies, and that each of us should live by whichever such untruths “make you brave and kind and healthy and happy.”
Some varieties of Christianity, of course, are seen by some as something that makes people happy and kind. So, as Gandhi didn’t ever really say when he was never really asked what he thought of Western civilization, it would be a good idea.
George Pyle , editorial page editor of The Salt Lake Tribune, was not always a fan of the Republican Party. Now he thinks what it used to be would be a good idea.

Texto completo: Saturday is the 50th anniversary of one of the greatest scientific achievements ever -- the first time that a human being stepped on the surface of another heavenly body. And today support for the space program is greater than ever. But is the cost of more space exploration too great?
America's great race to the moon began in 1961 at a low point in Cold War with the Soviet Union, after cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first man in space and the CIA carried out a botched plan for an invasion of Cuba, then a Soviet satellite. President John F. Kennedy established the goal of putting a man on the moon by the end of the decade.
Against tremendous odds, a spectacular cost and through three different presidential administrations, the goal was met and Apollo 11 astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin Jr. walked on the moon on July 20, 1969.
The success of the mission to the moon was seen at the time as a victory in the "space race" for the United States over the Soviet Union as well as a spectacular global attainment. Today, though, it is looked at with nostalgia and wistfulness. The price of another trip to a heavenly body may be just too great.
But even in 1961, there were doubts about the wisdom of spending so much money and risking lives to beat the Soviets at something.
"Anybody who would spend $40 billion in a race to the moon for national prestige is nuts," said Dwight D. Eisenhower, Kennedy's predecessor and commander of another great achievement, the D-Day invasion of 1944.
A recent New York Times story reminds us that scientists opposed a manned mission, arguing that money should go to robotic exploration. And 48 percent of Americans polled in 1966, when asked which government programs could be cut, cited the space program.
But 50 years later, Americans have overwhelmingly positive feelings about space exploration, polling shows, and about three in four Americans say NASA funding should be maintained or increased.
Americans' views have grown increasingly positive, the Gallup Poll found, since 1979, when only 41 percent thought space program costs were justified. Today, 64 percent feel that way.
So, what's next? Earlier the Trump administration said it wanted to return to the moon -- where no American has been since 1972 -- by 2024. But last month the president tweeted that NASA "should be focused" on Mars: "For all of the money we are spending, NASA should NOT be talking about going to the Moon -- We did that 50 years ago."
Just returning to the moon would cost $20 billion to $30 billion, NASA estimates. And a NASA-commissioned report said that exploring Mars by 2033 is not feasible.
The earliest that could happen, said the Science and Technology Policy Institute, would be 2037, with a cost estimated at more than $120 billion.
At a time when some Americans say they want free college and health care for all and others want more spent on defense, it's difficult to see where that money -- and ultimately the political support -- would come from. Ten years from now, we may again be looking wistfully at the Apollo 11 mission.

Texto completo: Limited selection
Editor: Have many voters really paid attention to who the Democratic or Republican committee members are for their district?
I know I haven’t. I never really have given much thought about who they are or what their role is other than to provide an endorsement to candidates for public office. Now these individuals that most of us don’t know much or anything about will ultimately get to select the next mayor of Scranton.
According to a Times-Tribune article on July 11, City Councilman Bill Gaughan won’t be a candidate in the mayoral special election and Councilman Kyle Donahue is considering running.
The City Democratic Executive Committee will solicit resumes, vet and interview candidates and vote on one candidate to recommend to the Lackawanna County Democratic Executive Committee for final approval of an endorsement. The Republican Committee process is similar. This process certainly leaves more questions than answers.
Will the list of candidates be made public? What will the interview process entail? Why are only executive committee members able to vote and not all committee members? Are there bylaws that govern the committees and this process? How can voters be certain that every candidate will be given an equal shot by the committees? Do any members of the committees have connection to the criminal investigations into both the school district and the city?
This process certainly doesn’t feel like the residents of Scranton will make the choice for the next mayor; instead it seems like a select few make the decision. I have learned my lesson and will pay closer attention in the future; I hope others do as well.

Boost internet equity
Editor: One reason Gov. Tom Wolf signed the recent “no snow days” bill into law was because it means there will be no school makeup days in the spring.
The downside is the fact that students without broadband access will still miss days of school since they cannot do assignments if teachers assign online homework during what used to be snow days.
While I do not argue the merits of this new law, it reminds me that Pennsylvania must bring internet equity to all students as a top legislative priority and not unintentionally leave them even further behind.

Flag not offensive
Editor: How has the Betsy Ross Flag now become offensive when President Obama’s second inauguration had it on full display?
People use our history and distort it in an effort to gain votes to win elections.
I do not condemn Colin Kaepernick, Nike or Rep. Ilhan Omar. I condemn their actions. Nike produced a sneaker with the Betsy Ross Flag on the back. Kaepernick stated the Betsy Ross Flag was offensive because of its connection to slavery.
At the time the flag was made, it represented the original 13 colonies. The colonies were united, free and independent states. Nike has pulled the sneakers off the shelves. This action goes against America’s history and the men and women who have fought to make our country free.
Omar stated that the Council on American-Islamic Relations “was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties.”
Yes, they did do something. Radical Islamic terrorists flew planes into the twin towers at the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001. The fact is, our military was called to fight and protect our country. My nephew wanted to do something; he joined the Marines in 2003 to protect our country and on March 31, 2006, Lance Cpl. Jacob Beisel died for our country in Iraq. Now, that is something.
So, let’s hope the American people do something. My suggestion: Boycott Nike, pull the plug on the NFL and get rid of radical representatives. If the history of our country or our American flag offends you, pack your bags.

Unhappy noncamper
Editor: Camp Bisco is underway again on Montage Mountain.
In the recent past at least two deaths have occurred during the annual music festival. People are treated annually for drug overdoses. Scranton has a noise ordinance that forbids noise crossing property lines between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. Despite that, I have been awakened as late, or early, as 4 a.m. by the music at Montage Mountain - about 2 miles away - and no one will do anything about it.
In spite of my personal pleas to the Lackawanna County Communications Center, county officials and three appearances at Scranton City Council, asking for help seems worthless.
The Times-Tribune, again, ran an article this week about how great the festival is. During the festival’s three days, more than 70 acts are scheduled to perform. Yet, despite promises to the contrary, Camp Bisco, Scranton and the county refuse to publish times for the acts.
The late noise has to stop.

Don’t abandon coal
Editor: It would be a mistake to dismiss coal to generate our electricity.
While natural gas is less expensive and pollutes the air less than coal, gas is used to heat millions of homes and other structures, which means that our natural gas supply will not last too long and coal will be needed.
While power generation affects our air, it is not the only reason for climate change. Hundreds of millions of motor vehicles worldwide contribute to warming.
Using natural gas instead of coal won’t stop climate change. Replacing gasoline-powered vehicles with electric ones will help.

Better than OK
Editor: The great New York Times - whose revenue is down 28% over the last 10 years - has declared the United States to be just OK, not great, but just OK.
Last year, we took in more immigrants than all other countries combined.
Recently, a father and daughter drowned trying to get in this country. I don’t believe they thought this country was just OK.

Texto completo: The New York Times included two Detroit chefs and one former Detroiter in its list of "16 black chefs changing food in America" published Tuesday.
Kiki Louya, co-owner of the brunch cafe Folk in Corktown, and Max Hardy, who runs River Bistro in Grandmont-Rosedale and the COOP stall in Midtown's Detroit Shipping Co. food hall, both made the paper of record's first-ever list of its kind.
Tunde Wey, a native of Nigeria who spent his early adulthood in Detroit and co-founded the pop-up restaurant Revolver in Hamtramck, also made the list. (Wey now resides in New Orleans but frequently brings his confrontational equity- and justice-centered dining experiences to the Motor City.)
Penned by the Times' national race correspondent John Eligon and food writer Julia Moskin, the feature calls attention to the racial inequities pervasive in the restaurant world.
"Diners often look past them when asking to compliment the chef," Eligon and Moskin write of the featured chefs. "Eyes still go wide when people see them cooking Mexican, Japanese or just about anything that's not considered soul food. They still have to navigate the same racial politics as other black professionals."
Hardy, whose River Bistro restaurant made the Free Press' annual Best New Restaurants list in 2018, told the Times he was influenced in part by growing up in Detroit. He moved to Florida as a teenager, but came back to his hometown in 2017 at least in part to give black chefs in Detroit more visibility.
"Growing up in Detroit, you didn't see chefs and restaurants elevated like that," Hardy told the Times. "It was Motor City, not Food City. Now I can invent a dinner based on the recipes of Hercules, a slave who was George Washington's personal chef, and I can have my restaurant, and I can teach kids in the community."
Louya has been in the news quite a bit lately. Folk made the Freep's most recent Best New Restaurant list and Food & Wine's inaugural list of best restaurants to work for. In May, Louya and business partner Rohani Foulkes announced they'd be joining forces with Ping Ho and Sarah Welch of Marrow on a new joint venture that will elevate Folk's presence and expand their Farmer's Hand grocery store.
Folk has garnered much attention for eschewing gratuity and instituting a flat service charge in its place. The cafe also pays its staff a living wage.
Wey has been covered previously by the Free Press for his various pop-up dinner discussions centered on blackness, immigration and the racial wealth gap.
"Food has politics," he told the Times. "It doesn't mean it can't be enjoyed. But it can't be separated into a rarefied medium that transcends everything else."

Investigation Into Trump Campaign Finance Violations Is Over, Judge Says

Texto completo: [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox .]
A federal judge in Manhattan disclosed on Wednesday that prosecutors have concluded their investigation into campaign finance violations involving President Trump and ordered that they publicly release some of their files, a new twist in a case that had threatened to upend the Trump presidency.
The judge's order did not answer one of the lingering questions of the investigation: whether prosecutors in the United States attorney's office in Manhattan still plan to file additional charges in connection with the case.
The investigation, which centered on hush money payments arranged during the 2016 presidential campaign to two women who said they had affairs with Mr. Trump, already resulted in the conviction of the president's former fixer, Michael D. Cohen.
Mr. Cohen, who is now serving a three-year prison sentence, has said he helped arrange the hush money at the direction of Mr. Trump, an accusation that the federal prosecutors in Manhattan ultimately repeated in court papers.
In ordering the unsealing of search warrants and related documents in connection with a 2018 raid on Mr. Cohen's home and office, the judge, William H. Pauley III, said the campaign finance violations discussed in the papers "are a matter of national importance."
"Now that the government's investigation into those violations has concluded," Judge Pauley wrote, "it is time that every American has an opportunity to scrutinize the materials."
As recently as this spring, prosecutors were still considering whether one Trump Organization executive was untruthful when testifying before the grand jury in the Cohen case, according to people briefed on the matter.
The prosecutors have also examined Mr. Trump's role in the hush-money arrangements, and effectively labeled him an unindicted co-conspirator. Justice Department policy holds that a sitting president cannot be indicted.
Prosecutors have not told the Trump Organization, or its executives, that the investigation has been closed, according to people briefed on the matter.
The United States attorney's office in Manhattan declined to comment. The Trump Organization did not respond to a request for comment, but a lawyer for Mr. Trump declared victory.
"We are pleased that the investigation surrounding these ridiculous campaign finance allegations is now closed," said the lawyer, Jay Sekulow. "We have maintained from the outset that the president never engaged in any campaign finance violation."
Mr. Trump has denied having affairs with the two women, Stephanie Clifford, an adult film actress known as Stormy Daniels, and Karen McDougal, a Playboy centerfold.
Michael D. Monico, a lawyer for Mr. Cohen, was surprised by the ruling, because, he said, "I do believe he has provided substantial and significant information.
The records that the judge ordered unsealed may reveal new details about the role played by members of the president's inner circle in the hush-money arrangements.
In his three-page order, Judge Pauley directed prosecutors to publicly file, with only minimal redactions, a confidential report that they had sent to him detailing the status of their investigation. The underlying search warrants and other records were also to be filed publicly, with limited redactions.
The material is expected to be released Thursday morning.
An original set of nearly 900 pages of search warrants and other records that contained extensive redactions was ordered released by the judge in March in response to a request by The New York Times and other news organizations. Judge Pauley ordered prosecutors to provide him with the confidential status report by this week.
Judge Pauley is still allowing the prosecutors to black out some portions, which he called "limited references" to an "uncharged third-party." The identity of that person is unclear.
In a separate inquiry, the federal prosecutors in Manhattan are also investigating Mr. Trump's inaugural committee, an investigation that evolved out of the Cohen case.
Maggie Haberman contributed reporting.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — John Paul Stevens, the second oldest and third longest-serving Supreme Court justice in history and a Republican president's nominee who went on to lead the court's liberal wing, died Tuesday. He was 99.
Stevens died in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, from complications of a stroke he suffered on Monday. His death was confirmed by Chief Justice John Roberts, who said Stevens "brought to our bench an inimitable blend of kindness, humility, wisdom and independence. His unrelenting commitment to justice has left us a better nation. "
In a statement late Tuesday night, the White House said President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump offered "their deepest condolences to the family and friends" of the retired justice and noted his military service, legal acumen and "affection for his beloved Chicago Cubs. "
More: In 35 years of opinions and dissents, John Paul Stevens left his mark on the Supreme Court and American life
"His work over the course of nearly 35 years on the Supreme Court will continue to shape the legal framework of our Nation for years to come. His passion for the law and for our country will not soon be forgotten," the statement said.
For 35 years, Stevens’ trademark bow tie and gentle mien belied a competitive edge that turned up in his opinions and dissents, most often defending the rights of individuals against the government.
More: John Paul Stevens will be buried among several other Supreme Court justices in Arlington National Cemetery
Stevens’ brand of conservatism – a term he insisted still applied until his retirement in 2010 – all but disappeared during his long and distinguished career. He was a proud veteran of World War II and a code-breaker who went on to become a corruption-buster in his native Chicago. President Gerald Ford not only nominated him in 1975 but proudly defended him 30 years later in a letter to USA TODAY.
“I am prepared to allow history’s judgment of my term in office to rest (if necessary, exclusively) on my nomination thirty years ago of Justice John Paul Stevens to the U. S. Supreme Court,” Ford wrote a year before his death.
In lengthy interviews with The New Yorker and The New York Times near the end of his career, Stevens insisted that he had not changed his stripes but had simply withstood the court’s transformation from liberal to conservative. During that time, he came to align more with the court’s liberals than its new brand of conservatives, eventually becoming the senior justice on that side with the power to assign opinions and dissents.
Those dissents often went to himself and were perhaps his greatest contribution. In his last term, he penned a 90-page dissent to the court’s decision in Citizens United vs. Federal Election Commission, which gave corporations the right to spend freely on elections.
“While American democracy is imperfect, few outside the majority of this court would have thought its flaws included a dearth of corporate money in politics,” he wrote.
And a decade earlier, he led the opponents of the high court's ruling in Bush v. Gore, which ended the Florida recount and handed the 2000 election to George W. Bush.
“Although we may never know with complete certainty the identity of the winner of this year’s presidential election, the identity of the loser is perfectly clear," he wrote. "It is the nation’s confidence in the judge as an impartial guardian of the rule of law. ”
That concern over impartiality led Stevens to oppose Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation in October 2018, following Kavanaugh's intemperate performance at the Senate Judiciary Committee's hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct during his youth.
Guns, abortion, death penalty
On other issues, Stevens appeared to be a true liberal. He fiercely opposed Associate Justice Antonin Scalia’s opinion in 2008 that said the Second Amendment gave Americans the right to keep guns at home for self-defense, later calling for its repeal. And he stood firmly behind women's right to choose their reproductive future.
"The societal costs of overruling (Roe v. Wade) at this late date would be enormous," he wrote in a 1992 case. "Roe is an integral part of a correct understanding of both the concept of liberty and the basic equality of men and women. ”
Stevens enjoyed his share of victories on the closely-divided court, including on a series of cases during Bush’s administration that gave prisoners at Guantanamo Bay the right to challenge their incarceration in U. S. courts, rather than military tribunals.
And in his last decade, the court also upheld the McCain-Feingold campaign finance law and banned the use of the death penalty against juveniles and those with intellectual disabilities, with Stevens leading the liberal wing against the court’s conservatives.
His greatest regret, he would later say, was his vote in 1976 to reinstate the death penalty after a four-year hiatus. By the end of his time on the high court, he had decided capital punishment was unconstitutional.
“My views on the death penalty have changed as the years have gone by," he told USA TODAY in 2014.
Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said, "From my first year at the court, Justice Stevens was my model for all a collegial judge should be. . . . Quick as his bright mind was, Justice Stevens remained a genuinely gentle and modest man. "
Court's last World War II vet
Born in 1920, Stevens enlisted in the Navy just hours before the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor and later served out his time there as a cryptographer. His fierce patriotism led him to oppose the Supreme Court’s ruling that burning the American flag was a protected form of speech – a decision even Scalia supported.
Stevens had plans to become an English teacher until he was convinced he should attend Northwestern University School of Law, where he graduated at the top of his class in two years.
Content as a lawyer in Chicago, he was entering his sixth decade when President Richard Nixon named him to the U. S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit in 1970. Five years later, Ford named him to succeed Justice William O. Douglas, whose record 36 years on the high court Stevens nearly matched. He was succeeded by Justice Elena Kagan in 2010.
Over the years, Stevens survived both prostate cancer and heart bypass surgery and was the picture of good health. He would spend nearly half the time the court was in session at his condominium in Fort Lauderdale, reading briefs on the beach between tennis and golf matches. He swam in the Atlantic Ocean regularly until recent years, when he decided he was no longer safe without someone nearby to help him get out.
A devoted Chicago Cubs fan, Stevens was at Wrigley Field in 1932 when the New York Yankees’ Babe Ruth called his famous shot to center field. He threw out the first pitch at age 85, and attended Game 4 of the 2016 World Series in a red bowtie and Cubs jacket.
'Maybe I should have had seven'
Since retiring from the court, Stevens maintained an active schedule of public speaking and wrote three books: “Five Chiefs: A Supreme Court Memoir,” “Six Amendments: How and Why We Should Change the Constitution,” and "The Making of a Justice: Reflections on My First 94 Years. "
“It’s certainly not easy to get the Constitution amended, and perhaps that’s one flaw in the Constitution that I don’t mention in the book,” he said during a wide-ranging interview with USA TODAY in 2014. While the book called for six new amendments, he mused, “Maybe I should have had seven. ”
During the interview, Stevens correctly predicted the court would soon address same-sex marriage and government surveillance programs, and he said the court’s 2008 decision on guns wouldn’t be the final word.
As for bringing cameras into the court, Stevens was a traditionalist. “If you leave it up to members of the court, I don’t think there’s a chance in the foreseeable future,” he said. “The downside is that whenever you bring television into a new arena, you’re never sure what’s going to happen. ”
And as for retirement, Stevens reveled in the time for golf, tennis and reading – lots of reading, particularly history.
“It’s amazing how many interesting things there are to learn about the world,” he said. "You’ve got a lot to learn, no matter how much you’ve studied. ”

What else was making headlines?

Texto completo: At the Spaceship Earth attraction at Walt Disney World's Epcot, time travelers glide through the past inside a geodesic sphere.
In a re-creation of July 20, 1969, an animatronic family – a mom, dad and their two children – are gathered at home around a black-and-white TV. The young boy, lying on the shag carpet, clutches a toy rocket as famed newsman Walter Cronkite covers the moon landing.
Yes. That moment in history, without a doubt, had the world's attention and remains a powerful example of how human communication brings the world together.
But other life-changing and just-life happenings occurred between July 16, when Apollo 11 launched, and July 24, when the crew returned triumphant to an appreciative global audience.
Americans were fighting and dying in Vietnam.
On July 17, an article in the New York Times shared that "Secretary of State William P. Rogers said today that he was at a loss to understand how North Vietnam could take a position 'so lacking in humanity' as to refuse the names of American prisoners of war and to deny permission for international teams to inspect their camps."
The next day, Sen. Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts drove an Oldsmobile off a bridge after a party on Chappaquiddick Island, and his passenger, Mary Jo Kopechne, died. Kennedy would appear on TV to talk about the incident on July 25, a day after Apollo 11's return to Earth.
In much lighter news, on July 18, rock singer Janis Joplin appeared on "The Dick Cavett Show."
And after a monthlong "retirement," New York Jets quarterback Joe Namath agreed to sell his interest in a New York nightclub called Bachelors 3 in order to stay in the NFL.
The same day men stepped on the lunar surface for the first time, a cease-fire between Honduras and El Salvador was declared, ending the "Football War." And also on July 20, cyclist Eddy Merckx of Belgium won the Tour de France.
On July 23, first baseman Willie McCovey of the San Francisco Giants was named MVP of the 40th Major League Baseball All-Star Game. The National League bested the American League 9-3 in a matchup at RFK Memorial Stadium in Washington, D.C.
On TV, other than live reports about those moon-walking guys, viewed by an estimated 720 million people, summertime was rerun time. Remember, we're talking about a time when new shows didn't premiere every other day and cable TV wasn't a mainstay in American households – viewers relied on ABC, NBC and CBS, the three major broadcast networks. That summer of 1969, popular shows included "Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In," "Gunsmoke," "Bonanza," "Mayberry RFD" and "Family Affair."
On the big screen, "Easy Rider," starring Jack Nicholson, Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda, was released two days before the launch. The 95-minute movie became one of the most popular films of 1969 and an enduring cult classic, eventually grossing $60 million.
The timeline of the summer of 1969 featured music that has stood the test of time, too, still popular on oldies stations and staples in advertising.
Billboard's Top 3 songs from the moon landing week of July 19, 1969: "In The Year 2525" by Zager & Evans; "Spinning Wheel" by Blood, Sweat & Tears; and "Good Morning Starshine" by Oliver. "Bad Moon Rising" by Credence Clearwater Revival landed at No. 11 that week. "Get Back" by the Beatles slipped in at No. 16.
And on July 24, the day Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins got back on Earth? A future megastar – actor and singer Jennifer Lopez – was born.

TECHNOLOGY; Google activist employee quits to focus on AI ethics

Texto completo: One of the leaders of last year's mass protests at Google has left the company, underlining a deepening rift between management and workers over issues as diverse as sexual harassment and the potential risks of artificial intelligence.
Meredith Whittaker, an artificial intelligence researcher, said she left to work full time on AI ethics and to focus on "organizing for an accountable tech industry -- and it's clear Google isn't a place where I can continue this work."
The 13-year Google employee took a leading role late last year in organizing walkouts of workers around the world over Google's handling of sexual harassment complaints against senior executives.

The protests followed a New York Times report revealing that the company had hidden the reasons for the departure of two top executives, one of whom, Android creator Andy Rubin, left with a large payout.
Encouraging open debate among workers on internal message boards has long been a part of Google's culture. But that has come back to haunt the company as workers have taken outspoken positions on a wide range of issues, in turn prompting a backlash from Republican critics who say the worker pressure is adding to a bias against conservatives at the company.
The internal tensions first boiled over publicly in 2017 after a conservative employee posted controversial comments saying women are less well suited to become engineers than men, prompting an uproar from other workers. Right-wing critics said his later dismissal showed that executives had caved to worker activism.
Other worker protests have erupted over a Google study into whether to launch a censored search engine in China, and a contract to handle automatic image recognition for U.S. military drones. The company backed off both projects.
Whittaker said she was worried about the way Google's strong position in AI was carrying it into new markets, including healthcare, city development and governance, and transport.
"The result is that Google, in the conventional pursuit of quarterly earnings, is gaining significant and largely unchecked power to impact our world (including in profoundly dangerous ways, such as accelerating the extraction of fossil fuels and the deployment of surveillance technology)," she wrote in an internal note to fellow employees that was later published online.
Dealing with these issues would take "serious structural change in how technology is developed and how tech companies are run," she added.
Whittaker, who co-founded a research group at New York University called the AI Now Institute to study the effects of AI, said she was leaving to work there full time. She also called on Google workers to become more organized, including unionizing, to take greater control of decision making at the company.
"The stakes are extremely high," she wrote. "The use of AI for social control and oppression is already emerging, even in the face of developers' best of intentions. We have a short window in which to act, to build in real guardrails for these systems, before AI is built into our infrastructure and it's too late."

ICE captura a migrantes en Home Depot y toca a puertas de madrugada. Esta joven supo cómo responderles

Texto completo: El presidente, Donald Trump , aseguró el lunes que “muchos, muchos” inmigrantes fueron capturados el domingo por el Servicio de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas (ICE, en inglés) en el primer día de la operación con la que planeaba arrestar a al menos 2,000 personas.
Hasta el momento no se han tenido noticia de detenciones masivas, pese a que tanto los migrantes (aterrorizados, y escondidos en sus casas) como los activistas (en guardia, defendiendo los derechos de los afectados) están en alerta máxima.
“Simplemente, ustedes no conocen lo que ha sucedido”, explicó Trump sobre esta falta de noticias sobre arrestos. “Fue un día muy exitoso, pero no vieron mucho de lo que pasó”, añadió el presidente, sin citar cifras concretas.
La operación, que debería llevarse a cabo durante toda la semana en nueve ciudades (Atlanta, Baltimore, Chicago, Denver, Houston, Los Ángeles, Miami, Nueva York y San Francisco), puede ganar fuerza en cualquier momento.
Y ICE, en cualquier caso, no ha dejado de arrestar a inmigrantes.
Entre el 7 de julio y el pasado jueves, por ejemplo, detuvo a docenas de personas en Los Ángeles. La semana pasada, arrestó a 20 migrantes, la mayoría con antecedentes criminales, en San Diego. El lunes capturó a seis más en una redada en un edificio de apartamentos de Houston (Texas).
En Estados Unidos hay 10,5 millones de indocumentados. ICE cifra en 565.892 los fugitivo s (migrantes que han desobedecido una orden final de expulsión).
La agencia federal arrestó a 160,000 personas (440 al día) en el año fiscal de 2018, y deportó a 256,000 (700 al día). Es decir, en una semana normal detiene a más de 2.000 migrantes y deporta a casi 4,000, cifras muy similares a las anunciadas para la operación de esta semana.
Si se cree en peligro, recuerde sus derechos y siga los consejos de activistas sobre qué hacer si se ve involucrado en una redada.
Agentes de ICE tocaron a la puerta de una vivienda en Passaic (Nueva Jersey) el domingo a la una de la madrugada, según cuenta el diario The New York Times. Despertaron a una joven adolescente, pero gracias a que había leído una información en Internet sobre qué hacer en estos casos, decidió no abrir.
“Dijeron, ‘tenemos que hablar contigo, ¿puedes salir, puedes abrir la puerta?’. Yo dije, ‘¿tienen permiso para entrar en mi casa, tienen un papel?’”, explicó la joven. “Ellos dijeron, ‘no estamos intentando entrar en tu casa, sólo queremos hablar contigo’, y yo dije, ‘no, no voy a salir”, añadió.
Los agentes regresaron a las cinco de la madrugada, pero la joven se escondió con sus padres hasta que se fueron, según cuenta el diario.
No fue la única redada.
“Hablan del domingo, pero no necesitamos esperar al domingo, ya están deteniendo a inmigrantes”, explicó la activista Nora Sandigo a la cadena NBC.
Según contó, el viernes fueron detenidos cinco hombres en el área de Homestead (Florida), al menos uno de ellos en su casa y otro mientras esperaba a las puertas de un centro comercial Home Depot esperando trabajo en la construcción.
Se trata de un guatemalteco que lleva 16 años en el país y tiene cinco hijos de entre dos y 16 años. “Es totalmente injusto”, explicó Sandigo, “es el que trae el dinero a la familia, una buena persona sin problemas con la ley, su único problema es que no tiene papeles”.

Texto completo: As Jeffrey Epstein, the registered sex offender and wealthy financier, faced charges of sex trafficking girls as young as 14 in federal court this week, the investigative reporting of Julie K. Brown of the Miami Herald received credit for reigniting the case 11 years after Epstein's plea deal for soliciting minors for prostitution.
But other media outlets have drawn critique from some sexual abuse survivors and advocates who point to language choices they say sanitize the accusations against Epstein, who has pleaded not guilty to the charges.
The media has been blasted for using terms such as "underage women" instead of "children," for saying "sex with minors" instead of "rape," for using the phrase "paid for sex," which they say erases coercion.
Epstein fallout: Trump's Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta resigns
"When journalists use words associated with consensual sex to report on sexual assault, they omit the very elements that make it a headline in the first place … coercion, threats, violence, manipulation … or even the legal charges. Legally, there is no such thing as 'sex with a minor. ' It’s instead recognized as statutory sexual assault, child sexual abuse, rape, or corruption of minors, or any other legal charge … but 'sex' by itself implies consent," said Kristen Houser, chief public affairs officer at the National Sexual Violence Resource Center.
Experts in human trafficking, sexual violence, law and media ethics say the media's language around such cases reflect a combination of factors, including adherence to legal definitions rather than colloquial terms, avoiding words that would compromise the presumption of innocence prior to conviction and reporting limitations, such as having access to court documents but not victims.
But experts also note that word choices carry weight and excessive caution could whitewash the charges.
Epstein's alleged targets: 'The more vulnerable the better'
'Underage women' vs. 'children'
Dozens of news outlets have referred to Epstein's victims as "underage women":
FOX Business Network: "The businessman stands accused of sexually abusing underage women at his residences in Florida and New York. "
New York Magazine: "Jeffrey Epstein, the man now accused of running a sex trafficking ring involving underage women, some of them in their early teens. "
New York Times: "Very embarrassing that [Labor Secretary Alexander] Acosta is one of the people who’s supposed to protect underage women from being sold as sex slaves. "
Donna Hughes, a leading international researcher on human trafficking, said she finds the term "strange. "
"A female under the age of 18 is a girl, while a female over 18 is a woman or young woman," she said. "Using the term 'underage woman' implies that she is a mature woman, but the law has made her 'underage. ' The implication is that the law could be changed to lower the age of consent —- or even eliminate it. . . . Personally, I would not use 'underage woman. '"
Houser said the term is inaccurate.
"It is a word that implies the ability to make adult choices such as engaging in an adult sexual relationship," she said. "But that’s not the case in this story. It would be more appropriate to say 'teenaged girls' or 'girls' or 'children. '"
In a post on the website Fatherly, "Stop Calling Epstein’s Victims Young Women. They're Children," the writer says "in no world is a 14-year-old an underage woman. "
"Proper terminology is important," the post read. "And using the incorrect terms obscures the fact that Epstein, a billionaire adult, is accused of assaulting children and trafficking them for nonconsensual sexual acts. "
A spokesperson for New York Magazine said going forward it will use “children” or “underage girls” depending on context.
'Sex with minors' vs. 'rape'
In referencing Epstein's previous plea deal, Bloomberg wrote that the "agreement allowed the wealthy money manager to dodge federal charges for having sex with minors. "
In a Facebook post that has since gone viral, a childhood rape survivor took issue with the term, saying, "it's rape. Call it rape. "
"When we use our 'polite words,' we create the impression that sexual abusers aren't really THAT bad," Jenna Glatzer wrote.
Experts say one reason why reporters are not using the term "rape" in this week's coverage is because it is not used in the legal definition of sex trafficking.
"The crimes the media is reporting on are federal crimes — there is no federal rape statute per se — they are using the language federal prosecutors are using, which is the language of sex trafficking," said Martina Vandenberg, founder and president of the Human Trafficking Legal Center,
Donna Hughes, a leading international researcher on human trafficking, said rather than “sex with a minor," she would say “victim of child sex trafficking. "
Gene Rossi, who has three decades of criminal and civil litigation experience at the U. S. Department of Justice, says sometimes the media can be overly cautious.
"Generically, there is no legal barrier to a reporter calling it as it is," Rossi said. "The media tend to somewhat sugarcoat the essence of the allegation when it comes to sexual violence. . . . It would be like if someone was accused of murder and the article on the murder said 'the alleged defendant took the life of of another person. '"
'Paid for sex'
A story in the Washington Times this week read, "Billionaire Jeffrey Epstein ran a 'vast network of underage victims' he paid for sex. "
Houser said she takes issue with that term when referring to victims under the age of 18.
"When we say 'paid for sex' it erases the coercion, manipulation, intimidation or even violence inherent in the situation and instead sanitizes it to sound like a business transaction between consenting people," she said.
What the media has done right
Despite some criticism, experts say many news organizations have used proper terminology and given the Epstein case appropriate weight.
"I think the media is doing a good job stressing that it is a big and dramatic event," Rossi said. "That this could be a small part of a bigger puzzle. "
As Vandenberg notes, there might not have been a case if not for Brown's November investigation on Epstein. The Herald identified about 80 victims who alleged they were abused by Epstein from 2001 to 2006.
"This story is a tribute to the power of investigative reporting, because this case would have died long ago," she said. "Those girls, now women, would have been completely forgotten but for this one journalist who would not let it go. "

Ohio's richest man once close to Epstein

Texto completo: COLUMBUS – Financier Jeffrey Epstein, arrested last week on child sex trafficking charges, was notoriously secretive about his billionaire client list, disclosing just one prominent name over and over: Leslie H. Wexner, CEO of L Brands and Ohio's richest man.
Epstein's recent arrest has brought to light his once-close relationship with Wexner, the billionaire founder and CEO of brands like Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works.
In 1989, Wexner purchased the seven-story Manhattan mansion where Epstein has since been accused of sexually assaulting girls in the 2000s. In 1996, a woman alleges Epstein and his partner sexually assaulted her at Wexner's Ohio mansion, according to a federal court affidavit.
Wexner, through a spokeswoman, said that he severed all ties with Epstein nearly 12 years ago – around the time Epstein faced charges for sex crimes in Florida.
Epstein was convicted in 2008 and served 13 months in county jail as part of a plea deal negotiated by then-U.S. Attorney Andrew Acosta, who announced Friday he would resign from President Donald Trump's administration. That deal has since come under scrutiny for cutting off a larger FBI investigation into Epstein.
Before that time, Wexner played a key role in improving Epstein's prospects as a financier to America's elite. In 2003, Epstein described his relationship with Wexner to Vanity Fair: "People have said it's like we have one brain between two of us: each has a side."
The connections between Wexner and Epstein abound. Wexner, a longtime Republican fundraiser who recently left the party out of frustration with Trump, became Epstein's client in the late 1980s after Epstein left global investment bank, Bear Stearns.
"I think we both possess the skill of seeing patterns," Wexner told Vanity Fair in 2003. "But Jeffrey sees patterns in politics and financial markets, and I see patterns in lifestyle and fashion trends."
In 1989, Wexner purchased the 21,000-square foot Manhattan townhome for $13.2 million – the highest recorded sale for that type of property at the time, according to the New York Times.
But Wexner never lived there. Epstein did.
That's one place where federal investigators say Epstein groped and sexually assaulted girls after he recruited them to massage him while nude or partially nude. Other alleged assaults occurred at Epstein's Palm Beach, Florida, residence. Some of the girls were as young as 14 years old.
Wexner no longer owns the Manhattan home; it was transferred to a trust that Epstein controls in 2011, according to a New York Times report.
Epstein played an important role in the development of New Albany, a city just east of Columbus where the Wexners reside in their Georgian-inspired estate, in the 1990s. At one point, Epstein owned a "grand house" nearby, according to a 2002 New York Magazine article.
In 2000, Epstein commissioned a $339,000 family portrait of Wexner's wife, Abigail, and the family's four children. But the Wexners weren't satisfied with the painting – upset about Abigail's expression and the children's ages and sizes – and refused to pay.
The artist, Nelson Shanks, sued over payment in 2002. The case was settled and dismissed in 2003.
The Enquirer reached out to Wexner for comment. A person close to the matter said Wexner has no knowledge of the situation Farmer referenced.
A Franklin County Sheriff's Office spokesman said nothing was reported at the time, and they would have responded to any claim or complaint. Ohio has a 25-year statute of limitations on rape and a 20-year statute of limitations on other sex crimes.

Texto completo: Bloomberg terminal subscribers gained broad access to Dow Jones & Co. news content on Monday, according to the companies.
Terminal subscribers will be able to access thousands of Dow Jones news articles from sources including Dow Jones Newswires, The Wall Street Journal, Barron's, MarketWatch and WSJ Pro specialty news services for such sectors as central banking and bankruptcy -- as well as News Corp's New York Post.
Dow Jones, publisher of the newswires and The Wall Street Journal, is a unit of News Corp.
Representatives for the companies declined to comment about any financial terms of the arrangement.
"This agreement will significantly extend the reach and impact of Dow Jones' trusted, high-quality journalism, enabling us to reach a larger total audience," said Chris Lloyd, head of Dow Jones's professional information business.
Dow Jones has been looking for different ways to grow its digital subscriber base and broaden its audience. In March, The Wall Street Journal said it would join with Apple Inc.'s Apple News+ news service, which charges $9.99-a-month, in an effort to draw in new readers and paying subscribers without undercutting the publication's core business.
Apple said it would give media partners a portion of the monthly fees based on readership of their stories.
Under the agreement, the Bloomberg Terminal aggregates Dow Jones content at no extra charge alongside Bloomberg's editorial content and stories from the New York Times, Washington Post and other news sources.
Bloomberg Terminal, which offers a single subscription for $22,000 a year, reaches some 325,000 users.
News content is part of the subscription, said a Bloomberg spokesman, who added that Dow Jones content has been one of the big missing outlets in its offering.
Bloomberg has looked for ways to expand what it offers through its platform.
"Our product delivers far more than content aggregation and Bloomberg subscribers will enjoy a fully integrated experience," said Jean-Paul Zammit, Bloomberg's global head of financial products, in an internal memo to employees.

"Books are the plane, and the train, and the road. They are the destination, and the journey. They are home."
-- Anna Quindlen , author and Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist
______
As with so many industries, literature and the world of books have long been an old boys' club -- and in many ways, not much has changed.
The author Kamila Shamsie said, in an often-cited piece for The Guardian from 2015, that gender imbalance exists "in terms of reviews, top positions in publishing houses, literary prizes."
Shamsie pointed out that the Man Booker Prize (named after a man named Man; insert joke here), one of the world's most prestigious literary awards, was skewed by the titles submitted for consideration by publishers: less than 40 percent in the years prior had been by women, she found. Male writers are also much more likely to recommend books by other men than those by women.
This year, the Emilia Report -- which examined the gender gap for authors and is named after Emilia Bassano, one of the first professional female writers in Shakespearean England -- compared how newspapers covered 10 male and female writers in the same market and found that the men received 56 percent of review coverage.
The gender of the authors is not the sole issue, either. Studies have also found that books about women are less likely to win prizes.
All this, and women authors still often dominate best-seller lists. (We see you, Margaret Atwood.)
I asked women who work at The Times -- and who have had books published, or soon will -- what books they've recently read and why they think you should read them, too. Here are their recommendations.
______
Pamela Paul, editor of The New York Times Book Review whose book "How to Raise a Reader" comes out in September
Recommendation: "Disappearing Earth," by Julia Phillips
This is a very assured and engrossing debut novel that starts off as a thriller, but then turns into a deeper exploration of the lives of women, and the ways in which violence affects women's lives, on the peninsula of Kamchatka. Phillips was a Fulbright scholar in Kamchatka, where she lived for two years immersing herself in the culture and studying the complexities of its people, which include Russians who immigrated from the mainland and several indigenous peoples. You're pulled right in from the opening chapter, which details the terrifying disappearance of two young girls, and then into interwoven stories in which the characters' lives are abruptly or unexpectedly overturned.
______
Taffy Brodesser-Akner, staff writer for The New York Times Magazine whose novel, "Fleishman Is in Trouble," came out in June
Recommendation: "Lady in the Lake," by Laura Lippman
Lippman's new book has so many lively voices in it, so much authentic history, and the story -- a Jewish woman in the 1960s who is having a post-divorce affair with a police officer -- seemed maybe designed with specifically me in mind. Not just because of the sex stuff, but because it's also the story of a woman creating a career for herself in journalism. And the case that propels the plot feels very modern, even as you absolutely feel like you've traveled back in time to read this book.
______
Amy Chozick, writer at large for The New York Times and author of "Chasing Hillary," which is being developed into a TV series
Recommendation: "Daisy Jones and the Six," by Taylor Jenkins Reid
Even if you have zero interest in the 1970s rock scene, the structure of this novel -- a faux documentary with the former members of an iconic rock band -- is so incredibly engrossing.

Honorable mention: For a change of pace, I also read Jessica Knoll's "Luckiest Girl Alive," mostly because I read her interview with The Cut about how she writes her novels with the intention of selling them to screen and making big money. Women are always hesitant to talk about making money and I respected that she was so honest. I also liked that she subverted the female heroine -- a little like "Gone Girl" in reverse.

So many female authors, so little time to read!
______
Jessica Grose, lead editor of New York Times parenting and author of the novel "Soulmates"
Recommendation: "Here Comes the Sun," by Nicole Dennis-Benn
Dennis-Benn is from Jamaica, and her novels give a gorgeous glimpse into the politics and personality of her homeland.
Honorable mention: I devoured "Juliet the Maniac" by Juliet Escoria, which is a lightly fictionalized account of her tumultuous teen years, which included psychiatric hospitalization and getting shipped to a therapeutic boarding school with an untrained staff.
______
What else is happening
Here's a look back at five articles from The Times about women and books that you might have missed.

From the archives, 1907: 'Lit'ry lady'
Women authors appearing on best-seller lists alongside men? "Startling," The New York Times called it in 1907.
Even more than appearing alongside them, successful books by women are beginning to "threaten the supremacy of man in the best-seller class," the article went on.
But that's not necessarily a bad thing, the article said. In fact, these men are even willing to "hobnob" with these women -- namely George Eliot, Jane Austen and Charlotte Brontë -- "now and again."

Texto completo: Long before Donald Trump ran for president, an inside-journalism battle was raging over the ideas of objectivity and balance.
It went like this: Should reporters and editors strive for a kind of neutral evenhandedness, long considered the hallmark of responsible journalism?
Or should they declare their biases up front and let news consumers know where they are coming from, an approach seen by some as more useful and honest?
With Trump dominating politics and media, a third - more important - question arises.
Are journalists going to embrace or abandon their primary job, which is truth-telling?
If they are going to do that job, they must embrace direct language and clear framing of important issues.
Early in Trump's presidency, the question of whether to use the word "lie" arose.
Most mainstream news organizations were wary about it. Some 10,000 false or misleading presidential statements later, many now use it when appropriate - that is, when there is a clear intention to mislead. Which is quite often.
Now the question is the word "racist."
Were Trump's tweets portraying Democratic legislators of color as foreigners merely "racially tinged"? Were they just sprinkled with racially tinted pixie dust?
And should descriptions of what Trump stands for be put only in the mouths of his critics - a step removed from the journalists themselves?
Or should stronger language and sharper focus be used?
It depends on only one thing: whether journalists want to be clear about saying what's right there in front of everyone's eyes and ears.
Not all of this comes down to a single word. Consider, for example, Peter Baker's analytical story that went online Sunday.
No polemicist, the New York Times's chief White House correspondent nonetheless was remarkably direct.
High up in his article, he wrote: "When it comes to race, Mr. Trump plays with fire like no other president in a century." No other modern president, he wrote, "fanned the flames as overtly, relentlessly and even eagerly as Mr. Trump."
It was hard to miss the point.
It was even harder to miss the point in a Los Angeles Times editorial (representing the views of the paper's editorial board), the headline of which was "Trump is Truly America's Bigot-in-Chief" and which used words such as "repugnant" and "disgusting" to describe the president's statements.
Or in CNN's use of "racist rant" in its headlines and on-screen banners.
Others didn't go there.
In general, the network news shows, with their efforts to appeal to everyone, regardless of political affiliation, like to be particularly careful not to offend.
So they used what CNN's Brian Stelter accurately called, in his media newsletter, a "crutch" - for example, on NBC, Kate Snow noted that "many were decrying [the tweet] as racist."
In a New York Times news story (not an analysis like Baker's), reporters wore kid gloves in describing Trump's urging the lawmakers to go back to their countries of origin:
"Wrapped inside that insult, which was widely established as a racist trope, was a factually inaccurate claim: Only one of the lawmakers was born outside the country." Earlier, even less direct language had it that "Democrats slammed" Trump's words as a racist trope; editing changed that for the better.
The Washington Post used language similar to that second (improved) version in some of its news coverage. A Monday article about Republican silence on Trump's attacks used this description: "Insinuating that people of color are foreigners, the president used a trope broadly viewed as racist."
It makes good sense for media organizations to be careful and noninflammatory in their news coverage. That kind of caution continues to be a virtue.
But a crucial part of being careful is being accurate, clear and direct. When confronted with racism and lying, we can't run and hide in the name of neutrality and impartiality. To do that is a dereliction of duty.
Former New York Times reporter and columnist Clyde Haberman, in a Sunday tweet, put it simply and well, describing his own transition:
"Despite decades of evidence that Trump is a racist, I've resisted calling him one because it's polarizing language that's rarely helpful. But his go-back-where-you-came-from harangue tears it for me. He's a bigot, and if GOPers don't call him out, they're complicit."
That goes for the news media, too.
Journalists don't need to see themselves as political advocates when they say obvious things in plain terms. And doing so doesn't make them Democratic operatives as their pro-Trump critics are sure to charge.
It just means they are doing the most fundamental job they have: telling the truth as plainly and directly as possible.

Texto completo: ST. LOUIS - St. Louis Cardinals great Bob Gibson is fighting pancreatic cancer.
The St. Louis Post-Dispatch said the 83-year-old Hall of Famer was diagnosed with the cancer several weeks ago and revealed the news Saturday to the other living Hall of Famers.
Gibson's longtime agent, Dick Zitzmann, told the Post-Dispatch that Gibson has visited The Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore and has been hospitalized in his hometown of Omaha, Neb., for the past two weeks. Zitzmann said chemotherapy is likely to begin Monday in Omaha.
The newspaper said the news became public Saturday night when Hall of Famer Jack Morris, broadcasting a Minnesota Twins game, spoke of it, having received his notification. The Cardinals' front office also was notified.
Gibson was 251-174 with a 2.91 ERA in 17 seasons with the Cardinals from 1959 to 1975. The right-hander led St. Louis to World Series titles in 1964 and 1967, and the National League pennant in 1968. He was 7-2 in nine World Series starts.
Royals trade Bailey to A's
KANSAS CITY, Mo. - The Kansas City Royals are sending Homer Bailey to the Oakland Athletics after scratching the veteran right-hander about 45 minutes before his scheduled start Sunday against Detroit.
In return, Kansas City is getting minor league infielder Kevin Merrell. He's been playing at Double-A Midland and will report to the Royals' affiliate at Northwest Arkansas.
The 33-year-old Bailey has rebounded this season with the Royals after signing a minor league deal in February. He is 7-6 with a 4.80 ERA, but he's been especially good over his past seven starts, giving the A's some additional help as they seek a playoff run in the second half.
GOLF
Goosen wins Bridgestone Senior Players
AKRON, Ohio - Retief Goosen birdied the final two holes to win the Bridgestone Senior Players Championship on Sunday at Firestone Country Club for his first PGA Tour Champions title.
The 50-year-old Hall of Famer from South Africa broke a tie for the lead with a 15-foot putt on the par-4 17th and made a 10-footer on the par-4 18th for a 2-under 68 and a two-stroke victory over 65-year-old Jay Haas and Tim Petrovic.
Wiesberger beats Hebert in Scottish playoff
NORTH BERWICK, Scotland - Bernd Wiesberger beat Benjamin Hebert on the third playoff hole at the Scottish Open on Sunday for his sixth European Tour title.
Hebert shot 62 to set the clubhouse target on 22 under at The Renaissance Club but overnight leader Wiesberger (69) recovered from a slow start to reclaim top spot with his fourth birdie of the day on the 16th, only to bogey the 17th and then hole from five feet on the last to force a playoff. Wiesberger parred the third playoff hole to beat Hebert.
Kim wins Marathon Classic
SYLVANIA, Ohio - Sei Young Kim won the Marathon Classic on Sunday for her second LPGA Tour victory of the season, making five straight birdies in a mid-round burst and shooting a 6-under 66 for a two-stroke victory over Lexi Thompson.
Kim began the birdie run on No. 7 and finished at 22-under 262 at Highland Meadows Golf Club. The 26-year-old South Korean player has nine tour titles, also winning the LPGA MEDIHEAL Championship in May in California.
Romo successfully defends celebrity title
STATELINE, Nev. - Tony Romo completed a wire-to-wire victory Sunday in the American Century Championship for his second straight victory in the celebrity tournament at Edgewood Tahoe Golf Course.
The former Dallas Cowboys and current CBS analyst closed with a 2-over 74 and scored 20 points to finish at 71 in the modified Stableford scoring system. Former pitcher Mark Mulder, the winner from 2015-17, was 10 points back after a 71 and a 24-point day.
FOOTBALL
E. Washington players involved in shooting
SPOKANE, Wash. - Two Eastern Washington University football players were shot in Spokane's downtown bar district. Dehonta Hayes and Keith Moore were hospitalized with non-life threatening injuries after Saturday's shooting.
University officials say the student-athletes are expected to fully recover.
SOCCER
P&G donates $529,000 to women's team
NEW YORK - Procter & Gamble, a sponsor of the U.S. Women's National Soccer Team, is now supporting its members' fight for equal pay.
The company, which supports U.S. soccer through its Secret deodorant brand, says it will donate $529,000 - $23,000 for each of the 23 players on the U.S. team that won the World Cup earlier this month - to help close the pay gap. The sponsor took out a full-page ad printed in The New York Times on Sunday urging the U.S. Soccer Federation to "be on the right side of history."
AUTO RACING
Hamilton wins record 6th British GP
SILVERSTONE, England - Formula One championship leader Lewis Hamilton won a record sixth British Grand Prix on Sunday after jumping ahead of Mercedes teammate Valtteri Bottas by taking advantage of the safety car being deployed.
In front of his home fans, Hamilton made the decisive move to the front in the 20th of the 52 laps by pitting to get new tires. With the safety car still out after Antonio Giovinazzi spun off in his Alfa Romeo, Hamilton rejoined ahead of pole-sitter Bottas. Charles Leclerc of Ferrari completed the podium by finishing third.
Pagenaud wins for 3rd time
TORONTO - Simon Pagenaud won his third race of the season and Alexander Rossi tightened the championship race with Josef Newgarden in IndyCar's Sunday race through the streets of Toronto.
The win on the streets around Exhibition Place is the first for Pagenaud this year away from Indianapolis Motor Speedway. The Frenchman won the Indy 500 and the road course race at the speedway to save his job with Team Penske.

Texto completo: It would seem that the band of young progressives in Congress driving the Democratic Party to the left have struck a chord in American politics.
Our Question of the Week for readers: Is it a symphonic G major, or a flat discord?
Even the Executive Branch Tweeter in Chief seems to be fascinated by the group.
Are especially the members of “The Squad” — the four young women members of Congress President Trump told to “go back” to ancestral home countries over the weekend — creating important new policy discussions that will add oomph to the Democrats’ brand?
Or are they a danger to their party, increasing the chances that Trump will easily be re-elected by an American people worried about radicalism under the banner of “democratic socialism”?
In a recent New York Times interview, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was fairly critical of The Squad, which is made up of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-New York, Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Michigan, Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minnesota and Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Massachusetts.
The irony of course is that Pelosi has long been viewed by many Americans as a stalwart liberal from elitist San Francisco. If she is instead the leader of the moderate wing of the Democratic Party, does that mean the center cannot hold?
The four were the only Democrats to vote against the House version of a border funding bill backed by Pelosi. The speaker angrily said they had supporters in “their Twitter world” but not on Capitol Hill.
But after the racially tinged tweets from the president, Pelosi spoke out in support of her junior colleagues.
Some note that The Squad and other newly elected House Democrats are really more representative through their youth of the Millennial generation than of their ethnic backgrounds.
Will they energize young people who haven’t been involved in the political process before? Will they bring to the polls some minority voters who stayed out of the Hillary Clinton-Trump election in 2016?

"Let's take this moment of celebration to propel women's sports forward," Secret says in the ad. "We urge the US Soccer Federation to be a beacon of strength and end gender pay inequality once and for all."
In March, 28 members of the USWNT filed a gender discrimination lawsuit against the U.S. Soccer Federation. The suit claims the federation pays the women less than members of the men's national team.
INDYCAR
Pagenaud triumphs in Toronto
Simon Pagenaud won his third race of the season and Alexander Rossi tightened the championship race with Josef Newgarden in IndyCar's race through the streets of Toronto.
The win on the streets around Exhibition Place is the first for Pagenaud this year away from Indianapolis Motor Speedway.The Frenchman won the Indy 500 and the road course race at the speedway to save his job with Team Penske.
Pagenaud had to save fuel in the waning laps to hold off reigning series champion Scott Dixon. But Penske teammate Will Power caused a caution on the final lap and Pagenaud was able to coast to the finish in his Chevrolet.
Rossi finished third, one spot ahead of IndyCar points leader Newgarden. The two began the race separated by just seven points and Rossi cut the deficit to four points.
Robert Wickens drove the parade lap in a car equipped with hand controls that allowed the Canadian to drive for the first time since he suffered a spinal cord injury in a crash last August.
FORMULA ONE
Hamilton edges teammate Bottas
Formula One championship leader Lewis Hamilton won a record sixth British Grand Prix after jumping ahead of Mercedes teammate
Valtteri Bottas by taking advantage of the safety car being deployed in Silverstone, England.
In front of his home fans, Hamilton made the decisive move to the front in the 20th of the 52 laps by pitting to get new tires. With the safety car still out after Antonio Giovinazzi spun off in his Alfa Romeo, Hamilton rejoined ahead of pole-sitter Bottas.
"The safety car came out and it was perfect timing," Hamilton said.
"It was maybe not my luckiest day," Bottas said after falling 39 points behind Hamilton in the championship standings. "But that's life."
It was an 80th career win for Hamilton, of which seven have come in the 10 races this season.
"Today was one of the best days I can remember having," Hamilton said. "I have done so many races you would think I would get used to it or the feeling would numb down but it feels as amazing as the first win (at Silverstone in 2008)."
CRICKET
England wins first World Cup
England won the Cricket World Cup for the first time in extraordinary circumstances in England, beating New Zealand by a tiebreaker of boundaries scored after the match was tied after regulation play and then the first Super Over in the tournament's history.
England wicketkeeper Jos Buttler ran out Martin Guptill off the last ball of the Super Over as the New Zealand opener scrambled back for a second run that would have earned the Black Caps also their first world title.
Both teams scored 241 after the regulation 50 overs per side, with England hitting 14 off the last over including a six made up of two runs followed by an accidental four deflected off the bat of the diving Ben Stokes to tie New Zealand's 241-8.
That meant the World Cup's first ever Super Over, which fans watched with hands around their heads and with a rule explainer required on the big screens inside the home of cricket.
ODDS AND ENDS
Brandon Clarke made a dunk with 10.7 seconds left in overtime and the Memphis Grizzlies beat the New Orleans Pelicans 88-86 in the NBA Summer League semifinals in Las Vegas. The Grizzlies will face the Minnesota Timberwolves, who beat the Brooklyn Nets 85-77 in the second semifinal. .... RyanLeaf was hired by ESPN to be a college football analyst, another step in the remarkable comeback of the former Washington State star who has battled drug addiction and served time in prison. Leaf will mostly call games on ESPN2 and ESPNU.

Texto completo: Three years ago, a foul-smelling blue-green algae bloom so thick it looked like guacamole shut down the beaches of Martin County over the Fourth of July. Last year, blue-green algae blooms again popped up in Lake Okeechobee and the rivers connected to it. This year, there are small blue-green algae blooms appearing in the waters of Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota counties.
It could be worse. A blue-green algae bloom in the northern Gulf of Mexico spurred Mississippi authorities to close all 21 of their beaches recently. In 2014, a blue-green algae bloom in Lake Erie meant 500,000 people were without a source of drinking water.
What is blue-green algae, why does it keep appearing and what does that mean for your health? Here are some answers.
1. It's not really an algae. Unlike Red Tide algae, blue-green algae are actually microscopic cyanobacteria that contain chlorophyll similar to true algae. They reproduce rapidly, just like algae when it blooms. They are typically found at or near the surface of the water, just like algae blooms. And they are known to produce toxins, just like what scientists call "harmful algae blooms." They are believed to represent the earliest known form of life on the earth.
2. It can show up in either fresh or salt water. The blue-green algae bloom shutting down Mississippi's beaches is growing in saltwater. The blue-green algae that has plagued both Lake Okeechobee and the Great Lakes thrives in freshwater. Ironically, a study by the U.S. Geological Survey last fall found that when the Lake Okeechobee algae traveled through the St. Lucie River to the Atlantic Ocean, the saltwater damaged its cell walls, releasing its toxins.
3. Those toxins are bad for humans. The Florida Department of Health says keep away from the algae blooms: "In high amounts, cyanobacteria toxins can affect the liver, nervous system and skin. Abdominal cramps, nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting may occur if untreated water is swallowed. Some people who are sensitive to the algae may develop a rash or respiratory irritation. If you come into contact with an algae bloom, wash with soap and water right away. If you experience an illness, please contact your healthcare provider." There could be long-term effects of exposure, too. Earlier this year, University of Miami scientists found that dolphins that had come into contact with blue-green algae toxins displayed degenerative brain damage similar to Alzheimer's, Lou Gehrig's disease and Parkinson's in humans.
4. These blooms are not new, but their frequency is. The first freshwater blue-green algae bloom in Lake Okeechobee was reported in 1986, when it suddenly covered more than 100 square miles of the lake's surface, leading to a New York Times headline that said, "Florida fears Lake Okeechobee is dying." Lake Erie started experiencing regular toxic algae blooms in the 1990s, and they've continued to worsen. The 2016 bloom in Lake Okeechobee that spread to both of the state's coasts was so bad that it became a political issue in the U.S. Senate campaign, and it was followed by another bloom last year, and the lake has already shown signs of a new bloom this year. In 2014, the Third National Climate Assessment predicted that climate change would lead to an increase in toxic algae blooms.
5. We can control the fuel for the blooms, if not what stops them. Nutrient pollution from agricultural and urban runoff, as well as from leaky septic tanks and sewer lines, causes the majority of freshwater cyanobacteria blooms, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Other conditions that contribute to blooms are stagnant water, resulting from a lack of natural flushing, and land clearing, which allows more polluted runoff to wash into waterways. Changing climate resulting in warmer ocean temperatures also is a factor for saltwater blooms, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. If the conditions that spur cyanobacteria growth change - for instance the water cools off or the flow of nutrients stops - then the bloom can fade.

Ohio's richest man once close to Epstein

Texto completo: COLUMBUS – Financier Jeffrey Epstein, arrested last week on child sex trafficking charges, was notoriously secretive about his billionaire client list, disclosing just one prominent name over and over: Leslie H. Wexner, CEO of L Brands and Ohio's richest man.
Epstein's recent arrest has brought to light his once-close relationship with Wexner, the billionaire founder and CEO of brands like Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works.
In 1989, Wexner purchased the seven-story Manhattan mansion where Epstein has since been accused of sexually assaulting girls in the 2000s. In 1996, a woman alleges Epstein and his partner sexually assaulted her at Wexner's Ohio mansion, according to a federal court affidavit.
Wexner, through a spokeswoman, said that he severed all ties with Epstein nearly 12 years ago – around the time Epstein faced charges for sex crimes in Florida.
Epstein was convicted in 2008 and served 13 months in county jail as part of a plea deal negotiated by then-U.S. Attorney Andrew Acosta, who announced Friday he would resign from President Donald Trump's administration. That deal has since come under scrutiny for cutting off a larger FBI investigation into Epstein.
Before that time, Wexner played a key role in improving Epstein's prospects as a financier to America's elite. In 2003, Epstein described his relationship with Wexner to Vanity Fair: "People have said it's like we have one brain between two of us: each has a side."
Property and paintings The connections between Wexner and Epstein abound. Wexner, a longtime Republican fundraiser who recently left the party out of frustration with Trump, became Epstein's client in the late 1980s after Epstein left global investment bank, Bear Stearns.
"I think we both possess the skill of seeing patterns," Wexner told Vanity Fair in 2003. "But Jeffrey sees patterns in politics and financial markets, and I see patterns in lifestyle and fashion trends."
In 1989, Wexner purchased the 21,000-square foot Manhattan townhome for $13.2 million – the highest recorded sale for that type of property at the time, according to the New York Times.
But Wexner never lived there. Epstein did.
That's one place where federal investigators say Epstein groped and sexually assaulted girls after he recruited them to massage him while nude or partially nude. Other alleged assaults occurred at Epstein's Palm Beach, Florida, residence. Some of the girls were as young as 14 years old.
Wexner no longer owns the Manhattan home; it was transferred to a trust that Epstein controls in 2011, according to a New York Times report.
Epstein played an important role in the development of New Albany, a city just east of Columbus where the Wexners reside in their Georgian-inspired estate, in the 1990s. At one point, Epstein owned a "grand house" nearby, according to a 2002 New York Magazine article.
In 2000, Epstein commissioned a $339,000 family portrait of Wexner's wife, Abigail, and the family's four children. But the Wexners weren't satisfied with the painting – upset about Abigail's expression and the children's ages and sizes – and refused to pay.
The artist, Nelson Shanks, sued over payment in 2002. The case was settled and dismissed in 2003.
Even though the Wexners severed ties more than a decade ago, Epstein's companies made $46 million in donations to Wexner's YLK Charitable Fund in 2008 – an apparent bid to get back into the family's good graces, according to tax records first reported by CNBC.
'My life was ruined' It was at the Wexner's Ohio home where Maria Farmer, of Paducah, Kentucky, accused Epstein and his partner Ghislaine Maxwell of sexually assaulting her during the summer of 1996, according to an affidavit filed in federal court.
Farmer first met Epstein and Maxwell in 1995 at an art show when she was in her mid-20s. Epstein told Farmer that if she sold him a painting at half price, he would help her with her career. Farmer later took a job with Epstein, helping him to acquire art.
Epstein later arranged for Farmer to work on a special art project at Wexner's Ohio mansion during the summer of 1996. She stayed at the property with her two younger brothers.
One day, Epstein and Maxwell visited Wexner's mansion, asked Farmer to come into a bedroom and sexually assaulted her, according to the affidavit.
"I fled from the room and called the sheriff's office but did not get any response," Farmer wrote in the affidavit. "The Wexner's security staff refused to let me leave the property."
Farmer alleges she was held against her will for 12 hours until she was ultimately allowed to leave with her father, who drove up from Kentucky to help her. When Farmer returned to New York City, she reported the assault to local police and the FBI but no charges were filed.
After that summer, Farmer says Epstein and Maxwell threatened her and cut off her access to art clients. "Maxwell and Epstein worked in concert to make sure that my career and my life was ruined," she wrote.
The Enquirer reached out to Wexner for comment. A person close to the matter said Wexner has no knowledge of the situation Farmer referenced.
A Franklin County Sheriff's Office spokesman said nothing was reported at the time, and they would have responded to any claim or complaint. Ohio has a 25-year statute of limitations on rape and a 20-year statute of limitations on other sex crimes.

Disorder Rises in de Blasio's New York

Texto completo: New York -- The mayor of this city occupies one of the most vital law-enforcement jobs in America. He commands the nation's largest police force, with three times as many officers as the Federal Bureau of Investigation has special agents, in the world's pre-eminent urban center. He therefore needs to be a voice of reasoned leadership about the balance between individual liberty and security in the city's five boroughs.
Five and a half years into the job, Bill de Blasio refuses to embrace the duty to secure and defend the city's millions of residents, commuters and visitors. As he did as a candidate, the mayor denies the legitimacy of the justice system -- the only place individuals and communities can turn when they are harmed by criminals.
He propagates the smear that the majority-minority NYPD unjustifiably targets minorities when conducting street investigations. He knows there is nothing racially proportionate about reported violent crimes in the city, which in the busiest precincts affect only minorities. His posturing and gamesmanship provide fuel for the worst kind of conspiracy theories and hate speech against officers. Never has a mayor been more disdained by his police.
His factionalist, unserious approach to public safety might have paved the way for the ascent into the Queens district attorney's office of a defense lawyer, Tiffany Caban, who insists that the cause of crime and disorder in the city is the criminal-justice system. Her 20-point platform did not mention victims, violence, community decay, punishment or even guns. Instead, she vowed to keep as many offenders as possible free -- even some of the most serious recidivists. There are exceptions: she pledges to prosecute landlords who fail to provide heat, business owners who don't pay employees -- and cops. At last count she trailed Borough President Melinda Katz by only 16 votes in the primary, with a recount under way. Only 10% of registered Democrats voted.
This impulse to explain away and excuse crimes is not, as elected activists such as Mr. de Blasio often claim, limited to minor offenses against the quality of life. Philadelphia's District Attorney Larry Krasner, whom Ms. Caban has called her role model, has been under fire for his lax and lenient handling of gun cases -- even as homicide is spiking in his city. When a man robbing a store shot the owner in the groin with an AK-47 rifle, Mr. Krasner's sentencing offer was 3 1/2 years, though the victim, who was forced to shutter his business, will suffer a lifetime of trauma. In response, federal prosecutors brought their own firearms charges against the shooter.
With violent crime on the decline for decades, many New Yorkers take their safety for granted. Yet many city residents and businesses, especially outside Manhattan, tell of disorder in the streets. Neighborhoods are immersed in graffiti (or what the New York Times calls "street art"), and noise complaints are common. The city's response to graffiti is to spend millions of tax dollars to remove it, while the vandals aren't prosecuted, encouraging them to keep on tagging.
Subway fare evasion has become widespread, even fashionable. Some see it as a form of rebellion. Petty theft like stolen package deliveries is rampant. Crimes of all sorts go unreported. A cohort of elected officials seem to believe, even if they don't say it, that shoplifting is a mere settling of scores, especially if the victim is an accursed big-box or high-end store.
Doubtless the criminal justice system needs dramatic reform. But sensibly rewiring such a large system requires getting beyond slogans and screeds. It calls for community engagement and truth-telling. Promising new technologies to track and monitor offenders can be used so fewer lawbreakers are exposed to a debilitating and potentially ruinous stint behind bars. Civil penalties can be used to correct and deter offenders, with ramp-ups for repeat offenders. Still, some very bad people commit very bad crimes, and no one has suggested an alternative to incarcerating them in a secure setting.
Elected officials must level with people about the consequences of criminal-justice reforms. The NYPD reports that calls about emotionally disturbed people have nearly doubled in the past decade, presumably because fewer people are under justice-system supervision. It is simply not true, as New Yorkers who traverse the city every day know well, that someone discharged from jail or prison will dependably show up and keep showing up for psychiatric care. Many will end up sleeping in parks, in subways and on sidewalks. Some will cause harm to others.
New York is not alone in seeing a breakdown in public safety. Particularly on the West Coast -- all over California, in Seattle and in Portland, Ore. -- residents are perplexed, angry and leaving as attentiveness to quality-of-life issues wanes, and "police" becomes a pejorative. San Francisco lost a 15,000-person medical conference last year because organizers didn't want conventioneers to navigate streets where human waste is a health hazard.
What is most notable is that safety is an absolute prerequisite to the lives of many of the most vocal who have commandeered the conversation, and who demand that others settle for insecurity. "Safety for me, but not for thee" is the battle cry of many of these self-congratulatory visionaries.
New York has been dubbed "the world's largest gated community." Those inside the gates have doormen, elaborate security systems, underground parking, and unlimited Uber and taxi trips. Those on the outside must navigate commercial streets that shutter promptly at sundown, ride the subway late at night, feel defenseless when someone makes a noise on a fire escape or bangs on their apartment door, or shepherd their kids through open-air drug markets. They find their concerns are readily dismissed.
The big question in all this is: How did criminal-justice reform become synonymous with the silencing of victims and communities?

Texto completo: The first time I ever went to a Dean & DeLuca, I did not know what harissa was. I was in college. I had never heard of a hen of the woods mushroom. I had no idea that salt could cost $40.
I remember walking through the Georgetown market, in its historic brick building, and looking at all the cheeses and smoked fish and exciting ingredients - not that I even knew what to do with half of them, at the time. I remember marveling: This is where fancy people buy their groceries. I think I bought one of the prepared salads, displayed behind glass in ceramic bowls. For less than $20, Dean & DeLuca made me feel like I could be a fancy person, too.
So that's why, when the New York Times reported on Wednesday that the specialty grocer was in grave financial trouble, fancy and non-fancy people alike were distraught. The future is uncertain for its remaining U.S. stores, in New York, the District and Honolulu. Even Dean & DeLuca Stage, a high-design cafe concept that opened only a few months ago in New York, has closed, the Times reported.
Giorgio DeLuca and Joel Dean opened the first Dean & DeLuca in 1977 in New York's SoHo neighborhood, and it went on to change how Americans shopped for specialty food. Many of its imported and precious ingredients, at the time rare and perhaps experimental, have grown up to become household names. The minimalist decor of open wire shelving - then an innovation - is a standard cool look for retail of all types now. The appeal of Dean & DeLuca has always been its European quality, presented with American excess.
"The store is stocked for a food fancier's 'what if' games," wrote Phyllis Richman for The Post in 1979. "What if you could choose from 40 French goat cheeses? Five kinds of dried mushrooms in bulk? A dozen different clam and oyster knives? Fresh truffles and fresh quail eggs and fresh mayonnaise and fresh plums in winter and Russian pashka when it is not even Easter?"
Dean & DeLuca claimed to be the first store in the United States to sell radicchio, balsamic vinegar and sun-dried tomatoes. It earned the nickname "The Museum of Fine Food." The company's immaculate displays and overflowing cases of prepared food have gone on to influence mainstream grocers.
Dean & DeLuca's style became "the basics of where other high-end retailers would end up going," said Phil Kafarakis, president of the Specialty Food Association. "When you see the Wegmans format today, if you've ever been to Publix, those grocers, I think, would tell you that they emulated some of that early in the day."
The store was also known for its impeccable customer service.
"The people who served you behind those cases were extremely knowledgeable. Today, most of that information comes from an app," Kafarakis said. "These guys, back then, it was on the top of their head - they immediately told you the story of where the product came from, they'd give you a little taste. There was a whole romance."
As it was for me, the grocer became many people's gateway to fine food and fancy ingredients. Shortly after the Washington store opened in 1993 - the brand's first outside New York - Chris Carter was working at his first job on Capitol Hill. He recalled via Twitter message that his girlfriend at the time had heard about Dean & DeLuca and was eager to try it. So one night, before they headed to a concert in Virginia, he "spent like 1/4 of my monthly take home pay (about $100) on a picnic dinner for a night at Wolf Trap for us - olives, fruit, cheese, deli meats and spreads and bread."
"I felt like this was one of my first real grown-up meals and dates," said Carter, now 53 and a lobbyist for Lehigh University. "I remember thinking, why don't I eat like this every day? "
Other customers recalled their favorite things about the store. A French expat would go there for a taste of home. It was, for one woman, the only place to find Aleppo pepper - "years before [London restaurateur and cookbook author Yotam] Ottolenghi made it a pantry 'staple.' " There were the fancy mac and cheese, the chocolate eggs, the rainbow of salads. The kitchen tools that lasted decades.
The company became a beloved pop culture touchstone, too. On "Felicity," the title character, played by Keri Russell, worked at Dean & DeLuca as a barista while attending the fictional "University of New York" (though she often spent her working hours flirting with her crush, Ben). The 1993 film "The Night We Never Met" features Matthew Broderick as a Dean & DeLuca cheese counter employee. It was also a good place for celebrity spotting - both in New York and Washington. In the early days of the SoHo store, you might run into the artist Donald Judd, but as the neighborhood changed, such actors as Meg Ryan and Sarah Jessica Parker shopped there. Plenty of people have experienced the random Dean & DeLuca celebrity sighting, whether it was Dave Chappelle or Julian Schnabel or Owen Wilson.
But the company, which was bought by Thailand-based Pace Development in 2014 for $140 million, has had its missteps. At the time of Pace's acquisition, there were 42 stores - but according to the New York Post, by 2018 that number dwindled to 18 as the company faced lawsuits from suppliers who claimed they were stiffed. The company abandoned sponsorship deals and withdrew from several of its leases.
On Thursday morning, the Georgetown Dean & DeLuca was a shadow of its former self. Cheese cases were half-full, and the charcuterie case had only seven options where there was once a bounty. Half of the prepared foods case, once brimming with salads and fish made in house, was bare. Three chicken pot pies remained in the freezer case, and exactly 12 jars of $29 Luxardo cherries were on a shelf. There were only five baguettes, one sourdough boule and three jars of $30 white truffle sea salt. Other assorted products had been pushed to the front of the shelves: A few bottles of Runamok Maple Syrup. A single gold-wrapped bottle of Anfosso olive oil, imported from Italy. Twenty boxes of imported French Le Puy lentils, for $14 apiece. There were signs around the store that read: "Please pardon our appearance as we prepare for renovations."
There were still pastries from Baltimore-based Patisserie Poupon in the cases, but the company owes about $10,000, owner Joseph Poupon said. "We've been doing business with them for over 20 years," said Poupon, who said he has "kind of given up" on getting the past-due money and now requires payment upon delivery for any products Dean & DeLuca orders. "If we could get something, it would be great. We're a small company."
Perhaps in an attempt to make the shelves seem more full, out-of-season products were stocked - or maybe the company was just hoping that people would buy leftover chocolate Easter eggs and holiday turkey brine in July. Nothing was on sale. I tried to order a ham and brie sandwich but was politely informed that the store had no brie. When a Dean & DeLuca runs out of brie, you know things are really bad.
An employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media, said the store was not going to close. When asked about the bare shelves, he gave this reporter a pained look. "We're having challenges," he said.

Texto completo: New York
The mayor of this city occupies one of the most vital law-enforcement jobs in America. He commands the nation's largest police force, with three times as many officers as the Federal Bureau of Investigation has special agents, in the world's pre-eminent urban center. He therefore needs to be a voice of reasoned leadership about the balance between individual liberty and security in the city's five boroughs.
Five and a half years into the job, Bill de Blasio refuses to embrace the duty to secure and defend the city's millions of residents, commuters and visitors. As he did as a candidate, the mayor denies the legitimacy of the justice system—the only place individuals and communities can turn when they are harmed by criminals.
He propagates the smear that the majority-minority NYPD unjustifiably targets minorities when conducting street investigations. He knows there is nothing racially proportionate about reported violent crimes in the city, which in the busiest precincts affect only minorities. His posturing and gamesmanship provide fuel for the worst kind of conspiracy theories and hate speech against officers. Never has a mayor been more disdained by his police.
His factionalist, unserious approach to public safety might have paved the way for the ascent into the Queens district attorney's office of a defense lawyer, Tiffany Cabán, who insists that the cause of crime and disorder in the city is the criminal-justice system. Her 20-point platform did not mention victims, violence, community decay, punishment or even guns. Instead, she vowed to keep as many offenders as possible free—even some of the most serious recidivists. There are exceptions: she pledges to prosecute landlords who fail to provide heat, business owners who don't pay employees—and cops. At last count she trailed Borough President Melinda Katz by only 16 votes in the primary, with a recount under way. Only 10% of registered Democrats voted.
This impulse to explain away and excuse crimes is not, as elected activists such as Mr. de Blasio often claim, limited to minor offenses against the quality of life. Philadelphia's District Attorney Larry Krasner, whom Ms. Cabán has called her role model, has been under fire for his lax and lenient handling of gun cases—even as homicide is spiking in his city. When a man robbing a store shot the owner in the groin with an AK-47 rifle, Mr. Krasner's sentencing offer was 3½ years, though the victim, who was forced to shutter his business, will suffer a lifetime of trauma. In response, federal prosecutors brought their own firearms charges against the shooter.
With violent crime on the decline for decades, many New Yorkers take their safety for granted. Yet many city residents and businesses, especially outside Manhattan, tell of disorder in the streets. Neighborhoods are immersed in graffiti (or what the New York Times calls "street art"), and noise complaints are common. The city's response to graffiti is to spend millions of tax dollars to remove it, while the vandals aren't prosecuted, encouraging them to keep on tagging.
Subway fare evasion has become widespread, even fashionable. Some see it as a form of rebellion. Petty theft like stolen package deliveries is rampant. Crimes of all sorts go unreported. A cohort of elected officials seem to believe, even if they don't say it, that shoplifting is a mere settling of scores, especially if the victim is an accursed big-box or high-end store.
Doubtless the criminal justice system needs dramatic reform. But sensibly rewiring such a large system requires getting beyond slogans and screeds. It calls for community engagement and truth-telling. Promising new technologies to track and monitor offenders can be used so fewer lawbreakers are exposed to a debilitating and potentially ruinous stint behind bars. Civil penalties can be used to correct and deter offenders, with ramp-ups for repeat offenders. Still, some very bad people commit very bad crimes, and no one has suggested an alternative to incarcerating them in a secure setting.
Elected officials must level with people about the consequences of criminal-justice reforms. The NYPD reports that calls about emotionally disturbed people have nearly doubled in the past decade, presumably because fewer people are under justice-system supervision. It is simply not true, as New Yorkers who traverse the city every day know well, that someone discharged from jail or prison will dependably show up and keep showing up for psychiatric care. Many will end up sleeping in parks, in subways and on sidewalks. Some will cause harm to others.
New York is not alone in seeing a breakdown in public safety. Particularly on the West Coast—all over California, in Seattle and in Portland, Ore.—residents are perplexed, angry and leaving as attentiveness to quality-of-life issues wanes, and "police" becomes a pejorative. San Francisco lost a 15,000-person medical conference last year because organizers didn't want conventioneers to navigate streets where human waste is a health hazard.
What is most notable is that safety is an absolute prerequisite to the lives of many of the most vocal who have commandeered the conversation, and who demand that others settle for insecurity. "Safety for me, but not for thee" is the battle cry of many of these self-congratulatory visionaries.
New York has been dubbed "the world's largest gated community." Those inside the gates have doormen, elaborate security systems, underground parking, and unlimited Uber and taxi trips. Those on the outside must navigate commercial streets that shutter promptly at sundown, ride the subway late at night, feel defenseless when someone makes a noise on a fire escape or bangs on their apartment door, or shepherd their kids through open-air drug markets. They find their concerns are readily dismissed.
The big question in all this is: How did criminal-justice reform become synonymous with the silencing of victims and communities?

Texto completo: The sidewalks outside the Santa Fe Bridge filled with protesters chanting, "Free the children now," as they marched up El Paso Street toward Cleveland Square Park in Downtown on Friday.
Protester Yvonne Nieves said dehumanizing conditions that children faced in the U.S. Customs and Border Protection facility in Clint, Texas, led her to demonstrate.
"It seems like bringing attention to the situation helps, so that it stops," she said.
The demonstration was one of more than 700 planned around the world to protest the treatment of immigrants in detention centers, organizers said. Lights for Liberty planned the vigils with local organizers, including the El Paso Coalition to End Child Detention, the Border Network for Human Rights, the ACLU of Texas, Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center and the Hope Border Institute.
Nieves said she first started protesting at the facility in Tornillo, Texas, adding she has become a more active protester since then because she believes it brings attention to the conditions in the detention centers.
Nieves said she has been attending candlelight vigils at the Clint facility on Monday nights and she noticed the attention the situation received when the El Paso Times and New York Times collaborated on a report about it.
Marisa Limón of the Hope Border Institute said reports on the Clint site sparked global concern over the immigration situation.
"That really signaled the alarm and, I think on a national level, kind of woke people up, and it's made people more conscious," she said. "So, in that consciousness, really, the public had asked, 'How can we respond? What can we do? How can we stand up?' "
After the march arrived at Cleveland Square Park, there were several speakers and a candlelight vigil for migrants in detention camps.
Dr. Nanette Nuessle, a pediatrician, traveled from Las Vegas, New Mexico, to attend the vigil. She said she has been trying to get a job working in one of the detention centers in San Antonio for about a year.
"It's like any other time you work with kids that you know aren't getting the right care — except for this time I can't call child services," Nuessle said. "Our hands are tied. We cannot get child services in there to make a report. They're being blocked from going in, just like the reporters are being blocked from going in."
She said she thinks the conditions children are being held in are appalling, including being inappropriately touched and abused, caring for other children, and being told they can't hug one another, as well as not being given blankets, clean diapers or medical clearance by physicians.
At the vigil, an accredited immigration representative from San Diego, California, Luis Guerra, took the stage to tell the story of a woman in detention.
He said after the judge decided she would spend one more month in detention at her final hearing, she screamed and said, "I want to be deported now."
Guerra said her story was similar to "the stories of thousands and thousands of individuals that have to endure government-sponsored torture to be able to win their asylum cases."
He said people shouldn't have to work so hard to get asylum, that it should be clear in the laws, but it's much different in practice.
'Asylum is like winning the lottery' "I usually explain this to individuals south of the border that asylum is like winning the lottery, and that is not right," Guerra said.
He said there has been a call for more resources in El Paso, and with the Migrant Protection Protocols, known as the "Remain in Mexico" policy, the number of people in need of help has skyrocketed.
"I come from an immigrant family, Mexican-American, and I acknowledge the privileges I had awarded to me and believe that I need to use those privileges to help other individuals that didn't have that opportunity," Guerra said. "I don't think that our country is going in the right direction and believe that we can do better."
Protester Melissa Teausant said she traveled from Seattle because she needed to see the migrant camps for herself.
She said that seeing the images on TV or online isn't enough: People need to go places and see things for themselves, so they can take action.
"Once you see it and then you turn your back on it, that's on you," she said.

Texto completo: NEW YORK - Jim Bouton, the irreverent Yankee who died at 80 Wednesday after a long battle with cerebral amyloid angiopathy, was a man of many layers. Criticized and ostracized by many of his former teammates after penning his seminal 1970 tell-all baseball book "Ball Four," he was also a tireless crusader for ballplayers' rights, an amateur painter, a political activist who joined a group of 65 (mostly African American) athletes voicing support of a boycott of the 1964 Olympic games in Mexico City, and a savvy business entrepreneur.
Most of all, however, Bouton was a hopeless baseball romantic who could never quite let go of his dream to keep pitching in the big leagues, and, in later life, embarked on a mission to save historic 85-year old Wahconah Park in Pittsfield, Mass.
The right-handed Bouton signed with the Yankees as an amateur free agent in December 1958, and with an already-established blazing fastball and curve, moved quickly through their farm system before arriving in the majors as a 21-year old rookie in 1962. The following year, he was second behind Whitey Ford in victories for the Yankees, with a 21-7 record and 2.53 ERA, and was named to the American League All-Star team.
Flush with instant success, Bouton held out that winter for a $20,000 raise and quickly ran afoul of Yankee general manager Ralph Houk, who'd been his manager in '63. It was the first of many acrimonious contract negotiations Bouton had with the stern, old school "major" who'd been a combat hero in World War II and didn't cotton to his young pitcher's brash and irreverent nature.
"Bouton and I didn't get along," Houk told me in a 2002 interview. "He was only for himself. He was the one guy I had who wasn't a team player."
Nicknamed "The Bulldog" for his pugnacious manner on the mound - he'd throw so hard his cap often fell off his head. Bouton followed up his 21-win '63 season with an 18-13 mark in '64 and won two games against the Cardinals in the World Series.
Unfortunately for him, that proved to be the highlight of his baseball career. In '65 he developed a sore arm, going 4-15 with a 4.82 ERA, and never again regained the velocity in his fastball. He remained with the Yankees, pitching mostly out of the bullpen, until being traded to the expansion Seattle Pilots in August of 1969. His final record for barely 10 years in the majors was 62-63 with a 3.57 ERA.
It was while with the Pilots, Bouton decided to write a diary, modeled after a similar literary effort "The Long Season" by Cincinnati Reds reliever Jim Brosnan in 1960. Originally, Bouton had intended the diary to be a chronicle of his struggles to stay in the majors with an expansion team full of misfits by developing a knuckleball. But he couldn't help venturing back to his Yankee days with tales out of school about his teammates' boozing, pill popping and womanizing that shocked the baseball world and got him on the best-seller list along with a very public reprimand from Commissioner Bowie Kuhn.
Much as Bouton later insisted "Ball Four" was really a tame book in comparison to some of the outrageous books written today, it was fair to say the Yankee management and his Yankee teammates did not appreciate tales like Mantle slamming the team bus window on kids seeking autographs and leading voyeurism missions with a telescope atop the Shoreham Hotel in Washington. As punishment for his tome, Bouton became a pariah around Yankee Stadium, never invited back to Old-Timers' Day until 1998 after his son, Michael, wrote an impassioned letter in the New York Times pleading with Yankee owner George Steinbrenner to end his dad's ban.
But after coming back to the Stadium for the first time in '98 and receiving a huge ovation from the sellout Old-Timers' Day crowd, Bouton managed to antagonize Steinbrenner and the Yankee brass all over again a few years later by harshly criticizing the plan for the new Yankee Stadium that, in his view, was going to remove valuable parkland from a poor neighborhood. "I think former Yankees should not allow Steinbrenner to trash history," Bouton told the Daily News."They should lie down in front of the bulldozers. I'd join them myself although I'm not sure the bulldozers would stop in my case."
In the latter years of his life, Bouton endured tragedy and illness. On August 15, 1997, his daughter, Laurie, was killed in an accident on the Garden State Parkway when the car in back of her rear-ended her at over 60 miles per hour. Exactly five years later, Aug. 15, 2012, Bouton suffered a stroke, robbing him of his ability to speak, read or write the way he used to. "The body knows, you know?" Bouton told Tyler Kepner of the New York Times. A few years later it was revealed he was suffering from dementia. In the few public appearances he made, his second wife, Paula Kurman Bouton, was at his side, helping him with his speech and his memory. She survives him as do his two sons from his first marriage, Michael and David.

Texto completo: It was certainly no slip of the tongue when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi cut a small group of her party's radicals to size. "All these people have the public whatever and their Twitter world," she told the New York Times. "But they didn't have any following. They're four people, and that's how many votes they got."
The issue at hand was the $4.6 billion border bill passed by Congress. The "squad" - Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib and Ayanna Pressley - considered it inadequate for protecting migrant children. Pelosi argued that it was the strongest bill they could get passed.
It was totally predictable that the four would go bananas over this questioning of their real power. Pelosi had stuck a pin in their balloon of self-importance, and with it, the myth of their immense following - outside Twitter, that is.
Speaking in their defense, Hillary Clinton's former spokesman Brian Fallon said, "Those freshman members are breaking through, and they're building a movement, and the more power that movement gains, the more persuasive they will be to Pelosi." OK, Brian, when they have eight members, give us a ring.
But even if their number were to double to eight, the squad would still be a small fraction of the House's 235-member Democratic caucus. Some 30 of the newly-elected Democrats took seats in Republican-leaning districts, which is where the party's "energy" really is. What's the big deal about winning in totally safe Democratic districts?
Of course, every Democratic member has the right to dissent or challenge what he or she sees as party orthodoxy. But Pelosi seems to be drawing the line at posturing considered poisonous to the party's prospects. That would include proposals seen as encouraging illegal immigration and nonstop appeals to ethnic and racial identity.
Still more aggravating are their threats to "primary" Democrats they do not deem to be sufficiently obedient. (For all their obsession with diversity, some of the squad's targets are black and Latino representatives.)
If these women are so unhappy with the Democratic Party, why don't they leave and run for reelection as democratic socialists? But they would never do that. For all their pitching of socialism - whatever they mean by that - they know that they can't win on the democratic socialist line. (Note how Sen. Bernie Sanders routinely slips in and out of Democratic affiliation to ensure that when it's time to vote, there's a D after his name.)
Working against efforts to contain these egos is a branch of the liberal media that inflates the importance of their every mood swing. To these reporters, all the important stuff happens on Twitter, which makes their jobs extremely easy. And if the attention-seeking tweets inflame the folks at Fox News, so much the better. Meanwhile, the hard work of other Democrats goes unnoticed.
Bear in mind that almost all these Democrats qualify as progressives. The characterization of these conflicts as liberals versus conservative moderates is lazy and unsophisticated. Until recently, Republicans portrayed Pelosi as a wild-eyed liberal from San Francisco. Her views have not radically changed.
Democrats have an opportunity in 2020 to bring home independents, never-Trumpers and no-longer-Trumpers. In doing so, they may be forced to choose between these new potential Democratic voters and appeasing some on the radical left.
That may risk another leftist attempt at sabotage similar to the Ralph Nader debacle in 2000. Back then, the left was so dissatisfied with the Democratic candidate - that famous right-winger Al Gore - it sent enough votes to Nader to hand the election to George W. Bush.
Now is the time to tell the furious four to play fair or go pound sand. Stay strong, Speaker Pelosi. American civilization is at stake.

Texto completo: The mayors stressed to the DHS secretary that more resources and support were needed on the border to maintain a steady flow for economic commerce. They also said their communities need to be reimbursed for the expenses local organizations and cities are spending on providing assistance to immigrants.
Acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan met with federal employees in El Paso Thursday and visited a Border Patrol station in nearby Clint where immigrant children have been held, sometimes hungry, sick, and without cots to sleep on.
McAleenan also met with members of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, which includes El Paso Mayor Dee Margo and Las Cruces Mayor Ken Miyagishima, to discuss immigration-related hardships facing their communities.
While in El Paso, McAleenan was scheduled to host a town hall with DHS personnel, tour other U.S. Customs and Border Protection facilities, and meet with volunteers with the DHS Surge Capacity Force — a program that allows DHS to reassign volunteers from the department and other federal agencies to help with situations identified as an emergency by the DHS secretary.
At the town hall, he spoke about interdepartmental cooperation with employees from CBP, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, and the U.S. Coast Guard, according to a DHS news release.
He toured the U.S. Border Patrol's El Paso Station and received a briefing about the El Paso Sector, which covers West Texas and all of New Mexico, and heard about what actions the CBP, which oversees the U.S. Border Patrol, has taken to improve conditions for immigrants and adjust to the changing flow of immigrants.
During his visit to the Clint holding facility, he was to be briefed on the medical services and accommodations provided at the site.
A report by the El Paso Times and the New York Times this weekend detailed allegations of poor conditions in which migrant children were being held at a Border Patrol facility in Clint, as well as the concerns of current and former Border Patrol agents over the conditions.
The Border Patrol previously had given the media a tour of the facility and denied the allegations, while saying the increase in migrant numbers was taxing the system.
Protesters from as far as Washington state joined local activists to object to the conditions in the Clint facility.
Peggy Hinkle of El Paso said she was glad to see people form other communities speak out on the alleged conditions where migrant children were kept.
"It's heartbreaking," she said.
Amy Sommers of Seattle said she came to Clint after reading the El Paso Times-New York Times story.
"I felt like I was going to be sick to my stomach," she said.
Miyagishima: 'It smelled too clean' Members of the United States Conference of Mayors also met in El Paso on Thursday and were able to see border facilities and processes for themselves. They also met with McAleenan. The eight mayors, mostly from border cities, were able to see the Downtown bridge and processing facility, as well as the El Paso Border Patrol Station.
Las Cruces Mayor Ken Miyagishima told the Las Cruces Sun-News on Friday that he went to El Paso seeking a better understanding of the surge this year in families seeking asylum.The explanation he received from a DHS official at the conference was that families with legitimate asylum claims were being aided and exploited by human traffickers.
Miyagishima said he was expecting to receive a tour of the Clint facility, but instead toured a tent facility in El Paso he described as "pretty clean," with ample food and water, as well as showers.
He remarked, however, DHS officials eagerly told the mayors that "we didn't clean this up for you," and yet did not permit the mayors to speak with detainees.
"It smelled too clean," Miyagishima said.
Their experience was much different than that of the agents' who had been working in the facilities months ago. The facilities did not shelter many migrants, the mayors said.
What the mayors did stress to McAleenan was that more resources and support were needed on the border to maintain a steady flow for economic commerce. They also said that they told the DHS secretary that their communities need to be reimbursed for the expenses local organizations and cities are spending on providing assistance to immigrants.
Miyagishima told the Sun-News that Las Cruces has seen decreased numbers of asylum applicants being released in the city by the Border Patrol, but is still assisting an average of 125 per day. The city has been leasing a former U.S. Army Reserve training center as a center for processing and assisting the asylees.
Immigration raids set for Sunday In another immigration-related development, the New York Times reported that migrant raids are set for Sunday in U.S. cities, although federal officials have not disclosed which cities will be affected.
In an emailed statement Thursday, a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesperson said: "Due to law-enforcement sensitivities and the safety and security of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement personnel, the agency will not offer specific details related to enforcement operations. As always, ICE prioritizes the arrest and removal of unlawfully present aliens who pose a threat to national security, public safety and border security. In fact, 90 percent of aliens arrested by ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations component in FY2018 had either a criminal conviction(s), pending criminal charge(s), were an ICE fugitive, or illegally reentered the country after previously being removed. However, all of those in violation of the immigration laws may be subject to immigration arrest, detention and — if found removable by final order — removal from the United States."
Miyagishima said he was unaware of any ICE operations planned in Las Cruces or the region, but said local law enforcement would only assist the agency in the event of an emergency. "They will not be enforcing federal immigration law," he said.
This story includes additional reporting by Algernon D'Ammassa of the Las Cruces Sun-News.
The mayors stressed to the DHS secretary that more resources and support were needed on the border to maintain a steady flow for economic commerce. They also said their communities need to be reimbursed for the expenses local organizations and cities are spending on providing assistance to immigrants.

Texto completo: Who are the best players in the AFC North? As the 2019 NFL season approaches, we have prognosticated the standout players at each position for our All-AFC North team.
This preseason all-division team is a projection on which players will excel this year. The selections are based on previous stats, circumstance and trajectory.
The picks will be revealed by position in a nine-part series. In the fourth installment, we name the All-AFC North tight end:
Browns tight end David Njoku: Njoku could be poised to make another leap this season. The Browns tight end had a career high 56 catches last year, which was second on the team and eighth in the NFL at the position. He's steadily improved since the Browns drafted him 29th overall in the 2017 NFL Draft.
The 6-foot-4, 246 pound pass catcher is athletic with good speed at tight end. He's a key component on a talented Browns offense.
One of the pressing questions in Cleveland this season is if there will be enough footballs to keep all their weapons happy? Odell Beckham Jr. and Jarvis Landry are going to command most of the attention and request for the majority of the footballs thrown there way. But the situation in Cleveland is also beneficial for Njoku. He'll see plenty of single coverage and his cover man will routinely be a linebacker. Njoku is a mismatch for most linebackers.
The Miami product averages 11.6 yards a catch. He's had four touchdowns in each of the last two seasons.
Michaels Dead: Walt Michaels, the former New York Jets coach who retired following the 1982 season after leading the team to the AFC title game, has died. He was 89.
The Jets said that Michaels died Wednesday. The team did not immediately provide a cause or location. The New York Times said Michaels died at a nursing home in Plains, Pennsylvania.
The former Cleveland Browns linebacker was the defensive coordinator of the Jets' Super Bowl-winning team in the 1968 season. He was head coach from 1977-82, going 39-47-1 and making the playoffs in the 1981-82 seasons. The Jets reached the AFC title game after the 1982 season before losing to the Miami Dolphins in a rain-soaked Orange Bowl.
He later coached the New Jersey Generals of the USFL for two years in 1984-85.
"We are very sad to hear about the passing of Walt Michaels. Walt was a great leader who inspired players to take their games to another level," Jets CEO Christopher Johnson said in a statement.
Michaels starred as a fullback and linebacker at Washington and Lee University and was a seventh-round draft pick of the Browns in 1951. He was a five-time Pro Bowl player and helped the Browns reach five NFL title games, winning championships in 1954 and 1955.
Chiefs: Kansas City wide receiver Tyreek Hill's former fiancee has gone to court seeking to prove that he is the father of her newborn twins and to require him to pay child support.
The Kansas City Star reports that Crystal Espinal filed a petition in Johnson County, Kansas, District Court. Her petition also seeks to establish supervised parenting time for Hill.
The Chiefs suspended Hill on April 25 over allegations that his 3-year-old son was abused, which Hill denies. The local district attorney said in June that an investigation was no longer active because he couldn't prove who injured the boy.
Online court records did not indicate that Hill had an attorney in the paternity case. The Chiefs did not immediately return a telephone message early Friday seeking comment.
Browns tight end David Njoku had a career high 56 catches last year, which was second on the team.

It’s time to check NASA’s astronomical spending

Texto completo: For a government website, NASA’s homepage is an exciting place. Americans can read news releases brimming with all sorts of interesting announcements. For example, on June 3, Pennsylvania students had “an opportunity to speak live with a NASA astronaut aboard the International Space Station.” The agency also lets taxpayers know that NASA is pro-small business, and willing to hand out dollars to startups to develop solar panels. But NASA is less than forthcoming about its mounting cost overruns and schedule delays — which are costing taxpayers billions of dollars and jeopardizing future missions. Taxpayers deserve better.
You wouldn’t know it unless you checked it out for yourself, but NASA has a serious spending problem. According to a report released in May by the Government Accountability Office, NASA’s major projects have veered nearly thirty percent over budget, as average launches are typically delayed by over a year. One of the chief culprits behind exploding cost figures is the James Webb Space Telescope, which was originally supposed to cost upward of $3.5 billion and launch by 2011. The latest estimates (but probably not the last) have the telescope launching in 2021 and costing $9.7 billion — a 177 percent increase.
In a 2018 report, NASA’s inspector general pointed out that NASA has a persistent, reckless culture of misplaced optimism, which prevents it from soberly assessing costs on the novel technologies it dreams up. After proposing the project, NASA had to invent 10 technologies in order to even make the JWST viable. In popular discourse, a proposal that precedes available technology is called a “pipe dream” — these are fun to have, but shouldn’t be dependent on the taxpayer’s dollar.
The JWST is not a one-off. The Hubble Space Telescope itself followed a similar fiscal path. NASA’s go-to star searcher was supposed to cost $200 million when it was proposed, but, by the end, costs ballooned to more than $1 billion. In 2008, former NASA science chief Alan Stern warned in a New York Times op-ed that “A CANCER is overtaking our space agency: the routine acquiescence to immense cost increases in projects.”
At the very least, taxpayers can take solace in the fact that these expenditures aren’t that big compared to the rest of federal budget. But, still — NASA’s 2019 budget of $21.5 billion is one of the highest since the Apollo Program (after adjusting for inflation). And its spending is even about to surge “bigly.” The Trump administration is determined to bring the U.S. back to the moon, and, right now, NASA doesn’t have enough funding for that. Depending on the report cited, another voyage to the moon could cost taxpayers anywhere from $53 billion to $86 billion (after adjusting for inflation from initial reports). Again, the mission is delayed — the Space Launch System tasked with bringing humans to the moon is roughly three years behind schedule. Too, it’ll cost double the originally-projected amount. The next trip to the moon seems to be more of a silly competition with China or Russia rather than a quest for scientific knowledge.
Robotic probes exploring new worlds would be a much better idea. Besides, robotic exploration can be done at a fraction of the cost, and without the risk of radiation to astronauts devoid of Earth’s atmospheric protections. Regardless of the future missions that NASA chooses to undertake, the agency should work with lawmakers, watchdogs and independent auditors to ensure that initial budget estimates are not too rosy. For taxpayers’ sake, America’s space agency should stop shooting for the moon and try getting its spending under control.

Epstein decía que no vivía en NY, pero ahora pide cárcel en su “hogar” de Manhattan en caso de sexo con niñas

Texto completo: Cuando en 2011 una jueza ordenó que, como parte del cuestionado acuerdo judicial en Florida, el multimillonario Jeffrey Epstein debía reportarse ante NYPD cada 90 días como “agresor sexual”, la abogada defensora Sandra Musumeci insistió en que no era un “residente de Nueva York” y que su propiedad de siete pisos era una “casa de vacaciones” en la que no tenía planes de quedarse “más de un período de 10 días”.
Pero ahora que fue encarcelado por nuevos cargos de tráfico y abuso de menores, de los que se declaró “no culpable”, Epstein (66) solicitó ayer la opción de esperar el juicio bajo detención domiciliaria en su mansión del Upper East Side.
La medida incluiría cámaras de seguridad, vigilancia con un brazalete en el tobillo, una fianza garantizada por la residencia de $77 millones de dólares y prohibición de vuelo de su jet privado.
La defensa también dijo que se podría nombrar a un “fideicomisario” residente para vigilarlo, y ofreció pagar a guardias armados las 24 horas para evitar que huya , detalla el expediente judicial citado por amNY.
Según la acusación federal, en esa misma casa de siete pisos (9 East 71 St), él abusó de “docenas” de menores de edad en una sala de masajes equipada con juguetes sexuales. También allí, según los documentos judiciales, los agentes encontraron cientos de fotos de chicas desnudas el pasado fin de semana.
Pero los abogados de Epstein, en la nota de fianza presentada el jueves en el tribunal federal de Manhattan, continuaron sosteniendo que los nuevos cargos están prohibidos por un acuerdo de no persecución con las autoridades federales en Florida en 2008, y que la “hipérbole” sensacionalista no debería obstaculizar su derecho a fianza.
“Dejando a un lado la condena popular, las cuestiones legales imperantes se interponen entre el señor Epstein y cualquier posible condena por las acusaciones de conducta de hace 14 a 17 años presentadas en la acusación”, dijeron los abogados Reid Weingarten y Martin Weinberg al juez de distrito de Manhattan, Richard Berman, quien el lunes decidirá si otorga la libertad bajo fianza.
Epstein se encuentra bajo custodia en Manhattan desde el 6 de julio por cargos de que contrató a niñas de 14 años para masajes desnudos que incluyeron contacto sexual en sus hogares de Nueva York y Palm Beach (Florida), entre 2002 y 2005.
Este escándalo por abuso sexual de menores ya salpicó a la Casa Blanca, donde esta mañana renunció el Secretario del Trabajo, Alex Acosta, el único latino en el gabinete de Donald Trump, debido a que fue él quien, siendo fiscal en Miami, negoció el acuerdo con Epstein en 2008.
Ahora Epstein podría ser encarcelado por hasta 45 años , informó The New York Times, destacando su amistad en el pasado con el Príncipe Andrés de Inglaterra, el cineasta Woody Allen y los presidentes Trump y Bill Clinton.

Texto completo: Ex-Redskins QB tells police he hit his wife
SPOKANE, Wash. - Former Super Bowl MVP Mark Rypien recently acknowledged to a Washington state police officer that he struck his wife during a domestic dispute, but his attorney later contended it was in self-defense.
A report by Spokane Officer Todd Brownlee said Rypien acknowledged hitting his wife, Danielle, on June 30. The former Washington Redskins quarterback told police that his wife covered his eyes as he drove and she got the "wind knocked out of her" after he pushed her hands away, The Spokesman-Review reported Thursday.
Later, when Danielle Rypien laid in the grass clutching her stomach and struggling to breath, Mark Rypien reportedly told his wife to "tell the truth."
Rypien, 56, has pleaded not guilty to a charge of domestic violence. He was released from jail without bail, and his next court appearance is July 31.

The magic of Arthur Sze's words

Texto completo: The third annual Taos Writers Conference, hosted by the Society of the Muse of the Southwest, is robust, including a selection of five one-day intensives on Friday (July 12). On Saturday and Sunday (July 13-14) there is a menu of three-hour workshops, with over 20 instructors in various genres including poetry, fiction, playwriting and publishing. Both the professional and the novice are welcome.
But, for fans of the literary arts, the biggest draw just might be the keynote speaker, Arthur Sze, who plans to read from his work Friday (July 12), 7 p.m., at the Harwood Museum of Art, 238 Ledoux Street.
"I'm really delighted and honored to kick off the weekend," expressed Sze. "There is a wonderful community in Northern New Mexico and a wonderful audience."
His first reading from the book "The Willow Wind" (1972) was at the then-Harwood Foundation, so in a sense he is coming around full circle to Taos this weekend.
Chinese-American Sze brings to the conference a wealth of teaching, writing and translating of all things poetry. "He is well regarded in his field," notes SOMOS Executive Director Jan Smith, adding that the conference is designed to make everything people-friendly. "I want to keep it a small intimate conference,," she said. "I want people to experience Taos."
Sze was born in New York City in 1950 and said he came to poetry rather late. The family expected him to go into a math, science or engineering field. Before building his poetical foundation at University of California-Berkeley, Sze was enrolled at MIT where in his sophomore year he fell off of the calculus wagon and veered off into poetry. The math did not speak to him.
The Harwood audience will have the pleasure of hearing Sze read from "Compass Rose," a finalist for the 2015 Pulitzer Prize in poetry. He will also be reading from his latest publication, "Sight Lines."
In Ted Mathy's review of "Compass Rose," he writes, "This is the magic of Sze's poetry. He creates artifacts in which the profusion of each present moment can be felt viscerally if not fully understood, in which 'each fragment is a whole' precisely because 'consciousness is an infinite net/in which each hanging jewel absorbs and reflects/every other.' "
"I can say that I've lived in New Mexico for 47 years and my poems are really grounded in the landscape of Northern New Mexico," Sze said.
Regarding "Sight Lines," The New York Times said, "Arthur Sze employs a wide range of voices -- from lichen on a ceiling to a man behind on his rent -- and his mythic imagination continually evokes how humans are endangering the planet; yet, balancing rigor with passion, he seizes the significant and luminous and transforms these moments into riveting and enduring poetry."
In his 2001 collection of translations, "Silk Dragon," Sze undertook translating classical Chinese from 18 Chinese poets ranging in date from 400 CE to the 1950s. He calls "Silk Dragon" his own "quirky collection." The poets included revered Li Po, Shen Chow, Wen I-to and Tu Mu.
In the poem "Moonlight Night," by beloved poet Tu Fu, Sze translates, "Her hair is damp in the fragrant mist/Her arms are cold in the clear light/When will we lean beside the window/and the moon shine on dried tear?"
Sze's many honors include an Lannan Literary Award, American Book Award and a Western States Book Award for Translation. He has received grants and scholarships from the Guggenheim Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts.
He is professor emeritus of the Institute of American Indian Arts, where he taught creative writing. His residencies include Brown University, Bard College and the Naropa Institute. In 2012, he was elected chancellor of the Academy of American Poets.
One of his former students from the IAIA, Sherwin Bitsui will be heading up a three-hour workshop on Saturday morning called "Storm Patterns."
Taos resident, poet and publisher Andrea Watson will teach one of the five four-hour-long intensives on Friday morning called "Discover Exciting and Innovative Forms in Poetry."
Watson's publishing house, 3:A Taos Press, focuses on poetry that documents life with intelligence and gentleness. In an interview with Muse magazine, Watson said, "We encourage our readers to get close to the difficult -- even different -- issues of life and to emerge exquisitely educated."
In hosting the third annual Taos Writers Conference, which she inaugurated, Smith said she wants to invite all demographics and genres into the literary body of Taos and its greater area. Smith said she sees Taos as being part and parcel of a rich and vibrant literary corridor extending from Denver down into Albuquerque.
Admission to Arthur Sze's keynote address is $20; $16 for SOMOS and Harwood members. The Harwood Museum of Art is located at 238 Ledoux Street.
The SOMOS Bookstore and Salon is at 108 Civic Plaza Drive. For more information on the conference, schedule and fees, call (575) 758-0081 or visit somostaos.org.

The United States of America is much greater than 'just OK'

Texto completo: Maybe President Trump was right that we needed a "Salute to America" last week, because apparently some Americans have lost sight of the greatness of our country. Case in point: To mark Independence Day, The New York Times posted a video op-ed challenging what it called the "mythology" of American greatness. "America may once have been the greatest," the Times video declares, "but today, America, we're just OK."

The video is like a caricature of how conservatives think the left sees America — except it isn't a caricature; it's real. It's a straw man come to life. As evidence we're just OK, the video cites statistics showing that other developed countries, such as Luxembourg, Sweden and Norway, have lower poverty rates or better education and health care outcomes than America. And as for our "kick-ass democracy," the Times says, it's not that big a deal because "a lot of countries have freedoms."

Put aside for a moment all the misleading data the video uses to show America is not so great. The fact is, all the freedom and progress those other countries enjoy today would not be possible without the United States.

The reason that "a lot of countries have freedoms" today is because our Founding Fathers pioneered the principle of popular sovereignty, where governments answer to the people instead of the other way around. At the time of our founding, the rest of the world was ruled by monarchs. Our founders established the first country in human history that was built on an idea — the idea of human liberty.

For most of our history, American democracy was a global outlier. In 1938, on the eve of World War II, there were just 17 democracies. It was not until 1998 — just two decades ago — that there were more democracies than autocracies.

The unprecedented expansion of liberty has produced unprecedented prosperity. Last September, the Brookings Institution reported that "for the first time since agriculture-based civilization began 10,000 years ago, the majority of humankind ... some 3.8 billion people, live in households with enough discretionary expenditure to be considered 'middle class' or 'rich.'"

None of that would be possible without the Pax Americana guaranteed by U.S. military. Americans liberated a continent, rebuilt much of it from the rubble of war with the Marshall Plan, and then stood watch on freedom's frontier and prevented a Soviet tank invasion across the Fulda Gap. And today, the only thing that stops North Korea from invading South Korea or China from invading Taiwan is American military might.

So, let's be clear: Every country that enjoys democratic governance today owes its birth of freedom to our Founding Fathers, and the continued existence of their democracy to the U.S. military.

Today, for all its flaws, America remains the freest, most innovative, most prosperous country in the history of the world. We invented the lightbulb and the iPhone. We put a man on the moon and a rover on Mars. We are a nation of unparalleled military power and unlimited opportunity. There's a reason we have a crisis on our southern border; millions want to come here so that they can share in the abundance of American prosperity.

The men and women who flew those fighters and bombers over the Mall last week make it all possible. They provide the critical foundation of peace and security upon which our freedom, and the freedom of all the world's democracies, is built.

That is better than "just OK."

Texto completo: Jim Bouton was an All-Star Yankees pitcher who became more famous as an author, publishing a book that changed the way people looked at baseball and some of its most beloved icons. He died Wednesday at 80, a little more than a year after he enjoyed one last moment of adulation and joy at Yankee Stadium.
Bouton suffered from a dementia-like condition in recent years. So, it meant a lot to him to be invited back - with his wife Paula Kurman and his grandchildren - to the 2018 Yankees Old-Timers' Day, an event from which he had been pointedly uninvited for many years before a reconciliation in 1998. The club was outraged over stories he told, particularly about Mickey Mantle, in the best-selling 1970 book "Ball Four."
The book was officially a diary of his comeback as a relief pitcher with the expansion 1969 Seattle Pilots, but it went further and deeper, recalling moments during his early years as a Yankees standout (he was a 20-game winner in 1963 and won two games in the 1964 World Series). He wrote of ballplayers, including Mantle, drinking and carousing, and of how others used amphetamines or "greenies" to prepare for games in the long season.
Its massive readership changed the trajectory of Bouton's life, sending him onto a second career as a sportscaster on Channel 7 Eyewitness News and Channel 2 in New York. He also was the entrepreneur of Big League, a company that produced chewing gum and baseball cards. He became a personality and celebrity, while enduring exile from the team that signed James Alan Bouton, a New Jersey native, in 1958.
He wore No. 56 and had a pitching motion so strenuous that his cap often flew off his head.
A New York Giants fan as a youngster, Bouton was undeterred by an episode in which one of his heroes, Alvin Dark, responded to an autograph request by saying, "Take a hike, kid." Bouton loved playing baseball so much that he was still pitching recreationally into his 50s. He wrote in "Ball Four" that, while he criticized "Neanderthal aspects" of baseball, "There's been a tremendous lot of good in it for me and I wouldn't trade my years in it for anything I can think of."
His relationship with the Yankees began to thaw in 1994, when he wrote a letter to Mantle offering condolences on the death of a son and congratulations on having the courage to seek alcoholism treatment. In a 1995 interview with Newsday, Bouton said that Mantle left a voice mail telling him "I'm not the reason you're not invited to Old-Timers' Day. I'm OK with `Ball Four' now." Bouton added in the interview, conducted after Mantle's death, ""I'm very, very thankful he called me. It really would have been a bad feeling I'd have carried with me the rest of my life if we had never made that contact."
Bouton received a formal "no hard feelings" notice when he finally was invited back to Old-Timers' Day in 1998. That came after Bouton's 31-year-old daughter died in a car accident and his son wrote a piece in The New York Times asking the Yankees to open their hearts to the former righthanded pitcher. They did, and he received one of the day's longest and loudest ovations.

DON'T LET THE FAR LEFT'S LITMUS TESTS BOOST TRUMP; EDITOR'S COLUMN

Texto completo: You would think these days would be good ones for those of us who loathe Donald Trump.
In the past two weeks, seated face-to-face with Russia's murderous dictator, he trivialized interference in our elections; he's the target of a new and credible rape charge; and he revealed a staggering ignorance of basic political terms during an overseas news conference.
Yet he may have still come out ahead.
That's because one of the most promising Democratic presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren pledged in a debate that she would take away private health insurance and force everyone into a national health care program.
For goodness' sake, the attack ads write themselves: Democrats want to take away your private health insurance even if you like it.
I gather that the far left of the Democratic Party demands purity even at the expense of victory. Or perhaps it believes that its radical vision for change will attract a deluge of first-time voters in swing districts in such numbers to offset the moderately left and centrist voters it will turn off.
What fantasy.
It's as if they want to run up even bigger margins in New York and California, as if that will matter if Trump again wins narrowly in the flyover states he won in 2016.
Beyond demanding purity from presidential candidates, the far left also targets other Democrats.
Take Cheri Bustos, a Democratic member of Congress whose northwestern Illinois district includes my childhood home of Rockford. Bustos won comfortably last year for the fourth time in a district that Trump carried in the 2016 presidential election.
And let's be clear: She is one of the true heroes of Democratic politics, as one of 31 winners in 2018 in districts that Trump won two years earlier.
But recently she was pictured atop a Huff-Post article describing how a group called Roots Action is targeting her and 14 other Democrats they say deserve primary challengers. They even have a name for these villainous moderate Democrats the "Bad Blues."
In its statement, Roots Action says: "While most insurgent primary campaigns will not win, they're often very worthwhile helping progressive constituencies to get better organized and to win elections later. And a grassroots primary campaign can put a scare into the Democratic incumbent to pay more attention to voters and less to big donors."
Put another way, let's threaten Democratic officeholders from the left in difficult swing districts, pushing them into positions that will make them more vulnerable in a general election. Heck, as part of this process to develop far-left candidates for future elections, maybe they will move the U.S. House back to Republican control.
That should boost progressive causes.
Bustos earned special ire by being strongly pro-incumbent as chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. In its message, Roots Action said, "Bustos, a member of the corporate-allied New Democrat Coalition, is out of sync with large numbers of progressive constituents."
In the HuffPost story, a spokesman for Justice Democrats, another far-left group, praised the hit list as a sign of the times. That group backed the insurgent candidacies of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ayanna Pressley, who unseated Democratic House incumbents in New York City and Boston, respectively. Yes, because if Democrats can just replace mainstream Democrats with radical Democrats in a handful of deep blue urban districts like those two, well then, Trump and congressional Republicans will shake in their boots.
After the presidential debates, conservative New York Times columnist David Brooks was on point when he said Democrats "sometimes talk as if they're campaigning for Brooklyn" on the PBS NewsHour.
In his column, Brooks elaborated: "The debates illustrate the dilemma for moderate Democrats. If they take on progressives they get squashed by the passionate intensity of the left. If they don't, the party moves so far left that it can't win in the fall."
In a Hill-HarrisX poll reported on The Hill website last winter, only one in 10 registered voters want the equivalent of Medicare for all if it means eliminating private health insurance plans. But that doesn't give pause to the far left.
A New York Times story focused on health care as a divisive Democratic issue for the 2020 race, alarming given that the issue was a source of strength for the party against Republicans in 2018.
"The challenge is to avoid alienating both the progressives, whose support they will need in the primary, and the more moderate voters, without whom they cannot survive the general election," the article said.
Look, I don't care if Bernie Sanders doesn't realize his time has passed as a relevant presidential candidate. Let him come across as self-righteous, perpetually angry and hoarse, pounding away at this extremist model for health care.
The problem comes when more serious candidates like Warren feel compelled to take such polarizing positions.
She has been gaining momentum by running on a populist economic platform that is starkly different from Trump's in its villains he blames immigrants and liberals for working-class woes; Warren correctly blames a rigged system of unregulated capitalism that screws the middle class.
That's a winning issue.
Kamala Harris, likewise, has gained ground recently by demonstrating toughness and passion taking on Joe Biden over her personal story on race. She said after her debate that she understood the crucial health care question to be whether she personally would give up private health insurance for a government-run plan and not to mandate doing so for everyone, but her hand was still up in the air in front of millions of viewers like Warren's was. And when real Democratic contenders like them are seen talking about eliminating private health insurance, they hand the political right a cudgel that will help Trump.

Texto completo: El presidente Donald Trump no tardó en intentar deslindarse de su relación con el multimillonario Jeffrey Epstein –acusado de tráfico sexual de menores– pero hay una historia demasiado personal entre ellos difícil de olvidar y que involucra a la primera dama Melania Trump .
Según un informe de The New York Times sobre los lazos comerciales y sociales entre el mandatario y Epstein, apenas el republicano fue electo, el empresario financiero se dedicó a difundir que fue él quien logró conectar al presidente con la entonces modelo y ahora Primera Dama.
Melania solo ha dicho que ella y Trump se conocieron cuando el entonces magnate inmobiliario le pidió su número de teléfono en el Kit Kat Club, en 1998, durante la Semana de la Moda.
Ni el presidente Trump ni su esposa han negado el hecho, además de que el periodo mencionado por Epstein coincide con las fechas en que se conoció la pareja presidencial, ya que la relación de la pareja presidencial comenzó hace 21 años, mientras que el mandatario afirma que dejó de hablarse a su exsocio hace 15 años, después de un pleito.
Una foto del 2000, tomada en Mar-a-Lago , muestra al presidente Trump, su esposa Melania, y a Epstein con la socialité británica Ghislaine Maxwell .
Jeffrey Epstein claims that he introduced President Trump to his wife Melania https://t.co/0N9L53RGxf pic.twitter.com/pIxaLu23mT

Un reporte de New York Post indica que en 1998, la entonces modelo casi no tenía dinero .
“Se encontró con Donald justo en el momento adecuado. Estaba casi sin dinero, como en la cuerda floja y a punto de regresar a Europa del Este” , afirm una la fuente al Post.
El portal británico Sunday Express indicó que a pesar de sus esfuerzos, la exmodelo nunca logró la fama mundial con su profesión, pero tuvo importantes contratos en los años noventa.

Opera connections in rural Nevada

Texto completo: In 2008 I spotted my friend Rick Joseph, owner of a construction company, jogging along the Nevada Day parade route handing out fliers about the latest opera production in Reno. I was surprised, to say the least. Chatting with him later, I discovered that he was one of the founders and funders for the Next Generation Program, an initiative of the Nevada Opera that provided opera tickets for youths through grants and donations by area businesses and individuals.
Rick grew up on a ranch and he explained he'd developed a love for opera as a teen when a family friend began taking him to opera productions in the city. As an adult, promoting the opera among the "next generation" became one of his passions. With underwriting from businesses such as Richard Joseph and Company, Stetson Beemer Insurance, J.D. Benefits, The Griffin Crowley Group, AT&T Nevada and Drakulich Insurance, the program provided about 450 opera tickets to children from Washoe, Douglas, Lyon and Storey counties and Carson City during its first season.
Having learned nothing at all about opera during my own K-12 years, I appreciated the opportunities for educational enrichment the Next Generation program offered. Through my work at the nonprofit Healthy Communities Coalition, I helped form a collaboration between Next Generation and schools and other groups in Lyon County so that students could experience opera. In 2008, nearly 100 teens from Silver Springs, Fernley, Dayton, Silver City and other Lyon County areas boarded buses and attended operas in Reno.
The Next Generation Program not only provided youths with tickets but went to great lengths to make the kids feel welcome and comfortable in a setting that was unfamiliar to many of them. Before students traveled to see Il Barbiere di Siviglia (The Barber of Seville), Nevada Opera's Paul Chiavini and Lynne Gray came to Silver Stage High and Western Nevada Regional Youth Center and explained the basics of opera to students. And after teens attended Englebert Humperdink's Hansel and Gretel, Rick invited them to a punch and cookie reception, decimating the stereotype of the opera as stuffy and somber by greeting them in a traditional Scottish kilt and encouraging them to cheer loudly as all the performers from the opera joined the reception. They were particularly enthusiastic about receiving Nevada Opera t-shirts and having them autographed by the entire cast of the opera, including the conductor.
Coincidentally, last year a Manhattan opera librettist contacted me about coming to the Resident Artist Program I direct in Silver City. I was delighted to add David Cote to our line-up of summer 2019 visiting artists.
David is a playwright, opera librettist, and theater critic based in New York City. In the last two years alone, his librettos have been in operas performed in New York's Carnegie Hall, Chicago Opera Theater, Brooklyn Academy of Music, Boston, Montréal, Cincinnati Opera, Nashville Opera and Shreveport. His reporting and reviews regularly appear in the Observer, Theater News Online, American Theatre, etc. His play Otherland was a finalist in the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center's National Playwrights Conference. He's written companion books for several hit Broadway musicals, including Wicked. He was the longest serving theater editor and chief drama critic of Time Out New York. His reporting and criticism have appeared in The New York Times, The Village Voice, The Guardian, and Opera News.
You can learn more about David's creative process during a talk at the Brick in Carson City from 5-6:30 p.m. Aug. 22, along with Chicago-based sculptor Nicole Beck, one of the visiting artists at Buffalo Creek Art Center in Gardnerville. You can also hear more about David Cote's librettos and the operas they're in at a talk at Sierra Arts in Reno on Aug. 24. In addition, he'll be leading workshops with Silver City locals to write a libretto on the topic of Comstock Mining Inc's unwelcome plans to pit mine within and next to the historic town.
Quest Lakes moved to Nevada in 1989 and fell in love with the state and its fascinating history, landscape, and culture. She can be reached at quest@theodata.com.

Epstein sex trafficking charges call for bipartisan revulsion

Texto completo: A number of rich and powerful people are sweaty this morning.
That's because multimillionaire Jeffrey Epstein was arrested over the weekend and arraigned in federal court today on sex trafficking charges involving dozens of young girls.
These aren't the old sex charges Epstein faced, the ones that, thanks to his wealth and political connections, earned him what the Miami Herald described as "the most lenient sentences for a serial sex offender in U.S. history."
These are new charges. New charges that carry a possible sentence of nearly 50 years. New charges that might make a 66-year-old financier want to talk about the rich and powerful people who have spun in his orbit over the past couple of decades, as accusations of Epstein preying on girls, some as young as 14, and farming them out to have sex with other wealthy men piled up.
These new charges will draw bright lights that make rich and powerful people who have something to hide feel sweaty.
If you aren't familiar with Epstein, you're far from alone. The fact that he managed to keep a low profile as the #MeToo movement brought a measure of justice to many lecherous, high-profile men speaks volumes of his influence, and that of his friends.
Here's a description of the previous FBI probe into Epstein, from the Miami Herald:
"Epstein, who has homes in Manhattan, Palm Beach, New Mexico, Paris and in the U.S. Virgin Islands, sexually abused nearly three dozen girls, mostly 13-16 years old, at his Palm Beach mansion from 1999 to 2006, according to investigators. He used the girls to help recruit other young girls as part of an operation that ran similar to a pyramid scheme. He also had recruiters who helped with his appointments, scheduling as many as three or four girls a day, the FBI probe found."
At the time, Epstein owned an island off St. Thomas. The Herald report continues: "His plane records show that during the time he was abusing young girls, he was flying former President Bill Clinton, Harvard professors and administrators, Nobel-prize winning scientists, actresses, actors, philanthropists and a who's who of wealthy and powerful people to his island."
Investigators prepared a 53-page federal indictment. But that indictment was conveniently pushed aside after prosecutors reached a secret deal with Epstein.
From The New York Times:
"Prosecutors did not tell the victims about the deal they made with Mr. Epstein until after a judge approved it.
"Instead of facing life in prison, Mr. Epstein pleaded guilty to two prostitution charges in state court and served about a year in a Palm Beach jail, though he was allowed to leave the facility six days a week, 12 hours a day on work-release privileges.
"Mr. Epstein's deal also shielded any co-conspirators who may have helped to arrange his sexual rendezvous and stayed in contact with his victims."
Along with Clinton, Prince Andrew of Britain was pals with Epstein. The financier also has been linked to Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz, and to a wealthy New York City real estate mogul named Donald Trump.
In 2002, around the same time Epstein allegedly was flying a plane that was nicknamed "the Lolita Express" to his private island and trafficking teenage girls, Trump described his friend as a "terrific guy."
The future president told New York Magazine: "He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side."
Who helped Epstein land the secret nonprosecution agreement that gave him a mere slap on the wrist? It was Alexander Acosta, then the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida.
Where is Acosta now? He's President Trump's labor secretary, running the federal department that oversees human trafficking laws.
Funny how life works sometimes, isn't it?
It may be a while before we know the scope of evidence that federal investigators have against Epstein. And it remains to be seen which of Epstein's friends and associates, if any, might get sucked into this grotesque vortex.
But the charges against Epstein and our knowledge of the circles he ran in present us with a rare opportunity for bipartisan revulsion.
Epstein is a monster. The evidence of his predatory behavior and the young lives he ruined is overwhelming.
If there are others who sexually abused or in any other way harmed these girls, if there are others who turned a blind eye to what was happening, I hope they're sweating. I hope they face the harshest of consequences, regardless of political persuasion.
We deserve to know the extent of Epstein's crimes and the depth of his well-heeled circle's involvement. But far more important, the girls who were molested, degraded and trafficked like property deserve the justice they were previously denied.

Taxi-Medallion Rules Strengthened

Texto completo: New York City will tighten rules for the purchase and refinancing of taxi medallions following a 45-day review ordered by Mayor Bill de Blasio.
The review, conducted by several city agencies and released Monday, found that brokers who facilitate the purchase, sale and refinancing of medallions often fail to disclose interests in the transactions or to adequately explain terms to borrowers.
Taxi-driver advocates said the recommendations don't go far enough. The New York Taxi Workers Alliance on Monday renewed calls for the city to repay the debt for thousands of drivers whose loans are underwater. Mr. de Blasio said the city can't afford to bail out drivers, but would try to help in other ways.
Medallions are the metal shields pinned to a taxi's hood that grant drivers the right to pick up passengers on the street. Of New York City's 13,500 medallions, about 3,500 are owned by people who also drive the taxi themselves, according to the city. Most of the remaining medallions are owned by garages that operate a fleet of vehicles.
Many owner-drivers were plunged into financial distress when the value of a medallion plummeted several years ago to less than $200,000 from a high of more than $1 million just a few years before. The drivers' situation has been exacerbated by the influx of about 80,000 ride-hailing vehicles.
The city's review was prompted by an investigation earlier this year by the New York Times, which found that taxi-industry leaders sought to inflate the value of medallions and that brokers used predatory-lending practices to enrich themselves.
About one-third of New York's 20 licensed brokers couldn't provide all of the necessary documentation for transactions they facilitated during the past three years, according to the city's review. Those cases with missing documentation have been passed to a city unit that could issue fines.
The review also found that drivers were poorly advised about the loans they took out and refinanced, and that it often was unclear to borrowers whether brokers charged additional fees or had financial ties to lenders and insurance brokerages.
More than 300 owner-drivers responded to a survey conducted by the review team. About 80% said they had borrowed against their medallion to finance homes, vehicle purchases or college. In many cases, drivers said they weren't aware of the terms of the deals.
The survey found that drivers paid a median purchase price of $340,000 for their medallions, but had a median debt outstanding of almost $500,000. One quarter said they were considering bankruptcy.
The review found that many drivers had medallion loan payments of between $2,500 and $4,000 a month.
The review team, which included officials from the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission, said the regulator should amend its rules forcing brokers to clearly lay out the terms of loans and to translate them for drivers, most of whom are immigrants. The city also will set up a unit to monitor and review brokers.

Texto completo: EDGEFIELD, S.C. -- President Trump and Attorney General William P. Barr began working to find a way to place a citizenship question on the 2020 census just after the Supreme Court blocked its inclusion last month, Mr. Barr said on Monday, adding that he believes that the administration can find a legal path to incorporating the question.
"The president is right on the legal grounds. I felt the Supreme Court decision was wrong, but it also made clear that the question was a perfectly legal question to ask, but the record had to be clarified," Mr. Barr said in an interview. He was referring to the ruling that left open the possibility that the citizenship question could be added to the census if the administration came up with a better rationale for it.
"It makes a lot of sense for the president to see if it's possible that we could clarify the record in time to add the question," Mr. Barr added.
But he also acknowledged that the career Justice Department lawyers who had worked on the census question had little appetite to continue on the case after Mr. Trump inserted himself into the process. "We're going to reach a new decision, and I can understand if they're interested in not participating in this phase," Mr. Barr said. The Justice Department announced a day earlier that it was replacing them, a nearly unheard-of move.
In a court filing on Monday in New York, though, plaintiffs in the case asked a judge to block the lawyers' withdrawal because they did not demonstrate "satisfactory reasons" for the change.
The talks between Mr. Barr and Mr. Trump and the decision to replace the legal team underscore administration officials' difficulty in adding a citizenship question to the census. Democrats have criticized the pursuit as an effort to reshape the results of the census -- which affects the allocation of hundreds of billions of federal dollars each year -- to benefit Republicans.
Mr. Barr said that the Trump administration would soon reveal how it plans to add the question, but he would not detail potential legal pathways. The main challenge, he said, would be adding the question without disrupting the census.
At a news conference later on Monday after touring a federal prison in Edgefield, S.C., with Senators Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott, the Republicans who represent the state, Mr. Barr declined to say whether the president would issue an executive order to add the question. It was not clear what such an order would accomplish; the Constitution makes Congress responsible for overseeing the census, not the president, though the administration carries it out.
The Trump administration's handling of the census has already put Mr. Barr in the cross hairs of House Democrats, who strongly oppose the addition of a citizenship question. And the hostilities may soon spike.
In a warning shot on Monday, Speaker Nancy Pelosi informed colleagues that she intended to schedule a full House vote "soon" to hold Mr. Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in contempt of Congress for defying subpoenas for documents related to the census question. Ms. Pelosi called the census dispute "essential to who we are as a nation" and asserted that the materials in question would "shed light on the real reason the administration added a citizenship question."
The House Oversight and Reform Committee, which is investigating the Trump administration's decision to add the question, voted last month to recommend that the two cabinet officials be held in contempt, mostly along party lines, despite protests from the administration that it was working in good faith to meet the requests.
If the House follows through with a contempt vote on the floor -- and no date for a vote has yet been set -- it would be empowering the Oversight Committee to take Mr. Barr and Mr. Ross to court to ask a judge to enforce their subpoenas. Doing so is an exceedingly rare step and puts a black mark on both officials' public records.
The House has already threatened to hold Mr. Barr in contempt once over a separate case related to a subpoena for material connected to Robert S. Mueller III's investigation as special counsel. But in the end, lawmakers struck a deal with the attorney general and voted on a resolution that merely authorized them to go to court to enforce the subpoena rather than formally accusing Mr. Barr of being in criminal contempt.
House Democrats intend to go further this time, formally accusing both officials of criminal defiance of their summons if the administration does not relent beforehand, according to a senior Democratic aide familiar with the plans. Still, the practical outcome could be the same since the Justice Department would almost certainly refuse to bring a criminal case against the men.
Kerri Kupec, a Justice Department spokeswoman, declined to comment on the contempt issue.
The conversations between Mr. Barr and Mr. Trump came amid a series of abrupt reversals on the issue. After the Supreme Court delayed the administration's effort to add the citizenship question, ruling that its rationale was "contrived," Mr. Ross and Justice Department lawyers declared the issue all but dead last week in the near term.
Mr. Ross said that the Census Bureau, which the Commerce Department oversees, would focus on conducting "a complete and accurate census" and had begun to print forms that did not include the citizenship question. Justice Department lawyers, who had argued that they faced a strict June 30 cutoff for printing the census forms, also concluded as that deadline passed that the question would have to wait for the next census in another decade.
But Mr. Trump, who had been strategizing with Mr. Barr to come up with a way to add the question, overruled Mr. Ross and the lawyers a day later, denouncing their statements as "fake news."
"We are absolutely moving forward, as we must, because of the importance of the answer to this question," Mr. Trump said on Twitter.
His discussions with Mr. Barr did not appear to make their way to the Commerce Department officials or the Justice Department lawyers working on the case. Mr. Barr did not say why, and a Justice Department spokeswoman would not say whether he had told aides about the discussions or instructed the lawyers on the case to keep pursuing the issue.
A Justice Department official said that even though Mr. Trump told Mr. Barr immediately after the ruling that he still wanted the question added, Mr. Barr, and subsequently the department, thought the issue was settled for the time being, in part because the census forms were already being printed.
Because of their conversations, however, Mr. Barr was not surprised by the message on Twitter and he knew he had to get the department to switch gears.
But the lawyers expressed surprise last week at the president's assertion, telling a federal judge who had summoned them to a conference call that they would most likely recant their earlier admission of defeat.
"The tweet this morning was the first I had heard of the president's position on this issue, just like the plaintiffs and your honor," Joshua Gardner, a lawyer working on the census issue, told Judge George J. Hazel of the United States District Court in Maryland.
But Mr. Barr said on Monday that the president's statement did not surprise him because "he and I had talked" about the census issue "several times" after the Supreme Court tossed out the citizenship question.
Mr. Barr confirmed that lawyers in the Justice Department's federal programs branch, who typically defend the administration's positions in court, would no longer work on the census question. He said that James Burnham, the No. 2 official in the department's civil division who had led the census team, recommended that lawyers in its consumer protection branch work on the question instead.
The Justice Department was still seeking lawyers to work on the census case on Monday, reaching out to lawyers in the office of immigration litigation to work on the matter, according to an email reviewed by The New York Times.
"They did a super job," Mr. Barr said of the departing team. "They were very professional."
Mr. Barr said that he did not know whether any of the original team members wanted to stay on. "I didn't really get into the details," he said.

Texto completo: Here's a quick briefing on the Jeffrey Epstein case, compiled from Globe wire reports:
Who is Jeffrey Epstein? Jeffrey Epstein is a 66-year-old billionaire hedge fund manager. His friends have included President Trump, former president Bill Clinton, and Great Britain's Prince Andrew. A convicted sex offender, he now faces new charges of sex trafficking and sex trafficking conspiracy brought by federal prosecutors in New York.
What is he accused of doing? Prosecutors from the Southern District of New York, which covers Manhattan, allege that Epstein sexually abused dozens of young girls — some as young as 14 — from 2002 through 2005 in both New York and Florida, paying the girls hundreds of dollars in cash for each encounter and hundreds more if they brought in more victims. “Epstein created a vast network of underage victims for him to sexually exploit in locations including New York and Palm Beach," the indictment said. He faces charges that could bring him a maximum penalty of 45 years in prison, US Attorney Geoffrey Berman said.
What happened in Florida? Epstein was convicted a decade ago in Florida but the outcome of that case has sparked intense criticism. In 2008, Epstein reached a deal with federal prosecutors in Florida that allowed him to avoid federal charges and the possibility of life in prison for molesting dozens of girls. Instead he was allowed to plead guilty to Florida state charges of soliciting a minor for prostitution. He served 13 months in a state prison, where he had work-release privileges for six days a week, 12 hours each day, during which a private driver picked him up and took him to a nearby office.
The lenient deal, which is being challenged in court, raised questions about whether he received special treatment because of his wealth and his political, business, and legal connections.
In the years that followed, in civil court proceedings, witnesses testified that hundreds of girls from around the world were brought to Epstein at different times.
Why doesn't the federal non-prosecution deal in Florida apply in New York? It wasn't immediately clear how much overlap there is between the Florida case and the new case. But Berman, the US attorney, said at a news conference Monday that the federal non-prosecution deal Epstein received only applied to federal prosecutors in Florida. The agreement “by its terms only binds the Southern District of Florida. The Southern District of New York is not bound by that agreement and is not a signatory to that agreement," he told reporters. There are also no double jeopardy implications because Epstein's guilty plea involved only state crimes, while the current case involves federal law, The Associated Press reported.
Does President Trump know Epstein? Trump has said in the past that he knew Epstein. Trump told New York magazine in 2002 that Epstein was a “terrific guy" whom he had known for 15 years. The comments have eerie overtones now.
“He's a lot of fun to be with," the president said at the time. “It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it – Jeffrey enjoys his social life." Epstein has also been photographed with Trump at Trump's Florida resort. And one of Epstein's accusers, Virginia Giuffre, said in court documents that she was recruited to give Epstein massages while she was working at Mar-a-Lago. A lawyer for Trump has denied that the two had a social relationship.
How does Alexander Acosta fit in? Acosta is Trump's labor secretary. He was US attorney for the Southern District of Florida when Epstein got his lenient deal. His actions have been under a microscope.
An investigative series by the Miami Herald last year revealed that Acosta was personally involved in the negotiations, and raised questions about his independence.
The Herald reported that the unusual deal had essentially shut down an FBI probe into whether there were more victims and whether other powerful people took part in Epstein's crimes.
Berman noted at a Monday news conference that New York investigators were “assisted by some excellent investigative journalism."
What's next? Prosecutors said they want Epstein, who has two planes and lives much of the year abroad, detained to prevent him from fleeing.
Meanwhile, a federal judge ruled in February that the government had violated the rights of Epstein's alleged victims in the Florida case by not telling them about the federal non-prosecution agreement until it was finalized. That opened the possibility of nullifying that agreement.
In February, the Justice Department opened an investigation into the agreement and whether attorneys had committed “professional misconduct" in making it.
The former White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said months ago that the administration was looking into the information about Acosta detailed by the Herald.
Various commentators have pointed out that Epstein could offer to cooperate with the government, but it wasn't clear what he might have to offer in exchange for leniency.

Prosecutors should stop the scare tactics. Reforming felony murder rule improves our justice system

Texto completo: In January, California ended a decades-old legal doctrine that put numerous people behind bars for murders they did not commit.
Yet six months after the new state law—Senate Bill 1437—took effect, some prosecutors are trying to overturn it, resorting to scare tactics and false distortions.
We are the legislators who wrote and supported this critical reform, and we need to set the record straight about it.
SB 1437 passed the Legislature last year with bipartisan support and was signed into law by then-Gov. Jerry Brown. It reformed California’s outdated and unfair felony murder rule, which had allowed people who did not kill to nonetheless be charged, convicted, and sentenced as murderers.
The old felony murder doctrine allowed prosecutors to charge all accomplices to a crime with first degree murder. It did not matter if there was no intention to kill, if the death was accidental, or if the accomplice had no knowledge that someone else would kill. Everyone was just as responsible, as if they had planned and committed the murder themselves.
The California Supreme Court, in a 1983 ruling, termed the state’s felony murder rule “barbaric.” And yet it remained on the books, and people were unfairly sentenced to long prison terms under this law.
We studied this issue for over a year before passing Senate Concurrent Resolution 48 in 2017. That measure recognized “the need for statutory changes to more equitably sentence offenders in accordance with their involvement in a crime.”
Then in the following legislative session we introduced SB1437 to correct what we concluded was a grave and needless injustice.
As SB1437 moved through the legislative process, we made significant improvements to ensure it was fair and that our reform did not let people who are responsible for a murder off the hook.
Based on input from district attorneys and other public safety advocates, we amended SB1437 to ensure that a criminal was held accountable for murder if they:
* Are the actual killer.
* Aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, solicited, requested, or assisted the actual killer with the intent to kill.
* Were a major participant in the underlying crime and acted with reckless indifference to life.
And so it’s been disappointing to see some of California’s district attorneys now working to block the law’s implementation. They remain intent on pursuing murder convictions for people not guilty of that crime, despite the fact that it’s not in the interest of public safety nor is it just.
Yet they have challenged SB1437 in court arguing it’s unconstitutional on the grounds that it’s allegedly inconsistent with two ballot initiatives California voters passed decades ago.
Before introducing SB1437, we spent over a year carefully reviewing past statutes, court decisions, and, yes, voter-approved ballot initiatives, to ensure that the provisions in SB1437 did not overstep our role.
SB1437 falls squarely within the Legislature’s broad authority to make policy.
Prosecutors have also challenged SB1437 in the press with mischaracterizations. The president of the Association of Deputy District Attorneys for Los Angeles County, for example, recently told The New York Times that under SB1437, “We’re literally talking about letting murderers go free.”
That’s a false claim designed to stoke fear.
Thankfully, many prosecutors have properly applied the law, and courts around the state have upheld the reform as constitutional. As a result, many deserving people have been able to go home—some after serving decades in prison for murders they did not commit.
It’s not just those newly freed and their families who have recognized the justice served in these cases. In San Luis Obispo County, after a judge found SB1437 constitutional, a reporter went to the parents of the victim.
They said that while they still endure the pain of their son’s death, it did not justify an unfair sentence: “It certainly wouldn’t bring closure to me to see him punished as if he were the murderer,” the parent of one murder victim was quoted as saying
SB1437 is a just and overdue reform. We’re confident that California’s courts will uphold it.

Texto completo: CLINT, Texas — Since the Border Patrol opened its station in Clint, Texas, in 2013, it was a fixture in this West Texas farm town. Separated from the surrounding cotton fields and cattle pastures by a razor-wire fence, the station stood on the town’s main road, near a feed store, the Good News Apostolic Church and La Indita Tortillería. Most people around Clint had little idea of what went on inside. Agents came and went in pickup trucks; buses pulled into the gates with the occasional load of children apprehended at the border, 4 miles south.
But inside the secretive site that is suddenly on the front lines of the southwest border crisis, the men and women who work there were grappling with the stuff of nightmares.
Outbreaks of scabies, shingles and chickenpox were spreading among the hundreds of children who were being held in cramped cells, agents said. The stench of the children’s dirty clothing was so strong it spread to the agents’ own clothing — people in town would scrunch their noses when they left work. The children cried constantly. One girl seemed likely enough to try to kill herself that the agents made her sleep on a cot in front of them, so they could watch her as they were processing new arrivals.
“It gets to a point where you start to become a robot,” said a veteran Border Patrol agent who has worked at the Clint station since it was built. He described following orders to take beds away from children to make more space in holding cells, part of a daily routine that he said had become “heartbreaking.”
The little-known Border Patrol facility at Clint has suddenly become the public face of the chaos on America’s southern border, after immigration lawyers began reporting on the children they saw — some of them as young as 5 months old — and the filthy, overcrowded conditions in which they were being held.
Border Patrol leaders, including Aaron Hull, the outspoken chief patrol agent of the agency’s El Paso Sector, have disputed descriptions of degrading conditions inside Clint and other migrant detention sites around El Paso, claiming that their facilities were rigorously and humanely managed even after a spate of deaths of migrant children in federal custody.
But a review of the operations of the Clint station, near El Paso’s eastern edge, shows that the agency’s leadership knew for months that some children had no beds to sleep on, no way to clean themselves and sometimes went hungry. Its own agents had raised the alarm, and found themselves having to accommodate even more new arrivals.
The accounts of what happened at Clint and at nearby border facilities are based on dozens of interviews by the New York Times and the El Paso Times of current and former Border Patrol agents and supervisors; lawyers, lawmakers and aides who visited the facility; and an immigrant father whose children were held there. The review also included sworn statements from those who spent time at El Paso border facilities, inspection reports and accounts from neighbors in Clint.
The conditions at Clint represent a conundrum not just for local officials, but for Congress, where lawmakers spent weeks battling over the terms of a $4.6 billion humanitarian aid package for facilities at the border. The lack of federal investment, some argue, is why the sites have been so strained. But the reports of squalor prompted several Democratic lawmakers to vote against the final bill, which did not have oversight and enforcement provisions.
ABOUT THIS STORY
Accounts of what happened at Clint and at nearby border facilities are based on dozens of interviews by the New York Times and the El Paso Times of current and former Border Patrol agents and supervisors; lawyers, lawmakers and aides who visited the facility; and an immigrant father whose children were held there. The review also included sworn statements from those who spent time at El Paso border facilities, inspection reports and accounts from neighbors in Clint.
By all accounts, the Border Patrol’s attempt to continue making room for new children at Clint even as it was unable to find space to send them to better-equipped facilities was a source of concern for many people who worked there.
“I can’t tell you the number of times I would talk to agents and they would get teary-eyed,” said one agent, a veteran of 13 years with Border Patrol who worked at Clint.
Mary González, a Democratic state lawmaker who toured the Clint station last week, said that Border Patrol agents told her they had repeatedly warned their superiors about the overcrowded facility, but that federal officials had taken no action.
“They said, ‘We were ringing the alarms, we were ringing the alarms, and nobody was listening to us’ — agents told me that,” González said. “I genuinely believe that the higher-ups made the Clint situation happen.”
A forward operating base
Architects designed the Clint station as a type of forward base — replete with fueling stations, garages for all-terrain vehicles and horse stables — from which agents could go on forays along the border.
The station was never intended to hold more than about a hundred adult men, and it was designed with the idea that migrants would be detained for only a few hours of processing before being transferred to other locations.
Officials have allowed reporters and members of Congress on controlled tours of Clint, but prohibited them from bringing phones or cameras inside, and from entering certain areas. But through interviews with dozens of people with knowledge of the station — including lawyers, former detainees and staff members — the New York Times was able to model the main areas where children were held: the station’s central processing area, with its cinder-block cells; a converted loading area and yard; and a warehouse on the property.
Parts of the site resemble what might be seen at many government buildings. Photographs in the hallway celebrate the work of the Border Patrol, showing agents on horseback and in all-terrain vehicles. A conference room features high-backed chairs upholstered with faux leather.
But the sense of normalcy fades away the deeper one goes into the station. A detachment of Coast Guard personnel, sent to assist overworked agents, stock an ad hoc pantry with items like oatmeal and instant noodles. Monitors in blue shirts roam the station, hired through an outside contractor to supervise the detained children.
Beyond the pantry, a door leads to the site’s processing center, equipped with about 10 cells. One day this month, about 20 girls were crowded into one cell, so packed that some were sprawled on the floor. Toddlers could be seen in some cells, cared for by older children.
One of the cells functioned as a quarantine unit or “flu cell” for children with contagious diseases; employees have at times worn medical masks and gloves to protect themselves.
A part of the processing area was set aside for detained children to make phone calls to family members. Many broke into tears upon hearing the voices of loved ones, episodes so common that some agents merely shrugged in response.
Clint is known for holding what agents call UACs, or unaccompanied alien children — children who cross the border alone or with relatives who are not their parents.
Three agents who work at Clint said they had seen unaccompanied children as young as 3 enter the facility, and lawyers who recently inspected the site as part of a lawsuit on migrant children’s rights said they saw children as young as 5 months old. An agent who has worked for Border Patrol for 13 years — and who, like others interviewed for this story, spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the situation — confirmed reports by immigration lawyers that agents have asked migrants who are teenagers to help care for the younger children.
“We have nine agents processing, two agents in charge of UAC care and we have little ones that need their diapers changed, and we can’t do that,” the agent said. “We can’t carry them or change diapers. We do ask the older juveniles, the 16-year-olds or 17-year-olds, to help us out with that.”
As immigration flows change, the scene inside Clint has shifted as well. The number of children in the site is thought to have peaked at more than 700 around April and May, and stood at nearly 250 two weeks ago. In an attempt to relieve crowding, agents took all the children out of Clint but then moved more than 100 back into the station just days later.
Unaccompanied boys are kept in a converted loading area that holds about 50 people. Until a few weeks ago, older boys were kept in a tent encampment outside.
Families, including adult parents, were also sent to Clint earlier this year, and Rep. Will Hurd, R-Texas, whose district includes Clint, said that 11 adult males “apprehended that morning” were also being held at the site when he visited on June 29.
Before the influx of migrants began to wane in recent weeks, the agents said they had kept the families in a warehouse normally used to house ATVs. It was converted into two holding areas initially intended to house 50 people each.
A chief agent under fire
At least two Border Patrol agents at Clint said they had expressed concern about the conditions in the station to their superiors months ago. Even before that, senior Homeland Security officials in Washington had significant concerns about the El Paso Sector’s brash chief patrol agent and his oversight of the facility over the past year, when tighter security along other sections of the border prompted a steep rise in migrant crossings along the section that runs from New Mexico through West Texas.
The situation became so severe that in January, officials at Customs and Border Protection, the agency that oversees the Border Patrol, took the unusual move of ordering the sector chief, Hull, to come to headquarters in Washington for a face-to-face meeting. The officials were concerned that Hull, an agency veteran who speaks with a pronounced Texas twang, had moved too slowly to put safety measures in place after the deaths of migrant children, according to a Homeland Security official. After the meeting, Hull moved forward with the new procedures.
But tension has persisted between Hull and officials in Washington, particularly in recent months, as the number of migrants continued to increase at his facilities. The officials believe that Hull and Matthew Harris, the chief of the Clint station, have been slow to follow directives and communicate developments at the facilities in their sector, according to two Homeland Security officials.
Hull is seen as a hard-liner on immigration issues. He has often been heard saying that migrants exaggerate the problems they face in their home countries.
Officials at the border agency declined multiple interview requests.
Last month, the acting head of CBP, John Sanders, ordered an internal investigation into the Clint facility. The investigation — which is being conducted by the agency’s Office of Professional Responsibility and the department’s inspector general — has examined allegations of misconduct.
As part of the review, investigators have conducted interviews and watched hours of video footage to see how agents treated detainees. So far, investigators have found little evidence to substantiate allegations of misconduct. But they have found that the facility is several times over capacity and has horrendous conditions.
The uproar over the site is drawing scrutiny on Border Patrol facilities that are some of the least-regulated migrant-detention centers in the United States.
That is in part because they are intended in most cases to hold migrants for no more than 72 hours, before they are turned over to better-equipped facilities operated by other government agencies with stricter regulations on, say, the number of toilets and showers required. But the 72-hour limit has been frequently breached during the current migrant surge; some children have been housed at Clint for weeks on end.
Lawyers who visited the Clint station described children in filthy clothes, often lacking diapers and with no access to toothbrushes, toothpaste or soap, prompting people around the country to donate supplies that the Border Patrol turned away.
But Hull painted a far different picture of his need for supplies in April, when the numbers of children held in Clint were soaring. Hull told commissioners in Doña Ana County in Las Cruces, New Mexico, in April that his stations had more than enough supplies.
“Twenty years ago, we were lucky if we had juice and crackers for those in custody,” Hull said, as quoted in The Las Cruces Sun-News. “Now, our stations are looking more like Walmarts — with diapers and baby formula and all kinds of things, like food and snacks, that we aren’t resourced or staffed for and don’t have the space to hold.”
An inspector arrives
One day in April, a man from Washington arrived unannounced around midday at the Clint station. He introduced himself as Henry Moak, and told the agents inside that he was there to inspect the site in his role as Customs and Border Protection’s chief accountability officer.
The Clint station was far over capacity on the day of Moak’s visit, bulging with 291 children. Moak found evidence of a lice infestation; children also told him about going hungry and being forced to sleep on the floors.
One girl, a 14-year-old from El Salvador, had been in custody for 14 days in Clint, including a nine-day stretch in a nearby hospital during which Border Patrol agents accompanied her and kept her under surveillance. Moak did not specify in his report why the girl had been rushed to the hospital. When the girl returned to Clint, another child had taken her bed so she had to sleep on the floor.
Two sisters from Honduras, one 11 and the other 7, told Moak that they had to sleep on benches in the facility’s hold room, getting their own cot only when other children were transferred out. “The sisters told me they had not showered or brushed their teeth since arriving at Clint station,” Moak said in his report. Showers had been offered twice during the girls’ time in custody, but the girls were asleep each time, his review showed.
Moak in the end stated that Clint was in compliance with standards.
One of a team of lawyers who inspected the station in June, Warren Binford, director of the clinical law program at Willamette University in Oregon, said that in all her years of visiting detention and shelter facilities, she had never encountered conditions so bad — 351 children crammed into what she described as a prisonlike environment.
She looked at the roster, and was shocked to see more than 100 very young children listed. “My God, these are babies, I realized. They are keeping babies here,” she recalled.
One teenage mother from El Salvador said Border Patrol agents at the border had taken her medicine for her infant son, who had a fever.
“Did they throw away anything else?” Binford said she had asked her.
“Everything,” she replied. “They threw away my baby’s diapers, formula, bottle, baby food and clothes. They threw away everything.”
Once at Clint, she told Binford, the baby’s fever came back and she begged the agents for more medicine. “Who told you to come to America with your baby, anyway?” one of the agents told her, according to the young woman’s account to Binford.
Border Patrol agents have said they have adequate supplies at Clint for most of the migrants’ needs. The facility lacks a kitchen, they said, so the ramen, granola bars, instant oatmeal and burritos that serve as most of the sustenance for migrants has been the best they could do.
Children sometimes could be seen crying, said one Border Patrol agent, who has worked for seven years at the Clint facility, but it most often seemed to be because they missed their parents. “It’s never because they’re mistreated; it’s because they’re homesick,” she said.
A father finds his sons
Not long after Moak signed off on the conditions inside Clint, a man named Ruben was desperately trying to find his sons, 11-year-old twins who both have epilepsy.
The boys had crossed the border together in early June with their adult sister. They were hoping to reunite with their parents who had come to the United States earlier from El Salvador in order to earn enough money to pay for the boys’ epilepsy medications. They require daily injections and a strict regimen of care to prevent the seizures they began having at age 5.
But the twins were separated at the border from their sister and sent to Clint. The first time they spoke to Ruben on the phone, the two boys sobbed intensely and asked when they would be able to see their parents again.
“We don’t want to be here,” they told him. Ruben asked that his last name and the names of his sons be withheld for fear of retaliation by the U.S. government.
Only later did Ruben learn that the boys had been given at least some of their epilepsy medication, and neither one had had a seizure. But one boy reported breaking out in a skin rash, his face and arms turning red and flaky. Both had come down with fevers and said they had been sent temporarily to the “flu cell.”
“There is no one to take care of you there,” one told his father.
It took 13 days after the boys were detained to speak to their father over the phone. A lawyer who had entered the facility, Clara Long of Human Rights Watch, met the boys, tracked down their parents, and helped them make a call. The boys were stoic and quiet, she said, and shook her hand as if “trying to act like little adults” — until they spoke to their father. Then, they could answer only with one- or two-word answers, Long said, and were wiping tears from their faces.
Much of the crowding appears to have been relieved at Clint, and overall arrivals at the border are slowing, as new policies make migrants, mainly from Central America, return to Mexico after they request asylum, as the summer heat deters travelers and as Mexico’s crackdown on its southern border prevents many from entering.
A Border Patrol agent who has long worked in the El Paso area said agents had tried to make things as easy as possible for the children; some bought toys and sports equipment on their own to bring in. “Agents play board games and sports with them,” he said.
But the Border Patrol long “took great pride” in quickly processing migrant families, and making sure children did not remain in their rudimentary stations for longer than 72 hours, the agent said. Clint, he said, “is not a place for kids.”
In the surrounding town, many residents were puzzled and sad at the news of what was happening to children in the station on Alameda Avenue.
“I don’t know what the hell happened, but they’ve diverted from their original mission,” said Julián Molinar, 66, a retired postal deliveryman who lives in a house facing the station. He served in the Army in Europe as the Berlin Wall came down, he said, and was dismayed that there was now talk of building a border wall near his home. As for the Clint facility, he said, “children should not be held here.”
Dora Aguirre, Clint’s mayor, expressed sympathy for the agents, who are part of the community in Clint and neighboring El Paso. “They’re just trying to do their job as a federal agency,” she said. “They are trying to do the best they can.”

Texto completo: Coco Gauff was probably destined to be the biggest story in sports at some point in her life, but nobody could have anticipated that it would happen on a Friday in July of her 15th year on Earth.
What started as a Wimbledon curiosity and a cool, niche story has now become a real thing -- a real, big thing -- as Gauff advanced to the Round of 16 with a rousing comeback to beat Polona Hercog 3-6, 7-6, 7-5.
No matter what happens from here, life will never be the same for Gauff – not just because she's into the second week of a Grand Slam tournament at age 15, but because of how she's done it: with incredible athletic ability and mental toughness and a maturity that has captivated an American audience often indifferent to tennis.
Which is all the more reason everyone around Gauff and the Women's Tennis Association must resist the urge to speed up this process.
Under the current WTA age restrictions, Gauff can play only 10 professional tournaments (with some merit-based flexibility) between her 15th and 16th birthday in March, with the limits increasing each year until she turns 18. Gauff's father, Corey, has been pushing for the rule to be relaxed and made solid points last week in an interview with The New York Times .
But tennis is a sport that has too often chewed up its prodigies before they're fully-formed adults, leaving a trail of burnout, chronic injury and family dysfunction. And as Gauff ascends into a stratosphere of fame that seemed unlikely this early, it's all the more reason for tennis to be extra careful about not screwing this one up.
From all indications, the Gauff family seems to get it. Corey, a former college basketball player at Georgia State, has been careful about his daughter's path up to this point. He says he's spent years studying the flameouts, the success stories and everyone in between to chart a course for Coco that will allow her a long pro career and the best chance at maintaining balance. In the player box, Corey and his wife, Candi, have given the appearance of being supportive and extraordinarily normal, which isn't always the case with tennis parents.
But it's inevitable now that things are going to change for the Gauffs. Though people within the niche tennis world have known about Coco Gauff for a while – Roger Federer's management company, Team 8, signed her in late 2017, and New Balance became her apparel sponsor last October – everything is different when you break out as a mainstream star. It's possible that she made millions of dollars in sponsorships based solely on what she did Friday afternoon on a holiday weekend with millions of Americans being drawn in.
And clearly she has enough tools to play like a legit pro, having beaten Venus Williams, 139th-ranked Magdalena Rybarikova and 60th-ranked Hercog to get into the fourth round.
But it's also worth remembering that Gauff – whose ranking will rocket from No. 313 to at least No. 139 even if she loses to Simona Halep on Monday – hasn't had much success at the highest level of pro tennis prior to Wimbledon. Gauff has made a couple of deep runs at developmental-level ITF events, but in the big WTA tournaments this spring at Indian Wells and Miami, she won just one match, against 221st-ranked Catherine McNally.
In other words, until last week, her results have been typical of what you'd expect from even a great 15-year-old.
Corey Gauff argued in The Times that the age restriction, while well-intentioned, has in fact put too much pressure on his daughter to play well in those tournaments because she knows there are limited chances. He suggested the WTA should look at changing the rule from limiting the number of tournaments to total matches, which might have some merit.
"I think anytime a rule is 20-something years old, it needs to be looked at," he said.
Even Federer told reporters he has lobbied the WTA Tour to relax the restrictions, noting how good it was for the sport when Martina Hingis won the Australian Open at 16 years, 3 months, starting a four-year run as the best player in the sport.
But it's also true that Hingis had to retire by 22 due to injuries, though she did come back later as a successful doubles player.
And it's also true that Jennifer Capriati struggled to handle everything that came with being a prominent 14-year-old pro and spiraled into burnout and drug addiction before later reinventing herself as a champion.
And it's undeniable that some of the young women with tremendous promise on tour have struggled to stay healthy over the last few years, which may or may not be attributed to the increased physicality of the pro game that has skewed the prime window for most players into their mid-to-late 20s.
So regardless of the specifics of Gauff's situation, the rules generally make sense. While it's great for Gauff and for tennis that she'll have a chance to play a handful of tournaments on the heels of this Wimbledon run, it doesn't make a lot of sense to put a 15-year-old on tour full time to play against adults week in and week out while she's still developing physically and emotionally.
Sometime when this run ends, the Gauff family and the women's tour will undoubtedly be tempted to strike while the iron's hot. Every tournament will want her in the draw, and sponsors will want her on TV, wearing their logo at every opportunity. The WTA will be under extreme pressure to let her play more events.
But if Gauff is really destined to have a special career, it's wise to take a deep breath and let it happen slowly. The history of tennis tells us that with a talent like Gauff, trying to speed things up is the riskiest path of all.

Texto completo: Al menos 20 trabajadores inmigrantes indocumentados que fueron despedidos de los clubes de golf del presidente Donald Trump a principios de este año están solicitando una reunión en la Casa Blanca.
A través de una carta firmada por 21 de las mucamas, jardineros, personal de cocina y otros exempleados de cinco de los clubes se pide al presidente que “haga lo correcto” y les dé la oportunidad, para explicar las razones por las cuales no deberían ser deportados.
“Somos personas modestas que representan los sueños de los 11 millones de hombres, mujeres y niños indocumentados que viven y trabajan en este país”, dice la carta. “Sabe que somos trabajadores y que no somos delincuentes ni buscamos un viaje gratis a Estados Unidos. Todos pagamos nuestros impuestos, amamos a nuestra fe y a nuestra familia, y simplemente queremos encontrar un lugar para que nosotros podamos mejorar a Estados Unidos”.
Según Associated Press, la misiva ya tuvo respuesta de la Casa Blanca, resumida en que fue recibida la notificación y que se estaba “revisando” la solicitud.
Los exempleados enfatizaron sus años de servicio a la familia Trump, señalando que su labor permitió a los clubes que “sean un éxito y para mantener felices a sus miembros y visitantes”.
La Organización Trump ha despedido a cerca de 20 trabajadores indocumentados de sus clubes de golf en los últimos meses, como resultado de una auditoría realizada, después de que The New York Times informara en diciembre sobre indocumentadas que trabajaban como empleadas domésticas en la propiedad Bedminster, en New Jersey.

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
The most popular tweet from @NYT_first_said, a Twitter bot that since 2017 has tracked new words in The New York Times, has received 8,500 retweets and 28,500 likes. It comes from a phrase used by President Trump in January 2018 to characterize countries like Haiti and some nations in Africa.
"This is your day to go viral," Brianna Wu, a software engineer and current congressional candidate, tweeted at the bot in response. "You earned it."
Technically, there is no "you" for the account. The bot is a computer program that scrapes The Times's website hourly for new articles and compares them against a memory bank of words the paper has previously used. The bot then tweets the words that appear to be new. On a typical day, it posts a handful of tweets, comprising neologisms, scientific terms, words in foreign languages and the occasional typo.
On June 28, its tweets read: zendale, zombiecorn, biofocals, parasexualized, dobok, doors'll, gaytriarchy. (That last one was by far the most popular.)
There is, however, a person behind the account: Max Bittker, a 24-year-old Google software engineer who built the program. "I'm most interested in uses of programming that are weird or interesting or artistic," Mr. Bittker said in a recent telephone interview. "One of them is Twitter bots, but also data visualization for journalism, text analysis and that kind of thing."
Mr. Bittker built the first version of the program in a weekend or two, he said, helped substantially by open-source code for a project called NewsDiffs, which records changes to online news articles. It was built by three coders, including the former New York Times journalist Jennifer 8. Lee, who made the source code available to other engineers. That allowed Mr. Bittker to create a "fork," or new project, off the same framework.
The initial draft was followed by a long period of refinement, to "filter out things that were not interesting," Mr. Bittker said. "It would tweet every URL and proper nouns and things like that." These days, a number of heuristics limit what the bot will tweet: no capital letters, dashes, underscores or @ symbols.
To date, @NYT_first_said has tracked more than 13,000 first appearances in The Times. Many of the most popular ones have come when The Times has used colorful slang -- like "thiccc," "hypebeasts" and "shooketh."
Words related to social trends tend to find success on the account, particularly those that mirror social media itself. The bot's followers have gone wild, for example, for verminfluencers, kidfluencers, fitfluencers and small-time influencers of both the micro- and nano- varieties.
Ranked by popularity, the Times music reporter Joe Coscarelli's use of "deadass" came second only to the presidential profanity, with 4,500 retweets and 16,000 favorites.
"'Deadass' is the perfect 'NYT First' because it's quintessential New York slang that has transcended thanks to the geographical flattening facilitated by the internet," Mr. Coscarelli wrote in an email. "It lets people feel like they're part of an edgy insider's club but is also mainstream enough to be widely relatable."
(Mr. Coscarelli also wished to credit the pop star Billie Eilish, the subject of the article in which the word appeared. He described her as "a teenager who uses 'deadass' way more than I do and is responsible for this virality and basically all virality.")
The account's followers tend to take special pleasure when it records a "naughty" word, Mr. Bittker said, likely because of the contrast it strikes with The Times's buttoned-up reputation. That "Old Gray Lady" image is also why he chose The Times, rather than another publication, for the project.
"There's a lot of scatological things that will be popular, and they're never my favorites, because I don't want it to just be a swear bot that's funny because it swears," Mr. Bittker said. His own tastes run to the scientific: "I really love when it's the name of some dinosaur or mega-bird."
Mr. Bittker also speculated that a sense of cultural celebration drove the popularity of many of the bot's tweets. Words relating to food and L.G.B.T.Q. issues, for instance, tend to do well. "When some cuisine or dish is passing into the mainstream American consciousness and having its moment, people really like to celebrate that," he said.
Similarly, when it comes to words relating to gender and sexuality, The Times's first use can represent a breakthrough in representation, even if in a small way. "Maybe that's a thawing-over of what kind of subcultures are fit to be canonized or to be covered," he suggested.
Mr. Bittker said the bot has had one happy side effect for him personally: Since each of the bot's tweets is followed by the article in which the word appeared, the account has functioned as an alternative algorithm for Times stories, leading him to journalism beyond the home screen that he might not have otherwise discovered.
There's just one thing left to hope.
"I've kind of had this dream that the bot will eventually get to tweet its own name," he said, adding that he personally refers to the project with no dashes, symbols, underscores or uppercase letters: nytfirstsaid.

Texto completo: [All-Star]
When Major League Baseball's finest players assemble for the All-Star Game at Cleveland's Progressive Field on Tuesday, it will mark the 90th time that the "Midsummer Classic" has been held, pitting the cream of the crop from the National League against their American League peers. Since 1933, All-Star Games have been played each year except 1945 (because of World War II) and twice a year from 1959 to 1962.
"All-star games" -- and the term "all-star" itself -- long predate 1933, however. John Thorn, the official historian of Major League Baseball, told me "the term 'all-star' indeed goes back, back, back." The idea of an all-star game, played by all-star teams, is even older than the sport's use of the word.
Mr. Thorn identifies a series of amateur games played in 1858 at the Fashion Race Course in Queens County, N.Y. as baseball's first all-star contest, with the best players from Manhattan vying against their rivals from Brooklyn, then still a separate city. But those elite teams were known simply as "picked nines."
So how did the "all-star" appellation come to be associated with baseball in the first place? The history of the term is rooted in theatrical productions. Popular stage entertainers have been likened to celestial bodies at least since 1751, when a Dublin writer using the pen name Harry Rambler dedicated his dramatic poem "Bays in Council" to an actress known as Mrs. Bland, to whom he expressed the hope that "you may Shine the brightest Theatric Star, that ever enliven'd or charm'd an Audience."
By the mid-19th century, it was commonplace to call notable performers "stars," especially in promotional material seeking to lure the public. An 1853 New York Times advertisement for the Washington Circus, for instance, boasted of "A Tremendous Bill" with "All the Star Performers." A year later, another circus troupe was billed in the Portage Sentinel of Ravenna, Ohio, as featuring "All Star Performers -- selected from the four principal Circuses of New York, Philadelphia, Boston and New Orleans."
As theatrical notices in the 1870s and 1880s touted "all star troupes" and "all star casts," a subtle shift in usage occurred. "All star" -- often hyphenated as "all-star" -- evolved into its own adjective, and eventually a noun, to describe talented people.
By 1887, the new term had spread to baseball. In November, the New York Giants, supplemented by Boston Beaneaters star Mike "King" Kelly, traveled to play an exhibition game against a California League team from Oakland. The Giants lost, and the San Francisco Examiner reported that "everyone appeared glad that the 'all-star' team had been defeated." (The Giants would go on to win their first National League pennant the next year.)
As for "all-star games," football evidently beat baseball to the punch. In 1897, the Chicago Tribune shared the news of "an 'all star' game" planned between Northwestern University's varsity football team and the school's alumni. A year later, the Chicago Athletic Association hosted its own charity "all-star game" featuring "heroes of former famous gridiron contests." But it was baseball's All-Star Game -- hatched by Chicago Tribune sports editor Arch Ward as a "dream game" to celebrate the city's centennial at the 1933 World's Fair -- that launched "all-star" into common parlance.
Since then, musicians have frequently made use of the term, as when Louis Armstrong assembled a jazz supergroup in the 1940s dubbed Louis Armstrong and His All-Stars. More recently, the 1999 Smash Mouth song "All Star," with its catchy refrain, "Hey now, you're an all-star," has given the word a boost, becoming the subject of countless internet memes.
It's fair to say that "all-star" has transformed into a lexical all-star.

Texto completo: Barbara Zirkin, a lifelong educator, a former associate dean of Stevenson University and an early developer of online learning programs, died June 20 from lung cancer in a hospice near her Baltimore County home.
Mrs. Zirkin was 75.
"Barbara was never about herself, ever," said Barry Ronald Zirkin, her husband of 54 years. "Her focus was never about her, but about the things she was doing or the people she was doing them with. The words 'I' and 'me' were almost alien to her."
The former Barbara Gottlieb was born in Columbia, S.C., in 1943, the daughter of Robert Gottlieb, an engineer, and Mildred Gottlieb, a homemaker. The family was Jewish and Mr. Zirkin said his future father-in-law moved his wife and two children frequently to escape the anti-Semitism hampering his career.
"Barbara was mostly protected from it, but she realized what was happening," said Mr. Zirkin, a professor of biochemistry and molecular biology at Johns Hopkins University's Bloomberg School of Public Health.
The couple met while attending the former Harpur College (now Binghamton University) in southern New York.
"Barbara always seemed to be outside the door of whatever class I had just finished," Mr. Zirkin recalled. He was smitten by the vibrant and independent young woman who always said exactly what she thought, though he later learned that she was interested romantically not in him, but in his roommate.
"She was told by her girlfriends not to bother with me because she would never be able to separate me from my basketball," he said.
Though Barbara Gottlieb never did learn to appreciate the intricacies of the star offense, the couple were married in 1965, the year after she graduated from New York's Hunter College. Their eldest son, William, was born in 1969; now, he is an emergency care physician in Towson. Their youngest son, Bobby, was born in 1971; a Democrat who represents Baltimore County in the state Senate.
The young family moved to Baltimore in 1973 when Barry Zirkin was offered a one-year contract at Hopkins. At the time, he was fielding an overture to be an assistant professor at Brown University in Rhode Island.
Nonetheless, Mrs. Zirkin didn't hesitate when her husband admitted that he wanted to accept the high-risk, challenging job in Maryland.
"It was a choice between absolute security and quicksand," Mr. Zirkin said. "When I brought the quicksand back to Barbara, she said, 'You need to find out who you are.'"
An avid, lifelong reader, Mrs. Zirkin earned a master's degree in English from The University of Rochester in the late 1960s, a second master's degree in education from Hopkins in the mid-1970s and a doctorate in education from Hopkins in 1984.
She taught high school for a few years in New York and Maryland but quit after becoming frustrated by the educational bureaucracy. After earning her graduate degrees, she began focusing on the administrative positions that became her calling.
"Barbara liked being able to make a difference," her husband said. "She cared about the students, she cared about the faculty, and she liked being able to figure out how to do things better. She was creative and she was organized."
In 1994, Mrs. Zirkin accepted a part-time job at Hopkins developing an online learning program.
"Barbara introduced online learning to the Bloomberg School of Public Health," Mr. Zirkin said, "though no one knows she did it because she refused to take credit for it."
Because online education was so new, there were no rules and Mrs. Zirkin finally had the freedom to innovate.
"She had ideas about stuff," Mr. Zirkin said. "Not just why the existing things were no good - that's the easy part, but what could be done instead. When you have a lot of ideas, some of them are bound to be bad. Barbara wasn't afraid of that."
Her expertise later proved invaluable when her husband started a part-time, fully online Master of Arts degree program in public health biology at the Bloomberg school.
"The only reason I knew how do it was because I spent five decades sitting on the other side of the kitchen table from Barbara taking notes," he said.
She later held increasingly senior administrative posts at the University of Maryland School of Pharmacy and at the Baltimore Hebrew Institute before becoming associate dean of Stevenson in 2009. She retired last summer.
In Mrs. Zirkin's spare time, she read the New York Times cover to cover every day - occasionally surprising her husband with a bit of sports trivia. Her tuneful soprano was a staple of the choir at Beth El Congregation in Pikesville, and she delighted in her sons and four grandchildren.
"She was always out doing something she cared about, such as delivering food to the poor," Mr. Zirkin said. "And she had a fabulous sense of humor, though it was usually directed at herself."
A funeral service was held June 23; Mrs. Zirkin is interred at Beth El Memorial Park in Randallstown.
In addition to her husband and two sons, who all are Baltimore County residents, Mrs. Zirkin is survived by a brother, Jim Gottlieb of Fairfax, Va.

'Ballet kink' melds dance with art

Texto completo: Artist Brendan Fernandes was dancing by himself for a moment at the spring gala for the Guggenheim's Young Collectors Council, lost in the throbbing music as if he were in a club, not at the base of Frank Lloyd Wright's rotunda, surrounded by hundreds of cocktail-wielding patrons.
Most eyes were on the professional dancers whom Fernandes had wrangled for the occasion, in a piece he had choreographed that mixed ballet and shibari, the Japanese art of rope bondage.
Clad in minimal black, the dancers were all wearing segments of thick rope on their upper bodies, and sometimes the shirtless men were chained to a large metal armature that served as a stage as they stretched and writhed. (The women were exempt from that.)
It was an example of what Fernandes, 39, calls "ballet kink," part of his genre-bending and boundary-pushing method that melds dance with visual art and has earned him a place in multiple exhibitions this year. The Biennial at the Whitney Museum of American Art, for instance, currently features his work "The Master and Form" on the fifth floor, at set hours on weekends through Sept. 22. Last week, "Brendan Fernandes, a Call and Response" opened at the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago.
The interdisciplinary practice that he has concocted over the last 15 years fits a cultural moment in which museums are featuring more performance, and institutions like the Shed are designed for it. But Fernandes said he was skeptical of "artists who say, 'I use dance.'"
"I come to it from lived experience," added Fernandes, who trained for years as a ballet dancer. As dance performances go, "The Master and Form" at the Whitney is slow and teasing. No one makes a jete across the floor in the piece.
After a long bout of stretching that is part of the work and then reappears throughout, dancers clad in black make their way around a minimal arrangement of scaffolding - designed by Fernandes with architecture firm Norman Kelley - emphasizing and drawing out every move.
At one preview in May, the audience looked a bit puzzled at first - was this it? The big finale consists of the troupe standing in front of the museum's large windows and grabbing onto long, thick ropes suspended from the ceiling before leaning and pulling on them.
Fernandes doesn't perform in his creations, but he's performative in the way of the modern art impresario. A few days after the Guggenheim gala, he posted a picture on Instagram of himself and the male dancers from the performance: They were on all fours, and he was holding their ropes as if they were dogs on leashes. "#zaddy handling the #pups!" read the caption
Fernandes, who lives in Chicago, was born in Nairobi, Kenya, to parents of Indian descent, and grew up mostly in Toronto. His diverse background is evidenced in his art, which pulls from classical dance traditions, queer culture, S&M and the conceptual-art probings of the more typical museum artist
"Brendan is a hybrid, and he's refreshing in the art world," said Pamela Joyner, a San Francisco collector and self-proclaimed balletomane who owns a sculpture by Fernandes called "Fourth Position." "Most people who work with dance in the museum context don't get it quite right," she added. "He knows how dancers' bodies work."
His work has a central theme, found in a question Fernandes posed casually over coffee: "How do we find freedom in restraints?"
It is, of course, a central question in ballet.
He didn't mean only restraints of the leather kind, but also much larger cultural burdens, like colonialism, which he addressed in "Authority Inside" (2016), a ballet staged in the archival vault of the African collection at the Agnes Etherington Art Centre in Kingston, Ontario.
Fernandes fits well into the context of the 2019 3iennial, which "brings forward the performative element," said Rujeko Hockley, who organized the exhibition with Jane Panetta.
She noted that both she and Panetta studied ballet, helping to explain the prominence of dance in the exhibition, which includes Madeline Hollander's site-specific "Ouroboros: Gs," exploring the ways in which the Whitney has had to adapt in the Face of climate change. It will be performed Sept. 19 and 22 to help close out the Biennial.
Hockley said it was partly the way Fernandes "plays with the audience's expectations" in his Biennial work, not giving them the soaring moves they might think are coming, that made it interesting.
"He brings forward the things that are often hidden - the stretching, the preparation," she said. "He finds beauty in that."
"The Master and Form" was first staged at the architecture-focused Graham Foundation for Advanced Studies in the Fine Arts in Chicago in 2018, and Fernandes sees it as an evolving work with different chapters. Coming iterations will be seen at the Noguchi Museum in New York in September and next year at the Asian Art Museum in San Francisco.
The culture of ballet, with its emphasis on control and discipline, is the foundation of his Biennial presentation. "It looks at the masochism, the sadism within it," said Fernandes, a graduate of the Whitney's Independent Study Program. "Ballet is definitely its own fetishized world. We don't want to admit to those things because we're ballet. We look effortless; we look pretty."
As viewers have discovered, the scaffolding doesn't put dancers under duress. "It's not a prison," Fernandes said. "It's a place to stretch and release," he added, "almost like a safe space."
Curators and dancers gravitate to the way he seeks a tonal balance even as he sometimes emphasizes ballet's "Black Swan" side.
"It's both a critique and a celebration of the form," said Amanda Jane Graham, who worked as a dramaturge for Fernandes on "Clean Labor" (2017), a site-specific piece about the overlooked efforts of hotel workers that was staged at the Wythe Hotel in Brooklyn.
Denise Markonish, a curator at Mass MoCA, who included Fernandes in the 2012-13 show "Oh, Canada," said that "Clean Labor" showed off his particular gifts. "The piece was incredible in the way he took the repetitive movements of hotel workers and turned them into choreography," Markonish said.
The intense rigors of ballet were impressed at an early age on Fernandes, who started taking ballet when he was 14. "When we were kids, we had to go into passe and develop our 'leg out,'" he said, referring to a classical ballet movement where a dancer bends one leg, like a triangle, with the foot near the knee of the other leg.
"My Russian teacher would take a lighter, and she would put it under us," he said. "So we had to hold up our leg for as long as we could. If we didn't, we got burned."
In the Toronto suburbs of his youth, ballet was not an expected pursuit for a boy "My parents were like, 'You need to be a doctor or a priest,'" Fernandes said. They eventually accepted his choice of career partly when Fernandes was eventually hired to teach dance at Northwestern University.
He went to York University in Toronto for his BA and then received an MFA from the University of Western Ontario. "In college, I was a double major, dance and visual arts," Fernandes said. "I remember being at a crossroads: How do I do both?"
The answer came partly out of necessity, when he tore his hamstring during his senior year in college.
It effectively ended one kind of career but helped lead to another.
The critics who sampled the Biennial may be mixed on Fernandes' contribution. Jerry Saltz of New York magazine seemed to enjoy being "caught in some sort of parasexualized movement enacted on various S&M-like devices," while Linda Yablonsky in The Art Newspaper said he had made "no forward strides" in terms of dance choreography.
Fernandes doesn't seem daunted.
It may be that in the deliberate movements of his works, Fernandes has found a version of control that works for him on two levels, both thematically and personally.
"I'm a restless creature," he said. "Stillness is hard."

When Major League Baseball's finest players assemble for the All-Star Game at Cleveland's Progressive Field on Tuesday, it will mark the 90th time that the "Midsummer Classic" has been held, pitting the cream of the crop from the National League against their American League peers. Since 1933, All-Star Games have been played each year except 1945 (because of World War II) and twice a year from 1959 to 1962.

So how did the "all-star" appellation come to be associated with baseball in the first place? The history of the term is rooted in theatrical productions. Popular stage entertainers have been likened to celestial bodies at least since 1751, when a Dublin writer using the pen name Harry Rambler dedicated his dramatic poem "Bays in Council" to an actress known as Mrs. Bland, to whom he expressed the hope that "you may Shine the brightest Theatric Star, that ever enliven'd or charm'd an Audience."
By the mid-19th century, it was commonplace to call notable performers "stars," especially in promotional material seeking to lure the public. An 1853 New York Times advertisement for the Washington Circus, for instance, boasted of "A Tremendous Bill" with "All the Star Performers." A year later, another circus troupe was billed in the Portage Sentinel of Ravenna, Ohio, as featuring "All Star Performers—selected from the four principal Circuses of New York, Philadelphia, Boston and New Orleans."
As theatrical notices in the 1870s and 1880s touted "all star troupes" and " all star casts ," a subtle shift in usage occurred. "All star" —often hyphenated as "all-star" —evolved into its own adjective, and eventually a noun, to describe talented people.
By 1887, the new term had spread to baseball. In November, the New York Giants, supplemented by Boston Beaneaters star Mike "King" Kelly, traveled to play an exhibition game against a California League team from Oakland. The Giants lost, and the San Francisco Examiner reported that "everyone appeared glad that the 'all-star' team had been defeated." (The Giants would go on to win their first National League pennant the next year.)
As for "all-star games," football evidently beat baseball to the punch. In 1897, the Chicago Tribune shared the news of "an 'all star' game" planned between Northwestern University's varsity football team and the school's alumni. A year later, the Chicago Athletic Association hosted its own charity "all-star game" featuring "heroes of former famous gridiron contests." But it was baseball's All-Star Game—hatched by Chicago Tribune sports editor Arch Ward as a "dream game" to celebrate the city's centennial at the 1933 World's Fair—that launched "all-star" into common parlance.
Since then, musicians have frequently made use of the term, as when Louis Armstrong assembled a jazz supergroup in the 1940s dubbed Louis Armstrong and His All-Stars. More recently, the 1999 Smash Mouth song "All Star," with its catchy refrain, "Hey now, you're an all-star," has given the word a boost, becoming the subject of countless internet memes.
It's fair to say that "all-star" has transformed into a lexical all-star.

Texto completo: Barbara Zirkin, a lifelong educator, a former associate dean of Stevenson University and an early developer of online learning programs, died June 20 from lung cancer in a hospice near her Baltimore County home.
Mrs. Zirkin was 75.
"Barbara was never about herself, ever," said Barry Ronald Zirkin, her husband of 54 years. "Her focus was never about her, but about the things she was doing or the people she was doing them with. The words 'I' and 'me' were almost alien to her."
The former Barbara Gottlieb was born in Columbia, S.C., in 1943, the daughter of Robert Gottlieb, an engineer, and Mildred Gottlieb, a homemaker. The family was Jewish and Mr. Zirkin said his future father-in-law moved his wife and two children frequently to escape the anti-Semitism hampering his career.
"Barbara was mostly protected from it, but she realized what was happening," said Mr. Zirkin, a professor of biochemistry and molecular biology at Johns Hopkins University's Bloomberg School of Public Health.
The couple met while attending the former Harpur College (now Binghamton University) in southern New York.
"Barbara always seemed to be outside the door of whatever class I had just finished," Mr. Zirkin recalled. He was smitten by the vibrant and independent young woman who always said exactly what she thought, though he later learned that she was interested romantically not in him, but in his roommate.
"She was told by her girlfriends not to bother with me because she would never be able to separate me from my basketball," he said.
Though Barbara Gottlieb never did learn to appreciate the intricacies of the star offense, the couple were married in 1965, the year after she graduated from New York's Hunter College. Their eldest son, William, was born in 1969; now, he is an emergency care physician in Towson. Their youngest son, Bobby, was born in 1971; a Democrat who represents Baltimore County in the state Senate.
The young family moved to Baltimore in 1973 when Barry Zirkin was offered a one-year contract at Hopkins. At the time, he was fielding an overture to be an assistant professor at Brown University in Rhode Island. Nonetheless, Mrs. Zirkin didn't hesitate when her husband admitted that he wanted to accept the high-risk, challenging job in Maryland.
"It was a choice between absolute security and quicksand," Mr. Zirkin said. "When I brought the quicksand back to Barbara, she said, 'You need to find out who you are.'"
An avid, lifelong reader, Mrs. Zirkin earned a master's degree in English from The University of Rochester in the late 1960s, a second master's degree in education from Hopkins in the mid-1970s and a doctorate in education from Hopkins in 1984.
She taught high school for a few years in New York and Maryland but quit after becoming frustrated by the educational bureaucracy. After earning her graduate degrees, she began focusing on the administrative positions that became her calling.
"Barbara liked being able to make a difference," her husband said. "She cared about the students, she cared about the faculty, and she liked being able to figure out how to do things better. She was creative and she was organized."
In 1994, Mrs. Zirkin accepted a part-time job at Hopkins developing an online learning program.
"Barbara introduced online learning to the Bloomberg School of Public Health," Mr. Zirkin said, "though no one knows she did it because she refused to take credit for it."
Because online education was so new, there were no rules and Mrs. Zirkin finally had the freedom to innovate.
"She had ideas about stuff," Mr. Zirkin said. "Not just why the existing things were no good - that's the easy part, but what could be done instead. When you have a lot of ideas, some of them are bound to be bad. Barbara wasn't afraid of that."
Her expertise later proved invaluable when her husband started a part-time, fully online Master of Arts degree program in public health biology at the Bloomberg school.
"The only reason I knew how do it was because I spent five decades sitting on the other side of the kitchen table from Barbara taking notes," he said.
She later held increasingly senior administrative posts at the University of Maryland School of Pharmacy and at the Baltimore Hebrew Institute before becoming associate dean of Stevenson in 2009. She retired last summer.
In Mrs. Zirkin's spare time, she read the New York Times cover to cover every day - occasionally surprising her husband with a bit of sports trivia. Her tuneful soprano was a staple of the choir at Beth El Congregation in Pikesville, and she delighted in her sons and four grandchildren.
"She was always out doing something she cared about, such as delivering food to the poor," Mr. Zirkin said. "And she had a fabulous sense of humor, though it was usually directed at herself."
A funeral service was held June 23; Mrs. Zirkin is interred at Beth El Memorial Park in Randallstown.
In addition to her husband and two sons, who all are Baltimore County residents, Mrs. Zirkin is survived by a brother, Jim Gottlieb of Fairfax, Va.

Divulga video violando a adolescente; pero lo exculpan porque es de “buena familia”

Texto completo: Un adolescente de 16 años se filmó mientras agredía sexualmente desde atrás a una joven de su misma edad en el transcurso de una fiesta en Nueva Jersey, Estados Unidos. El abuso con penetración se concretó, además, cuando la víctima se encontraba intoxicada, casi inconsciente en un sótano de la casa donde se realizaba la celebración, según las fuentes judiciales.
Luego del aberrante hecho, como si el abuso no fuera suficiente, y según señalaron los investigadores del caso, el joven envió a sus amigos el video junto con la leyenda: “Cuando la primera vez que tuviste relaciones sexuales fue una violación”.
Sin embargo, un juez de la Corte de familia del condado de Monmouth, de Nueva Jersey , llamado James Troiano, solicitó indulgencia para el joven porque “provenía de una buena familia” y que, por las características de su formación, “claramente es un candidato no solo para la universidad, sino para una buena universidad. Sus puntuaciones para ingresar a la universidad fueron muy altas”, aseguró.
La causa y los dichos de Troiano fueron difundidos por el New York Times. El medio estadounidense consigna también que el juez en cuestión, en una audiencia de septiembre de 2017, negó que el acto cometido por el adolescente haya sido una violación, ya que para él solo se considera “violación tradicional” cuando dos o más hombres atacan sexualmente a una mujer a punta de pistola.
Agregó que los fiscales de la causa debieron haber advertido a la víctima de que presentar cargos contra su abusador podría destruir la vida del adolescente. Troiano también cuestionó si el nivel de intoxicación de Mary era tan excesivo como para que no entendiera lo que estaba ocurriendo y no le dio demasiada importancia a los mensajes de texto del acusado porque “los jóvenes dicen muchas estupideces a sus amigos”.
Troinano utilizó todos estos argumentos para negar la moción presentada por los fiscales para que se juzgue al adolescente, como un adulto en un juzgado superior, ya que la ley de Nueva Jersey permite que los menores, a partir de los 15 años, sean juzgados como adultos cuando son acusados de delitos graves.
Pero los argumentos de este juez de 70 años no alcanzaron para evitar que G.M.C. -como fue identificado el imputado- sea tratado como adulto. Troiano fue reprendido severamente por una corte de apelaciones que despejó el camino para que el caso pase de la corte familiar a un tribunal penal de adultos, donde se espera que finalmente se haga justicia.
El caso
El hecho, que llegó esta semana al conocimiento de la opinión púlbica de los Estados Unidos gracias a la decisión de la corte de apelaciones, se remonta a 2017. Siempre según el testimonio de los fiscales del caso, el abuso ocurrió en el contexto de una fiesta en la que había unos 30 adolescentes.
La víctima, identificada como Mary para proteger su identidad, fue llevada, en medio de tropiezos, a un sótano de la casa donde se realizaba la fiesta por un grupo de adolescentes. Allí la sentaron en un sofá, le rociaron la cola con un desodorante de ambientes y la golpearon con tanta fuerza que al otro día tenía marcas en sus nalgas, según rezan los documentos judiciales reproducidos por el New York Times.
Entonces fue cuando se produjo el episodio que grabó G.M.C. donde se lo veía a él penetrando a la menor. Luego de esto, el adolescente salió del sótano y Mary fue encontrada en el piso con vómitos. La llevó hasta su casa la madre de un amigo.
A la mañana siguiente, Mary estaba confundida por su ropa desgarrada y los moretones que tenía en su cuerpo, y le dijo a su mamá que tenía miedo de que “hubieran ocurrido episodios sexuales en la fiesta” sin su consentimiento.

“No tengas miedo”, el clamor de nuevos ciudadanos a inmigrantes

Texto completo: NUEVA YORK – Arellano, Boena, Jawad, Kim, Kupriynenko, Lu, Mallol, Meléndez, Sosa, Stan, Tucker, Varela y Velázquez muestran la diversidad en los Estados Unidos. Los apellidos son parte de los 52 inmigrantes que se convirtieron en nuevos ciudadanos de los Estados Unidos en el Museo del 9/11. “No tengas miedo” , fue la frase en la que coincidieron algunos de ellos cuando fueron entrevistados, un mensaje que envían a los inmigrantes en Estados Unidos.
“Apoyaré y defenderé la Constitución y leyes de los Estados Unidos de América contra todos los enemigos, extranjeros y locales” , juraron al unísono jóvenes, adultos en plenitud y adultos mayores, guiados por Ken Cuccinelli , el director interino de Servicios de Ciudadanía e Inmigración ( USCIS ), nombrado por el presidente Donald Trump y conocido por sus duras posturas migratorias, pero que durante la ceremonia realizada el martes pasado destacó el valor de los extranjeros que asumieron a este país como su nuevo hogar.
El evento tuvo varios significados, primero porque los participantes fueron oficialmente ciudadanos naturalizados, además de formar parte de las celebraciones por el 4 de Julio que realiza esta dependencia del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional (DHS), pero quizá el más emotivo fue honrar la memoria de aquellos inmigrantes que murieron víctimas de los ataques a las Torres Gemelas en 2001, ya sea porque trabajaron en alguno de los edificios del World Trade Center o porque ayudaron después del atentado y su esfuerzo derivó en consecuencias fatales.
“El 9/11 no solo es un evento que ha quedado en el pasado, sus efectos continúan hasta nuestros días… murieron alrededor de 3,000 personas, gente originaria de 90 naciones” , narró Alice M. Greenwald , directora del Museo del 9/11, quien no pudo contener sus lágrimas cuando habló de los inmigrantes que murieron en el mayor ataque terrorista que ha vivido el país y destacó el caso de aquellos a quienes USCIS ayudó a identificar, incluido el dominicano Gregorio Manuel Chávez , quien se naturalizó en 1999 y tras un reportaje de The New York Times, el Gobierno colaboró para ubicar a sus familiares, quienes aportaron una imagen que se exhibe en el museo. Hubo otros cuatro casos similares. En la ceremonia de este martes, la hija de Gregorio tomó juramento como ciudadana en la misma zona donde murió su padre.
Hay historias familiares que pueden resultar complejas, difíciles de creer y, sobre todo, demostrar a las autoridades migratorias que son legítimas, ya que están atentas a casos donde cualquier indicio pudiera tratarse de un fraude: un matrimonio falso o familiares que no lo son.
Así lo vivió Adrián Varela , un mexicano que lleva seis años viviendo en los Estados Unidos, a donde llegó con la Residencia Permanente , un proceso que no fue fácil, ya que sus padres se mudaron a este país cuando él era pequeño, por lo que sus abuelos lo registraron a él y a su hermana como sus hijos. Eso les funcionó bien para tener tutores, pero complicó su proceso migratorio.
Varela reconoce que el personal de USCIS alzó una “bandera roja” a su caso, ya que no creía que sus padres eran sus padres, a pesar de que en México hubo un juicio que permitió a los abuelos devolver la patria potestad a sus progenitores.
“Metieron el caso a prevención de fraude, llamaron a varias entrevistas, a mi papá, a mi mamá, no quedaron conformes con todo eso, se entregaron muchas pruebas de relación, fotografías” , cuenta.
La única forma de confirmar que él era hijo de sus padres era con pruebas de ADN, un examen que USCIS puede solicitar en ciertos casos.
“Al final hicieron pruebas de ADN, porque sintieron que lo entregado no era suficiente”, dijo Adrián, quien es licenciado en Administración de la Hospitalidad y trabaja en hotelería. “Ya no quedó duda. Ellos son mis padres”.
Recibió su “green card” en Nueva York, a donde llegó con una visa provisional, por cuatro semanas, en lo que recibía su documento final. A los cinco años obligatorios aplicó por la ciudadanía y a los seis meses levantó la mano derecha para jurar lealtad al país.
“Tomo esta obligación libremente sin ninguna reserva”, expresó al lado de otros 51 nuevos estadounidenses.

La única forma de confirmar que él era hijo de sus padres era con pruebas de ADN, un examen que USCIS puede solicitar en ciertos casos.

Texto completo: The real threat to America
The future of America is not about the threat of immigrants and refugees. America is bigger and better than that. Welcoming immigrants is good for America.
That's what the Democrats are trying to say, in the impossible box of a debate. That's not pandering. It is the better angels of our nature. And, yes, that is who we are. Not fearful and cowering and bellowing, as President Donald Trump would have it.
The real threat to America is not immigrants but greed that allows massive inequality, no growth in middle-class wages, tax giveaways to the ultrawealthy, and the destruction of our natural resources and our kids' future to continue the rampage.
-- Tony Quintanilla, Chicago

Free health care for immigrants?
Regarding Democrats' support for health care for people in the U.S. illegally: The issue here is not simply free health care for the undocumented. It will likely go beyond that. Consider the benefit status of America's immigrants. A September 2015 study by the Center for Immigration Studies found that in 2012, 51% of immigrant households (legal or illegal) used at least one welfare program, 42% were on Medicaid, 40% received food assistance and 12% received cash assistance. Indeed, 76% of immigrant households with children were on welfare in 2012, according to the study. While a substantial number of native-born Americans are on welfare, the numbers for immigrants are higher. I doubt these numbers have changed much today. Is the thought that we can somehow provide free medical care while denying these other forms of assistance? Hardly, is my guess.
While I appreciate and sympathize with the plight of these immigrants, I believe our plate is full just providing health care and social services to Americans. Immigrants dependent on our safety net -- and many legal immigrants have been relying on it for many years -- are of no help to Social Security and, beyond that, are a growing drain on the overall federal budget.
-- Neil Gaffney, Chicago

Chicago's defiance of ICE
While we live in northwest Indiana, my wife and I have always spent a lot of time and money in the city of Chicago. Sporting events, dinners, plays and overnight stays have always been a part of our lives. Recently we have spent less time there due to the violence, even on the Mag Mile. We so looked forward to the election of Lori Lightfoot since she was so determined to change the attitudes in the entire city. We loved how she took control of her first council meeting. We are, however, disappointed in her refusal to follow federal law regarding cooperating with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. None of us is entitled to observe only the laws we agree with. Hopefully, Mayor Lightfoot will realize this and declare that Chicago is no longer a sanctuary city.
-- Tom and Rita Jerome, Winfield, Ind.

Definition of an American fascist
Henry A. Wallace, vice president under Franklin D. Roosevelt, wrote the following in The New York Times: "The American fascist would prefer not to use violence. His method is to poison the channels of public information. ... If we define an American fascist as one who in case of conflict puts money and power ahead of human beings, then there are undoubtedly several million fascists in the United States. ... They are patriotic in time of war because it is to their interest to be so, but in time of peace they follow power and the dollar wherever they may lead. ... (Fascists) can be identified by their appeal to prejudice and by the desire to play upon the fears and vanities of different groups in order to gain power. ... They claim to be super-patriots, but they would destroy every liberty guaranteed by the Constitution. They demand free enterprise, but are the spokesmen for monopoly and vested interest. ... Using the power of the state and the power of the market simultaneously they may keep the common man in eternal subjection."
Draw your own conclusion regarding our current state of affairs.
-- Marla Cowan, Glenview

'The Perfect Dog' opens at NCC Summer Theatre
A family musical based on a New York Times best-selling book opens July 10 in the Lab Theatre at Northampton Community College Summer Theatre.
John O'Hurley's "The Perfect Dog" comes to life in the playful show featuring a seven-member cast and directed by Clair M. Freeman.
"I'm really excited about this show, which is about accepting everyone for their uniqueness," says Bill Mutimer, summer theatre artistic director. "It's about Sam and her mutt, Max, and all the dogs and kids are played by adult actors."
"The Perfect Dog" was written in 2013 by O'Hurley, an actor best known for his role as J. Peterman on "Seinfeld." O'Hurley has emceed the Kennel Club of Philadelphia's National Dog Show, which is aired on NBC at Thanksgiving since 2002. He also has written two other books with dog-related themes: "Life Lessons from a Wise Old Dog to a Young Boy" and "It's Okay to Miss the Bed on the First Jump."
O'Hurley's story was made into a musical in 2016, with music and lyrics by David Abbinanti and book by Jill Abbinanti.
In the story, Sam Brown is a 12-year old perfectionist who is searching for a flawless dog to enter in the town's dog contest and impress Ideal Ida. When she can't find any dogs in town that are perfect enough, she turns to unruly family dog, Max, who she wants to train, but who is less than eager to obey commands. In the end, Sam and Max learn that there is no such thing as perfect, but there is such a thing as being perfect for each other.
The musical stars Katie Gilhooley as Sam and Dedrick Ramos as Max. Also in the cast are Matthew Camardo as Mr. Brown and a yorkie; Emma Gerstein as Mrs. Brown, Mrs. Hayes and Ideal Ida; Garrett Shin as Charlie and a bulldog; Kiana Clarke as Alex, and Joshua Battisti as a German shepherd.
A portion of the ticket sales from the show will be donated to Animals in Distress, a no-kill animal shelter in Coopersburg.
"The Perfect Dog," 1 p.m. Wednesday and Thursday, 10 a.m. Friday and Saturday, July 10 to Aug. 4, Lab Theatre, Lipkin Theatre, Kopechek Hall, Northampton Community College, 3585 Green Pond Road, Bethlehem. Tickets: $10, $5 students. 484-484-3412, ncctix.org.
Sing for America presents area premiere of 'Tuck Everlasting'
For the second show of its summer season, Sing for America will stage the Lehigh Valley premiere of "Tuck Everlasting," a new musical based on the 1975 novel "Tuck Everlasting" by Natalie Babbitt.
The musical, being held July 4-6 at Cedar Crest College, will raise funds for families of area servicemen through Blue Star Mothers.
Founded by the Gilbert Family of Easton, Sing For America has raised more than $50,000 for families of active military since 2005 through song and dance performances and through musical productions since 2011.
"Tuck Everlasting" features music by Chris Miller, lyrics by Nathan Tysen and a book by Claudia Shear and Tim Federle. It ran on Broadway in 2016, when it was nominated for a Tony Award. It explores the concept of immortality, and suggests it might not be as desirable as it may seem.
When Winnie Foster sees a boy drink from a spring in Treegap Wood, she follows him and is kidnapped by the boys family, the Tucks, who want to keep her from revealing the secret that drinking from the spring makes them immortal.
The boy, Jesse, becomes fond of Winnie and asks her to drink the water when she is 17 so they can be married. Meanwhile Winnie's family is searching for her, and a mysterious man in a yellow suit discovers secret of the spring. He plans to sell the water, but is killed in self-defense by Mae Tuck, forcing the Tucks to leave town. When Winnie turns 17, she contemplates drinking the water, but ultimately pours it out.
"Tuck Everlasting," 5 p.m. July 4, 11 a.m. July 5 and 2 and 7:30 p.m. July 6, Alumnae Hall, Cedar Crest College, 100 College Drive. Allentown. Tickets: $18, $15 seniors and students, $12 children under age 6. 610-417-2189, www.singforamerica.com.
Munopco announces 2019-2020 season
Municipal Opera Company (Munopco), Allentown's oldest community theater, has announced its 2019-2020 season, which features both a contemporary and a classic musical.
The theater group, which performs at the Scottish Rite Cathedral in Allentown, will present the ABBA jukebox musical "Mamma Mia!" in October, and "Gypsy," which has been called the "greatest American musical" in March.
It is part of an overall plan by Munopco's board to appeal to a broader audience.
"We are committed to changing the face of Munopco," says Daniel Petrovich, who directed "A Chorus Line" at Munopco in March.
Munopco ran into financial problems during the 2009 recession when grants dried up and ticket sales lagged. For two years, Munopco stopped doing its trademark Broadway musicals and turned to revues, which had cheaper royalties and used recorded music.
In 2011, Munopco tried something different with the Terrence McNally Broadway musical "Catch Me If You Can." Since then, the theater has balanced more contemporary fare such as "The Producers" and "Hairspray" with traditional musicals like "Brigadoon."
"This is what we went to be," says Petrovich. "We still want to do big old-fashioned musicals, but it's no longer our bread and butter."
"Mamma Mia!" premiered on Broadway in 2001 and is the longest-running jukebox musical in Broadway history.
It is based on the hot songs of the Swedish pop group ABBA and follows free-spirited Donna and her son-to-be wed daughter Sophie, who is trying to figure out which of three men is her father so he can walk her down the aisle. The show features songs such as "Dancing Queen", "Knowing Me, Knowing You", "Take a Chance on Me", "The Winner Takes It All", "Voulez-Vous", "SOS" and the title track.
Performance dates are Oct. 12, 13, 18, 19 and 20.
"Gypsy" is a 1959 musical with music by Jule Styne, lyrics by Stephen Sondheim, and a book by Arthur Laurents. The story is loosely based on the 1957 memoirs of Gypsy Rose Lee, the famous striptease artist, and focuses on Gypsy's mother, Rose, whose name has become synonymous with "the ultimate stage mother." The musical contains many songs that became popular standards, including "Everything's Coming up Roses," "Together (Wherever We Go)," "Small World," "You Gotta Get a Gimmick," "Let Me Entertain You," "All I Need Is the Girl" and "Rose's Turn."
Performance dates are March 21, 22, 27 and 28. Tickets are available at www.munopco.org.

Ten Medical Myths We Should Stop Believing. And Doctors Should, Too.

Texto completo: You might assume that standard medical advice was supported by mounds of scientific research. But researchers recently discovered that nearly 400 routine practices were flatly contradicted by studies published in leading journals.
Of more than 3,000 studies published from 2003 through 2017 in JAMA and the Lancet, and from 2011 through 2017 in the New England Journal of Medicine, more than 1 in 10 amounted to a “medical reversal”: a conclusion opposite of what had been conventional wisdom among doctors.
“You come away with a sense of humility,” said Dr. Vinay Prasad of Oregon Health and Science University, who conceived the study. “Very smart and well-intentioned people came to practice these things for many, many years. But they were wrong.”
Some of those ideas have been firmly dislodged, but not all. Now Prasad and his colleagues are trying to learn how widespread are discredited practices and ideas.
Here are 10 findings that contradict what were once widely held theories.
Peanut allergies occur whether or not a child is exposed to peanuts before age 3.
Pediatricians have counseled parents to keep babies away from peanuts for the first three years of life. As it turns out, children exposed to peanuts before they were even 1 year old have no greater risk of peanut allergies.
Fish oil does not reduce the risk of heart disease.
At one point, the notion that fish fats prevented heart trouble did seem logical. People whose diets contain a lot of fatty fish seem to have a lower incidence of heart disease. Fatty fish contains omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 supplements lower levels of triglycerides, and high levels of triglycerides are linked to an increased risk of heart disease. Not to mention that omega-3 fatty acids seem to reduce inflammation, a key feature of heart attacks.
But in a trial involving 12,500 people at risk for heart trouble, daily omega-3 supplements did not protect against heart disease.
A lifelike doll carried around by teenage girls will not deter pregnancies.
These dolls wail and need to be “changed” and “cuddled.” The idea was that girls would learn how much work was involved in caring for an infant. But a randomized study found that girls who were told to carry around “infant simulators” actually were slightly more likely to become pregnant than girls who did not get the dolls.
Ginkgo biloba does not protect against memory loss and dementia.
The supplement, made from the leaves of ginkgo trees, was widely used in ancient Chinese medicine and still is promoted as a way to preserve memory. A large federal study, published in 2008, definitively showed the supplement is useless for this purpose. Yet ginkgo still pulls in $249 million in sales. Did people just not get the message?
To treat emergency room patients in acute pain, a single dose of oral opioids is no better than drugs like aspirin and ibuprofen.
Yes, opioids are powerful drugs. But a clinical trial showed that much safer alternatives relieve pain just as well among emergency room patients.
Testosterone treatment does not help older men retain their memory.
Some men have low levels of testosterone and memory problems, and early studies had hinted that middle-aged men with higher testosterone levels seemed to have better-preserved tissue in some parts of their brains. Older men with higher testosterone levels also seemed to do better on tests of mental functioning.
But a rigorous clinical trial showed that testosterone was no better than a sugar pill in helping older men avoid memory loss.
To protect against asthma attacks, it won’t help to keep your house free of dust mites, mice and cockroaches.
The advice from leading medical groups has been to rid your home of these pests if you or your child has asthma. The theory was that allergic reactions to them can trigger asthma attacks. But intensive pest management in homes with children sensitized to mouse allergens did nothing to reduce the frequency of their asthma attacks, researchers reported in 2017.
Step counters and calorie trackers do not help you lose weight.
In fact, the reverse is true. Among 470 dieters followed for two years, those who wore devices tracking the steps they took and calories they burned actually lost less weight than those who just followed standard advice.
Have a torn knee meniscus? Try physical therapy first, surgery later.
An estimated 460,000 patients in the United States get surgery each year to fix knee cartilage that tears, often because of osteoarthritis. The tear is painful, and many patients fear that if it is not surgically treated, the pain will linger.
But when patients with a torn meniscus and moderate arthritis were randomized to six months of physical therapy or surgery, both groups improved, and to the same extent.
If a pregnant woman’s water breaks prematurely, the baby does not have to be delivered immediately.
Sometimes, a few weeks before a woman’s due date, the membrane surrounding her fetus ruptures and amniotic fluid spills out. Obstetricians worried that bacteria could invade what had been a sterile environment around the fetus, causing infection. Better to deliver the baby immediately, doctors thought.
But a clinical trial found that if obstetricians carefully monitor the fetus while waiting for labor to begin naturally, the fetus is at no greater risk for infection. And newborns left to gestate were healthier, with less respiratory distress and a lower risk of death, than those who were delivered immediately after a break.

Texto completo: ‘It cannot wait for the actions of the Congress or the courts. We face a moment of moral and constitutional crisis, and men of generosity and vision must make themselves heard in every section of this country.”
Fifty-six years ago, when the annual meeting of the U.S. Conference of Mayors was first held in Honolulu, President John F. Kennedy told the leaders of cities large and small that the shining goals of civil rights and racial equality would be won or lost in their towns, in their neighborhoods, in their local classrooms and on their city payrolls.
It was a powerful speech, one that is still quoted despite the outdated use of the word “men” to mean “all people.” Reading Kennedy’s words is a reminder of what America set out to do, what our country accomplished and where we still fall short. It is also a reminder of what Hawaii meant to all those visiting mayors.
That was the summer of the demonstrations in Birmingham, Ala., against segregated schools, the arrest of thousands of protesters, a scourge of terrible violence.
“It is clear to me that the time for token moves and talk is past,” President Kennedy said in Honolulu. “It is our responsibility, yours and mine, to see that they are won in a peaceful and constructive way and not won in the streets. The events in Birmingham have stepped up the tempo of the nationwide drive for full equality, and rising summer temperatures are often accompanied by rising human emotions.”
The president spoke of new civil rights legislation but said that the passages of laws was not enough. “Justice cannot wait for too many meetings,” he said.
So here we are, decades later, hotter than ever and still waiting. We have added different, more specific terms to discuss issues of equality — like social justice, human rights, women’s rights and pride — and we call racism by its name rather than tiptoe around “issues of race.” But there is so much still to be fixed.
The 1963 meeting put a spotlight on Hawaii as a place where races blended with little friction.
Detroit Mayor Jerome Cavanaugh, who attended the conference in ’63, said that in Honolulu, with its diverse population, he saw “many examples of racial harmony that could serve as a model for the nation.”
It’s a reputation that lingers today, even though we know the reality is more complicated. But we’re still an object of fascination or wishful thinking, judging by the long piece that ran in The New York Times on Sunday praising Hawaii’s diversity as an antidote to racism. The headline: “Want to be less racist? Move to Hawaii.”
If only that were true, then all the mayors who came to Waikiki last week could take home their pocket full of peace and spread it around like a salve. Kennedy spoke of giving “all Americans a fair chance for an equal life.” In 2019 we’re arguing what “all” means, what “fair” means, what “equal” means and what it means to be American.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – E. Jean Carroll recently ignited a firestorm when she alleged Donald Trump sexually assaulted her more than two decades ago in the mid-1990s.
Her book that details the alleged assault is out Tuesday.
The alleged assault was first reported on June 21 when New York Magazine published an excerpt of her book, "What Do We Need Men For?: A Modest Proposal. " The excerpt also includes details of other alleged assaults Carroll says she faced throughout her life.
Carroll's sexual misconduct allegation is not the first such allegation against Trump. But it is the first such allegation to come to light since he took office as president. At least 15 other women have accused Trump of sexual misconduct. The president has denied all allegations.
Trump has likewise denied Carroll's allegation. He has suggested she is lying to sell books and has also said "she's not my type. "
'She's not my type': Trump again denies E. Jean Carroll's sexual misconduct allegation
Here's what you need to know about Carroll and her allegation against Trump:
What she's alleged
While leaving Bergdorf Goodman, a posh Manhattan department store, in either the fall of 1995 or the spring of 1996, Carroll wrote that she encountered Trump. She said she greeted him as "that real-estate tycoon," and he greeted her as "that advice lady. "
He told her that he was looking to buy a present for a "girl" and asked for the advice columnist to advise him, she wrote. She pointed out handbags and hats, but Trump pointed out lingerie and asked Carroll to try on a piece, she said. After going into a dressing room, Carroll claimed, Trump forced himself on her.
"The moment the dressing-room door is closed, he lunges at me, pushes me against the wall, hitting my head quite badly, and puts his mouth against my lips," Carroll wrote. "He holds me against the wall with his shoulder and jams his hand under my coat dress and pulls down my tights. "
Carroll alleged Trump "opens the overcoat, unzips his pants, and, forcing his fingers around my private area, thrusts his penis halfway – or completely, I’m not certain – inside me. " The episode lasted no longer than three minutes, Carroll said. It was the last time she had sex, she wrote.
She said that she only told two people following the alleged incident. Lisa Birnbach and Carol Martin, who were not named in the excerpt, but who have since come forward saying that Carroll told them about the incident when it allegedly happened more than 20 years ago.
More: Before the White House, Trump faced an array of sexual misconduct accusations. As president, he faces another
Why she came forward
Carroll said that she was prompted by the #MeToo movement, which made her reflect on the "most revolting scoundrels" she had ever met, according to the excerpt.
"As the riotous, sickening stories of #MeToo surged across the country, I, like many women, could not help but be reminded of certain men in my own life," she wrote.
She created a "Most Hideous Men of My Life List," which has 21 names, including Trump.
During an interview with the New York Times, Carroll said she "felt like a fraud" for never speaking up about her alleged assaults, despite repeatedly advising other women over the years to report such allegations.

Where her politics stand
Carroll, who is a registered Democrat according to the Washington Post, said last week that she will be supporting Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. , in the 2020 election.
Warren is one of 24 candidates vying to be the Democratic nominee in 2020 and face-off against Trump as he seeks re-election.
In an interview with Vanity Fair, Carroll said Warren is her "candidate. "
"She’s brave. She took on Wall Street. She absolutely believes in the middle class. And she has plans for health care, for educating the children," Carroll said.
"She feels their pain and she’s just so bright. She just feels to me unstoppable," she continued. "She’s just the best candidate and the smartest and will do the best for the country. She speaks in complete sentences. She’s like Barack Obama in that way. She’s got a plan. "
In 2016, Carroll said she voted for Hillary Clinton, also according to the Washington Post. In the current election cycle, Carroll has donated $1,000 to Emily’s List, the Post reported. In addition, she donated $500 to President Barack Obama's re-election campaign in 2012.
Carroll has been critical of Trump. She told Vanity Fair that she paid $100 to send a plaque to Melania Trump that said “For Idiocies Suffered as a Result of Being Donald Trump’s First Lady. ”
However, she said that coming forward publicly with her sexual assault allegation was not for political reasons.
“This is not political,” Carroll told the Post. “Sexual violence is not political. ”
Who she is
Carroll was born in Detroit, Michigan, and raised in Fort Wayne, Indiana. She attended Indiana University. While at the university, she won the Miss Cheerleader USA title in 1964.
For more than twenty years, Carroll has penned an advice column for Elle, entitled "Ask E. Jean. "
From 1994 to 1996, Carroll also hosted a talk show on NBC. She created a website based on her column, where users can get instant video replies to their questions.
Carroll has been a contributor to Esquire, Outside, and Playboy magazines.
Carroll was a writer for "Saturday Night Live" in the 1980s.

Texto completo: Shoot the moon. That's what "Apollo's Muse" - a photo-driven exhibition launching Wednesday at the Metropolitan Museum of Art marking the 50th anniversary of the lunar landing on July 20, 1969 - is all about.
Subtitled "The Moon in the Age of Photography," the show, running through Sept. 22, features more than 170 photographs, including the iconic snap of Buzz Aldrin by fellow Apollo astronaut Neil Armstrong, which shows the lunar surface in a mirror-faced space helmet.
"The Apollo 11 moon landing was a major event in human history, one that has changed the way we think about our place in the cosmos," Mia Fineman, exhibit curator, tells amNewYork. "Photography, in both a scientific and artistic way, was an important part of this whole landmark journey."
Fineman was 3 when her parents plopped her down in front of their television set to witness "one giant leap for mankind." They were among a half a billion people around the world who watched as images of American astronauts on the moon were beamed 238,900 miles back to earth a half-century ago.
But centuries before that, Earth's natural satellite had already captivated people's curiosity and fascination. The Met exhibit "traces back that history," explains Met director Max Hollein, who describes the moon as a "nearly universal source of fascination and inspiration."
Oscar-winner and acknowledged space geek Tom Hanks echoes that sentiment in his introduction to the book accompanying "Apollo's Muse."
"From the earliest days of human history, no matter where our kind was scattered, the moon was a mystery," writes the "Apollo 13" star. "Was that a face looking down on us? Did the gods live there? Or a big rabbit? Or a divine woman? Maybe a race of cricket-men?"
Photography has helped answer those question. "As soon as photography was invented, the moon was a target and focus," according to Fineman.
While photos make up the bulk of the show, there's an array of drawings, paintings, film clips, astronomical instruments and NASA cameras. Across the show's five galleries, there's something for everyone.
Photography fans will savor two newly discovered lunar daguerreotypes from the 1840s, which, says Fineman, are believed to be the earliest photographs of the moon in existence. Works by 19th-century lunar photography pioneers Warren De La Rue, Lewis Morris Rutherfurd and John Adams Whipple are also on view.
Science aficionados will appreciate a book of lunar etchings by Galileo published in 1610 that helped give birth to selenography, the science of the moon's surface.
Sci-fi geeks will be over-the-moon for lunar-centric cinematic excerpts which, beyond their kitschy qualities, offer reminders of the overlap between art and science. Perch on a bench and check out clips of Georges Méliès 1902 classic "A Trip to the Moon," Fritz Lang's 1929 "Woman in the Moon" and Irving Pichel's 1950 "Destination Moon."
A 1968 mini dress, made of paper and printed with NASA rocket ships on the front and back shows how space had blasted its way into the fashion of the times. Created by Harry Gordon, the mod frock is part of a series of disposable poster dresses that could be cut at the seams and hung on the wall.
For an "eagle has landed" flashback, a vintage television console plays CBS News television coverage - actual footage and simulation. The look of excitement seen on the face of anchor Walter Cronkite is the real deal.
"It's a truly dramatic moment," says Fineman. "But as a 3-year-old, I didn't appreciate that things like this didn't happen all the time."
Fifty years later, Hanks wonders: "Who will attempt the next lunar landing with its so-very-slim margin for error? Who is going to go where no woman has gone before?"
Feeling moonstruck? Don't snap out of it! Consider: Just in time for the lunar landing 50th anniversary, Christie's is auctioning space-exploration artifacts including the Apollo 11 Lunar Module Timeline Book used by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin to navigate the Eagle onto the moon's surface. Moondust included (seriously). It's expected to fetch $7-$9 million. Here are three more options with down-to-earth prices. One Giant Leap: The Apollo 11 Moon Landing, 50 Years On Tony-winning playwright J.T. Rogers ("Oslo") understands the value of teamwork. "In a moment of great political upheaval and divisiveness, remember what it meant when we worked and did something together." That's one theme of his new 45-minute drama about the space race drawn from transcripts, news reports and interview that will be read at this event by stars like Lauren Ambrose, Jeff Daniels and Samuel L. Jackson. The idea for the play came to Rogers from a science writer at The New York Times, which presents this event that also includes chats with Apollo 11 command module pilot Michael Collins and Peggy Whitson, the first woman commander of the International Space Station and others. (Town Hall, July 21, 7 p.m., $50 and up) Apollo, a Party! Space-themed music, drinks, treats, solar observations and stargazing with members of the Amateur Astronomers Association and more events are on tap at this evening family affair. (New York Hall of Science, Queens, July 20, 7-10 p.m.) Moon Landing: 50th Anniversary Celebration Space is the summer reading theme at the New York Public Library. "The moon landing was a remarkable moment in U.S. History, one that showcased to a generation that literally anything is possible," NYPL interim chief library manager, Caryl Matute   tells amNewYork. "The sky's the limit." Readings and events run through the summer. Check NYPL.org.

Taylor Swift, And Artists' Fight to Own Their Work

Texto completo: It is one of the oldest and hardest lessons of the music industry: No matter how successful artists may be, chances are someone else owns their work.
Prince, protesting how his label, Warner Bros., had control over his master recordings, quipped in 1996: "If you don't own your masters, your master owns you." That same year, when Janet Jackson negotiated a landmark contract with Virgin Records, ownership of her original recordings was a major deal point.
Now we can add Taylor Swift to the chorus of artists who have bemoaned that their creative work is someone else's property, as she once again used her social-media megaphone to stir debate about the inner workings of the music industry.
In a Tumblr post on Sunday, Swift responded bitterly to the news that her former label, Big Machine, had been sold for more than $ 300 million to a company run by Scooter Braun, the manager of pop stars including Justin Bieber and Ariana Grande.
Swift had strong personal objections to the deal, which included the rights to her first six albums, blaming Braun for orchestrating "incessant, manipulative bullying" against her by Kanye West, an on-and-off client.
But the episode also highlighted the fraught and little-understood industry politics of master recordings -- the original copies of an artist's work -- and the copyrights associated with them.
The owner of a master controls all rights to exploit it, including selling albums or licensing songs for movies or video games. The artist still earns royalties from those recordings once associated costs are fulfilled, but controlling the master could bring greater income, as well as a level of protection over how the work is used in the future. (These rights are separate from copyrights for songwriting.)
The deep significance that musicians attach to their masters was highlighted last month, when a group of artists sued the Universal Music Group over a fire in 2008 that destroyed many original recordings, after an exposé was published in The New York Times Magazine.
Historically, record companies have retained rights to masters in exchange for the financial risks they take in backing an artist over the course of their contract.
"Fundamentally, the business model that most record companies operate under is not unlike the venture capital business," said Larry Miller, the director of the music business program at New York University's Steinhardt School of Culture, Education and Human Development.
"They make investments in unproven talent," he added. "The trade is that, traditionally, the masters stay with the record company."
Swift, despite appearing to have an almost unrivaled level of self-determination as a star -- like single-handedly getting Apple to change a royalties policy in 2015 -- signed such a deal with Big Machine in 2005, at the beginning of her career. Her post on Sunday was partly an admonishment to young artists to avoid those kinds of contracts.
"This is what happens when you sign a deal at fifteen to someone for whom the term 'loyalty' is clearly just a contractual concept," Swift wrote, in a jab at Big Machine's founder, Scott Borchetta.
Hours later, Borchetta posted a rejoinder, including a snippet of a deal proposal, that suggested that Swift could have earned her recording rights back had she renewed with Big Machine last year. Instead, she signed with Universal. (Her next album, "Lover," is due in August.)
Borchetta also called into question Swift's claim that she only learned of the deal once the news broke -- he said he texted her the night before -- and noted that her father, Scott Swift, was a minority shareholder in Big Machine.
The barbs between Swift and Borchetta, a rare example of such contractual dirty laundry being aired outside of litigation, captivated the industry and raised questions about the age-old power dynamic between artist and label.
"This kind of deal is neither unusual or controversial," the media mogul David Geffen said. "She didn't want to put up $ 300 million. Someone else did. They offered her a deal that she rejected to get ownership of her masters. Only time will tell who made the wise decision."
Geffen, whom Braun has frequently described as a mentor, added: "I'm betting that Scooter will build an important company with the addition of this asset."
Steve Stoute, a music and advertising executive whose new company, UnitedMasters, allows artists to keep their rights, saw the Swift episode as a painful illustration of what he called "the fundamental problem with the record industry."
"The record business historically runs the same business model as sharecropping," Stoute said. "You build it; we make you think that you own it; you act like you own it; but at the end of the day, we own it."
The battle between Swift and Braun also divided celebrities on social media, as accusations of exploitation intermingled with personal loyalties.
Some of Braun's clients, like Bieber and Demi Lovato, defended his personal character. "I have dealt with bad people in this industry and Scooter is not one of them," Lovato wrote on Instagram.
But other female artists took Swift's lead as an opportunity to discuss their own experiences in a business that has long faced criticism for its treatment of many creators, especially young women and people of color.
"I signed contracts when I was 15 & I'm still paying the consequences for it," the singer Sky Ferreira, now 26, wrote on Instagram after pointing people to Swift's blog post. "Insisting on your rights, value & ownership doesn't make you difficult." She added: "Just because this system has been the same for decades doesn't mean it's okay or you need to bow down to it."
In a statement expressing support for Swift, the pop singer Halsey wrote: "it turns my guts that no matter how much power or success a woman has in this life, you are still susceptible to someone coming along and making you feel powerless out of spite." Alessia Cara chimed in: "stop stealing from women who work hard!!!"
And the rapper Iggy Azalea, while interacting with fans on Twitter, added: "this is why I'm so happy to own my master for this new album, they really do ppl crazy dirty on ownership of their intellectual property in the biz." After years of limbo on major labels, Azalea recently announced a deal with the distributor Empire that gave her ownership of her recordings.
Tension over the ownership of recordings is nearly as old as the industry, but it has gained momentum as superstar artists have exerted greater control -- typically after years of work. Prince rebelled against Warner Bros. in the mid-1990s, after nearly two decades of hits. And when Jay-Z became president and chief executive of the Def Jam label in 2004, he insisted on earning back control of his masters on that label.
The industry's shift to streaming has begun to change the dynamic between artists and labels, which once held exceptional leverage through their ability to market albums and promote songs to radio stations. Given this change, some younger artists have leaned toward autonomy.
The singer and rapper XXXTentacion, for example, who was killed in a shooting last year, rejected traditional long-term label deals in favor of one-off contracts for each of his releases that offered lower payment upfront, but gave him full ownership and a higher royalty rate.
Swift's talent for fueling debate continued on Tumblr -- the platform where she frequently communes with her most faithful fans -- well after she published her account of the deal. "taylor will not be silenced," wrote one fan who earned acknowledgment from Swift.
Elsewhere, some questioned whether Swift, with her enormous wealth and reputation for careful self-mythologizing, was the best messenger for this ongoing battle, especially after Borchetta pushed back, sharing deal points and private text messages between the two parties.
But the power of Swift's fame made her message about the importance of ownership a vital lesson, Stoute said.
"If you're an artist today, you must go into the record deal owning your master," he said. "If not, then you are basically building an asset that you will not own."

Texto completo: The Kyrie Irving era in Boston is over, as he's off to join the league's newest superteam, the Brooklyn Nets.
Shortly after NBA free agency formally opened at 6 p.m. on Sunday, The Athletic reported Irving had agreed to a four-year, $142 million deal with Brooklyn. The fourth year, according to the report, is a player option.
That's far from all. The Nets will also add Kevin Durant , the former MVP and two-time champion with the Golden State Warriors, who'll miss the 2019-20 season with a torn Achilles', and DeAndre Jordan .
ESPN had the initial report that Durant's deal will be for four years and $164 million. It later reported both Irving and Durant are taking less than the maximum to allow Jordan, who split last season with Dallas and the Knicks after 10 with the Los Angeles Clippers, to sign for $10 million per year.
Durant formally announced his decision to join Brooklyn on Instagram. There was also an Irving announcement on social media, but it merely confirmed his previously reported decision to sign with Roc Nation Sports, replacing longtime agent Jeff Wechsler . Roc Nation also represents Durant.
Russell headed westBrooklyn free agent D'Ang­elo Russell , meanwhile, is off to Golden State and a four-year, $117 million contract. The Warriors and Nets agreed on a sign-and-trade that sends the 23-year-old point guard, a first-time All-Star last season who averaged 21.1 points and 7.0 assists per game with the Nets, to California along with — according to The Athletic — Treveon Graham and Shabazz Napier .
Earlier Sunday, the New York Times reported the five-time defending Western Conference champions retained Klay Thompson — who tore his ACL in the Finals loss to Toronto — with a five-year, $190 million max contract. To help fit the Russell contract under the salary cap, the Warriors (per ESPN) are trading Andre Igoudala to Memphis for draft picks.
Knicks stuck settling
The Knicks quickly became the butt of jokes on social media, having followed their failed efforts to land Zion Williamson via the top pick in the draft by whiffing on both Durant and Irving.
ESPN reported New York was unwilling to offer Durant, who'll be 31 in November and has played nearly 1,000 NBA games, a full max contract due to concerns over his recovery from the Achilles' injury he suffered during the Finals.
“While we understand that some Knicks fans could be disappointed with tonight's news, we continue to be upbeat and confident in our plans to rebuild the Knicks to compete for championships in the future, through both the draft and targeted free agents," Knicks president Steve Mills said in a statement.
New York didn't go emptyhanded Sunday. ESPN reported Julius Randle , who averaged 21.4 points per game in his lone season with New Orleans, agreed to a three-year, $63 million deal.
Yahoo Sports reported the last year of Randle's deal is a team option.
Taj Gibson is also in, ESPN reporting the longtime Bulls forward who spent the last two years with Minnesota agreed to a two-year, $20 million deal.
Butler to South Beach
Al Horford's arrival in Philadelphia meant the end of ­ Jimmy Butler 's time there.
According to The Athletic, the four-time All-Star is headed to the Miami Heat, his fourth organization since the start of the 2016-17 season. He will receive a four-year, $142 million max contract as part of a sign-and-trade deal.
Miami and Philadelphia were still working out some aspects of the swap, such as the addition of Dallas as the third team, according to the person who spoke to the Associated Press. The Heat will be sending Josh Richardson to Philadelphia and were in talks to trade Goran Dragic to Dallas as part of the move.
Butler met with the Heat right when free agency began at 6 p.m. Sunday and made clear that he wanted to be in Miami.
Harris, Sixers stick
Forward Tobias Harris , traded to the 76ers in February, is staying there on a five-year, $180 million contract. Multiple reports say the deal doesn't include a player option.
Harris played in all 82 games last season, averaging 18.2 points and 7.9 rebounds in 27 with the Sixers. He started all 12 playoff games for Philadelphia, to the tune of 15.5 points and 9.1 rebounds per game. The Sixers were eliminated by the Raptors in the East semifinals.
Along with Butler, guard JJ Redick is also leaving Philadelphia. He accepted a two-year, $26.5 million deal to join the New Orleans Pelicans.
Blazers buy on Lillard
A person with knowledge of the negotiations says Damian Lillard and Portland have agreed on a four-year Supermax extension that will be worth nearly $200 million.
The deal will kick in for the 2021-22 season, with a salary of nearly $44 million, and will end in 2024-25 with Lillard holding an option of nearly $55 million.
The Blazers will pay Lillard $29.8 million next season and $31.6 million in 2020-21.
Bucks make the call
Milwaukee All-Star Khris Middleton will sign a five-year, $178 million contract to remain with the Bucks. The fifth year is a player option, according to an Associated Press source.
Middleton was an All-Star for the first time last season, aver­aging 18.3 points per game for a 60-win Milwaukee team. His deal is not quite a max; he could have commanded closer to $190 million.
The Bucks are keeping around George Hill , The Athletic reporting he's agreed to a three-year, $29 million deal, but are moving on from ­Malcolm Brogdon . Indiana, according to multiple reports, is trading a first-round pick and two second-round picks for the 2016-17 Rookie of the Year, who'll sign a four-year, $85 million deal with the Pacers.
Around the league
■ Indiana is also adding guard Jeremy Lamb , its backup after Ricky Rubio agreed to a three-year, $51 million deal with the Phoenix Suns. Rubio was intrigued by the chance to play for new Suns coach Monty Williams and alongside shooting guard Devin Booker , a source told the AP. Rubio averaged 12.7 points and 6.1 assists last season for Utah, where he spent two seasons.
■ Former All-Rookie forward Bojan Bogdanovic is leaving Indiana for a four-year, $73 million deal with Utah, per ESPN. That deal will force the Jazz to either trade or waive Derrick Favors ; New Orleans is reportedly closing in on an agreement with him.
■ Restricted free agent ­Kristaps Porzingis is signing a five-year, $158 million max contract with the Dallas Mavericks, pairing the 7-foot-3-inch Latvian with fellow Euro star Luka Doncic . Porzingis and Doncic, the dynamic 20-year-old Slovenian guard who was just named Rookie of the Year, haven't played together yet. The 23-year-old Porzingis, acquired from the Knicks before the deadline last season, sat out all of last season after tearing the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee in February 2018.
■ Orlando held its two biggest free agents, agreeing to a four-year, $100 million deal with All-Star Nikola Vucevic and, according to his agent, a four-year, $54 million deal with center Terrence Ross .
The Magic also added Portland forward Al-Farouq Aminu , according to ESPN, on a three-year, $29 million deal — the third year is a player option.
■  Harrison Barnes is sticking in Sacramento on a four-year, $88 million deal, according to the New York Times. He'll be joined there by Trevor Ariza , on a reported two-year, $25 million deal, and Dewayne ­Dedmon , whose agents told The Athletic the center agreed to a three-year, $41 million deal after two seasons in Atlanta.
■  Rudy Gay plans to sign a two-year, $32 million deal to return to San Antonio, according to The Athletic. It also reported that forward DeMarre Carroll , with Brooklyn the last two seasons, is headed to the Spurs on a two-year, $13 million pact.
■ Center Jonas Valanciunas is staying in Memphis on a three-year, $45 million deal.
■  Derrick Rose , the oft-injured former MVP, agreed to a two-year, $15 million deal to go from Minnesota to Detroit, accord­ing to ESPN.
■ Two-time Celtic Gerald Green is returning to Houston on a one-year deal, his agent told ESPN.
■  Nerlens Noel of Everett, Mass., initially agreed to a new deal with Oklahoma City, but ESPN reported he asked for time to evaluate the agreement. The sixth overall pick in 2013 played 77 games for the Thunder last season, averaging 4.9 points and 4.2 rebounds.

Trump and Putin laugh at freedom of the press

Texto completo: In the past couple of weeks, President Trump has accused the New York Times of "a virtual act of treason" because of an accurate story he didn't like. It reported that the United States "is stepping up digital incursions into Russia's electric power grid."
And he's been credibly accused of rape by a well-known magazine journalist, to which he responded that it never happened and what's more, she was "not my type."
Apparently deadened by the constant barrage of outrages and scandals surrounding him, Congress and many Americans don't seem to care about any of it.
So there's absolutely no reason to think that what happened between the president of the United States and Russian leader Vladimir Putin on Friday will make a difference or change minds.
But it really should.
According to Bloomberg News reporter Jennifer Jacobs, who was traveling with the president to the G-20 summit in Osaka, Trump "bonded with Putin" over his scorn for journalists. She quoted their exchange in a tweet:
"Get rid of them. Fake news is a great term, isn't it?" Trump said. "You don't have this problem in Russia, but we do."
"We also have," Putin answered, in English. "It's the same."
They then "shared a chuckle," she reported.
That this happened on the first anniversary of the massacre of five employees of the Capital Gazette in Annapolis probably never occurred to him - nor would his staff remind him of something as apparently inconsequential to the administration as that horror.
The rape accusation, it appears, has failed to make any dent in Trump's reputation.
And it was largely downplayed by the cowed media - it never even got a hearing on the network Sunday news shows last weekend, just days after it hit. (The Washington Post was alone among major papers in putting it on its front page; The Post has also written a searing editorial on the subject.)
For many, if not most, the reaction can be summed up like this: We already knew that about him. Why would this matter?
He was, after all, famously caught on audio bragging about being a sexual abuser, though he explained it away as locker room talk. (More than a dozen other women have accused him of sexual misconduct.)
Trump has made no secret of his blatant disrespect for the press, which was a mainstay message of his 2016 presidential campaign - in fact, part of his appeal, apparently, to his most fervent followers.
Nor has he expressed much concern about the role of Saudi ruler Mohammed bin Salman in the murder of Washington Post contributing columnist Jamal Khashoggi inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul last October. Trump looked cozy with MBS during a quote "family photo" shoot at the G-20, standing between him and Turkish strongman Recep Tayyip Erdogan, known for jailing journalists.
But let's put our president's latest remarks about the news media in context. Putin is an outright enemy of journalistic freedom, one of the world's worst.
According to the Columbia Journalism Review, 59 journalists were murdered in Russia between 1992 and this year. And the World Press Freedom Index puts Russia near the bottom of the list as a place where journalists are safe and can do their jobs. (The United States, shamefully, has dropped on the list, barely ranking in the top 50.)
In the same session on Friday, Trump also yukked it up with perhaps his favorite authoritarian ruler on the topic of Russian interference in our elections.
Here's how the BBC, a news organization not given to wild overinterpretation, rendered it:
"U.S. President Donald Trump has appeared to make light of Russian election interference during a meeting with the country's leader, Vladimir Putin. A smirking Mr. Trump wagged his finger at the Russian president and said: 'Don't meddle in the election, please.'"
It was, as the BBC noted, the first time the two had met since special counsel Robert S. Mueller III concluded his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. His report concurred with U.S. intelligence agencies in concluding that Russia was behind an effort to influence the presidential election for Trump with state-authorized cyberattacks and a disinformation campaign on social media.
So, putting it plainly, Trump is joking with a foreign adversary about two of the most basic elements of American democracy: voting integrity and the role of a free press.
And he has the gall to accuse the press of treason?
Those who call themselves Americans should be disgusted by what Trump did in Osaka.
That many won't feel that way is almost as serious a betrayal of our bedrock values as what Trump himself has done - and will continue to do.

Texto completo: What did you think of the bunch of socialists you just saw debating onstage?
Wait, you may protest, you didn't see any socialists up there. And you'd be right. The Democratic Party has clearly moved left in recent years, but none of the presidential candidates are anything close to being actual socialists - no, not even Bernie Sanders, whose embrace of the label is really more about branding ("I'm anti-establishment!") than substance.
Nobody in these debates wants government ownership of the means of production, which is what socialism used to mean. Most of the candidates are, instead, what Europeans would call "social democrats": advocates of a private-sector-driven economy, but with a stronger social safety net, enhanced bargaining power for workers and tighter regulation of corporate malfeasance. They want America to be more like Denmark, not more like Venezuela.
Leading Republicans, however, routinely describe Democrats, even those on the right of their party, as socialists. Indeed, all indications are that denunciations of Democrats' "socialist" agenda will be front and center in the general election campaign. And everyone in the news media accepts this as the normal state of affairs.
Which goes to show the extent to which Republican extremism has been accepted simply as a fact of life, barely worth mentioning.
To see what I mean, imagine the media firestorm, the screams about lost civility, we'd experience if any prominent Democrat described Republicans as a party of fascists, let alone if Democrats made that claim the centerpiece of their national campaign. And such an accusation would indeed be somewhat over the top - but it would be a lot closer to the truth than calling Democrats socialists.
The other day The New York Times published an op-ed that used analysis of party platforms to place U.S. political parties on a left-right spectrum along with their counterparts abroad. The study found that the Republican Party is far to the right of mainstream European conservative parties. It's even to the right of anti-immigrant parties like Britain's UKIP and France's National Rally. Basically, if we saw something like America's Republicans in another country, we'd classify them as white nationalist extremists.
True, this is just one study. But it matches up with lots of other evidence. Political scientists who use congressional votes to track ideology find that Republicans have moved drastically to the right over the past four decades, to the point where they are now more conservative than they were at the height of the Gilded Age.
Or just compare the Republicans, point by point, with parties almost everyone would classify as right-wing authoritarians - parties like Hungary's Fidesz, which has preserved some of the forms of democracy but has effectively created a permanent one-party state.
Fidesz has cemented its power by politicizing the judiciary, creating rigged election rules, suppressing opposition media and using the power of the state to reward the party's cronies while punishing businesses that don't toe the line. Does any of this sound like something that can't happen here? In fact, does any of it sound like something that isn't already happening here, and which Republicans will do much more of if they get the chance?
One might even argue that the GOP stands out among the West's white nationalist parties for its exceptional willingness to crash right through the guardrails of democracy. Extreme gerrymandering, naked voter suppression and stripping power from offices the other party manages to win all the same - these practices seem if anything more prevalent here than in the failing democracies of Eastern Europe.
Oh, and isn't it remarkable how blasé we've become about threats of legal persecution and/or physical violence against anyone who criticizes a Republican president?
So it's really something to see Republicans trying to tar Democrats as un-American socialists. If they want to see a party that really has broken with fundamental American values, they should look in the mirror.
But that won't happen, of course. Whoever the Democrats nominate - even if it's Joe Biden - Republicans will paint him or her as the second coming of Hugo Chávez. The only question is whether it will work.
It might not, or at least not as well as in the past. By spending decades calling everything that might improve Americans' lives "socialist," Republicans have squandered much of the accusation's force. And Donald Trump, who was installed in office with Russian help and clearly prefers foreign dictators to democratic allies, is probably less able to play the "Democrats are unpatriotic" card than previous Republican presidents.
Still, a lot will depend on how the news media handle dishonest attacks. Will we keep seeing headlines that repeat false claims ("Trump Says Democrats Will Ban Hamburgers"), with the information that the claim is false buried deep inside the article? Will we get coverage of actual policy proposals, as opposed to horse-race analysis that only asks how those proposals seem to be playing?
I guess we'll soon find out.

Texto completo: Earlier this month, former New York police detective Luis Alvarez delivered a heartbreaking plea to Congress to extend the Sept. 11 Victim Compensation Fund, which provides financial assistance to first responders who had developed illnesses after responding to the 2001 terrorist attacks.
On Saturday, his family confirmed that the veteran of the NYPD had died at age 53, having succumbed the cancer he developed years after working at Ground Zero.
Family spokesman Matt McCauley confirmed to The Post that Alvarez had passed in the early hours of Saturday morning due to "9/11-related cancer. Alvarez developed colorectal and liver cancer in 2016.
"It is with peace and comfort, that the Alvarez family announce that Luis (Lou) Alvarez, our warrior, has gone home to our Good Lord in heaven today, the family said in a statement. "Please remember his words, Please take care of yourselves and each other.' We told him at the end that he had won this battle by the many lives he had touched by sharing his three year battle. He was at peace with that, surrounded by family.
Alvarez leaves behind his wife Lanie Alvarez and three children David, Tyler and Ben, according to The New York Times. He is also survived by his mother Aida and brothers, Fernando and Phil.
Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., one of the lead sponsors of the Sept. 11 Victim Fund renewal legislation, tweeted, "Det. Alvarez is by every definition a true American hero. It is one of the honors of my life that I got to work with him & call him a friend. My thoughts are with his family.
But Alvarez also lives on through his advocacy for his fellow first responders to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, and in the legislation he helped push through the House Judiciary Committee. On Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said the Senate hoped to pass the bill by August after he faced direct criticism from former Daily Show host Jon Stewart over his handling of the renewal.
Sitting beside Stewart at a June 11 hearing on the eve of his 69th round of chemotherapy, Alvarez implored members of Congress to replenish the fund, which is expected to run out in 2020 without intervention with thousands of responders and their families are still waiting for assistance.
"I should not be here with you, but you made me come, he said. "You made me come because I will not stand by and watch as my friends with cancer from 9/11 like me are valued less than anyone else because of when they get sick, they die.
"It is my goal and it is my legacy to see that you do the right thing for all 9/11 responders, he said. The next day, Alvarez felt too disoriented to continue treatment and was placed in hospice care shortly after, The New York Times reported.
"You all said you would never forget, Alvarez said at the hearing. "Well I'm here to make sure that you don't.

Texto completo: The Clippers will have to woo Kawhi Leonard without offering him an opportunity to play with Kevin Durant, according to reports Sunday afternoon by a variety of NBA insiders indicating he will be signing with the Brooklyn Nets, where he will team up with fellow free agent Kyrie Irving.
Durant, who suffered a torn Achilles tendon during the NBA Finals, reportedly will sign with the Nets on a four-year $164 million deal while Irving will sign a four-year $141 million max deal, per multiple reports. Durant is scheduled to make an announcement via the Instagram of his sports-owned business channel The Boardroom.
NBA free agency is scheduled to open officially today at 3 p.m., PT.
A pair of players with Clippers connections – veteran center DeAndre Jordan, a pillar of the Lob City era, and guard Garrett Temple, who joined the team last season after the trade deadline – also reportedly are set to sign with the Nets.
The Clippers will wait to learn the truth of reports that Leonard was going to leave the Toronto Raptors only if he could be assured he’d be playing with a “top-flight free agent.”
The Clippers reportedly had their sights on Durant, for months. In Brian Windhorst’s report for ESPN in December, he broached the possibility of the duo teaming up and noted that the Clippers would be able to create two max slots to allow it to happen this summer.
Of course, even with the cap space, Windhorst equated pulling off the feat to “pulling the sword from the stone.”
Durant, a 30-year-old forward who won two titles with Golden State, went on the record earlier this month to make it clear that he would make his decision independent of any of his peers intentions: “I can’t be recruited.”
Not that the New York Knicks, Warriors and Clippers wouldn’t join the Nets in making their best cases.
Reports were that the Warriors were set to offer Kevin Durant a five-year, $221 max contract, $57 million more than any of his other suitors, and Stephen Curry was going to help deliver the pitch.
The Clippers’ pitch also will include people that Durant is known to admire, including Jerry West, whose 2016 call to Durant is said to have helped persuade him to join the Warriors, and owner Steve Ballmer, who appeared on the second episode of “The Boardroom with Kevin Durant,” an ESPN series that debuted in February.
Furthermore, Durant’s familiarity with the Clippers organization extends to general manager Michael Winger and assistant coach Rex Kalamian, whose tenures in Oklahoma City overlapped with Durant’s.
And Durant, remember, raved about several members of the Clippers this past season, including their then-rookie backcourt of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Landry Shamet.
But, according to reports, the Nets’ offer and the chance for Durant to play alongside his friend Irving proved most enticing.
On Saturday, the New York Times reported Leonard – who also is a target of the Lakers, who cleared cap space this week in order to offer him a chance to play beside LeBron James and Anthony Davis – wants to play with a “top-flight free agent” if he chooses to leave the Toronto Raptors.
The Clippers also are rumored to be among the teams vying for the 76ers’ Jimmy Butler — who also has been linked to the Houston Rockets and reportedly is most interested in playing for the Miami Heat. The 29-year-old wing was mentioned in various reports as another potential option. An excellent two-way player with a drive to win, on paper he seems like a fit for both Leonard and the Clippers.

Texto completo: Today is Sunday, June 30, the 181st day of 2019. There are 184 days left in the year.
Today’s Highlight in History:
On June 30, 1936, the Civil War novel “Gone with the Wind” by Margaret Mitchell was first published by The Macmillan Co. in New York.
On this date:
In 1865, eight people, including Mary Surratt and Dr. Samuel Mudd, were convicted by a military commission of conspiring with John Wilkes Booth, the assassin of President Abraham Lincoln. (Four defendants, including Surratt, were executed; Mudd was sentenced to life in prison, but was pardoned by President Andrew Johnson in 1869.)
In 1918, labor activist and socialist Eugene V. Debs was arrested in Cleveland, charged under the Espionage Act of 1917 for a speech he’d made two weeks earlier denouncing U.S. involvement in World War I. (Debs was sentenced to prison and disenfranchised for life.)
In 1934, Adolf Hitler launched his “blood purge” of political and military rivals in Germany in what came to be known as “The Night of the Long Knives.”
In 1953, the first Chevrolet Corvette, with its innovative fiberglass body, was built at a General Motors assembly facility in Flint, Michigan.
In 1963, Pope Paul VI was crowned the 262nd head of the Roman Catholic Church.
In 1966, the National Organization for Women (NOW) was founded in Washington, D.C.
In 1971, the Supreme Court ruled, 6-3, the government could not prevent The New York Times or The Washington Post from publishing the Pentagon Papers. A Soviet space mission ended in tragedy when three cosmonauts aboard Soyuz 11 were found dead of asphyxiation inside their capsule after it had returned to Earth.
In 1977, President Jimmy Carter announced he had decided against production of the Rockwell B-1 bomber, saying it was too costly. (However, the B-1 was later revived by President Ronald Reagan.)
In 1982, the proposed Equal Rights Amendment to the U.S. Constitution expired, having failed to receive the required number of ratifications for its adoption, despite having its seven-year deadline extended by three years.
In 1985, 39 American hostages from a hijacked TWA jetliner were freed in Beirut after being held 17 days.
In 1997, the Union Jack was lowered for the last time over Government House in Hong Kong as Britain prepared to hand the colony back to China at midnight after ruling it for 156 years.
In 2013, 19 elite firefighters known as members of the Granite Mountain Hotshots were killed battling a wildfire northwest of Phoenix after a change in wind direction pushed the flames back toward their position.
Ten years ago: Democrat Al Franken was declared the winner of Minnesota’s eight-month U.S. Senate vote recount, defeating Republican incumbent Norm Coleman. A Yemeni jet with 153 people on board crashed into the Indian Ocean as it tried to land on the island nation of Comoros; a 12-year-old girl was the sole survivor. American soldier Pfc. Bowe R. Bergdahl went missing from his base in eastern Afghanistan, and was later confirmed to have been captured by insurgents. (Bergdahl was released on May 31, 2014 in exchange for five Taliban detainees.)
Five years ago: A sharply divided Supreme Court ruled some companies with religious objections could avoid the contraceptives requirement in President Barack Obama’s health care overhaul, the first time the high court declared businesses can hold religious views under federal law. President Obama tapped former Procter & Gamble CEO Robert McDonald to take over the troubled Veterans Affairs Department. The Israeli military found the bodies of three missing teenagers just over two weeks after they were abducted in the occupied West Bank, allegedly by Hamas militants. Writer, actor, producer and director Paul Mazursky, 84, died in Los Angeles. Actor Bob Hastings, 89, died in Burbank, California.
One year ago: Hundreds of thousands of people gathered for rallies and marches in hundreds of locations around the country, demanding an end to the separation of immigrant families who cross into the United States.

Texto completo: MÉXICO – Al cumplirse un año de su victoria en los comicios, el presidente de México, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, usa los micrófonos como si fueran bombonas de oxígeno.
El contacto diario con los medios de comunicación es esencial en su forma de gobernar y, por el camino, el mandatario ha dejado algunas frases memorables:
– “Abrazos, no balazos”
Todo un clásico desde la campaña electoral, casi un mantra de cara al público sobre el que levitan sus intenciones de pacificar el país. En contraste, la presencia de la Guardia Nacional -un nuevo cuerpo de seguridad- ha sido vista como una contradicción a esta frase mítica.
– “Me canso, ganso”
Un popular apunte del líder del Movimiento Regeneración Nacional (Morena) que provocó las risas -tanto cariñosas como hirientes- entre los mexicanos. La usa para dejar clara su perseverancia a la hora de conseguir su objetivo de transformar México.
– “Yo tengo otra información”
La favorita del presidente cuando la prensa espeta datos o información contraria a su Gobierno. Con total confianza se le ha visto poner en duda a calificadoras financieras como Moody’s, Fitch Ratings o incluso al prestigioso diario estadounidense The New York Times.
– “La mafia del poder”
Según describe el filósofo esloveno Slavoj Zizek en su libro “En defensa de la intolerancia” (1998), el ejercicio político es auténtico cuando una “no parte” minoritaria pide ser “parte” rebelándose contra el grupo dominante.
En el caso de López Obrador, ese grupo dominante -al que finalmente derrocó- es “la mafia del poder”, un grupo de políticos y empresarios que durante décadas, asegura, controló México.
– “La prensa fifí”
Un término muy usado desde el arranque de legislatura, identificado inmediatamente como los periódicos que califica de conservadores y adversarios del presidente, del izquierdista Morena.
– “Primero los pobres”
“Por el bien de todos, primero los pobres”, exclamó el presidente durante su discurso de investidura en el hemiciclo del congreso de los diputados el 1 de diciembre de 2018.
Toda una declaración de intenciones sobre las prioridades de su Gobierno: eliminar la pobreza es erradicar el resto de males de México. Y que ha repetido en multitud de ocasiones desde entonces.
– “Limpiar las escaleras de arriba a abajo”
Una de las frases más socorridas del mandatario. Hace referencia a la limpieza de las instituciones, empezando por las altas esferas, para acabar con la corrupción que ha dominado el país durante los últimos años.
– “Me producen ternura, ternuritas”
De las más recientes, lanzada a sus adversarios con una media sonrisa entre pícara y retadora desde su bastión en Palacio Nacional.
“Me producen ternura, ternuritas”, dijo el mandatario, cuando manifestó que sentía cierta pena por la labor que ciertos opositores hacen cada día difundiendo calumnias sobre él.
– “No es mi fuerte la venganza”
Ante todo, la paz. Desde que arrancó su mandato, el líder izquierdista ha defendido que no realizará una caza de brujas contra expresidentes o altos funcionarios por presuntos casos de corrupción, y dijo que prefiere hacer borrón y cuenta nueva.
– “No tengo derecho a fallar”
La consciencia de responsabilidad y el enorme peso que asegura que acarrea sobre sus hombros se desprende de esta frase del presidente mexicano.
López Obrador es el primer líder de izquierdas en décadas que gobierna el país, y su ascenso vino a romper la dicotomía existente entre el otrora hegemónico Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI) -que estuvo en el poder casi 70 años- y el Partido Acción Nacional (PAN).
Para López Obrador, no existe la opción de fallar a las más de 30 millones de personas que le entregaron su voto en busca de un cambio

Texto completo: LIMITED SERIES "The Loudest Voice" WHEN | WHERE Premieres Sunday at 10 p.m. on Showtime
WHAT IT'S ABOUT Former political media consultant Roger Ailes (Russell Crowe) has just been fired from CNBC and is ready for a new challenge. Rupert Murdoch (veteran British actor, director and playwright Simon McBurney) has just the thing - a cable news channel to challenge CNN. Ailes' idea is to essentially counterprogram the rest of the mainstream media with a conservative-leaning network, and the Fox News Channel is born Oct. 7, 1996. After the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, Ailes shifts FNC more sharply to the right, turning it into a bullhorn for President George W. Bush's call for a war in Iraq, then later, a battering ram against candidate Barack Obama, whom he instructs his anchors to refer to as "Barack Hussein Obama." Meanwhile, his private life: Ailes' wife, Beth (Sienna Miller), who tends to their vast estate in Garrison, New York, wants another challenge and her husband buys her one, a local newspaper. Ailes has also employed Laurie Luhn (Annabelle Wallis), whose only apparent job is to service his sexual desires. He later makes a fateful pass at Gretchen Carlson (Naomi Watts).
This short-run series is based on Gabriel Sherman's 2014 book, "The Loudest Voice in the Room: How the Brilliant, Bombastic Roger Ailes Built Fox News." It was adapted by Tom McCarthy, who won an Oscar  for the screenplay of 2015's "Spotlight." 
MY SAY In the opening seconds of this seven-parter, Ailes - presumably from the great beyond (he died in 2017 at 77) - declares that he knows "what people are gonna say about" him after he's gone.
Not to disappoint, Roger, but what most people probably said was, "Who?"
Long an object of curiosity and ultimately obsession in the media/political worlds, none of this ever really translated to household name status, including the households of Fox News Channel. There's one obvious reason why: Ailes would never put someone on the air who looked like Roger Ailes, and in his case, he didn't. Like most TV executives, he believed viewers would be less inclined to flip the channel if the anchors they were watching were telegenic, preferably blonde-thin-female telegenic.
"The Loudest Voice" obviously doesn't have a choice in the matter. It's all about Ailes, all the time. Crowe gained weight for last fall's theatrical "Boy Erased," and kept some of that for this role, but not quite enough. He's wearing a fat suit here, while prosthetics have added the extra chin or two. His eyes are a pair of ice-blue marbles that stare out from that well-padded face. When he smiles, he can scarcely manage a rictus. When he walks, he shuffles. When he sits, he protrudes. The transformation is stunning, but the effect - scene after scene, hour after hour - can be numbing. 
People who knew Ailes, or competed against him, or worked for him, or (for that matter) wrote about him over the last years were left no shortage of impressions beyond those physical ones. But Sherman's exhaustive reporting, and later the reporting of The New York Times, ensured one final impression, that of a sadist and serial sexual predator, who drove one of his victims (Luhn) to a breakdown.
This is the Ailes of "The Loudest Voice," and after four episodes (the ones made available for review) that can be numbing, too - or worse. When he drags Luhn into a hotel room for another sordid assignation, you may be tempted to turn the channel. (My advice: Don't necessarily resist the urge.) 
Because Crowe is on-screen for so much of the time, the effect is amplified. He's the miserable boss from hell who launched Fox on his own by collecting a bunch of nobodies to ape his self-styled GOP fifth column. In "The Loudest Voice," they're mostly actors playing real people - Sean Hannity, Steve Doocy, Glenn Beck, Rupert Murdoch - who look nothing like them. In a bewildering omission and missed opportunity, the series doesn't even bother to cast anyone to play Bill O'Reilly. (For some obscure reason, "Family Guy's" Seth MacFarlane plays former Fox PR man Brian Lewis, but if there had been an O'Reilly part, he just might have been perfect for it.)
You now know that "The Loudest Voice" is far from a fun series, but is it an important series? It has the beginnings of one, but the creation of Fox was far more complicated than this allows and, for that matter, so was its creator. Instead, we get the most obvious side to his story, along with the most repellent side. Perhaps that's ultimately - or grimly - fair, but it's not particularly balanced, or engaging.
BOTTOM LINE Crowe is good to a point, but "The Loudest Voice" can be root canal. 
While "The Loudest Voice" is largely based on Gabriel Sherman's 2014 book, the real horror story of this series had nothing to do with it. The particulars of this story would arrive two years later, when Sherman interviewed a onetime airline stewardess by the name of Laurie Luhn. Luhn (played here by British actress Annabelle Wallis) told the New York Magazine writer that she met the future chairman of Fox News when she was a 28-year-old volunteer for the George H.W. Bush campaign in 1988.  They were in an elevator together, and Luhn expressed admiration for the ads Ailes had helped craft for the campaign. A few days, she recalled, he walked by her desk, saying, "If there is ever anything I can do for you, let me know."  She told Sherman that was the beginning of a 20-year sexual relationship - one in which she endured "psychological torture," humiliation and harassment. Per Sherman's report, she was hired years later as an event planner at Fox News and also as a booker, making as much as $250,000 a year, and would sign a $3.15 million severance package in 2011.  But Luhn told Sherman that her role there had less to do with events, more to do with sexual favors for Ailes. She said she suffered a breakdown in 2007, and later moved to California - while still on the Fox payroll - where she suffered a complete breakdown. A few years later (late 2010 or early 2011, per Sherman's report), she wrote a letter to Fox's top legal counsel, saying she had been sexually harassed by Ailes over a 20-year period. The settlement was struck by the summer of 2011. Sherman's bombshell story arrived in the midst of a Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison investigation into Ailes' behavior that had begun on July 6, 2016 - the day Gretchen Carlson filed a sexual harassment complaint against Ailes.

Texto completo: Lillian Cunningham and Jim Tankersley were married June 24 at Theodore Roosevelt County Park in Montauk, N.Y. The Rev. Nathan A. Barczi, a Presbyterian minister who is a college friend of the groom, officiated.
Ms. Cunningham, 35, is a journalist at The Washington Post, where she has created and hosted several podcasts on American history, including "Moonrise," "Presidential" and "Constitutional." She graduated with general honors from the University of Chicago, and received a master's degree in journalism from Northwestern.
She is a daughter of Christine V. Cunningham and Richard E. Cunningham of New York.
The groom, 41, is a domestic correspondent in the Washington bureau of The New York Times, where he covers taxes and economic policy. He graduated from Stanford.
He is a son of Janet Ficken Tankersley and Thomas C. Tankersley of McMinnville, Oregon.
The groom's previous marriage ended in divorce.
The couple met in 2014 while both were working in the financial section of The Post. They got to know each other a bit better two years later after Ms. Cunningham interviewed Mr. Tankersley on the economics of pre-Civil War America for her "Presidential" podcast series. Their first date was at Teddy and the Bully Bar, a Theodore Roosevelt-themed restaurant in Washington.

Kimono Controversy for Kim Kardashian West

Texto completo: Another week, another cultural appropriation controversy. Or so it's beginning to seem when it comes to fashion and its faux pas.
This time around the lightning rod is Kim Kardashian West's latest venture, announced on Tuesday: a line of "solutionwear," itself a creative take on the more typical "shapewear," which used to be called girdles, and before that corsets. This one happens to be called Kimono.
Turns out Romeo and Juliet had it wrong. When it comes to names, there is a lot involved -- at least when attempts at catchy branded wordplay, national heritage and influencer-associated fame collide.
Kimono, a riff on Ms. Kardashian West's name that is in line with her other brands (Kimoji and KKW Beauty) and what she said in a statement to The New York Times was meant to be "a nod to the beauty and detail that goes into a garment," quickly became the subject of online charges of ignorant and offensive misuse. Especially because the name was juxtaposed against images by the photographer Vanessa Beecroft of many women of different sizes and colors undressed in the collection.
Ms. Kardashian West said in her statement that she has no plans "to design or release any garments that would in any way resemble or dishonor the traditional garment." She also has no plans to respond to the reaction by changing the name.
"My solutionwear brand is built with inclusivity and diversity at its core and I'm incredibly proud of what's to come," she said. That includes bras, briefs, shorts and bodysuits, among other undergarments.
The line is scheduled to make its debut in July. But while traditional kimonos, which date from the 16th century, according to the Victoria & Albert Museum, have many associations, those tend not to involve lingerie, Hollywood celebrities or reality TV. Hence, the problem.
One exception to those posting their objections was Chrissy Teigen, who tweeted, "Oh my god, I don't have to cut one side of my Spanx anymore." Ms. Kardashian West promised to send her "the biggest package ever."
People became even more incensed when they learned that Ms. Kardashian West had applied for trademarks for her Kimono lines. She has applied for eight, around variations on the name and its design, and in classes that include Clothing and Apparel Products, Leather Products (not including clothing) and Advertising, Business and Retail Services.
The application also involves a specific font version of the word Kimono -- a sort of bubbly print created, she has said, by her husband, Kanye West -- as opposed to the general word itself.
"Filing a trademark is a source identifier that will allow me to use the word for my shapewear and intimates line but does not preclude or restrict anyone, in this instance, from making kimonos or using the word kimono in reference to the traditional garment," Ms. Kardashian West said in the statement. The nuance was lost in the outrage.
As of Thursday morning, a new hashtag was making the rounds on Twitter -- #KimOhNo -- and a petition had been started on change.org by Sono Fukunishi, who wrote of wearing a kimono every day.
"I do not wish to share the word with an underwear brand," the petition says. "'Kimono' means 'clothing' in Japanese."
The petition calls the use of the name "horrible cultural disrespect." As of Thursday afternoon, more than 11,000 people had signed, though it does not specifically call for any action other than demonstrating general unhappiness with Ms. Kardashian West's choice.
Ms. Kardashian West has been accused of cultural appropriation before, most recently in April, when she attended her husband's Coachella "Sunday service" wearing what looked to many like a maang tikka, the head pendant that is one of 16 traditional Indian wedding adornments; and previously for wearing what she called "Bo Derek braids."
She has chosen not to engage in the public self-recrimination and apology that has become de rigueur in the fashion world (see: Gucci, Prada, H&M) and has remained silent, at least on social media, during much of the controversy.
By Thursday, however, she had decided to make a statement. Perhaps because the chaos had overshadowed the line itself, which was conceived for many different body types and skin tones and is clearly meant to carve out a space in a market somewhere between Spanx and Rihanna's Savage x Fenty lingerie line.
"I understand and have deep respect for the significance of the kimono in Japanese culture," Ms. Kardashian West said.
In any case, she is not, it turns out, the first brand with no particular kimono-related history to attempt to attach the name to a product. There are Kimono condoms, and Kimono Lash eyelash extensions. Still, Ms. Kardashian West's brand is the first created on an individual persona -- and her internet fame.
And therein lies the moral of this particular story. Those who live by the power of viral social media moments and sharing can also be vulnerable to the power of viral social media backlash and sharing.

Texto completo: M
anhattan: I would like to thank you for your newspaper's coverage ofthe disgusting conditions in
NYCHA. I think this is the only way the city takes
action.
Atthe Smith Houses in Manhattan,the elevators
break down atleasttwo to three times a day.The fire department comes almost every day and the lasttime they had to
remove the elevator door.There are two elevators, and they
are constantly out of order.The elevators jump floors, get
stuck, doors won't close. Elderly people have to sitin the hot
sun while they repair the elevators, only for the elevators to
get stuck later on (most ofthe time on the same day).
Tenants feelthatthere is something permanently wrong
with these elevators that NYCHAis notfixing.Why else
would they break down every single day?Tenants have complained to management but nothing has been done.These
elevators have been operating like this for years.They are
scared that what happened to the Lower East Side man who
was crushed by a falling elevator might happen there.
Please continue to expose NYCHAand its continuing mismanagement,tenants feel invisible and ignored. I have a friend
living in this building under these horrible conditions and it
breaks my heart every single day.

Revival of a curse
Shaftsbury, Vt.: The mighty curse is now in reverse. The Curse of the Bambino is now on the New York Yankees. The Yanks are worried about the Red Sox and they should be. Winners of last year's World Series, the Sox are now flat and no real threat to anyone. But, the curse is still out there. Boonie is worried that the Sox will start a landslide of losses for his Evil Empire Yanks. This nagging worry is eating him alive and his mentor, "Cash," is throwing cold water on it. This just makes the new curse worse. It happened before and it will happen again. The Sox bedeviled the Yanks and came from three games down to win the pennant and destroyed the Yanks since that time. Start sweating Boonie! You're finished as Yankee manager.
Thomas W. King
Lady Liberty
Staten Island: To Voicer Julia Lutch: You speak of dazzling ignorance in reference to AOC's comparing immigrant detention centers (or Trump Camps) to concentration camps. People are willingly risking their lives to get into the U.S.A., not get into the camps. "Give me your poor, yearning to breathe free."
Victor R. Stanwick
Time travel
Morris Plains, N.J.: I was delighted to read the June 26 Voice of the People page. I'm sure many millions of letters have been sent to you. These spanned from 1919 to 2016. As I read them, I realized the direct correlation to current topics. There's the POTUS with fake news complaints, then and now. New paper in town as other publications close down. Bad grammar and spelling then, and spell check still can't prevent it. Horses impeding traffic, on bridle path or Central Park. Complaints about Soviet Union (Russian interference). Riots after Dr. King's assassination, and now peaceful demonstration. Trips to the Moon. Mars is next. Nixon impeachment. Calls for Trump impeachment. Support for death penalty versus decriminalizing marijuana. Deterioration of subways and homeless riders. 9/11 united us, but health care for first responders and others is under scrutiny. Police killings and Black Lives Matter. Teaching young black men not to resist or face death. And finally, bashing presidents, past, present and future. The more things change, the more they remain the same.
Linda S. Langan
Voicer Donald Trump
Plainview, L.I.: Donald Trump's 1997 Voicer letter about having been P.S. 70's Principal For A Day mentioned "screaming, shouting...emanating from the children." Sounds a little like the young children now caged down by the border! (Having made my point, I admit that my three-dot ellipsis purposely omitted his words "laughing and pure joy.")
Richard Siegelman
So insulting
Brooklyn: One can only imagine the outrage, and rightfully so, directed at a waitress in a restaurant who may have spat upon Malia Obama. The server's name would be plastered on the front page of the New York Times and the Washington Post, and she would be dutifully blackballed from her profession. President Trump's son is subject to such vile degradation in Chicago (a Democratic stronghold) and not a word from the left condemning such uncivil behavior. No surprise!
George F. McIntyre
Slackers
Garwood, N.J.: If I had spent two years blaming my faults on my predecessors, my boss would have laughed me out the front door. So why must we listen to our president constantly blame Barack Obama for everything Trump has screwed up or failed to deliver on? Immigration, health care, North Korea, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, trade deals, climate change, and the list never ends. Trump and the GOP controlled the House, Senate, and White House for 2017 and 2018, and none of the above issues were handled. So, quit blaming Obama and do your damn jobs! John Deichmeister
Oh say can you see!
Staten Island: To Voicer Karen Jehlen: We fly our beautiful flag because we are proud to be American and honor those who fought and died for our freedom. It has nothing to do with who lives in the White House.
Lorri Thompson
Time is money
Brooklyn: The MTA claims that they are losing millions of dollars from fare evasion. I wonder how much money us riders lose every time they make us late to work. I can't count the times I've been docked for being late because of the lousy service of the MTA, and I always pay my fare. Leighton Perkins
Civic duty
Staten Island: I am appalled at the level of voter indifference on primary day throughout the five boroughs, most recently in Queens for the primary race for Democratic nominee for district attorney. Many people often wondered how some of the present whack-a-doos got into office in the first place. Well, I just laid out why. Here is the solution to this problem: Everyone, let's start getting out and knocking on doors and getting your neighbors out to vote on all primary and general election days. Which borough is first?
Robert McKenna
Empathetic citizen
Hardyston, N.J.: To Voicer Fred Dollonsky: You, sir, are a heartless individual and an obvious Trump supporter. I am no fan of Joe Guidice, however I am a compassionate person. Yes, he messed up, committed a crime and did his time. He is still a family man with four young girls who need their father. Would you be so quick to deport if this had been your family? I wonder? These cases need to be looked at individually. He didn't kill anyone. Who benefits? Kathy Ricker
Loud and clear
Manalapan, N.J.: All are welcome in "our" U.S.A., you idiots who are deporting immigrants. You will rot in hell and you will have company. His name is Hitler.

Texto completo: Anna Marie Ramírez gritó: “¡Amanda, me apuñalaste!” antes de morir desangrada la madrugada del sábado en una pelea en su hogar de Nueva Jersey.
Así lo afirmó ayer el juez de la Corte Superior del Condado Camden, Edward McBride, citando la declaración de un testigo a la policía.
El testigo no identificado también escuchó a Amanda Ramírez amenazar a su gemela Anna Marie poco antes de la tragedia familiar en los apartamentos de vivienda popular “Centennial Village” en Camden, alrededor de las 5:40 a.m. del sábado, dijo McBride en la corte.
“¡Mira lo que haré!”, dijo Amanda supuestamente antes de entrar al edificio para agarrar un cuchillo de cocina grande.
El testigo, que vive en un piso superior en el mismo edificio que la familia Ramírez, escuchó la amenaza mientras observaba desde una ventana y bajó las escaleras, llegando afuera justo después de que apuñalaran a Anna Marie, señaló el juez McBride.
La poderosa evidencia fue revelada durante una audiencia en la que a Amanda le fue negada la libertad bajo fianza. Desde el sábado ha estado detenida y acusada de homicidio agravado en el asesinato de su gemela.
El fiscal Peter Gallagher también entregó ayer una foto del cuchillo que Amanda supuestamente hundió en el lado izquierdo del pecho de Anna Marie.
Amanda se echó a llorar cuando entró en la sala del tribunal y vio a casi 20 amigos y familiares, incluida su madre, sentada en la galería. La joven no habló en el tribunal y pasó la mayor parte de la sesión sollozando en la mesa de la defensa con el rostro hundido en el hombro izquierdo.
Un “triángulo amoroso” está siendo observado como el motivo de la pelea entre las hermanas, dijo su tía Blanca Class al New York Times. “Fueron a una fiesta, volvieron a casa, estaban bebiendo, discutían sobre un novio”, afirmó.
Cuando llegaron al edificio había un hombre con ellos, informó New York Post, citando una vecina menor de edad.
La acusada tiene un antecedente judicial por un caso sellado cuyos detalles no han sido difundidos. Según la policía, ha dado versiones contradictorias sobre lo sucedido el sábado, incluyendo que actuó en defensa propia porque era su hermana quien la quería apuñalar.

Texto completo: The Rev. Talitha Arnold's tribute to the Very Rev. Monsignor Jerome Martinez y Alire was spot on ("A shepherd and builder for all," Commentary, June 9). There could be so much more to add to that commentary. One additional accolade most certainly must be added, and that is Martinez y Alire's bold, creative vision of ministry to seniors. To paraphrase, he said that looking over his congregation he found a lot of gray, white and Clairol heads out there. He wondered if they, too, were being served, nourished and fed as much as the youth of the parish. Many had lost their spouses, didn't drive, were becoming more isolated; were living on a fixed income and stressing over pending health issues. He also recognized their wisdom, faith and vast experiences that should be supported and cherished. Thus, he initiated and established a new senior ministry. Now, 10 years later, a ministry dedicated to spiritual growth, cultural traditions and lively, close friendships flourishes. Thank you, Monsignor Jerome.

Stories in newspapers connect neighbors -- past, present and future. Take some time out of your hurry-scurry day and communicate with your newspaper people. They need to know you care. What else can you do? Pay for a subscription to your local newspaper. Staffers and their families need to eat at least once a day.

Manage the pollution
New Mexico has the dubious distinction of being the site of a conspicuous-from-outer-space methane-leaking hot spot, coincidentally centered on the gas production area near Farmington. It is a methane waste and a pollution problem that is a black spot on our state.
On the other hand, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham's commitment to developing a state-level methane capture rule is a bright spot for our state. Her leadership in bringing attention to this problem is something of which we can all be proud. We can be first in the nation in methane management with this initiative saving energy and money in the process.

Deserving compensation
Though no decent, right-thinking person would ever deny the horrors visited upon the Africans brought here as slaves and whose descendants, throughout our history, have been brutalized and subjugated, it's hard for me to consider reparations to them without simultaneously including Native Americans. White Europeans slaughtered the Native population and plundered an entire continent. A few acres of mostly inhospitable land as reservations and/or pueblos do not amount to reparations.
Both these populations deserve compensation and, first, a national apology. Perhaps, when someday we return to an actual "American" government, we can have constructive talks and come to some resolution. A massive infusion of federal dollars to the communities and lands of each group would be a start, coupled, perhaps, with a national holiday of remembrance for each.

Texto completo: Joy Harjo’s name has been in the news lately. Last week, the Library of Congress named her the country’s new poet laureate. She’s the first Native American to serve in that role.
But a month before that, the Palm Beach Poetry Festival announced she would be its special guest poet at the 2020 festival, which is scheduled to be held Jan. 20-25 at Old School Square in Delray Beach.
“We could not be more thrilled to congratulate and welcome Joy Harjo, whose poetry often merges the global and the personal and the imagery of the natural world with that of the inner one,” Susan Williamson, festival director, said in a statement.
Harjo is the second sitting poet laureate to be featured at the festival. The first was Natasha Trethewey in 2014.
Harjo, 68, is a member of the Muscogee Creek Nation. She grew up in Oklahoma, where she still lives.
In her 2012 memoir, “Crazy Brave,” she writes about her troubled early years, which included substance abuse, an abusive stepfather and teenage motherhood.
She has published eight books of poetry and released four albums of music. Her newest collection, “An American Sunrise,” is due out from W.W. Norton in August.
During her time as poet laureate, she hopes to highlight the connections between poetry and music, and address the current social and political divides, she told The New York Times.
“Just as when I started writing poetry (in the 1970s), we’re at a very crucial time in American history and in planetary history,” she said. “Poetry is a way to bridge, to make bridges from one country to another, one person to another, one time to another.”
During the Palm Beach Poetry Festival, Harjo will participate in a conversation with poet Laure-Anne Bosselaar at 4 p.m. Jan. 21 at the Crest Theatre. Following the Jan. 22 gala, Harjo will read her poetry at 8 p.m. at the Crest.

Misfits, Unite!

Texto completo: Ever get the feeling that you don't belong?
You come to work and do your job, but you can't escape the suspicion that everyone else is different from you.
In a word, you're a misfit.
Now, it could be that everyone else in your office is a misfit, and you're the only normal person. Or it could be that everyone else is normal, and the misfit really is you.
(It could also be possible that Venusians have invaded the bodies of your co-workers, and you are the only one whose superior lack of intelligence lets you resist Venusian mind control. Don't you hate it when this happens?)
Being a misfit does have its advantages. If you want to stand out from the madding crowd, being the unmatched argyle in the sock drawer will do the trick. But if you'd like to blend into the bland background of business, sticking out like a sore -- and weird -- thumb could be a problem.
Which brings us to Jennifer Romolini.
An "editor, writer, speaker and ... author," Romolini recently published "A Misfit's Guide to Navigating the Office" in The New York Times. It's a step-by-step and stumble-by-stumble tutorial well worth our attention.
Your first step? "Embrace Your Weird."
"If you're offbeat," Romolini writes, "you've probably felt that the parts of your personality that seem out of sync are weaknesses you need to overcome."
Ain't necessarily so.
Companies don't want cookie-cutter thinkers, she asserts. They want disruptors, "employees who are too odd to understand the ways things are 'supposed to work.'"
If you've been waiting for an invitation to let your freak flag fly, this is it.
Of course, being odd does have its limitations. The way I see it, bringing your pet rabbit to work is good. Coming to work in a rabbit suit is better. Sending your rabbit into the office to sit at your desk is bad. This is especially true if Mr. Floppy Ears does your job better than you do.
"Don't Fake It" is another step to leveraging your weird.
Romolini believes that "pretending to be something you're not in a new job, faking skills or contorting yourself to gain recognition, is a short-sighted strategy with little return."
In order to be a more genuine you, you should "identify what it is about work that makes you feel anxious," and find ways to cope, either through "journaling, therapy, (or) confiding in friends."
Unfortunately, no one wants to read your journal. No one wants to hear your problems, even at $200 an hour. Besides, the thing that makes you anxious about work is working, and you've already found the perfect way to cope with that. In the medical community, it's called goofing-off.
Romolini's insight that "Confidence Is Overrated" is also a non-starter for you.
"Confidence is actually fleeting," she explains. This is true. You may feel supremely confident when making an important decision, like recommending the best doughnut shop in town, but when it comes to trivial matters -- like presenting your plan to reorganize the marketing department and move production to Kiribati -- you are faltering and full of self-doubt.
The author's advice is to stop focusing on confidence and "set your mind to developing your competence ." It's a lovely thought but clearly impossible. You have already maximized your competence by being able to find your way to work most mornings. To attempt to be competent once you've arrived is impossible.
(Your managers know this, of course. The only reason they keep you around is because you're so good-looking. This will keep you employed until the bosses have improved their competence, which is going to happen -- never.)
"Stop Overthinking" is another way a misfit can succeed. This will be easy. You can't overthink if you never think in the first place.
The final piece of advice is the battle cry: "Misfits, Unite!"
"Finding a few smart, supportive people who understand you" is a good idea, though even the optimistic Romolini admits, it "won't happen overnight."
Find the workers who "don't fit the mold," and see if they'll hang with someone who is covered in mold.
If nothing works and you still remain a misfit, there's only answer: listen to Oprah.
"Failure is just life trying to move us in another direction," she says, and, as always, Oprah is right. Your failure to fit in at work is indeed life trying to move you in another direction.
It's a direction called unemployment.

Rosenstein considered sneaking Trump's 'potentially incriminating' draft letter firing Comey out of White House

Texto completo: Former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein considered sneaking out of the White House a copy of President Trump's draft letter firing FBI Director James Comey in May 2017.
That four-page letter was never used, and in fact Rosenstein himself wrote a distinctly different memo used to justify Comey's termination, but the previously unreported account adds further details about the tumultuous experience the Justice Department's No. 2 official had over a span of several days which led up to the appointment of Robert Mueller to be special counsel of the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.
The existence of the initial draft letter was first reported by the New York Times in September 2017 and only a portion of the letter, which was provided to Mueller's team, was conveyed in the special counsel's final report. But a report by the New York Review of Books on Wednesday sheds new light on the contents of that draft letter and Rosenstein's actions in May 2017.
In the draft letter, Trump made clear he wanted to fire Comey because of the Russia investigation and his frustration with the director refusing to say publicly that Trump was not personally under investigation.
Also among the previously unreported aspects of the draft letter was Trump's dismay with Comey allowing FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe to be involved in the Russia investigation. The president complained McCabe was biased against him and cited McCabe's wife, Jill, who ran unsuccessfully as a candidate for the Virginia state Senate.
McCabe was fired from the FBI on March 16, 2018, after the Justice Department's Office of the Inspector General determined he misled investigators about the role he had in leaking information to the Wall Street Journal in October 2016 about the investigation into the Clinton Foundation.
Sources said Comey's refusal to state publicly whether Trump was under investigation (which he repeatedly told the president in private that he was not) was due to a decision made by Rosenstein and top DOJ official Dana Boente.
The draft letter, which the report states was largely dictated by Trump himself, was shown to Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff Sessions during a meeting at the White House. Both agreed to write their own recommendations to fire Comey. It was at this meeting Rosenstein considered surreptitiously taking the draft letter out of the White House because it had the potential to be incriminating evidence, he told a longtime Justice Department official.
The New York Review of Books stated that Rosenstein "was nervous as he considered walking out of the White House with the letter in case he was detected spiriting it away" and wondered that if he went along with Trump's story on the reasons for the firing "he himself might have unwittingly acted as an accessory to a presidential obstruction of justice". Rosenstein believed the letter was "potentially incriminating evidence."
Trump fired Comey on May 9, using Rosenstein's memo, which was critical of Comey for his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's email server, but not the Russia investigation. Sessions, who had recused himself from the Russia investigation, wrote an accompanying letter recommending Comey's removal.
In the days that followed, Rosenstein reportedly spiraled into rage and paranoia as he felt like he was being used by the White House, even as Trump himself acknowledged publicly that the "Russia thing" played into his decision to fire Comey.
It was during this period that Rosenstein was said to have discussed wearing a “wire” to record conversations with Trump and recruiting Cabinet members to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove the president from office. Rosenstein and his staff brushed off these reports of his comments as either untrue or that what he said was meant as a joke.
On May 17, Rosenstein appointed Mueller, a former FBI director, as special counsel. Nearly two years later, Mueller completed his Russia investigation, which also examined possible obstruction of justice by the president. Mueller's team was unable to find sufficient evidence of conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia and declined to make a determination about obstruction.
Mueller's report did lay out 10 instances in which Trump might have obstructed justice, but Mueller declined to make a determination on the matter, citing a Justice Department guideline that sitting presidents cannot be indicted.
Before the report's release in April, Attorney General William Barr released a summary of its principal conclusions which said he and Rosenstein decided there was not sufficient evidence to establish an obstruction crime had occurred. Still, although Trump says he has been vindicated, Democrats argue Mueller's refusal to clear Trump on obstruction provides them a road map to continue to investigate and possibly seek impeachment.
After nearly three decades of service, Rosenstein retired from the Justice Department last month on what appeared to be good terms with the president. In a speech in which he dubbed Comey a "partisan pundit," Rosenstein denied the notion that Comey's ouster was meant to influence the Russia investigation.
"Nobody said that the removal was intended to influence the course of my Russia investigation. The notion that replacing the FBI director with a new FBI director would influence the Russia investigation — or any other investigation — never crossed my mind," Rosenstein said.

E. Jean Carroll's corroborators enhance her case (with no help from the New York media)

Texto completo: The case of E. Jean Carroll's allegation against President Trump continues to grow more curious. On the one hand, the New York City advice columnist has undermined her quarter-century-old rape allegation against the then-real estate mogul through a series of baffling and disquieting cable news appearances. She's described rape as "sexy," leading Anderson Cooper to cut to commercials. She's declined to entertain suing Trump because it would be "disrespectful to the women who are down on the border who are being raped around the clock." And when asked what she wishes she had told Trump — again, a man she is accusing of violent and forcible rape — she said she would have asked for his tax returns. Really.
In fact, Carroll has worked pretty hard to undermine her own credibility. Her first-person account accusing not just Trump but multiple other men of sexual assault, part of a magazine book promotion, was surely an inferior vehicle for such an accusation compared to, say, an objective news report.
Yet we cannot write off Carroll's claims thanks to two friends of hers contemporaneously corroborating her account.
Although New York Magazine did its due diligence in confirming the existence of the corroborators, it did a disservice by failing to provide any substance of their corroboration. Megan Twohey, the New York Times reporter who broke the Harvey Weinstein story with Jodi Kantor, got the two to go on the record in an interview published on the New York Times' podcast, "The Daily."
"I remember her saying repeatedly: 'He pulled down my tights. He pulled down my tights,'" writer Lisa Birnbach recalls Carroll saying after the alleged incident. Birnbach told Carroll, who told her about the event a day or so thereafter, to go to the police. The second witness, Carol Martin, was told after Birnbach.
"I said: 'Don’t tell anybody. I wouldn’t tell anybody this,'" Martin recalls saying.
Like the presentation of the New York Magazine story, the New York Times' decision to introduce the witnesses on the record with selectively chosen interview excerpts, accompanied by Carroll no less, leaves much to be desired and undercuts the notion of independent corroboration.
Still, the underlying point remains and is now strengthened: Carroll separately told two people seemingly consistent details about this alleged attack immediately after it allegedly happened. If she's lying, then she must have lied to two people about someone who, at the time, decades ago, was an apolitical and widely liked figure.
Critics point to Carroll's repeated, bizarre statements as evidence she's lying. But if Carroll was in fact assaulted, by anyone even if not by Trump, her behavior is consistent with a lifetime of suppressing trauma.
Campus crusaders have promulgated the lie that trauma impedes the ability to recall details of an assault. In fact, science suggests the opposite. The fight or flight response to an attack may enhance a victim's recollection of specific details or timeline of events. Carroll's account is consistent, even if her statements are outlandish and weird. Given the cognitive dissonance between her lifetime of promoting third-wave feminism and her suppression of alleged repeated assaults, her refusal to call what obviously would have been a rape a rape because she "fought" makes sense. She may refuse to call herself a victim because she so desperately doesn't want to be one. Denying that reality would lend itself to strange and unsettling statements.
This allegation on its own may not yet meet the preponderance of evidence standard. That Carroll doesn't want to hand over her coat to forensics experts certainly doesn't help her case. But her allegation is not obviously untrue. Just as we cannot presume guilt of those accused, naysayers ought not presume accusers are making things up — certainly not with the corroboration Carroll has.

Writer E. Jean Carroll came forward last week with a rape allegation against President Donald Trump. Thursday two women she confided in after the alleged assault spoke publicly for the first time. Lisa Birnbach and Carol Martin, two veteran journalists, described their conversations with Carroll, the conflicting advice they gave and what has happened since to The New York Times podcast “The Daily. " Birnbach, whom Carroll says she called right after the assault, said she encouraged Carroll to go to the police after asking, "He raped you?" Carroll declined. Martin told Carroll the opposite: Fearing Trump was too powerful to take on, Martin says she told Carroll, "Don't tell anybody. I wouldn't tell anybody this. " Trump denied the accusation and said Carroll is "not my type. "
Is it still the 2020 census if it's delayed until 2021?
The Supreme Court on Thursday put a halt – at least temporarily – to the Trump administration's effort to add a question asking about citizenship to the 2020 census, sending the request back to a lower court – and giving opponents another chance to block it. The ruling was a setback for the Trump administration, but the court's decision doesn't end the dispute. Trump tweeted Thursday afternoon that he would attempt to delay the census “no matter how long. " The citizenship question would affect 22 million noncitizens, the allocation of seats in Congress and federal funds. Opponents contended that adding the question was an effort to scare noncitizens into avoiding the census.
Hyper-partisan gerrymandering lives on
A deeply divided Supreme Court ruled Thursday that the federal government does not have the authority to block the election maps drawn by state lawmakers, no matter how partisan the drawing of the maps might be. The ruling allows gerrymandering to live on. (Want a refresher on gerrymandering? This one is for you. ) Chief Justice John Roberts said partisan election maps drawn by Republicans in North Carolina and Democrats in Maryland are permissible, legal and constitutional. The court’s liberal justices loudly denounced the decision: Associate Justice Elena Kagan said the gerrymandering discussed in those cases could “imperil our system of government. ”

Texto completo: The Supreme Court ruled that federal courts don't have power to hear partisan gerrymandering challenges.
Justice John Roberts wrote the majority opinion, saying that in this case, judges should not supersede lawmakers’ decisions.

- “We conclude that partisan gerrymandering claims present political questions beyond the reach of the federal courts.”

Justice Elena Kagan wrote a passionate dissenting opinion, saying this decision would harm American democracy.

- “For the first time ever, this Court refuses to remedy a constitutional violation because it thinks the task beyond judicial capabilities, and not just any constitutional violation. The partisan gerrymanders in these cases deprived citizens of the most fundamental of their constitutional rights: the rights to participate equally in the political process, to join with others to advance political beliefs, and to choose their political representatives.”

Adam Liptak of The New York Times explained what gerrymandering was and how it became so prevalent.

- "Partisan gerrymandering is almost as old as the nation, and both parties have used it. But in recent years, as Republicans captured state legislatures around the country, they have been the primary beneficiaries. Aided by sophisticated software, they have drawn oddly shaped voting districts to favor their party’s candidates. Should Democrats capture state legislatures in the next election, the ruling would allow them to employ the same tactics."

The ACLU tweeted that while it was disappointed with the decision, it's not the end.

- https://twitter.com/ACLU/status/1144250982966222856

Evan McMullin emphasized the need for states to continue fighting against gerrymandering.

- https://twitter.com/EvanMcMullin/status/1144263848427495425

Justin Levitt , an election law professor at Loyola Law School, told NPR that some legislators with total political control in a state may feel inspired to gerrymander districts in their favor.

- "We are in Mad Max territory now; there are no rules. I think you'll see more legislators in more states (where there is unilateral control) taking up the mantle of extreme partisan aggression against people who disagree with them."

Sen. Mazie Hirono tweeted that the conservative judges in the court are helping Republicans stay in power.

- https://twitter.com/maziehirono/status/1144274341661741056

Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris said SCOTUS just gave the green light to racial gerrymandering.

- https://twitter.com/SenKamalaHarris/status/1144365980266717190

Carrie Severino wrote on Fox News that this ruling was a victory for the Constitution.

- "Thursday a bare majority of five justices — Chief Justice Roberts joined by Justices Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh — had the integrity to admit that drawing voting district lines is precisely one of those areas that the Constitution leaves in the hands of legislators, not judges ... Thursday's decision is a victory for the Constitution."

Jess Bravin and Brent Kendall of The Wall Street Journal wrote that the U.S. would feel the effects of this ruling soon.

- "The impact of the Supreme Court’s ruling will become apparent as soon as the 2022 elections, after the 2020 census triggers reapportionment of U.S. House seats among the states, followed by redrawing of districts to equalize their populations within each state. Because Republicans currently control most statehouses, restrictions on partisan gerrymanders are likely to reduce their political advantage."

No more ‘poverty naps’

Texto completo: When college students return to their campuses in the fall, many will face a growing problem that threatens to undermine their chances for success. Hunger.
Recent surveys agree that more than one-third of all college students suffer at times from bouts of food insecurity. The rate is far higher for students with an extra risk factor: belonging to a racial minority, having a single parent or being the first in their family to attend college, for example.
For these students, hunger means "sitting in a classroom hoping no one hears your stomach growl," said Christopher Nellum of The Education Trust-West to U.S. News. "It means spending time worrying about where to get food for the next week rather than studying for next week’s exam."
A New York Times report on local campuses told these stories: "A senior at Lehman College in the Bronx dreams of starting her day with breakfast. An undergraduate at New York University said he has been so delirious from hunger he’s caught himself walking down the street not realizing where he’s going. A health sciences student at Stony Brook University on Long Island describes ‘poverty naps,’ where she decides to go to sleep rather than deal with her hunger pangs."
In one sense, the problem reflects good news: the growing diversity of student bodies, from both racial and socioeconomic perspectives. A recent study by the Government Accountability Office says only 29% of those now in college are "traditional students," who enroll right out of high school and depend on their parents for support. The rest, especially in community colleges, can be older, and financially fragile -- often with children of their own.
But federal aid programs have not kept up with this changing profile and rising need. Forty years ago, Pell grants, the main source of public support for needy students, covered half the average cost at two-year colleges and 39% at public four-year colleges. Today, according to statistics from the Department of Education, those rates have dropped to 37% at community schools and 19% at bigger universities.
The result could be called the "hunger gap," which Steve sees firsthand at George Washington University, where he has taught for almost 30 years. The way the federal government calculates a student’s annual need is woefully inadequate, and even students with "full rides" can have trouble affording full meals.
"Food insecurity is a college completion issue," said Sara Goldrick-Rab, a leading scholar in campus hunger at Temple University, to the Atlantic. "We’re undermining our federal investment in financial aid by not paying attention to this. We have to stop pretending like living expenses are not educational expenses."
One answer is a rapid expansion of campus-based food banks. An organization called the College and University Food Bank Alliance started with 15 schools in 2012 and now counts about 700 members.
The Store at George Washington is one of them. It’s housed on the ground floor of a large dorm, but the entrance is tucked away in an obscure hallway so students don’t feel stigmatized when they use it. All students who register with The Store and get the passcode for the entrance can take what they need -- no limits, no supervision, all on the honor system.
Many campuses have tried other innovations. Programs called Share Meals and Swipe Out Hunger enable students to donate their unused dining hall credits to hungry classmates. Sodexo USA, which manages dining halls on many campuses, now has a system of alerting students to "leftovers from catered events," reports the Times. An urban farm at Kingsborough Community College in Brooklyn produces fresh produce that’s distributed free to students.
One critical change would involve SNAP, the federal nutrition program once known as food stamps. Its rules regarding student eligibility remain highly restrictive and confusing, and the GAO reports that about 2 million students who could have qualified for aid in 2017 did not receive it.
Simplifying the rules and extending eligibility to more students makes total sense. But the Trump administration is actually trying to reduce the program and eliminate recipients, even as the need continues to grow.
That’s both profoundly immoral and utterly counter-productive. Programs to combat hunger easily pay for themselves: Students who don’t have to worry about food do better in school, graduate at higher rates and are more likely to become productive, tax-paying citizens.
The public policy goal should be completely clear and compelling: No more growling stomachs in classrooms. No more "poverty naps" instead of lunch.

Heroes of the summer of 1969

Texto completo: On July 20, 1969, the United States landed all-Americans Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on the rocky surface of the moon. I was among 600 million people watching - a 5-year-old kid of the Space Age living in Clifton, New Jersey. As my Hot Wheels collected dust, I went gaga for outer space and astronauts.
Three weeks before, on June 28, a bus and a subway ride away from our family's split Colonial, a band of gays, lesbians and trans people also launched into the great unknown. They sparked an unprecedented three-day protest against a police raid at the Stonewall Inn, a seedy mob-run gay bar off Seventh Avenue South.
On that night, this group, which many may still consider the antithesis of anything all-American, began the modern LGBTQ movement. You wouldn't know it by the headlines: Three days of New York Times coverage amounted to a trio of one-column articles buried between Pages 19 and 33.
On July 20, across the Hudson and years away from awareness of such events, my mom, dad, two older brothers and I sat watching a blurry black-and-white transmission on a 21-inch TV screen with walkie-talkie audio. Earlier, Armstrong had said, "The Eagle has landed."
"What Eagle?" I thought. Armstrong was on our television, setting foot on the moon with a fishbowl on his head. I, a premature skeptic, ran to the patio. I wanted to see it with my own eyes, in color.
"But I can't see the moon!" I said, frustrated. The astronauts were as invisible to me and my family as the Stonewall Inn protesters.
"You can't really see them," said my brother Bob. I took it on faith, along with the Santa myth. Because as a 5-year-old gay-to-be with a penchant for pomp, a hero like Armstrong made sense. After extensive and exclusive NASA screening, he rode on a one-of-a-kind spaceship to an exclusive destination, wore a custom outfit and ate freeze-dried ice cream. My grandmother helped me write a letter to NASA for his autographed photo.
As an out-of-the closet 30-something, I found that Saran-wrapped 8-by-10. But now a claustrophobic, afraid-of-heights Cub Scout dropout, I reminded myself why I wasn't at NASA.
I learned about my Stonewall forbears during the 25th anniversary celebrations. Like the astronauts, they headed into uncharted territory: Armstrong and team entered history on a fantastic rocket ship. Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera, two of the Stonewall uprising's most acknowledged leaders, likely arrived in heels, fueled only by years of oppression and rage. They and their comrades approached the unknown, arguably more bravely, from a far precinct of American society.
Armstrong and his crew risked their lives to advance humankind's understanding of the universe. Similarly, Johnson and Rivera and their co-patriots gave voice to their internal rage and advanced human rights. Like the Apollo 11 team, which faced its mortality in outer space, the protesters knew the stakes of going up against the NYPD. They furthered America's heritage of protest and uprising, right back to that most famous of tea parties in the harbor.
In the summer of 2019, precocious gay 5-year-olds and their families can come to know and respect all-American role models in and out of the LGBTQ community. Our heroes are no longer invisible.

Why Trump's Huawei ban won't stand

Texto completo: The world was marking half a century of information technological progress the week President Trump signed an executive order seemingly designed to halt that progress in its tracks. Issued in mid-May, the order kept Huawei -- a leading tech innovator -- out of America's digital networks. At the same time, the Commerce Department effectively banned U.S. companies from selling components to us.
This one-two punch is a challenge for Huawei, headquartered in Shenzhen, China, since we source about a third of our products from the United States. Some have wondered if we can survive this crisis and continue honoring our commitments to customers.
The answer is yes. Huawei pays particular care to supply continuity. We have spent over a dozen years establishing systems and developing key technologies for different types of supply emergencies. Our supply chain is an open system, which means we source our key components from different channels, sources and countries. These measures will keep our business running despite the challenges we currently face.

In striking out at Huawei, the United States will inflict considerable damage on itself. The actions against Huawei alone will seriously hurt U.S. companies, which sold more than $10 billion in goods and services to Huawei last year. The blacklisting of Huawei could wipe out that business in a single stroke. The resulting drop in revenue may force U.S. companies to cut research-and-development spending, threatening their ability to innovate.
The Trump administration's actions also threaten to split digital technology into separate fiefdoms or tribes. In a divided world, conflicting or incompatible standards may prevent companies from using digital technology on a global scale, an obstacle that relegates them to the status of regional enterprises. And in markets where technology leaders are kept out for political reasons, competition will be reduced, raising costs and leading businesses to curtail their investments. In such markets there will be less innovation overall; companies will produce inferior products, while charging higher prices.
Most troubling is how the U.S. attacks on Huawei will severely damage the global trading system. Over the last 70 years, free trade and open markets have helped create prosperity and relative peace. Yet the current U.S. administration seems to believe international trade should be controlled by government decrees rather than market forces.
Washington says it was motivated to take action because Chinese tech companies threatened U.S. national security or foreign policy interests. But trying to protect communications networks by blacklisting companies is naive. Global supply chains mean that those with criminal intent and the right skills can compromise the equipment of any company or country. Securing digital networks requires a coordinated international response -- an outcome that the Trump administration's actions have yet to produce.
The U.S. government's actions will inflict short-term pain on the telecommunications and technology industries. Even so, I do not believe the digital world will be split into two camps as a result. A top-down ban will ultimately be rescinded by a bottom-up force: the will of the American business community. Industry groups are already speaking out against the Huawei ban and companies are seeking to be exempted from it. The more U.S. businesses stand to lose, the stronger the resistance will grow. As the New York Times reported Tuesday, some companies have already found loopholes.
Outside the U.S., the ban will further damage America's long-standing credibility as a global leader. Trump's inconsistent remarks have blurred the line between politics and national security, and other countries will not risk becoming technological laggards simply to follow America's lead. That's why some nations, including the United Kingdom, have adopted a cybersecurity model that relies on independent verification of Huawei's technology. This has allowed the UK to be among the first to roll out a 5G network.
History shows that attempts to contravene open markets and free trade tend to produce weaker, more vulnerable economies. Similarly, previous generations of wireless communications (2G, 3G and 4G) were hamstrung by conflicting technical standards, making the technology more expensive and preventing its use across all markets.
In contrast, 5G creates a universal standard -- the natural result of technological evolution and market demand. Some politicians, overestimating their power, may try to erect walls against cooperation, openness and progress. Ultimately, however, they will find that walls can be toppled just as quickly as they are built.

Texto completo: To the Editor:
Re "Lost in Abortion Noise: Nuance" (front page, June 16):
As a pro-choice woman who is personally uncomfortable with abortion in most circumstances, I feel as if I sit between two camps, each of which shouts about half of the equation.
The left frames the issues as being solely about women's rights while denying that the developing embryo or fetus has any rights at all. Yet, political rights aside, that growing being is new life, which is distinct from the mother's body.
The right, sadly, proclaims the rights of that developing being as if the woman carrying it were only a vessel, a means to an end. Its efforts to shut down legal abortion will only send women to die in back alleys.
The only solution is to do all that we can to make abortions rare. To those who say that this position suggests that abortions are "wrong," I say that having to make such a wrenching choice is never good for the woman, though at times it may be necessary.

To the Editor:
I wondered why there is nuance only in the Democratic Party. The entire article was devoted to Democratic women having trouble with strong pro-choice positions. I know from other coverage that there are Republican women who have trouble with strong pro-life positions. Except for one mention of the Republican Majority for Choice (and its demise), we don't hear anything about nuanced positions on the Republican side.

To the Editor:
The print subheadline, "Politics Straddles 2 Extremes, but Americans Fall in the Middle," promotes a false equivalency. If one extreme is forcing women to give birth against their will, the equally extreme other side would be forcing women to have abortions against their will. The pro-choice movement certainly does not take that position, nor does anyone else.
It's long past time for The New York Times, and other media, to realize that there isn't always an opposite but equal position on every issue. There is only one extreme position on abortion. It's anti-choice.

A problem with Kardashian's Solutionwear

Texto completo: TOKYO - Kim Kardashian West 's latest product is not yet available to buy, but the backlash is already here.
A day after a new line of slimming undergarments called Kimono Solutionwear was announced, some Japanese people expressed their displeasure with the reality star's use of the word kimono to sell her latest product. They accused her of appropriating an item - and an idea - central to Japanese culture in an attempt at cute wordplay and consumerism.
Kardashian announced the project on Twitter on Tuesday, saying it was coming soon. The product, which does not resemble a kimono, is shapewear for women in nine different shades and an array of sizes that is intended to help women feel more confident.
"Finally I can share with you guys this project that I have been developing for the last year. I've been passionate about this for 15 years. Kimono is my take on shapewear and solutions for women that actually work," she wrote.
In Japan, the word kimono, which means "thing to wear on the shoulders," is a central part of national culture. It is a gown that is tied with a sash and has been worn by both men and women for generations.
On social media, angry users accused the reality star of disrespecting Japanese culture and stealing the name of their traditional dress.
"This is blasphemy against Japanese culture. Can't someone from kimono-related organizations protest? This is terrible," tweeted Masahito Sato , an editor and writer.
Many used the hashtag #KimOhNo to express their disgust and disappointment, including one user who asked the reality star not to "take the name of a beautiful, traditional Japanese wardrobe and use it for your undies."
Kardashian calls her new brand "a solution focused approach to shape enhancing underwear." According to the BBC, she trademarked the Kimono brand last year in the United States and has also filed trademarks for "Kimono Body," "Kimono Intimates" and "Kimono World."
Yoshifumi Nakazaki , deputy director general of the Japan Kimono League, said the kimono was a "common asset" for all Japanese people.
"It's not just kimono as clothes but kimono as a name that is the common asset, not just for those of us who live in the modern era but for the history of Japanese people that has been accumulated over the years," he said in an interview. "Generally speaking, it is unthinkable for a Japanese person to register kimono for a trademark. That would be impossible."
Sarah Owie , another writer, said she was sad to see Japanese culture "threatened" and that Kardashian had gone "OVER LIMIT."
This is not the first time the Kardashian sister has been accused of cultural insensitivity. In 2017, she was accused of wearing blackface during the launch of her KKW Beauty range. A photo posted to social media at the time showed an extremely tanned-looking Kardashian promoting her new Contour and Highlight Kit.
"I would obviously never want to offend anyone," she later told the New York Times. "I used an amazing photographer and a team of people. I was really tan when we shot the images, and it might be that the contrast was off."

Texto completo: Theater Mu has been going through some cataclysmic changes. In December, the theater fired its artistic director, Randy Reyes, after complaints about his conduct. Earlier this month, it announced that Lily Tung Crystal, co-founder and artistic director of Ferocious Lotus Theater Company in San Francisco, would be its new artistic director starting in September.
Between December and now, Mu had a play to put on with Penumbra, “The Brothers Paranormal.” It had another planned for August at the Mixed Blood, “Hot Asian Doctor Husband.” And what about the 2019-20 season? Without an artistic director, how would that even happen?
With an artistic advisory committee, whose members included Katie Bradley, Sheena Janson Kelley, Sara Ochs, Audrey Park, Eric Sharp, Eric “Pogi” Sumangil and Katie Ka Vang. All are experienced Theater Mu artists. Together they chose three plays by women artists, all regional premieres, and agreed on a theme for the season: “The World is Ours to Build.”
Here’s what we’ll see, where and when.
Carla Ching’s “Fast Company” in the Guthrie’s Dowling Studio. This will be Mu’s second play by Ching. The first was “The Two Kids That Blow Shit Up” in 2016-17. Brian Balcom will direct. Nov. 8-24.
Jiehae Park’s “Peerless” at the Gremlin Theatre. A comedic take on Shakespeare’s “Macbeth,” set in the world of high school during college admissions. Lily Tung Crystal will direct. Jan. 31-Feb. 16, 2020.
Lauren Yee’s “Cambodian Rock Band” at the Jungle Theater . Mu previously worked with Yee to produce the world premieres of “Ching Chong Chinaman” and “The Tiger Among Us.” In “Cambodian Rock Band,” a young Cambodian American has found evidence that could finally put away the Khmer Rouge’s chief henchman. It’s “part comedy, part mystery, part rock concert.” Joshua Kahan Brody, Yee’s longtime collaborator, will direct the co-production with the Jungle. June 24-Aug. 2.
Mu will also continue its annual New Eyes Festival of new works in staged readings. The latest New Eyes ended last week.
Tickets for “Peerless” will go on sale in September. “Fast Company” will go on sale July 8 through the Guthrie’s box office. “Cambodian Rock Band” will be available later through the Jungle.
Jazz at Studio Z season finale spotlights young artists
The annual Lowertown jazz series curated by guitarist Zacc Harris is seven years strong. Fueled by a grant from MRAC, it presents the finest jazz artists in the region in one of the Twin Cities’ best listening rooms.
The seventh season will end with a trio of young musicians – including two women saxophonists – leading their own ensembles.
Apple Valley teenager Sophia Kickhofel recently won a spot in this summer’s National Youth Orchestra – Jazz (NYO Jazz), a program created by Carnegie Hall’s Weill Music Institute to nurture and showcase exceptional young American jazz instrumentalists. Kickhofel will spend two weeks at SUNY Purchase studying with artistic advisor Sean Jones and other jazz greats, then play Carnegie Hall with Grammy winner Kurt Elling, then tour the Far East, all before starting her junior year at Apple Valley High. Led by her sax, her quartet will include Lasse Corson on piano, Jon Butler on bass and Carter Pearson on drums.
Award-winning trumpeter Jake Baldwin graduated from New England Conservatory in 2013. He’s been a vital part of the Twin Cities jazz scene ever since – and tours with Har Mar Superstar. His quintet will feature Nelson Devereaux on saxophones, Joseph Strachan on piano, Ted Olsen on bass and Miguel Hurtado on drums. Great group.
Another New England Conservatory grad, saxophonist Stephanie Wieseler once played with the Penguins. She has toured with Bon Iver. At studio Z, she’ll be joined by Harris on guitar, Charlie Lincoln on bass and Greg Schutte on drums.
Both Baldwin and Wieseler are alums of the Dakota Combo.
The music will start at 7 p.m. Studio Z is on the second floor of the Northwestern Building, 275 E. 4th St. Tickets $12 advance, $15 door.
The picks
Now at Norway House: Judy Olausen: “Mother.” Subtitled “a vision of the Eisenhower Era Mother: eager to please, ready to serve, and blissfully sweeping the unmentionable under the rug,” this new exhibit features Nordic American photographer Olausen’s mom as model. She patiently assumes various positions in colorful, theatrical scenes: as, for example, a mink-clad, hat-wearing, cart-pushing, cross-bearing supermarket shopper. The photographs in this show (which took four years to shoot) are from Olausen’s book “Mother,” a 1996 New York Times best-seller and tribute to Olausen’s lifelong inspiration, Marcel Duchamp. In the Gallery. Admission $5, under 12 and members free. 10 a.m.-4 p.m. Tuesday through Sunday. Closes Sept. 1.
Tonight (Wednesday, June 26) and Thursday at Finnegans Brewery: Democratic Presidential Primary Debate Watch Party with the Theater of Public Policy. There’s no one we’d rather watch the Dem debates with than the smart, well-informed, funny as heck comedy improv geniuses of T2P2. Tane Danger will host, with Jennifer Brooks and Patricia Lopez of the Star Tribune providing pre-show commentary and real-time political analysis. There will also be debate-themed bingo. 817 5th Ave. S., Minneapolis. 7:30 p.m. both nights. Free, but you will have to buy your own beer.
Starts Friday at SteppingStone Theatre for Youth: “Junie B. Jones, the Musical Jr.” Steppingstone is wrapping its 2018-19 season in a sassy bow. Based on the New York Times best-selling “Junie B. Jones” series by Barbara Park, this musical follows our rambunctious heroine as she starts first grade with a journal and a yen for adventure. With Erin Schwab as director, this looks to be a family-friendly hit. Schwab is a musical theater star in her own right, last seen as Rosie in the Ordway’s “Mamma Mia” (and earlier as King Herod in “Jesus Christ Superstar”). She knows how to hold a stage. 7 p.m. FMI and tickets ($12-16). The performance on Sunday, June 30, at 3 p.m. is pay-as-able. Closes July 14.
Saturday at the Ordway : “Napoleon Dynamite”: A Conversation with Jon Heder, Efren Ramirez and Jon Gries. For fans of the quirky cult comedy about the awkward teen who runs for class president with help from his friend Pedro. This is the film that birthed the immortal line “Give me some of your tots!” Following a full screening, Miss Shannan Paul will lead a discussion with cast members Jon Heder (Napoleon Dynamite), Efren Ramirez (Pedro) and Jon Gries (Uncle Rico). FMI and tickets ($48-$141 for VIP with meet & greet). A Twin Cities Film Fest event.
Sunday at the A-Mill Artist Lofts: “Mystery of Cats: A Cat Art Festival.” Of course. Why not? There will be cat-themed art for show and sale by more than 50 local artists, cat nonprofits and rescues, cat music, cat videos, cat Tarot, live painting and face painting, an arts & crafts station and a silent auction, with proceeds benefiting Diabetic Cat Help. Noon-8 p.m. Free. Here’s a list of confirmed artists and vendors.

Texto completo: A warm welcome for our new food critic

Youre going to start seeing a new face around the table: Our new food critic Helen Freund arrives this week.

Were excited to welcome Freund to a role that remains crucial as Tampa Bays culinary scene continues to expand. She comes from New Orleans, so shes no stranger to warm climates and a strong food culture. Freund was the food and dining editor and restaurant critic for Gambit Weekly, New Orleans alternative weekly newspaper, and a contributing writer for the New Orleans Advocate.

She has a background in both food and reporting. She attended culinary school at Le Cordon Bleu in Paris and later worked as a chef in New York City for several years, then worked as a general assignment reporter for the New York Post and later on the criminal justice beat at the Times-Picayune in New Orleans.

As food critic, Freund will write restaurant reviews, which will become a weekly part of the Taste section again. She wont be anonymous, and youll be getting to know her more in the coming weeks through photos, video and her writing.

Freund will also report and write in-depth stories about our food scene, like the one she wrote about wage disparities of New Orleans food service workers that in 2017 led to her being named a finalist by the Press Club of New Orleans Excellence in Journalism awards.

Shell spend these first few weeks getting acquainted with her new home. Weve put together a list of iconic Tampa Bay restaurants for Freund to check out, places that highlight different parts of our large and diverse food community. Berns Steak House. The Tarpon Springs Sponge Docks. Our new collection of food halls. Frenchys on the beach.

We want your input, too. Which places must a new Tampa Bay resident check out? What new and noteworthy spots should she add to her list of potential reviews? Send them to hfreund@tampabay.com.

I tried to make pancakes from scratch one recent weekend morning, and it did not go well.

Despite following a usually reliable New York Times recipe for simple pancakes, mine were flat and lifeless.

It may have been that I only had about ¼ cup all-purpose flour, and had to use wheat flour for the rest. Or maybe it was my skillet.

Either way, it left me with a longing for a decadent breakfast. When I came across a recipe for a Dutch baby in a new cookbook I was testing, it felt like a solid alternative. It called for peaches, but you could use any stone fruit, or even apples for more of a fall feel.

Dutch babies are essentially baked pancakes that crisp up on the edges and remain wonderfully puffy in the middle. And the best part: No standing over a skillet with a spatula, wondering when your pancakes are done.

E. Jean Carroll: She said, he said, and how media weighs balance

Resumen: Why didn't The New York Times and other media outlets give E. Jean Carroll sexual assault charges against Trump bigger play?

Enlaces: https://upfinder.upf.edu/openurl/34CSUC_UPF/34CSUC_UPF:VU1?genre=article&amp;atitle=E.+Jean+Carroll%3A+She+said%2C+he+said%2C+and+how+media+weighs+balance&amp;author=Bruinius%2C+Harry&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;date=2019-06-26&amp;rft.btitle=&amp;rft.jtitle=The+Christian+Science+Monitor&amp;issn=0882-7729&amp;isbn=&amp;sid=ProQ%3Ahispanicnews_

Texto completo: Last Friday, when the writer and advice columnist E. Jean Carroll accused President Donald Trump of sexually assaulting her in a dressing room at the Bergdorf Goodman department store in Manhattan 23 years ago, few of the nation’s major media outlets treated it as bombshell news.
Just a few days later, however, many journalists and critics have begun to wonder why. The president immediately denied what would  have been an explosive, news-dominating allegation, and he quickly attacked the well-known author’s credibility, suggesting her possible ulterior motives.
Ms. Carroll leveled her accusations, after all, in an excerpt taken from her fifth book, and published Friday in New York Magazine – a little more than a week before her book’s scheduled release. “Shame on those who make up false stories of assault to get publicity for themselves, or sell a book, or carry out a political agenda,” President Trump said. 
The columnist’s accusation and the president’s denial were all but absent in this weekend’s headlines and Sunday morning roundtables, and many media watchers decried the fact that this latest allegation barely caused a stir.
Yet when it comes to discerning the credibility of those who allege sexual assault, many media ethicists and journalists say, it is actually essential that news outlets react in a sober-minded and particularly careful way.  
“I do think that in the MeToo era, news outlets have had to be extremely cautious and extremely meticulous about what they publish,” says Lauren Wright, lecturer in politics and public affairs at Princeton University in New Jersey, and a frequent political analyst on Fox News, CNN, and other news outlets. “They do check it out, they do figure it out, and they do have that due diligence process, and that sometimes takes a few days.”
The reporting of The New York Times and other outlets, in fact, helped give voice to the many women who were sexually harassed and assaulted by Hollywood moguls like Harvey Weinstein as well as Fox News titans Bill O’Reilly and Roger Ailes.
Still, critics singled out the particular dearth of coverage in this weekend’s editions of the Times, which won a Pulitzer Prize for its investigations of what became the #MeToo movement. On Monday, the publication’s executive editor, Dean Baquet, admitted that “we were overly cautious” in their handling of Ms. Carroll’s allegations against the president. 
But Mr. Baquet also provided insight into the guidelines the paper employs when trying to assess the credibility of an accuser. These include locating sources other than those mentioned by the accusers who are willing to corroborate their allegations on the record. In this story, Mr. Baquet said, The Times could not find any independent sources beyond the two friends Ms. Carroll cited in her book, or any other additional corroborating evidence. 
Nevertheless, given that a respected public figure like Ms. Carroll, whose advice column “Ask E. Jean” has appeared in Elle magazine since 1993, was making a public allegation against a sitting president “should’ve compelled us to play it bigger,” he said.
“But the history of coverage of sexual assault in America’s media has always been one of extreme caution, and that is driven by a sense of fairness,” says Ken Paulson, former editor-in-chief of USA TODAY and now the director of the Free Speech Center at Middle Tennessee State University in Murfreesboro. “It’s an allegation that, once unveiled, never gets put away.”
And all things being equal, Mr. Paulson suggests, President Trump’s questions about the credibility of his accuser and her possible motives are usually valid concerns. 
“If you take the same fact situation, and someone in your community accuses a small-town mayor of rape from 23 years earlier, and there’s no other indications of such behavior,” he says, “you would look at that with considerable caution. You would ask understandable questions: Why is the allegation being made today?” 
But as he and other observers point out, all things are far from equal when it comes to President Trump. Ms. Carroll is the 22nd woman to accuse Trump on the record of sexual assault or misconduct, and hers is in many ways the most serious, as she alleges an attack that included forced penetration. 
Add to these accusations, too, the fact that the president described sexually assaulting women in the infamous Access Hollywood video and audiotapes.
“The credibility regarding charges of sexual assault should be the same as in any other matter: What are the facts, and who and how many people can testify to those facts?” says Paul Levinson, professor of media studies at Fordham University in New York. “People should make decisions about whom to believe with the utmost gravity. The credibility of the accused and the accuser should both be taken into account.”
Even though Dr. Wright at Princeton University agrees that the news media has generally handled the recent allegations of rape against the president in an even-handed and proper way, she points out that it is far more complicated when it comes to assessing the credibility of women accusing powerful men of sexual assault. 
“The first thing we always do is question their credibility and ask questions about them,” she says. “And their claims are always scrutinized ad nauseam.”
“And the baseline, I would say, is not that we believe women, the baseline is that we do not believe women,” continues Dr. Wright, author of “Star Power: American Democracy in the Age of the Celebrity Candidate.” “And that has been the case going back to the beginning of time, as long as humans have existed – women have not been believed.”
False accusations are rare when it comes to sexual assault, according to an in-depth survey of existing research on the subject by the National Sexual Violence Resource Center, a nonprofit in Pennsylvania. Only 2% to 7% of accusations in various parts of the counter were found to be fabricated or false.
“Nobody wants to become famous from their story of sexual assault,” Dr. Wright says. “I mean, this idea has been proven again and again, that women face many more consequences when they come out with their story, and the rewards, really, are nonexistent. Society actually punishes you.”  
Some observers also saw an “outrage fatigue” at work in the news media’s cautious response to Ms. Carroll’s accusations, especially on the heels of the divisive confirmation hearings of Justice Brett Kavanaugh last year.  Others pointed out, too, that the most recent allegations against President Trump were part of a busy weekend in the news, including the humanitarian crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border and the administration’s mulling military action against Iran.
“But there is a dynamic to President Trump that we have never seen before,” says Mr. Paulson, the former editor-in-chief of USA TODAY. “He does things, he says things, and he is accused of things that would have destroyed less confident candidates or public officials. And that, in some way, can affect editors who sort of go, here we go again.”
“But I guess the long and short of it is that I think that the press overall has acted responsibly, even though there are factors in this case that would lead you not to strip it across the top of your front page in a headline,” he continues. “These should give anyone caution, but it also doesn’t mean you shouldn’t cover the accusations, and that you should actually dig deeper.”

Texto completo: Hundreds of thousands of people once converged on a remote site in upstate New York to engage in a mass ritual marked by a wide range of unusual behaviors.
It's no wonder that archeologists are now looking at Woodstock.
Binghamton University's Public Archaeology Facility has been examining the site of the Woodstock Music and Art Fair, the most famous of the 1960s rock festivals, which was held 50 years ago this summer.
Last year, archeologists determined the exact location of the stage where Jimi Hendrix, Sly and the Family Stone, the Who, the Grateful Dead, and Janis Joplin, among others, played to an unexpectedly large crowd of 400,000, the university said.
More recently, by analyzing the rocks and vegetation surrounding the area, the team found 24 vendor booths and 13 other potential cultural features in an area known as the “Bindy Bazaar."
“The Bindy Bazaar was a meeting place where transactions — which included trading and bartering, in addition to selling — and cultural interactions took place," Maria O'Donovan, assistant to the director of the Public Archaeology Facility for historical archeology, said in the statement. “It exemplifies the informal, free-wheeling spirit of the counterculture."
O'Donovan said that spirit was reflected in the fact that the booths in the bazaar were not set up the way they were shown on plans.
“Our research demonstrated that the reality of what occurred at Woodstock was not captured by the preliminary plans," she said. “Archaeologists located 24 potential vendor booths concentrated on one side of the Bindy Bazaar area and not distributed as on the 1969 plans. This is more evidence that the festival took on a life of its own that organizers could not control. We also identified more recent usage of the area, which could be related to later anniversary events or casual use of the site before it was acquired and preserved."
The archeologists worked closely with the Bethel Woods Center for the Arts, which owns the Woodstock site, and its Museum at Bethel Woods, which is focused on telling the story of the '60s.
O'Donovan said the museum has “long-term preservation and interpretive goals for the site. Their immediate concerns were to prevent further impact to the area and to open the Bindy Bazaar to visitors with a reconstructed trail network and with interpretive signage. The Museum at Bethel Woods is considering special displays in the Bindy Bazaar for the 50th anniversary and I am sure the anniversary influenced the timing of our research."
The Public Archaeology Facility is an organized research center at the university that performs archeological studies for business and government clients. O'Donovan said in a telephone interview that the center had been hired by the museum for the project.
Visitors to the site have been able to wander across the mainstage area where the concert took place. Now they will be able to navigate a small trail system on the wooded hillside where the Bindy Bazaar was located, she said.
“It's actually quite a pleasant place," she said.
She said archeological projects that look back into the near past are “becoming much less rare. Actually, the archeology of the contemporary world has become a very important subject within archeology." But she also said, “50 years, I suppose, is technically the limit."
Some old photos have documented a massive field of trash on the site after the concert was over, but it was all cleared away, which is unfortunate for an archeologist interested in the material items left by people's daily life .
“They loaded it all off into trucks with heavy equipment, and it was gone," O'Donovan said.
Asked if she was disappointed the trash had been taken away, O'Donovan said, “I suppose as an archeologist, I am. As a person, I'm not."
With four inexperienced promoters, the festival began to go wrong quickly. The towns of Woodstock and Wallkill denied permission for the concert, forcing the festival to be held on farmer Max Yasgur's land in Bethel, N.Y., from Aug. 15 to Aug. 18, 1969, according to britannica.com.
But something about the cultural moment touched a nerve and, even though few tickets were sold, about 400,000 people showed up for what was billed as “Three Days of Peace and Music." Rain fell, but the audience bonded, possibly because of the psychedelics and marijuana consumed.
The Globe reported on Aug. 16, 1969, “More than 200,000 young Americans jammed into town for perhaps the most spectacular music festival ever staged in the East or, for that matter, anywhere in the nation. They began arriving Wednesday — long-haired, blue-jeaned and bell-bottomed — and by later tonight the crowd may swell to as many as 300,000."

Celebrating Bourdain Day; Six ways to remember; the beloved chef

Texto completo: It started with an Instagram post. Two of the world's most prominent chefs, Éric Ripert and José Andrés, stood smiling on camera to proclaim a new holiday. "On June 25, we all are going to celebrate the birthday of our dear friend and beloved Anthony Bourdain," Ripert says in the post.
The two take turns piecing together a single request: "We want all of you to celebrate Tony's life." To do that, all you need to do is pick up a beverage of your choosing and toast to Bourdain on camera, and post the moment to social media with the hashtag #BourdainDay. The chefs complete their announcement by taking long pulls from their porróns, a traditional wine pitcher from Spain.
Ripert wanted to take the lead on shaping the dialogue around the legacy of Bourdain, who died by suicide June 8 of last year. To change the tone of the conversation from solemn to celebratory, Ripert ordained June 25 Bourdain Day.
"The idea was to create, on his birthday, an event that anyone can contribute to, something that is low-production," the chef of Le Bernardin says in a phone interview. "We will make sure that Anthony is being remembered on his birthday, and not when he left. We will keep this tradition year after year."
To participate in Bourdain Day is simple. "It's so easy to lift your beer or a glass of wine or tea, whatever you want," Ripert says. The gesture allows as many people as possible to get involved, and its social element brings everyone together, at least digitally.
Some people will get together in person for the occasion. This year, Ripert will celebrate Bourdain Day with Andrés in Singapore, where the two will be gathered for this year's World's 50 Best Restaurants awards. They plan on toasting together with a beer over some street food. "Something that Anthony liked to do," Ripert said, "which was, as you know, going to the hawkers in Singapore or eating in the streets and having a beer."
The beauty of the Bourdain Day toast is that you can do it anywhere. "People can celebrate at home, people can celebrate at the top of a mountain, people can celebrate in a bar in Guatemala, in Antigua. People can celebrate anywhere," Andrés says. "The point is we can all honor him by doing a little video and tag along."
Beyond their toasts, Andrés and Ripert will support a new scholarship established by the Culinary Institute of America, his alma mater, in Bourdain's memory. The Anthony Bourdain Legacy Scholarship will support cooks who dream of following in Bourdain's footsteps by traveling abroad. "He was a guy who educated all of us," Andrés says. "This is a way to use his memory to keep educating the future talent in the food world in all of its forms."
If you're looking for ways to celebrate the immense life of Bourdain in addition to raising your glass on Tuesday, here are five more suggestions:
Plan a trip
Bourdain saw travel as a great unifying force. One of his most referenced quotes, from the series finale of "No Reservations," is about the ability of travel to expand worldviews and empathy:
"If I'm an advocate for anything, it's to move. As far as you can, as much as you can. Across the ocean, or simply across the river. The extent to which you can walk in someone else's shoes or at least eat their food, it's a plus for everybody. Open your mind, get up off the couch, move."
Take those words of wisdom into account and plan a trip into the unknown, whether that's 50 miles away or 5,000.
Volunteer your time
A man who spent some 250 days per year on the road, Bourdain still made time for volunteer work.
"He always came back to help raise money for World Central Kitchen without getting paid, without anything," Andrés says. "He never said no."
Carve out space in your schedule to volunteer, or make a donation to a worthy cause.
Support a mom-and-pop restaurant
Part of what made Bourdain stand out from others in food media was his appreciation of food at every level. He gave credit where credit was due. You don't have to dine at a Michelin-starred restaurant to dine like Bourdain; appreciate the people in your neighborhood who pour their hearts into their cooking. Dive in hungry and "eat without fear, tearing into the local stew, the humble taqueria's mystery meat," as he wrote in "Kitchen Confidential."
Consume Bourdain's literature
Before Bourdain was on TV, he was writing articles and books. We're lucky to have his quick-wit immortalized on paper and online.
"He always said he was he was really lucky, and he got a big break. He always said he never believed he would be a New York Times best-seller," Andrés says. "Really? You write like the gods! You could argue why it didn't happen before, no?"
You can start where it all began with his 1999 essay in the New Yorker, "Don't Eat Before Reading This." Then pick up some of his classics, like "Kitchen Confidential," or try cooking a dish from "Appetites: A Cookbook."
Binge Bourdain
on television
It's always a good idea to turn on a Bourdain show. Fortunately, those episodes are easily accessible with the right streaming subscriptions (here's where to find them all.)
Try the "No Reservations" Quebec episode (Season 2, Episode 4) that humanized Inuit fishing traditions and the "No Reservations" Beirut episode (Season 2, Episode 14) in which violent conflict breaks out, an experience that "was clearly a defining moment for the show - and some kind of crossroads for me personally," Bourdain later told Blogs of War in 2014. Don't sleep on "The Layover," either. The places he visits in Los Angeles at the end of the first season still hold up (looking at you, Tiki Ti).
One of Andrés's recommendations: Bourdain's episode in Iran on "Parts Unknown." If you want to understand what an important person Tony was, watch his show on Iran," Andrés says. "There you will see that actually the American people should not be afraid of the Iranian people. They don't look any different than you and I on that amazing show."
Whether on Tuesday, or any other day, there is much to honor when it comes to Bourdain. He meant a lot of things to a lot of people.
"Tony was this person who gave a voice to the voiceless," Andrés says. "He was able to show us the unknown side of humanity. The show brought us together."

Texto completo: Dan Abrams, host of A&E's runaway hit "Live P.D.," stopped by the Atlanta History Center recently to discuss his book about a mostly forgotten libel trial featuring Teddy Roosevelt more than a century ago.
I spoke with Abrams by phone about "Theodore Roosevelt for the Defense: The Courtroom Battle to Save His Legacy" and the appeal of watching cops do their jobs.
How the book came about: "My co author [David Fisher] and I were working on the Lincoln book using a transcript of a case he did nine months before his nomination as president."
When they heard about the Roosevelt trial, they knew a transcript would help make that a book as well. They found the only one available in Syracuse. It was 4,000
pages long.
Why the book makes good reading: The trial was a monstrous deal for the press at the time in 1915 -- and for Roosevelt, who was six years removed from his presidency.
"He was trying to clear his name. He also wanted to make a broader point about his legacy," Abrams said. The case focuses on Roosevelt accusing a former New York Republican leader William Barnes Jr. of being a corrupt party boss working in cahoots with the Democrats. Barnes sued for libel.
Abrams said some of the trial was supremely boring and they had to get through much of that to get to the meat of the matter: Roosevelt's eight days on the stand providing testimony. And the charismatic politician provided no shortage of fireworks. "I hope it reads more like a crime thriller than a libel trial," Abrams said.
Reaction so far: The book landed on the New York Times bestseller list. It has received four out of five stars among Amazon readers. Reviews in Publisher's Weekly, NPR and Kirkus were all positive.
"Theodore Roosevelt IV came up to me at a stop during the tour," Abrams said. "He didn't know much about this trial. I hope we did this trial justice and did Roosevelt justice in how we portrayed it."
Why the trial is hardly remember now: "It's probably because he won. If he'd lost, the downside to him was potentially far great than any potential upside.When he prevailed, it was more of a relief. I think he and his team expected to lose the trial."
Why "Live P.D." is working: "People want to see real. And police work is inherently interesting. It's certainly a hot topic right now. I think that people enjoy being able to see the everyday aspects of what police officers do. It's not 'Cops," which is a cut-up highlight reel. You see how they're seeing it. There's uncertainty every time they pull you over.Most of the time, nothing much happens. But it's still incredibly interesting."

Texto completo: One of the key special counsel prosecutors to explore whether President Trump obstructed justice is headed to private practice, and he said in an interview he will try to bring with him the ethos that Robert S. Mueller III instilled in his investigators.
Andrew Goldstein, a senior assistant special counsel under Mueller, will join the Cooley law firm working in New York and Washington, the firm announced Monday. In an interview, Goldstein declined to address the specifics of his special counsel work but talked broadly about what it was like to work under Mueller.
"He is an extraordinary public servant, and he created an environment in our office where our only mission was to do the right thing for the right reasons," Goldstein said.
As part of the special counsel team, Goldstein played an instrumental role in investigating whether Trump had sought to obstruct justice, and he was involved in the prosecutions of Michael Cohen, Trump's former personal lawyer and fixer; Roger Stone, a longtime Trump friend; and George Papadopoulos, a foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign.
Over the course of a two-year investigation, the special counsel charged 34 people, including 26 Russian nationals, and secured guilty pleas from seven, including high-level Trump campaign and administration officials. The investigation concluded in March, and the following month the Justice Department released the office's 448-page report documenting its work.
The report said investigators found insufficient evidence to show a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia to influence the election and reached no conclusion on whether Trump obstructed justice - despite laying out a series of episodes of the president apparently seeking to stymie the investigation. Mueller's team wrote that it was bound by Justice Department policy that forbids the indictment of a sitting president from deciding or alleging that Trump had committed a crime.
Goldstein declined to comment on whether the team unanimously supported that analysis. He also declined to say whether he personally felt there was sufficient evidence to charge Trump with obstruction, were he not president, as more than 1,000 former federal prosecutors have asserted.
In recent weeks, several of those who worked under Mueller have made public what they are doing next - though even those who have left government have not publicly discussed the specifics of their work. Goldstein said he "potentially" could say more in the future but added, "I think all of us who were on the team are going to continue to be very careful and discreet in the way that we've been from the beginning."
On Friday, the firm Paul Weiss announced it would add Jeannie Rhee, another senior member of Mueller's team. The Justice Department revealed last week that Michael Dreeben, a deputy solicitor general who has argued more than 100 cases before the Supreme Court and took a sabbatical to work with Mueller, would be leaving the department.
Last month, the firm Davis Polk announced it would add Greg Andres, the senior assistant special counsel who led the prosecution of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. The New York Times reported that Andrew Weissmann, a senior assistant special counsel who is now a fellow at New York University School of Law, is writing a book.
The House Judiciary Committee has been negotiating with Mueller to get him to testify on Capitol Hill, though he has been reluctant to do so.
Goldstein declined to say whether he thought Mueller should testify. "I don't want to say, one way or the other, my personal view," he said. He added, though, that he was "100 percent supportive" of the public statement Mueller made.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – The accusations poured in one after another.
One woman described Donald Trump forcibly kissing her when she tried to get a job at the Trump Organization. Another said he put his hands under her skirt in a Manhattan nightclub. Others said he groped their breasts, attacked them or watched them change in a dressing room. At least 15 shared similar stories, claiming sexual misconduct by the former real estate tycoon.
Trump denied and fended off the accusations, which came in the aftermath of an "Access Hollywood" tape recorded in 2005 on which he made vulgar comments about groping women.
That tape was released in October 2016, one month before he won the presidency.
After 2½ years in the White House, Trump is fighting a new allegation, lodged by longtime advice columnist E. Jean Carroll. She wrote in a forthcoming book, "What Do We Need Men For? A Modest Proposal," that Trump forced himself on her in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room more than 20 years ago. An excerpt from the book was published by New York Magazine and included a photo of Carroll wearing the coat she said she wore the day of the attack.
More women share experiences: Women share sexual assault stories amid Trump tape fiasco
After 'Access Hollywood' tape: Reports: Multiple women say Trump grabbed them inappropriately
As Democratic challengers to his presidency campaign for the 2020 election, Trump portrayed Carroll as someone whose only motivation is to sell books.
"I have no idea who this woman is," Trump said as he left the White House on Saturday for Camp David. "It is a totally false accusation. " The president alleged Carroll made a habit of accusing men of misdeeds and said "people have to be careful" because "it's happening more and more. "
He downplayed a photo included in the New York Magazine story of Carroll with Trump, saying his back was to the camera and he was with his wife. "Give me a break," he said, repeating that he did not know Carroll. Carroll wrote in the excerpt that she ran into Trump while shopping at the elegant New York City department store in the mid-1990s. She said she greeted him as "that real-estate tycoon," and he greeted her as "that advice lady. " He was looking to buy a present for a "girl" and asked for Carroll's help, she wrote. She pointed out handbags and hats, but Trump pointed out lingerie and asked Carroll to try on a piece, she said. Near the dressing room, Carroll claimed, Trump forced himself on her. "The moment the dressing-room door is closed, he lunges at me, pushes me against the wall, hitting my head quite badly, and puts his mouth against my lips," Carroll wrote. "He holds me against the wall with his shoulder and jams his hand under my coat dress and pulls down my tights. " Carroll claimed Trump "opens the overcoat, unzips his pants, and, forcing his fingers around my private area, thrusts his penis halfway – or completely, I’m not certain – inside me. " The episode lasted no longer than three minutes, Carroll said. It was the last time she had sex, she wrote. The incident was not reported to the police, and Carroll said she told only two close friends, whose names were not made public in the story. One told her to go to the police. The other told her to forget about it, she wrote. "She is trying to sell a new book – that should indicate her motivation. It should be sold in the fiction section," Trump said in a statement Friday. "Shame on those who make up false stories of assault to try to get publicity for themselves, or sell a book, or carry out a political agenda. " He pointed out that the department store had no footage of the incident or the pair in the store together and said there was no proof of an assault. New York Magazine, along with other outlets, including The New York Times, talked with the two friends, who verified that Carroll told them her account. Both said they did not want their names publicized for fear of threats. Carroll could not be reached by USA TODAY on Saturday.

'I just want to honor him'

Texto completo: Calling attention to what has been described as "a violent and often-ignored chapter of Delaware history," legislators and community members gathered Sunday to unveil a state historical marker commemorating the only documented lynching in the First State.
Installed by the Delaware Public Archives at New Castle County's Greenbank Park in Prices Corner, the new historic marker memorializes the 1903 lynching of laborer George White at the hands of a white mob. He was burned at the stake, according to historical accounts and newspaper archives.
"I don't think he's ever going to be forgotten," Savannah Shepherd, soon to be a senior at the Sanford School in Hockessin said standing in front of a tower that is all that remains of the New Castle County workhouse White was imprisoned in before his death.
The high schooler was instrumental in getting the memorial put up and first learned of White's murder after visiting the National Memorial for Peace and Justice in Montgomery, Alabama – the nation's first memorial dedicated to the roughly 4,300 documented racial terror lynchings of African Americans between the end of the Civil War and the end of World War II.
"There was no getting George White's name out of my head," Shepherd said. "... I just want to honor him. I just hope he's proud."
White had been accused of killing Helen S. Bishop, the daughter of the Ferris Industrial School's superintendent, weeks earlier and was being held at a workhouse awaiting trial. Bishop, 17, was attacked on her way home from Prices Corner on June 16, 1903, according to The News Journal's archives. Her throat was cut three times and she died several hours later.
After her death, residents called for White to be tried immediately, but instead, the proceedings were scheduled for September of that year.
People quickly became impatient and decided to take matters into their own hands.
Two attempts to carry White from the workhouse had already failed when local pastor Robert Elwood delivered a sermon that sparked a violent confrontation between White's jailers and an angry mob.
White was eventually dragged off and burned alive on June 23 while pieces of his charred body were taken by the mob as souvenirs.
The following is an expert from a 2017 Delaware Online column looking back at the lynching:
"As night fell, thousands stormed the prison where White was being protected, while the warden, prison guards and Wilmington police tried to stop the frenzied mob, firing shots and turning on high-pressured water hoses.
In the melee, a 15-year-old boy was fatally shot.
The would-be lynchers forced their way through steel doors into White's prison cell, took him to a field near the scene of the crime, lit a pyre of straw and fence posts smashed into kindling, coiled ropes around the man and threw him into the fire.
White twice freed himself only to be thrown back into the flames as thousands of all ages watched and some cheered.
The New York Sun wrote, "By dawn a few pale bones were all that remained of the black man. Vendors hawked them in the streets of Wilmington as souvenirs."
The Every Evening reported on people taking pieces of wood, clothing and even the body from the pyre."
The lynching made national news.
A minister's letter to the New York Times called Delaware "a community corrupted in civic ideals and void in civic and moral virility."
President Teddy Roosevelt reportedly said: "Whoever in any part of our country has taken part in lawlessly putting to death a criminal by fire must forever have the awful spectacle of his own handiwork seared into his brain and soul. He can never again be the same man."
No one was ever convicted of any crimes related to White's murder, though one man was initially arrested.
The charges against him were quickly dismissed, according to The News Journal's archives.
Elwood, the pastor, was found guilty by the Presbyterian church of being "unchristian" but instead of being punished was told to be more "judicious in the future," according to The News Journal's Archives.
Although a documentary has been made about White's lynching and the story has been repeated over the years by various historians and journalists, the incident has been largely forgotten by the general public.
That is until Shepherd, a high schooler, went to see the memorial in Alabama. It is operated by the Equal Justice Initiative, a nonprofit founded by criminal justice reform pioneer and Milton, Delaware-native Bryan Stevenson, who is now the subject of the HBO documentary "True Justice," slated to premiere on Wednesday.
His brother, Howard Stevenson, professor of Africana studies at the University of Pennsylvania, was at the historical marker's unveiling Sunday.
"Why do we need to remember the past?" he asked the crowd.
Because there's no reconciliation without truth, he said.
Shepherd has helped the community take a step in that direction, he said. After she got home from Alabama, she founded the Delaware Social Justice Remembrance Coalition and worked to get a historic marker placed in the area where White was killed.
She approached Sen. Darius Brown, D-Wilmington, who agreed to cover the cost of the marker and advance Shepherd's efforts. Brown is also chair of the Delaware Legislative Black Caucus.
"It's important for all Delawareans to know what our history is so not only can we have the knowledge of it and some of the ugly, unfortunate things that have occurred but how we can also work together to improve and create opportunities along racial lines here in the state of Delaware," Brown said Sunday.
Brown said public acknowledgment of the lynching is long overdue.
U.S. Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester, the first African American and the first woman to represent Delaware in Congress, said growing up in Delaware, she had heard rumors of it. But no one seemed to know the full story.
She challenged the crowd to speak his name out loud.
"George White, George White, George White," they chanted.
"George White, we say your name," Blunt Rochester said.
Blunt Rochester, echoing Howard Stevenson, said things need to be brought out into the open before healing can take place.
"I believe trauma and hate grow like mold with two ingredients: silence and darkness," she said, adding that both are woven into the walls of some of the country's greatest institutions.
"Let me tell you, we cannot Febreze this stuff away. To fully heal, you need sunlight and love."

Texto completo: Confounded by declining enrollment and the prospect of increasing tuition for faculty and staff salary raises, many higher education institutions in New Mexico would benefit greatly from an infusion of revenue. Up$tart, a new initiative being piloted at Northern New Mexico College in Española, will utilize software to bundle applications for social benefits for low-income college students and provide those funds. By integrating applications for federal benefits -- the free application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA, necessary for Pell Grants), the Earned Income Tax Credit, the Child Tax Credit, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, Supplemental Security Income and Veterans Benefits -- Up$tart could increase student income as much as $3,297 on average.
Simplifying complex applications evolving through "silo" programs operated by different agencies is logical for students as well as universities. Students navigating different applications would better invest time in studies as opposed to the social-benefit paper chase. As prospective beneficiaries throw up their hands in frustration and give up, they forfeit thousands of dollars in benefits. Wading through the bureaucratic "sludge" ultimately results in low benefit take-up rates. "Most programs designed to benefit poor people have participation rates of between 30 and 60 percent," noted behavioral economist Cass Sunstein.
Universities also gain from bundling benefits. For 2016-17, the University of New Mexico had 11,495 Pell Grant recipients. Assuming Up$tart was fully operational and increased social benefits for Pell Grantees half of the amount above, UNM students would have generated $18.9 million. While Up$tart is free to students, institutions will be charged $5 per Pell Grant recipient. Subtracting Up$tart's charge to UNM of $57,475, the return on investment is approximately 330 to 1. Similarly, New Mexico State University would have increased students' income $16 million.
Increasing income for poor students increases retention as well as the prospect of graduation. A recent New York Times analysis of public universities revealed that both UNM and NMSU graduated significantly fewer students compared to universities with more aggressive anti-dropout policies. But this is not meant to be a critique of our two flagship universities. On the contrary, systemic support structures statewide like Up$tart have the potential to help all of our higher education institutions. "The most effective way for colleges to spend money may simply be to give it to students -- not just to pay for tuition but also to cover living expenses," the report concluded. Ben Castleman, an education professor at the University of Virginia, cited affordability as "probably the biggest factor" prompting dropouts.
Extrapolating to other New Mexico institutions, a 5 percent increase in Pell Grants, the EITC and SNAP would have generated $69 million in 2015 for New Mexico, all federal revenue. Arguably, the state leaves million-dollar bills on the sidewalk when New Mexicans are unable to access social benefits.
Like other revenue streams, including wages, charitable contributions, tax credits and federal grants, social benefits are essential for a flourishing public sector. Failure to access social benefits contributes to New Mexico being less competitive than neighboring states, such as Arizona, Texas and Colorado, which have become magnates for talent and capital. In 2015, the Measure of America ranked New Mexico and Nevada last in its Opportunity Index.
By enhancing access to social benefits, Up$tart would contribute to New Mexico's prosperity, increasing student income, improving the college graduation rate and bolstering the state economy, a win-win-win scenario. We plan to make New Mexico not only the trendsetter, but the exemplar, in providing more access to higher education for low-income students across the nation.

China’s Great Firewall and the end of globalization

Texto completo: The Great Firewall of China—Beijing’s AI-powered website blocker, used to shut down Western media penetration—is spelling an end to the era of globalization. While digital tech encompasses the world, the East and the West have hardened into two separate spheres. There is no looking back.
Through the Great Firewall, China’s leadership has turned off nearly every major English-language news outlet, from the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal on down. The Washington Post and the Guardian, two of the last survivors, were zeroed our in time for the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre.
Social media has not been spared. All the big US platforms and services, Google, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, are access denied; group chat applications like WhatsApp are firmly out of reach.
Companies including Google have struggled, sometimes secretly, to figure out how to get back into the Chinese market, even if it means working on much cozier or even riskier terms with the country’s military than Americans—and their own workers—are ready to tolerate. The dream of one globally integrated world, networks and ultimately controlled by the masters of the internet, dies hard.
But it has died. Nowhere is the digital divide between East and West sharper than it is where Hong Kong stops and the rest of China begins. Rebellion against a draconian extradition law that would see Hong Kong residents spirited away to the mainland for punishment made national Western headlines, with huge crowds spilling into the streets—and voluntarily shutting down their own online activity to frustrate or defeat Chinese monitoring.
That’s a long way from the days of the Arab Spring, when autocratic regimes put their internets on lockdown to stop protests from mobilizing into more serious political opposition. Today, governments have learned how to reassert sovereignty over their digital domains—not just how to pull the plug.
But for China the two are hardly mutually exclusive. The goal is no Western media, just as Western religion, which is seen to breed rampant heresy, instability, and factionalism, is being all but expunged from the country. China’s digital plan is to remoralize its billion-plus population before venality and vice wrecks civil society.
That’s frighteningly Orwellian to the West. In China, by contrast, the Orwellian imagination is unwelcome: both the fear of servility and the fear of mastery at the heart of 1984. Technological times have changed since Orwell’s day—digital rule is about the triumph of machine memory, not of Big Brother’s compulsory fantasies—but in the West, the dystopian vision endures. In China, no such millennia-old tradition of the slavery-and-mastery morality play exists.
It’s not that the Chinese can have no appreciation for freedom, of course; it’s that their experience with digital will simply not shape them and be shaped by them in the same way as we in the West will ours.
That alone marks a harsh lesson for Western elites. Those clinging bitterly to certitudes that more modernization, more money, or more engagement will eventually bring down the autocratic regime in favor of Western-style democracy are indulging in a fantasy every bit as dangerous as 2 + 2 = 5.
In technology, leading Westerners are beside themselves to see Chinese researchers and companies being squeezed out from American positions. But China has so penetrated strategic American tech and science that it would be negligent at best not to do so.
In academia, leading Westerners fear that the loss of lucrative Chinese students and access to brilliant Chinese graduate students will gobble America’s development of next-generation tools and patents. But the West has grown too lazy and comfortable leaning on outside talent while home-grown students become over-credentialed and under-employable ingrates with a resentful sense of entitlement and little game plan for the future.
And in entertainment media, leading Westerners have grown similarly dependent on “international”—read Chinese—audiences to prop up box office numbers, make movies marketable and produceable, and sustain the illusion that Hollywood and its power brokers hold real cultural authority in America and beyond. But the reality of a contracting and consolidating industry with little to say about life besides formulaic and narrow-cast cultural politics is inescapable.
The message China has sent the West’s elite, in other words, is painfully simple: you need us more than we need you. And the West agrees. It is Western elites, not Chinese ones, who are still hung up on the utopian dream of creating one harmonious and standardized world. China’s bid for international power hinges on its domestic priorities of preventing chaos, civil strife, and the collapse of its sovereignty; if Beijing thought it could lock its power in and fully establish state morality through the populace without a hugely risky intercontinental economic and infrastructure program, it likely would have gone in that direction. It didn’t.
And the West? It harbors three leading assets over the Chinese: its media apparatus, its military capability, and its financial power. Of these, the first has effectively been neutralized in China. The third is holding steady, but the second is showing cracks in its mystique. If China can use technology to make its absolute sovereign control over its culture and morality complete, it will consider itself to have the upper hand.
And if the West continues to fragment into weak and Balkanized camps dominated by bureaucratic revolutionaries at odds with their country’s histories and cultures, and ultimately their own countrymen, the Chinese will be right.

Texto completo: If you go
Northwest Passages Book Club: "The River: Author Peter Heller"
When: 7-8:30 p.m. Tuesday
Where: Montvale Event Center, 1017 W 1st Ave., Spokane
Info: General admission: $5; students: $4. VIP tickets are $35 and include a private reception with Heller, a glass of wine or beer from the bar, a copy of Heller's latest book, "The River," and reserved seating.
All tickets are available at spokane7tickets.com.
Peter Heller will be in Spokane on Tuesday for an evening discussion with the Northwest Passages Book Club. The acclaimed writer of books such as "Kook," "The Dog Stars" and "The Painter" will talk about his latest book, "The River," at the Montvale Event Center. Here are five things readers should know about Heller and his work.
First writing job
Heller enjoyed outdoor adventures and had been told he could write, and when suggested he combine the two, he took that advice. His writing career started after he cold-called an editor with Outdoor Magazine, and his pitch was accepted: traversing an un-run river on the Tibeaten Plateau.
A natural storyteller with an engaging conversational manner, Heller has been a longtime contributor to NPR, an editor for Outdoor Magazine, Men's Journal, National Geographic Adventure and continues to write for Businessweek and Travel & Leisure Magazine. His nonfiction titles include "The Whale Warrior, Hell or High Water; Surviving Tibet's Tsango River" and "Kook: What Surfing Taught Me About Love, Life, and Catching the Perfect Wave."
Wait  what? Does he surf?
Yes, yes, he does.
In 2010, Heller took on the challenge to go from beginner surfer - a kook - to a shredder, a real surfer within a year. The closest thing he got to a surfboard before that was a kayak. Undetered and ready for adventure, Heller recounts the year in his memoir: "Kook: What Surfing Taught Me About Love, Life, and Catching the Perfect Wave."
He doesn't tweet
There is a Twitter handle for Peter Heller @kookPete, but while the account has been active since 2010, he hasn't tweeted once.
You would think the character limit would work for Heller as he starts each project with one line, not believing in structuring an outline as he described in an earlier interview with The Spokesman-Review:
"When I sit down to write a novel, I want it to be like running a river for the first time," he said. "You get in the current, you travel into territories that you've never been before.  You don't know what's going to be around the next corner. I love that about writing fiction."
His fiction borrows
from real life
"The Dog Stars" (Vintage Contemporaries, 2012), Heller's first foray into fiction, was a post-apocalyptic story that centered around a man, his dog and an airplane. Heller is a pilot, a hunter, a fisherman, an outdoorsman and a poet. The main character of "Dog Star," Hig, is also a pilot, a hunter, a fisherman, an outdoorsman and a poet.
In "The Painter" (Vintage Contemporaries, 2014), the character of Jim Stegner bares a striking resemblance to Heller's real-life friend, Jim Wagner, a painter in Taos, New Mexico.
The main character in "Celine" (Vintage Contemporaries, 2017) is based on his mother, an American born in Paris who became a real-life private investigator.
"The River" (Knopf, 2019) is no exception. At 17, Heller spoke to a man whose wife had died on a river expedition. Even at 17, Heller thought he was being fed a line. The main characters in the "The River," best friends Jack and Wynn, also are versions of Heller and Jay, his best friend from college.
Net Zero house
Committed to the environment, Heller lives in a Net Zero house in his hometown of Denver. Net Zero construction combines energy efficiency and smart design - ensuring that the renewable energy produced onsite meets the demand of the energy consumed by the building.
Suggested reading
If you liked reading "The River" - and you've read all his titles, here are a few more adventure-fiction titles for you to check out:
"The Feather Thief: Beauty, Obsession, and the Natural History Heist of the Century: by Kirk Wallace Johnson Johnson succeeds in conveying the gravity of this natural-history "heist of the century," and one of "The Feather Thief's" greatest strengths is the excitement, horror and amazement it evokes. It's nonfiction that reads like fiction, with plenty of surprising moments." Outside
"Where the Crawdads Sing" by Delia Owens A painfully beautiful first novel that is at once a murder mystery, a coming-of-age narrative and a celebration of nature. ... Owens (who lives in North Idaho) here surveys the desolate marshlands of the North Carolina coast through the eyes of an abandoned child. And, in her isolation, that child makes us open our own eyes to the secret wonders - and dangers - of her private world." The New York Times Book Review
"Deep River" by Karl Marlantes Inspired by family history, Marlantes ("Matterhorn") offers a sprawling, painstakingly realistic novel about Finnish immigrants in the Pacific Northwest during the first half of the 20th century Marlantes's epic is packed with intriguing detail about Finnish culture, Northwest landscapes and 20th century American history, making for a vivid immigrant family chronicle." -Publishers Weekly
"The Mountain Story" by Lori Lansens "Lansens has written a colorful, adventurous wilderness survival novel.  The realistic details, such as the traditional herbal medicine used to fight Nola's broken-bone infection and threatening coyotes and vultures, provides the narrative's raw edge. Genre readers will also be swept along as the suspense builds in this first-rate character-driven thriller." Publishers Weekly

Texto completo: Amy Trompetter speaks her mind on controversial topics by letting her puppets do the talking.
The puppeteer, 76, has a large collection of puppets that represent various political issues. She houses them in her theater company, Redwing Blackbird Theater in Rosendale, which travels the world performing thought-provoking plays, operas and musicals. Additionally, the theater performs hand puppet shows and outdoor pageants.
Trompetter recently opened a museum to house all of her best work, built over five decades. It is based outside of the theater's studio, which is also her home.
"We need to make the Redwing Blackbird Theater more communal," she said. "We will have workshops on a regular basis and small shows for the public."
She also will be launching the "Truth" tour, a touring production of her play of the same name on the life of Sojourner Truth, the famed abolitionist, women's rights activist and suffragist who was born into slavery in Ulster County sometime in 1797. It debuted at the nearby Rosendale Theatre last summer and will visit Poughkeepsie, Newburgh and Kingston in the spring of 2020.
Her work has been performed for years at Bard College's Richard B. Fisher Center for the Performing Arts, including the ballet "Fantasque," with choreographer John Heginbotham, and the play "Requiem for Anna Politkovskaya."
The latter is based on the story of the journalist who was mysteriously slain in Russia in 2006 after her extensive coverage of the war in Chechnya and criticism of President Vladimir Putin.
It was Politkovskaya's quest for truth that motivated Trompetter to create the play.
"She was so unprotected as a woman, but she didn't back off under death threats," she said.
The opera is a collaboration between her and Russian composer Alexander Bakshi, whom she met through a mutual friend at the Harriman Institute at Columbia University's Barnard College.
"The stars converged that allowed me to do this piece," Trompetter said. "I was getting the resources and the perfect collaborator."
Bakshi described their collaboration.
"Amy likes to improvise," he said. "I need a lot of time to react adequately."
With more journalist deaths appearing in the media in recent years, Trompetter feels now is the right time to revive the play.
"Continuing (this piece) is my mandate," she said. "I need to do it one more time, it's an even more relevant story now."
Another hit for Trompetter was "The Barber of Seville," the Gioachino Rossini opera that was performed in Brooklyn's St. Ann's Warehouse twice, two decades apart in 1983 and 2003. Both productions were given rave reviews by The New York Times.
Trompetter got her start as a puppeteer in college. The Ohio native had transferred to the University of California-Berkeley from the College of New Rochelle, and the shy, Catholic girl was intrigued by the idea of theater after working for a college missionary organization.
"As a student, I went to work and the young people on the streets seemed to be interested in street theater," she said. "Then I left for New York City after I graduated at the time of Vietnam War protests, and there were several theaters, but Bread and Puppet Theater left me spellbound."
Bread and Puppet Theater hosted a protest featuring 12-foot-tall puppets of Vietnamese women with their hands bound and a giant airplane flying over.
"This was so deeply moving and inspiring," Trompetter said. "It brought together everything I cared about: politics, spiritualism and art."
The theater company was given the Public Theater as a workspace, and she followed them, knowing this was her calling.
"I thought to myself, if I don't go back, I've blown it," she said. "Puppet theater gives you a way to not be taking the center of the stage."
Trompetter started working as an adjunct professor at Bates and Barnard colleges, teaching world theater.
She admired Asian theater and would use her savings from working as a professor to fund research trips to countries such as Burma and China. She explained that it is different from Westernized theater in that the script, the sets and the costumes all are done by one creator.
"I would use all my professional development money to travel to theaters around the world," she said. "Traditional theaters have a visual richness that Western theater has tried to separate."
The work reminded her of her work with the Bread and Puppet Theater.
"I felt like I was searching for the grandparents and great-grandparents of the Bread and Puppet Theater in my research," Trompetter said.
Her first major production was "Punch and Judy," in 1978, based on the 16th-century play on sexual dynamics between men and women.
She has performed another interpretation with a Faustian twist: with President Trump as the devil and deceased Brazilian political activist Marielle Franco as the protagonist. Franco was murdered last year in what has been thought to be a targeted assassination.
Trompetter expresses the difficulties of being an artist and creator when visual and performing arts are often left underfunded.
"It's difficult every morning," she said. "In this country, the arts are not supported. Every time, you're working from scratch to find the resources to perform."
She believes that we live in a "society of spectacle," where mainstream media mesmerizes people into living a consumerist lifestyle and away from art for art's sake.
"The kinds of advertising on TV help take away people from the truth and responsibility for helping others," she said.
What gives Trompetter comfort is knowing that the younger generation seems to not be as tantalized by commercialism, instead opting for activism.
"There's more urgency now," she said. "With young people, there's more of a drive for self-preservation and the willingness to not pursue a professional career for a wealthy lifestyle."

Texto completo: Family secrets, every family has them. But should your estate plan be one of those secrets?
In my law practice, I am often asked by parents if they should provide a copy of their estate planning documents to their adult child(ren), or at least discuss the plan with them. And the typical lawyer answer I give is “it depends.” And it does.
It depends on the ages of those folks; whether you’re likely to make significant changes in the future; if there is anything unusual in your plan; whether anyone is being disinherited or inheriting less than what they might expect; and your relationship with the heirs and beneficiaries in general.
There are, however, some general rules.
What not to keep secret
Someone besides you (and your spouse, if applicable) should know where your documents are stored.
By the time your will, trust, health care directive, or power of attorney is needed, you are either deceased or incapacitated, so you won’t be available to hand over keys or combinations or directions to your secret storage spot.
Generally, it’s not a good idea to keep your documents in a bank safe deposit box either — access to these is notoriously difficult and they can’t be reached as quickly as may be needed in an emergency.
Your heirs and beneficiaries should know which attorney drafted your documents and how to reach them.
It’s a good idea to inform your heirs who you’ve put in charge when you’re gone. The trustee of your trust will have immediate duties and responsibilities. It’s good for them to be aware of their role ahead of time so they are prepared and willing to act.
The job of trustee is a big one — it’s not necessarily an “honor.” Thus, let them all know whom you’ve selected and why. You might find out the person you chose doesn’t want to serve, or the others object to that choice for very valid reasons.
I once had a client choose one child as trustee because the other four children “liked” that child. But during the family meeting to review the plan with all the children, it became clear that while they may have liked that child, they did not respect him. We could all see he wasn’t likely to act fairly either. Luckily, it was also apparent there was one child they all did respect. We made the change immediately.
If you are disinheriting a child or leaving one child less than the others, it’s generally a good idea to make that known ahead of time as well as your reasons for doing so. If you aren’t comfortable telling that child directly, let your attorney and your other children, and perhaps a trusted friend or adviser, know your reasons for the disinheritance. You may be able to avoid a costly fight later.
Secrets you might keep
You may want to keep the dispositive provisions of your estate plan (i.e. who gets what and when) confidential. Your children don’t need to know if you’ve left a charitable gift in addition to what you’ve left them, or how much you have, or that you’ve left the grandchildren something as well. Those things often change over time.
If you’re concerned about the spending habits of the spouse of one of your children, or the possibility of a child divorcing, you can arrange for that child’s share to be held in trust to maintain its separate property status (in California). That might be awkward to bring up at a family dinner, so you don’t have to go into details. You can simply let your child know you’ve provided for them in a trust that will give them creditor protection. (“Creditor” includes future ex-spouses, but doesn’t “creditor protection” sound so much nicer?).
Your list of assets and liabilities isn’t something anyone needs to know currently. But there should be a list (often it’s attached to your trust) and contact information readily available so that the trustee or agent acting under a power of attorney can spring into action when needed.
Many times I’ve seen family members struggle to find out where the bank accounts are, whether there was a mortgage on the house, and if there was any insurance, for weeks and months, which causes a delay in the entire administration process and unnecessary stress during an already stressful time.
Don’t take it to the grave
Finally, you’d be doing your family members a great favor if you talked about your wishes for end-of-life care and memorial services. It’s a difficult topic, but an important one. Talk about whether you want to be an organ donor, your desires for pain medication, life support and CPR.
If you prefer cremation or burial, let your loved ones know. The more plans you make on your own, including pre-paid burial arrangements, and share with your loved ones, the less their burden will be when they are grieving your loss. They’ll be able to focus on celebrating you and your life, your final gift to them.

D.C. Memo: Getting out of your comfort food zone

Autor: Schneider, Gabe. 

Información de publicación: MinnPost.com ; Minneapolis, Minn. [Minneapolis, Minn]. 21 June 2019.

Texto completo: Welcome to this week’s edition of the D.C. Memo. This week in Washington, Ilhan Omar takes center stage, while Amy Klobuchar will not be center stage at the upcoming debate.
Before we dive in, a quick plug: We just started MinnPost’s summer membership drive. If you appreciate this newsletter — or all the great reporting coming out of our newsroom — please consider contributing so we can keep you informed on the most important stories coming out of D.C., St. Paul and throughout Greater Minnesota.
Okay, shameless plug over: Let’s get on with it.
The President Next Door?
What exactly is Sen. Klobuchar’s stance on copper-nickel mining? Environment reporter Walker Orenstein and I tried to find out. Read more.
This week, Klobuchar provided a comprehensive list of executive actions and steps she would take in her first 100 days in office as president. There isn’t a consistent theme, but the list is comprehensive. A few that I found notable:
* Requiring publicly traded companies to disclose all political spending over $10,000 to their shareholders.
* Directing the IRS to institute the requirement that tax-exempt organizations that engage in issue advocacy disclose to the IRS the names of individual donors who contribute more than $5,000 per year.
* Undoing attempts by the Trump administration – many of which have been blocked by courts – to deport DREAMers and immigrants who are living, working and succeeding here under Temporary Protected Status and Deferred Enforcement Departure.
* Immediately allowing for the safe importation of prescription drugs from countries like Canada.
And in a New York Times interview, she (and 20 other candidates) were asked 18 questions like: “Do you think Israel meets international standards of human rights?” and “Do you think it’s possible for the next president to stop climate change?”
The answers were deeply revealing and the video format works well, so take a watch. There were clear and obvious divides on what the candidates know about Israel, for example, and how exactly they characterize the country’s government.
If you want to mix it up a bit, watch some of the policy answers and then listen to what the candidates’ favorite comfort foods are. For Klobuchar, “A baked potato.” For presidential candidate and spiritual guru Marianne Williamson , “I have no comfort food.” For me, because I’m oversharing today, it’s cacio e pepe (which is basically just cheese, pasta, and pepper, if you haven’t had it).
If you want to watch Klobuchar answer more questions (this time live!), she will be on the debate stage on Wednesday, June 26, for the first night of debates. The debate will run from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m CDT and the first night’s stage will also include:
* Cory Booker New Jersey senator
* Julián Castro , former secretary of Housing and Urban Development
* Bill de Blasio , New York mayor
* John Delaney , former U.S. representative from Maryland
* Tulsi Gabbard , U.S. representative from Hawaii
* Jay Inslee , Washington governor
* Beto O’Rourke , former U.S. representative from Texas
* Tim Ryan , U.S. representative from Ohio
* Elizabeth Warren , Massachusetts senator
Candidates currently polling the highest will take the center stage. On this night, that means Warren and O’Rourke. Klobuchar has been polling at around 2 percent in most states, and while being off to the side won’t preclude her from talking, she won’t be directly in the spotlight.
Other news from the trail
Former Vice President Joe Biden stole the week (again), this time by referencing his amicable relationship with segregationist leaders like former Sens. James O. Eastland of Mississippi and Herman E. Talmadge of Georgia. Eastland, among other things, was known for describing black people as “an inferior race.”
Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, one of three black senators, critiqued Biden for discussing his relationship with Eastland and Talmadge and suggested he should apologize. In turn, Biden said that it was actually Booker who should apologize.
Sen. Kamala Harris of California had this to say: “He’s done very good work, and he has served our country in a very noble way. But to coddle the reputations of segregationists, of people who if they had their way I would literally not be standing here as a member of the United States Senate, is, I think, it’s just misinformed and it’s wrong.”
A ban on school lunch shaming
On Wednesday, Rep. Ilhan Omar , of Minnesota’s Fifth District, introduced legislation to reimburse schools for families that fall behind on school lunch payments. Standing with her was Valerie Castile, the mother of Philando Castile, the beloved Falcon Heights school cafeteria worker who was shot and killed during a traffic stop in 2016. Philando Castile was known for paying for school lunches out of his own pocket, and in March, Valerie raised over $130,000 in his honor to repay school lunch debts in St. Paul.
The media lately has been full of supposedly inspirational stories of generous donors or students saving their allowance in order to pay for their classmates to be able to eat. The bill is intended to be a stark rebuke to the systemic problems that cause that in the first place. The bill is co-sponsored by many members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus , where Omar serves as whip. Sen. Tina Smith has sponsored the Senate version of the bill.
Emmer’s NRCC mandate
Politico has a story Thursday about how some Republicans believe the National Republican Campaign Committee, chaired by Sixth District Rep. Tom Emmer , is lagging behind. Something I found particularly interesting is: When asked about a personal attack on a Democrat (the NRCC called New York Rep. Max Rose “little”), Emmer had this to say: “Our communications team has a direct mandate from me and Leader [Kevin] McCarthy to be ruthless.”
Beyond calling Rose “little,” the NRCC has also charged that California Rep. Mike Levin , who was raised Jewish, supports “anti-semitic conspiracy theories” and argued that AIPAC, a bipartisan pro-Israel advocacy organization, is representative of all Jews.
“His team is inept. They have no idea what they’re doing,” one disgruntled GOP lawmaker told The Hill.
Amending the Trump administration
Omar this week, without much coverage, placed in an amendment to stop a Department of Energy loan program intended to promote renewable energy from being used to fund projects like the Appalachian Storage Hub. ASH is a $10 billion project over 500 square miles that would transport fracking byproducts to turn them into plastics. The amendment, bundled with several others, passed the House 233-200 on Wednesday.
Concerned community citizens?
The New York Times visits St. Cloud , where some residents and local politicians are pushing back on immigration, saying that Minnesota has gone too far. When asked why they have these beliefs, or how exactly immigrants are impacting their way of life, one resident had this to say: “They were just —” she told the Times, searching for the words to describe the offending behavior of the Somali-Americans. “They were just walking around.”
In other news
* Former White House Communications Director Hope Hicks refused to provide answers about the Mueller Report to a majority of questions asked by the House Judiciary Committee.
* The media cycle was engaged on whether undocumented Americans are being detained in concentration camps, after Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York called them as such. The wording is charged and makes people uncomfortable, but if you’re going strictly by the definition of the word, it’s hard to say that they are not. George Takei, who was imprisoned in an internment camp as a child during World War 2, said: “I know what concentration camps are. I was inside two of them, in America. And yes, we are operating such camps again.”
* Matt Pierce at the LA Times has a profile of Jay Inslee titled: “Jay Inslee’s 2020 plan: Become president, save the planet.”
* Nevada, Texas, and California’s roles have shifted dramatically, and will be critical for Democratic candidate’s pathway to the presidential nomination.
Quote of the week
“There’s not a racist bone in my body.” — Joe Biden, responding to criticism of his relationship with segregationists.
What I’m reading
Splinter: “The Revenge of the Poverty-Stricken College Professors Is Underway in Florida. And It’s Big.”
Splinter’s Hamilton Nolan flew to Florida to talk about the crisis of housing and food insecurity for adjunct professors, and the organizing effort that’s looking to curb it.
The New York Times Mag: “Judge Judy Is Still Judging You”
A comprehensive profile of Judge Judy. Everybody watches Judge Judy. Now you can read about her.
That’s all for this week. Thanks for sticking around. Until next week, feel free to send tips, suggestions, and sound advice to: gschneider@minnpost.com. Follow at @gabemschneider . And don’t forget to become a MinnPost member.

Tyson Foods, Boeing, Slack: Stocks That Defined The Week

Texto completo: The S&P 500 surged to a record Thursday, as major indexes rallied this past week after the Federal Reserve hinted Wednesday of possible interest-rate cuts if the economic outlook doesn't improve.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 2.4% to 26,719.13 on the week. The S&P 500 added 2.2%, closing at 2,950.46, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 3% to 8,031.71.
Separately, U.S. oil prices jumped 5.4% Thursday to $56.65 as geopolitical concerns intensified after Iran shot down an American reconnaissance drone. For the week, oil rose 8.8%, its biggest weekly gain since early December.
Here, the stocks that defined the week:
Tyson Foods Inc.
Tyson Foods and other meat producers tumbled Monday as persistent flooding in the Midwest threatened crops used for livestock feed. Millions of U.S. farm acres are set to go unplanted, and the prospect of a planting shortage has driven up corn and soybean futures. The higher feed costs could weigh on meat producers' bottom lines. Tyson Foods fell 4.1% Monday, Sanderson Farms Inc. declined 7.4% and Pilgrim's Pride Corp. lost 3.8%.
Boeing Co.
Boeing shares gained 5.4% Tuesday after British Airways parent International Consolidated Airlines Group SA said it had signed a letter of intent to buy as many as 200 Boeing 737 MAX planes, giving the jet maker its first such deal since the model was grounded months ago after two fatal crashes. The company has also gotten a vote of confidence for its other planes this week, as Qatar Airways said Wednesday it had signed an order to purchase five 777 freighters worth $1.8 billion and China Airlines said it planned to order as many as six of the freighters.
Sotheby's
Going once, going twice…sold, to art collector and media entrepreneur Patrick Drahi. Sotheby's agreed on Monday to be taken private by Mr. Drahi in a $2.66 billion deal, ending the global auction house's 31-year run as a public company. Mr. Drahi is buying Sotheby's shares outstanding for $57 apiece, a 61% premium to Sotheby's closing price the Friday before. "For my entire life, I have been passionate about this industry," Mr. Drahi said, "and I believe the opportunities and growth potential are significant for Sotheby's." The deal is slated to close in the fourth quarter of 2019. Shares surged 59% Monday to close at $56.13.
Slack Technologies Inc.
Slack shares soared 49% in their first day of trading Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange, the latest initial offering to pop in recent weeks after the successful debuts of Uber Technologies Inc. and Beyond Meat Inc. The workplace-messaging company, trading under the ticker symbol "WORK," opened at $38.50, beating its so-called reference price of $26 published by the NYSE on Wednesday. The company ended its first day at $38.62, giving Slack a valuation of about $23.2 billion. Slack went public via an unusual method called a direct listing, joining Spotify Technology SA as among the biggest companies to make such a move, which is significantly cheaper than going public conventionally.
Walmart Inc.
Walmart agreed Thursday to pay $282 million to resolve criminal and regulatory investigations into whether it paid bribes around the world, acknowledging that the company had lax policies in place to catch potential corruption. The deal requires Walmart to return $144 million in gains to the Securities and Exchange Commission and pay a $138 million penalty to the Justice Department. The investigation began as a result of a series of 2012 New York Times articles describing payments Walmart made in Mexico to obtain permits to build stores there, and later explored the company's business in other countries, including Brazil, China and India. Walmart shares gained 0.7% Friday.
MoneyGram International Inc.
MoneyGram said late Monday that cryptocurrency startup Ripple has agreed to invest up to $50 million in the money-transfer company, in one of the first crypto-based company investments in a major U.S. publicly listed firm. The initial deal would give Ripple about a 10% stake in MoneyGram. Under that deal, MoneyGram said it would use Ripple's XRP technology to handle cross-border transfers of digital funds for at least two years. The two companies began working together in 2018 when MoneyGram agreed to run a pilot program testing XRP, and this deal is an extension of that program. MoneyGram shares soared 168% Tuesday.
Carnival Corp.
Carnival, the world's biggest cruise operator, cut its full-year earnings outlook Thursday, citing a hit from voyage cancellations, the abrupt Cuba travel ban imposed by the U.S. and weakening demand in Europe. Carnival shares fell 7.7% Thursday and extended its losses Friday, losing more than 12% for the week. The report weighed on other cruise-line operators such as Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd., which closed Thursday down 2.5%, and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., which fell 3.2%. Earlier this month, new restrictions from the Trump administration barred American cruise ships from going to Cuba, forcing cruise lines to reroute already planned trips.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - That the Democrats' two evenings of dueling oratory snippets this week are called "debates validates Finley Peter Dunne's prediction that "when we Americans are through with the English language, it will look as if it had been run over by a musical comedy.
Already a linguistic casualty of the campaign is the noun "socialism. So, quickly, before Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' campaign sinks, like darling Clementine, beneath the foaming brine, consider his struggle to convince Americans that socialism deserves to be the wave of their future.
One European explanation of America's puzzling (to many European intellectuals) resistance to socialism was given in 1906 by the German economist Werner Sombart: "All the socialist utopias came to nothing on roast beef and apple pie. Recently, however, Sanders delivered a Washington speech explaining, in effect, that socialism is as American as a piece of frozen apple pie with a slice of processed cheese. Doing so, however, he demonstrated that socialism is a classification that no longer classifies.
Sanders' socialism turns out to be a tweaked New Deal. He began, of course, by saying that the nation is in "a defining and pivotal moment. Speechwriters actually get paid for such bromides; capitalist America remains a land of opportunity even for the untalented. What Sanders then offered as forward-looking socialism was a warmed-over version of what President Franklin Roosevelt advocated 75 years ago.
In his 1944 State of the Union address, FDR called for "rights to "useful jobs, "good education, "adequate food and clothing and recreation, a "decent living for farmers, a "decent home, "adequate medical care, "adequate protection in old age. Details, such as how to define the adjectives and how to pay for what the nouns denote, were for another day. Sanders' agenda for "completion of FDR's New Deal is a right to a "decent job, "quality health care, "complete education, "affordable housing, a "clean environment, a "secure retirement. Details later.
Sanders says, "what I mean by democratic socialism is "economic rights are human rights. Really. That's it. FDR said, "necessitous men are not free men, implying that government can and should remove necessity from the human story. Sanders, FDR's unimaginative echo, presumably agrees.
Sanders loathes billionaires and loves Sweden, which has more billionaires per capita than America has. Economist Deirdre McCloskey, writing in National Review, notes that "none of Sweden's manufacturing or extractive industries has even been socialized. And "when Saab Autos began its descent into bankruptcy, the government let it go, unlike the U.S government bailing out GM and Chrysler (for a second time) after 2008. McCloskey quotes a Swedish diplomat: "In many fields, we have more private ownership compared to other European countries, and to America. About 80% of all new schools are privately run, as are the railroads and the subway system.
The morning after Sanders' speech, The New York Times reported something momentous: "Democratic socialism has become a major force in American political life. This is amazing, considering that it was never more than a negligible force when capitalism seemed to be in a perhaps terminal crisis: In 1932, three years into the Depression, with the unemployment rate at 23.6 percent and the GDP 25.7 percent smaller than in 1929, as this column previously noted, the Socialist Party's presidential candidate, Norman Thomas, received fewer votes (884,885) than its 1920 candidate, Eugene Debs received (913,693), while he was imprisoned by President Woodrow Wilson's administration.
A young adult - a member of the demographic supposedly most sympathetic to socialism - who attended Sanders' exegesis of socialism told The Times: "In America, we embrace a lot of socialist policies already, like public education and parks. This understanding of socialism as any government provision of public goods puts Horace Mann (1796-1859), an advocate of public education, and Frederick Law Olmsted (1822-1903), designer of New York City's Central Park, in the socialist pantheon with their contemporaries Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. Many young people who supposedly are making socialism a "major force think it is sociability: everyone being nice to everyone.
Sen. Elizabeth ("I have a plan for that) Warren, D-Mass., who describes herself as a "capitalist to my bones, is a more authentic socialist than Sanders, because she has more granular plans for government power (aka politics) to supplant market forces in the allocation of wealth and opportunity. So she, even more than the other participants in this week's Democrats' presidential scrums, would as president give the nation a helpful, if inadvertent, tutorial about this axiom: If you want to make God laugh, tell him your plans.

Citizenship question would hit Florida's power and pocketbook; Sun Sentinel Editorial

Texto completo: The Trump administration claims that adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census would aid enforcement of the Voting Rights Act. Amidst its forest of falsehoods, that one is gargantuan. The transparent purpose is to frighten immigrants into not being counted, leading to more congressional seats and Electoral College votes in Republican areas and fewer in Democratic ones.
Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., tacitly confirmed it when he said in a recent Fox News interview that seats in the House of Representatives "ought to be based on citizenship," rather than on total population.
But the Constitution couldn't be clearer: apportionment is based on the "whole number of persons in each state."
"Senator Scott does not want to change the Constitution," his press office said, "but asking about citizenship on the census is common sense" and "only the radical left would think otherwise."
Only the radical right pretends the question is necessary. There is compelling evidence of a deliberate scheme to benefit Republicans.
Independent experts on the census agree overwhelmingly that the citizenship question would intimidate immigrants already alarmed by Trump's campaign bigotry against them. The census already undercounts minorities and the census question could make as many as 6.5 million more people invisible.
Posting an online petition against it, U.S. Rep. Charlie Crist, D-St. Petersburg, explained why the question is so sinister.
"Numerous studies indicate that minorities are less likely to respond to citizenship questions out of fear that they will face retribution if they, their family or their friends are in an undocumented status," he wrote.
The original and still prime purpose of the census is to apportion seats in the House and establish how many electoral votes a state may cast for president. Census data also controls many population-based federal programs, including those for highway assistance and food stamps. Thus, a count contrived to overlook immigrants would hurt native-born and naturalized citizens as well.
The Tampa Bay Times, which spotted Scott's remark in an otherwise unexceptional Fox News interview, noted that Florida could lose the two House seats it expects to gain from the 2020 census if only citizens were counted.
The same could happen if non-citizens refuse to be counted.
The Supreme Court is expected to rule as early as next week whether to allow the citizenship question. During oral argument, a majority of the justices seemed to be leaning that way.
But it would be a travesty of justice.
The evidence that the question is a partisan scheme comes from the computer files of Thomas B. Hofeller, a Republican Party consultant whom the New York Times described as "the Michelangelo of gerrymandering." His estranged daughter found them in hard drives after his death and gave them to Common Cause.
They contained, among other things, a study he wrote in 2015 saying that a citizenship question on the census would help Republicans gerrymander state legislatures against Democrats.
He also wrote part of a draft Justice Department letter that claims the question would help enforce the Voting Rights Act. His language appeared "word for word" in the Justice document, according to the New York Times.
Looking at Texas, Hofeller found that a count excluding Democratic Hispanics and their children would require larger but fewer Democratic districts, to the advantage of Republican mapmakers. The same would likely be true of Florida, California and most of the Southwest.
A friend of Hofeller later became an informal adviser to Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary who proposed the citizenship question.
The Supreme Court is considering a lower court ruling from New York that barred the question on administrative law grounds. The Hofeller evidence is not part of that case.
A federal district judge in Maryland, who had also ruled against the citizenship question on procedural grounds, agreed Wednesday to reopen his case to consider whether the Hofeller evidence proves discrimination against immigrants, Latinos and Asian Americans. That means he could bar the question even after the Supreme Court approves it in the New York case.
Anti-immigrant prejudice has been rooted in the national psyche since the 1840s, when it spawned the so-called Know-Nothing party that had a substantial presence in Congress until the Civil War.
Gov. Ron DeSantis shamelessly exploited that endemic bigotry when he went last week to Panama City, deep in the dark red Panhandle, to sign legislation, the Sanctuary Cities act, aimed at making immigration enforcers of every law enforcement officer and local elected official in Florida.
Trump threatened, on the eve of his campaign kickoff in Orlando, to hunt down and deport "millions" of undocumented immigrants beginning next week. He made ICE's job that much harder, of course, by tipping off the targets. And the agency had to admit that it isn't equipped or budgeted for such a massive purge.
But if it could be pulled off, it would topple the nation into recession by crippling the agriculture, construction and hospitality industries. Millions of people are here illegally because they're needed for jobs that few of our citizens are willing to fill.
Trump claimed in Orlando that he wants Democratic cooperation on comprehensive immigration reform. No such outcome is politically or morally feasible so long as he continues to demagogue the issue.
He has never had to tell the census whether he's a citizen. Neither should anyone else.

A 1974 Documentary Proves Itself Prescient

Texto completo: First released in 1974, "A Bigger Splash," Jack Hazan's semi-fictional portrait of the British artist David Hockney, has proved prescient.
For one thing, the movie -- revived for a week in a new, 4K restoration at the Metrograph -- is largely concerned with the creation of "Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures)," which sold for $ 90.3 million at auction last November, shattering the record for the work of a living artist. For another, Hazan's 106-minute documentary created a template for what, a quarter-century later, would be known as reality television.
In essence, the movie, shot over a period of several years, is a mosaic in which a flurry of episodic shards revolve around Hockney. A moon-faced dandy in owlish spectacles, the artist is shown attending fashion events, including the Alternative Miss World contest; mourning the end of his relationship with the artist Peter Schlesinger; and kvetching to the curator Henry Geldzahler, a friend and sometime subject, who tells him, "You are the painter of Southern California now."
The film never shows Hockney in Los Angeles, but follows him to New York, where he has a gallery show, including "Portrait of an Artist." (An ambivalent review in The New York Times characterized him as "an extremely clever artist, with a facility that both amazes and dismays.") Compared to the lotus-land settings of many of Hockney's paintings, the brute symmetry of Midtown Manhattan seems singularly uninviting.
"A Bigger Splash" is both meandering and forthright. Hockney allowed the British-born, American-trained Hazan remarkable access. At one point the camera joins the artist in the shower. The most notorious scene shows Schlesinger in bed with another man. Consequently, the movie received an X rating in Britain and was held up in customs in the United States before it was screened at the 1974 New York Film Festival. Customs officials described it as "disgusting and immoral." Hockney himself was not initially pleased with it and reportedly considered paying Hazan 20,000 pounds for the negative.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
"A Bigger Splash" drew comparisons to Andy Warhol's films when it was first released, likely because Hockney was initially associated with Pop art and because, like Warhol, he carefully cultivated the image he projected to the world. The Times critic Vincent Canby found the movie "unforgivably solemn, something that Andy Warhol and Paul Morrissey would never have allowed." Perhaps, but no Warhol-Morrissey film ever took art-making this seriously. Much of "A Bigger Splash" was shot in and around Hockney's Notting Hill studio, where he is observed working day and night to complete "Portrait of an Artist." (In one scene, his London gallerist complains about his lack of productivity.)
In the late 1970s, Hazan made a second film that mixed documentary and fiction: "Rude Boy." This time the subject was another British cultural -- or subcultural -- phenomenon, punk rock, and the celebrities were the Clash. Reviewing it in 1980 in The Times, Janet Maslin called it "about as mixed up as a movie can be," although "the best parts are everything this British rock group's fans could hope for." Swap out the Clash's performances for Hockney's and the same might be said of "A Bigger Splash."

The silent victims of 9/11

Texto completo: Near the southern tip of Manhattan, each name of the 2,977 victims of 9/11 is inscribed in stone.
Americans have vowed to remember those who died during the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. But so many more have been forgotten.
Rob Serra had just started with the New York City Fire Department when the Twin Towers fell down. He now has neuropathy, a condition that numbs his feet, and he uses a wheelchair. Serra was lucky enough to survive, but many first responders have died in the years since, suffering from health problems related to the attack.
“We might have stopped the recovery efforts on that day,” Serra told the New York Times, “but for a lot of us, it never stopped.”
Serra attended the opening of the Memorial Glade in New York City last month, as the city unveiled an addition to its 9/11 Memorial, honoring more than just the first 3,000 victims. An inscription dedicates it to "those whose actions in our time of need led to their injury, sickness and death."
The issue is not simply one of remembrance, though. Healthcare bills and illnesses still ravage many first responders' lives, and comedian Jon Stewart has become a vocal champion of 9/11’s forgotten victims.
A video of Stewart’s testimony before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution went viral, as he argued that Congress must renew the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund, which will run out in December 2020.
“Certainly, 9/11 first responders shouldn’t have to decide whether to live or to have a place to live,” he said. “The idea that you can only give them five more years of the VCF because you’re not quite sure what’s going to happen five years from now? Well, I can tell you. I’m pretty sure what’s going to happen five years from now: More of these men and women are going to get sick, and they are going to die.”
The fund's administrator has said it may run out sooner than its 2020 expiration. A new bill, which has advanced out of committee and is expected to pass the House, would clear all necessary funding for victims until 2090.
Meanwhile, 9/11 first responders are still dealing with the aftermath of the attack. One of them is Luis Alvarez, an NYPD detective who testified with Stewart and was put in hospice care this week. During his testimony, though, he said he wouldn't have done his job any differently.
“I can tell you that I did not want to be anywhere else than ground zero when I was there,” he said. “We were part of showing the world that we would never back down from terrorism, and that we could all work together.”

Béla Fleck's banjo wizardry

Texto completo: There's no question that Taos has found its place on the music map: Just look at the recent insurgence of top-quality talent passing through our tiny high-desert town such Alabama Shakes and Sting. And this weekend, with the summer sun at its northernmost point, you have yet another opportunity to enjoy the best and brightest of world-class entertainment.
On Saturday (June 22) the Taos Mesa Brewing Mothership is your solstice destination where, at 8 p.m, Béla Fleck and the Flecktones take to the outdoor amphitheater stage ready to rock your world with their Grammy Award-winning progressive bluegrass music and Fleck's formidably masterful banjo music.
The foursome -- including Fleck, Victor Wooten (bass), Roy "Futureman" Wooten (percussion) and Howard Levy (piano/harmonica) -- have enjoyed a long history together beginning in 1988. Their popularity shows no signs of waning and the band is selling out its current 30th anniversary U.S. tour.
However, don't expect a "wistful trip back in time," publicity for the group noted. "[T]he quartet has been creating some of the most forward-thinking music of their long, storied career. While all manner of genres come into play -- from classical and jazz to bluegrass and African music to electric blues and Eastern European folk dances -- the result is an impossible-to-pigeonhole sound all their own, a meeting of musical minds that remains, as ever, utterly indescribable. Simply put, it is the Flecktones: the music made only when these four individuals come together."
Frontman Fleck -- a prolific musician, composer and songwriter -- grew up in New York City and became enthralled with the banjo after hearing the Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs theme song to the "Beverly Hillbillies." According to his biographical notes the young musician was gifted his first guitar by his grandfather at the age of 15.
After receiving training with some of the best -- Erik Darling, Marc Horowitz and Tony Trischka -- Fleck's career took off in a trajectory that today remains one of the music world's most remarkable.
The year 1979 saw him co-found a band called Spectrum and, in 1981, he joined the bluegrass band New Grass Revival, with whom he recorded five albums over eight years.
At the same time, he also maintained an active solo career while collaborating with other notable acoustic musicians, and recording with country stars such as Garth Brooks, Dolly Parton, Randy Travis, the Oak Ridge Boys, the Gatlin Brothers and many others.
With the Flecktones, the banjoist found himself in a groove with these like-minded artists that remain with him today. Though they've recorded an impressive catalog of music, perhaps their most iconic is their second album, "Flight of the Cosmic Hippo," which rose to the number one slot on the Billboard Top Contemporary Jazz chart upon its release.
Besides releasing albums and touring, the Flecktones have also shared the stage with the Dave Matthews Band, Sting, Bonnie Raitt and the Grateful Dead, have made appearances on "The Tonight Show," both during the Johnny Carson and the Jay Leno days, as well as Arsenio Hall, and Conan O'Brien. Fleck has also appeared on "Saturday Night Live" and the "Late Show with David Letterman."
In recent years Fleck has toured with his wife, Abigail Washburn, who is herself an accomplished banjoist. He has also explored world and classical genres, visiting Africa to explore the roots of the instrument in African music and joined forces with the renowned composer and bassist, Edgar Meyer, to co-produce two concertos that were performed by the Nashville Symphony and Detroit Symphony orchestras.
Jon Pareles, the chief popular music critic for The New York Times , said in 2017 of the banjoist, "Béla Fleck has taken banjo playing to some very unlikely places ... He's also baffled the Grammy awards, winning for country and jazz in the same year and also winning in pop, world music, classical crossover and, yes, folk. That's a lot of territory for five strings."
Indeed. Though to many the banjo may be a more obscure instrument, it's a fact that Fleck's music, both solo and in collaboration, has won more Grammys across more categories than any other performer in the award's history.
Tim Franke of AMP Concerts, said of this show's production, "Getting Béla Fleck and the Flecktones here is a real score for your town and for us. We at AMP love Taos; its beauty and uniqueness make it the perfect destination spot for music-goers from all around, not just from New Mexico, Colorado and Texas." Known for working both independently and in collaboration with local groups, AMP notes it has worked hard to provide the chance for audiences to experience world, folk, acoustic and Americana music, as this show demonstrates.
Of course, it doesn't hurt that the Taos Mesa Brewing Mothership is the perfect venue for a dose of fine summertime music.

Texto completo: Philippe Zdar, the French music producer and one-half of the house music duo Cassius, died at 52 after accidentally falling through a building's window in Paris, the group's representatives confirmed to the New York Times and AFP.
Zdar – born Philippe Cerboneschi – performed in Cassius with bandmate Hubert Blanc-Francard. Cassius' first album in three years, "Dreams," is set to be released on Friday, and Zdar was due to perform at Central Park's SummerStage in New York on Sunday.
Zdar also owned the influential Motorbass music studio in Paris, which hosted artists including Kanye West and Pharrell Williams. In 2010, he won a Grammy for best alternative music album for his work on “Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix” album, which was recorded there.
Zdar's electronic music peers paid tribute to him on social media, with Calvin Harris tweeting a link to his music with the note, "Awful news about Phillipe Zdar, what an unbelievably lovely man with an incredible legacy. I was mesmerized by this record as a 15 year old. "
"Sad awakening here :(" David Guetta wrote. "I just heard Philippe Zdar from @CASSIUSOFFICIAL passed away. I can’t stop remembering amazing parties we had all together. "
"So (expletive) sad to learn about Philippe Zdar last night," Mark Ronson added in an NSFW tweet. "A true, true legend whose influence hangs over not just dance but indie, hip hop, all of it. I remember buying Feeling For You when it first came out and being blown away. . . My condolences to his family and friends"

Texto completo: President Donald Trump has repeatedly commented on a case that wrongly accused a group of black and Latino men of assaulting a white female jogger in Central Park in 1989.
Trump's comments surrounding the case, many of which were made in his capacity as a New York business mogul, have resurfaced following a Netflix series on the men who were charged with the assault. The men are commonly referred to as the Central Park Five.
Raymond Santana, Kevin Richardson, Antron McCray, Yusef Salaam and Korey Wise were all boys when they were convicted of raping Trisha Meili. They were then found innocent of the crime after convicted murder Matias Reyes in 2002 confessed to raping Meili, which was confirmed by DNA evidence. The city awarded the men $41 million in 2014, a decade after some of the men initially sued the city for how it handled the case.
Trump, now president, has doubled down on his stance that some involved in the attack were guilty.
On Tuesday, he dodged questions about apologizing for a 1989 ad calling for the death penalty for those involved in an assault.
'You have people on both sides of that': Trump doesn't apologize to Central Park Five
Trump's role: Ava DuVernay lets Trump 'speak for himself' in Central Park Five series 'When They See Us'
Here is a history of Trump's comments and actions surrounding the Central Park jogger case:
"BRING BACK THE DEATH PENALTY"
Less than two weeks after the attack on Meili, Trump took out a full-page ad in four New York City newspapers with the headline: "BRING BACK THE DEATH PENALTY. BRING BACK OUR POLICE!"
The $85,000 worth of ads wereq published on May 1, 1989, in The New York Times, The Daily News, The New York Post and New York Newsday. In a statement included in the ad, Trump criticized crime in the city and claimed there was no more "law and order. "
Trump, then a popular business mogul, claimed that the city was being "ruled by the law of the streets, as roving bands of wild criminals roam our neighborhoods, dispensing their own vicious brand of twisted hatred on whomever they encounter. "
"At what point did we cross the line from the fine and noble pursuit of genuine civil liberties to the reckless and dangerously permissive atmosphere which allows criminals of every age to beat and rape a helpless woman and then laugh at her family's anguish?" he continued in the ad.
The ad came several days after New York City police held a controversial press conference claiming that they believed that a group of youth had attacked Meili. Authorities also claimed in the press conference that they were a part of a group of 32 young boys who assaulted eight other people the same night Meili was attacked.
Trump in the ad said he hated "these muggers and murderers. "
"They should be forced to suffer and, when they kill, they should be executed for their crimes. They must serve as examples for their crimes," he continued. "They must serve as examples so that others will think long and hard before committing a crime or an act of violence. "
"Maybe hate is what we need if we're gonna get something done"
Trump defended the ads several days after they were published in an interview on CNN.
He said that he did not believe that the ads were "inciteful," according to a 2016 CNN article that dug up the May 17, 1989 interview.
"I have never done anything that's caused a more positive stir. I've had 15,000 — 15,000 — letters in the last week and a half," Trump said. "The ad's basically very strong and vocal, they are saying bring back law and order. And I'm not just referring to New York, I'm referring to everything. "
Trump also claimed that he "hates" anyone who commits a crime such as rape, but that hatred could also be a key for change.
"And I said, look this woman was raped, mugged, and thrown off a building -- thrown off a building on top of everything else," he continued. "She's got some major problems, to put it mildly. I said, 'of course I hate these people and let's all hate these people because maybe hate is what we need if we're gonna get something done. '"
"One-sided piece of garbage"
Trump in 2013 criticized an award-winning documentary on the Central Park jogger case. By the time the documentary came out, Reyes had already admitted to the raping and assaulting Meili.
The men who had since been exonerated for the crime were in an ongoing legal battle with New York City for how they handled the case. Richardson, Santana, and McCray sued the city in 2003.
Analysis in the documentary "The Central Park Five" suggests that authorities could have connected Reyes to Meili's rape at the time of the attack.
"The Central Park Five documentary was a one-sided piece of garbage that didn't explain the. horrific crimes of these young men while in park," Trump tweeted on April 24, 2013.
Trump in a June 5, 2013 tweet referred to the Central Park Five as "muggers. "
When asked by a Twitter user how Trump felt that the five men who were convicted of the crime were actually innocent, Trump in a tweet on June 29, 2013 responded: "Innocent of what-how many people did they mugg?"

"It's a disgrace"
After the city awarded the five men $41 million in a settlement, Trump maintained that the men — who were young teenagers when convicted — were still guilty.
Trump in an op-ed published in the New York Daily News suggested that "settling doesn't mean innocence. "
"My opinion on the settlement of the Central Park Jogger case is that it's a disgrace," Trump began his op-ed. "A detective close to the case, and who has followed it since 1989, calls it "the heist of the century. "
"Forty million dollars is a lot of money for the taxpayers of New York to pay when we are already the highest taxed city and state in the country," he continued in the op-ed. "The recipients must be laughing out loud at the stupidity of the city. "
The next day, Trump continued to tweet about the settlement.
"How much money are the lawyers for the Central Park Five getting out of the 40 million dollars, or are they paid by the City (or both)?" Trump tweeted on June 22, 2014.
On the same day, Trump also tweeted: "I'd bet the lawyers for the Central Park 5 are laughing at the stupidity of N. Y. C. when there was such a strong case against their 'clients'"
"They admitted they were guilty"
Around a month before the 2016 election, Trump stood by his opinion that he believed that the five men charged for Meili's attack, who have since been exonerated from the crime, were still guilty.
"They admitted they were guilty," Trump said in a statement to CNN in October 2016. "The police doing the original investigation say they were guilty. The fact that that case was settled with so much evidence against them is outrageous. And the woman, so badly injured, will never be the same. "

Texto completo: LONDON -- The chief executive of the Serpentine Galleries, Yana Peel, resigned on Tuesday after a newspaper investigation revealed she had connections to a cybersecurity firm whose technology has been used to target journalists and human rights activists.
"In light of a concerted lobbying campaign against my husband's recent investment, I have taken the decision to step down as C.E.O.," Ms. Peel said in an emailed statement. "I am saddened to find myself in this position," she added.
The Serpentine Galleries is one of London's most popular art museums, and has recently presented exhibitions by Marina Abramovic and Christo. It has also championed artists who have faced persecution such as Ai Weiwei.
In an interview with the Times of London in 2017, Ms. Peel said she wanted the Serpentine to be "a safe space for unsafe ideas." In 2018, she was a judge for the Freedom of Expression awards presented by Index on Censorship, a British nonprofit.
On Friday, The Guardian newspaper reported that Ms. Peel owns one-third of Novalpina Capital, a private equity firm co-founded by her husband, Stephen Peel. In March, funds controlled by Novalpina bought a controlling stake in NSO Group, an Israeli company offering technology, developed by former intelligence operatives, that can hack phones to gain access to encrypted communications.
The technology is used by governments to fight crime and terrorism, but has also been used to target journalists and activists. Mexico used NSO products to track at least two dozen journalists, government critics and international observers, according to a New York Times investigation and research by Citizen Lab, part of the University of Toronto.
A lawsuit filed last year in Israel charged that Saudi Arabia had used NSO technology to target Jamal Khashoggi, the Washington Post columnist killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. NSO denies this and says it does not tolerate misuse of its products.
On Friday, Novalpina said in a news release that it was developing guidelines "to ensure NSO's technology is used only for its intended lawful purpose -- the prevention of harm to our fundamental human rights to life, liberty and security."
Ms. Peel told The Guardian that criticism of NSO was "misinformed," and that she had "no involvement in the operations or decisions of Novalpina, which is managed by my husband, Stephen Peel, and his partners."
On Monday, the German artist Hito Steyerl, whose work was presented in a solo exhibition at the Serpentine this year, said in an email that she had withdrawn a digital artwork from the Serpentine's website in response to the reports.
"I am very happy that the Serpentine Galleries set a strong precedent by reacting quickly thus living up to their stated ethical values," Ms. Steyerl added in an email on Tuesday after Ms. Peel's resignation. "I think it's a valuable example for art institutions worldwide."
Ms. Peel's quick decision to resign is in contrast to similar events at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York. For months, artists and activists have called for the resignation or removal of Warren B. Kanders, a board member who is also the chief executive of a company that produces tear gas that protesters say was used on migrants at the Mexican border. Mr. Kanders said that the firm, Safariland, played no role in deciding how its products are used, and that he was staying put.
Activists in Britain have been more successful in asserting pressure on arts organizations. Last year, artists including Shepard Fairey removed work from the Design Museum in London after it rented its atrium to Leonardo, one of the world's largest aerospace and defense companies, for a drinks reception. BAE Systems also withdrew its sponsorship from an arts festival, the Great Exhibition of the North, after several musicians pulled out because of the defense contractor's involvement.
James Bridle, a digital artist who has shown work at the Serpentine, said in an email on Tuesday that it was significant that the Serpentine chief executive's resignation "turns on Ms. Peel's alleged ownership of a cyberweapons company, at a time when many are coming to recognize these products for what they are: weapons."
This is not the first time the Serpentine has found itself faced with troubling ethical questions. Earlier this year, the museum was one of many in Europe and America that cut ties with the Sackler family, generous arts donors whose members include the owners of a pharmaceuticals company linked to the opioid crisis in the United States.
The Serpentine had "no further funding applications" with the Sackler Trust, a spokeswoman said in March, but the museum's second space is still named the Serpentine Sackler Gallery.
In her resignation statement, Ms. Peel hit out at artists and others who led crusades against museums. "The world of art is about free expression," she said. "But it is not about bullying and intimidation."
"If campaigns of this type continue, the treasures of the art community -- which are so fundamental to our society -- risk an erosion of private support," she added. "That will be a great loss for everyone."

Texto completo: The United States Department of Defense has admitted it researched and investigated unidentified aerial phenomena or more commonly known UFOs - Unidentified Flying Objects - in a secret government initiative called the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program.
Christopher Sherwood, a Pentagon spokesman told the New York Post, the Defense Department still investigates claims of UFO sightings and experiences of service people, although the AATIP Program was axed in 2012. Before now, the Defense Department held the program, that began in 2005 with its $22 million annual budget, highly secret.
In a statement provided exclusively to The Post, a Department of Defense spokesman said a secret government initiative called the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program "did pursue research and investigation into unidentified aerial phenomena," reported the New York Post in its May 22 article titled, "The Pentagon finally admits it investigates UFOs."
"This is just one of many programs that has been designated to monitor and even try to counter UFO activity," said Illia-Rashad Muhammad, author of the book, "UFOs and The Nation of Islam: The Source, Proof, and Reality of The Wheels."
While skeptics persist, for years former military personnel, airline pilots and ordinary citizens have argued they have witnessed objects in the sky they argue are "not of this world." For decades, The Final Call newspaper has published research chronicling the existence of what are commonly called UFOs but what the Nation of Islam refers to as IFO's - Identified Flying Objects.
"If the Pentagon is just now admitting that they had one program ... this lets us know they've had several more programs and initiatives since the UFO phenomenon occurred," Illia-Rashad Muhammad told The Final Call.
Nick Pope, who secretly investigated UFOs for the British government during the 1990s, called the latest U.S. Department of Defense disclosure a "bombshell revelation."
Mr. Pope told the New York Post prior statements on the subject were "ambiguous and left the door open" to criticism the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program was only concerned about threats from aircraft, missiles and drones from foreign nations. "This new admission makes it clear that they really did study what the public would call 'UFOs,'" he said.
The Defense Department's term "unidentified aerial phenomena" shows British influence, added Mr. Pope. "It was the term we used in the (British) Ministry of Defense to get away from the pop culture baggage that came with the term 'UFO.'"
Scholars who study the existence of the crafts tend to agree that the technology is advanced compared to what is understood globally. Some estimate the technology is 80 million years ahead of the most advanced science in the U.S., Russia, and China.
The behavior of the UFOs themselves demonstrates what is clearly "intelligence," scientists' reason. The craft have been sighted alone, in pairs, and "sometimes in thousands," standing still, making formations, some resembling "big parades" in the sky, said scholars during a major plenary session on the subject in Rosemont, Illinois, in February 2011.
Before the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, the U.S. Air Force had Project Blue Book, which investigated more than 12,000 purported UFO sightings between 1952 and 1969. The interest by the U.S. government has never ended with dedicated programs taken out of use, say experts. Reports of encounters never ended, only protocols in responding varied. The Defense Department changed how encounters are reported.
It's a response to unknown, advanced aircraft flying into or near Navy strike groups or other sensitive military facilities and formations, said the U.S. Navy.
"There were a number of different reports," said Joseph Gradisher, a Navy spokesman. "Some cases could have been commercial drones," but with others "we don't know who's doing this, we don't have enough data to track this." Mr. Gradisher explained the intent of the new policy to provide updated guidance on reporting procedures for suspected "intrusions into our airspace,"
But Navy pilots were demanding military officials find real means whereby UFO sightings can be reported. "For so long they had protocols in the military where they had to be quiet and were not allowed to go public," said Illia-Rashad Muhammad.
Reports of sightings occurred daily between 2014 and 2015 on the East Coast. Navy pilots reported seeing flying objects that had no apparent engine or exhaust trails and moved at hypersonic speeds.
Lieutenant Ryan Graves, a veteran Navy pilot told The New York Times in a 2014 interview how the objects had unprecedented moves.
"These things would be out there all day. Keeping an aircraft in the air requires a significant amount of energy. With the speeds we observed, 12 hours in the air is 11 hours longer than we'd expect."
The Times reported that Lt. Graves and four other pilots, saw the objects in 2014 and 2015 during training maneuvers from Virginia to Florida off the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt.
But along with sightings by military personnel and private professional pilots there have been numerous experiences of private citizens. There are many conferences convened by organizations worldwide discussing UFOs.
The U.S. is lagging behind other countries that declassified their records on UFOs. A partial list includes the United Kingdom, Russia, China, Mexico and France - being the first country to open their files in 2007 according to the New Scientist online. However, unlike other countries the United States keeps the information highly classified and among a few people.
Meanwhile, considering all things in space and defending against all things foreign, proposed legislation to form a Space Force, a sixth branch of the U.S. Armed Forces, was sent to Congress in early March by the Defense Department. If approved by Congress, the U.S. Space Force would be the first military service established since the Air Force began in 1947.
UPI reported the Defense Department has established a full-time task force to conduct detailed planning for the new service. The department's fiscal year 2020 defense budget request is $72.4 million to establish it and a projected $500 million annually to fund it. According to the DoD, China and Russia are developing similar space programs.
But the question is why? What threats are spanning space against the world powers?
The Honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan of the Nation of Islam have taught and convened a major panel featuring several experts on UFOs during one of the Muslim organization's Saviours' Day conventions.
"The U.S. government and its top scientists have known about the presence of The Great Wheel since the 1940's, when they raided the home of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad and confiscated his and Master Fard Muhammad's writings about and drawings of The Wheel," Min. Farrakhan pointed out during his 2013 weekly broadcast series, The Time and What Must Be Done.
The Minister characterized those hiding the truth of the crafts a "shadow government" controlled by a global elite doing everything in their power to keep the truth secret. This includes intelligence activities carried out through the implementation of "Black Budget Operations." They are able to use their influence to avoid scrutiny, engage in covert actions to achieve their objectives and virtually nullify the U.S. Constitution.
"Hiding the truth is a very serious thing to do. It causes harm and disappointment and causes one to be misled. It causes loss of property and life. It causes the loss of friendship, beloved ones, and loss of confidence and trust," said the Minister, quoting an excerpt from the book, "Our Saviour Has Arrived" by the Most Honorable Elijah Muhammad, patriarch of the Nation of Islam
With the encounters of UFOs billions are spent confusing the American people in order to conceal the truth, he said. When people come forward to talk about what they've witnessed or experienced, they are ridiculed, mocked and in some cases, intimidated and threatened into silence.
"Members of the government would visit those who said that they saw or knew, and frightened them, that if they ever told what they saw or what they knew...they would be discredited or even put to death!" said Min. Farrakhan.
Amidst waves of sightings, before the recent "bombshell" by the Defense Department, Pentagon officials acknowledged earlier this year they studied and monitored UFOs, said Illia-Rashad Muhammad.
The actual truth the government is withholding is the connection between the crafts and the 89-year-old Muslim organization that has disseminated information about the crafts since the early 1930s. The Nation of Islam has taught the so-called UFOs are advanced technology designed to destroy America. The crafts were created by the Great Mahdi, Master Fard Muhammad.
Illia-Rashad Muhammad said it was around this time mass sightings, military encounters, widespread reports, and official government investigations into UFOs began - and the Nation of Islam played a pivotal role.

White House gets an earful on tariffs, from art collectors to toilet makers

Texto completo: American companies, from video-game makers to tractor manufacturers, are lining up to give the Trump administration an earful about the damage its proposed tariffs on $300 billion of Chinese imports will do to their businesses. Whether President Trump is listening remains to be seen.
But the diversity of businesses converging on Washington this week to weigh in should send a signal to the White House about the breadth of the pain consumers will feel if Trump presses forward with the next round of import taxes.
On Monday, the U.S. trade representative kicked off seven days of hearings on the tariffs featuring testimony from hundreds of people representing interests as disparate as Best Buy, the sport fishing industry, toilet maker American Standard, and a group representing museum directors.
Retailers in particular are raising hackles about import duties they say will either bite into their bottom lines or force higher prices on consumers.
Jason Bonfig, Best Buy's chief merchandising officer, told the administration in testimony that the proposed tariffs would raise consumer prices on smartphones, laptops, tablets, smartwatches, gaming consoles and televisions. The levies "will only serve to maximize the pain on U.S. consumers, workers, businesses and the economy at large, with minimal impact on China," he said, according to his testimony.
Other big-name retailers are making similar complaints, since they were largely spared from earlier rounds of tariffs that targeted industrial goods and components in an attempt to shield consumers. "Even for healthy chains, like Walmart and Costco, the new duties threaten the business formula that helped speed their rapid rise over the last few decades: Import cheap products from Asia and sell them at rock-bottom prices," the New York Times's Nelson D. Schwartz and Sapna Maheshwari write. "The National Retail Federation estimates that China supplies 42 percent of all apparel, 73 percent of household appliances and 88 percent of toys sold in the United States."
In a new twist, footwear maker New Balance is adding its voice to the chorus. The company caught widespread heat on the left for aligning itself with Trump's trade offensive back in 2016 - a position the sneaker company said it took because unlike its top competitors, it makes its shoes domestically.
But in comments posted online last week, Monica Gorman, the company's vice president of global compliance, said the new tariffs would hit shoe parts it sources from China. The import taxes, she wrote, would "not just translate into higher costs, but jeopardize our ability to maintain production levels and continue investing in our domestic factories."
The sneaker company's about-face (first noted by CNN Business) lines up with a broader shift by the business community, which is registering new urgency about Trump's tariff plans now that a deal with China that seemed imminent last month looks remote.
My colleague David Lynch notes that USTR has already received more than 1,600 written comments on the proposed tariff escalation, and the "overwhelming majority" warn of damage to consumers, jobs and production.
American Standard presented itself to the USTR as an iconic, 150-year-old brand with operations in Illinois, Kentucky, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio and Texas. Troy Benavidez, the company's vice president of corporate affairs, warned that the tariffs would hit its global supply chain, creating a potential public health risk. "At a time when our nation has continued to underinvest in its water and plumbing infrastructure, and with over 1.7 million U.S. citizens lacking access to acceptable plumbing, it is crucial that the cost of the basic toilet and faucet that every American deserves remains accessible," he said, according to his testimony.
The fishing industry is likewise arguing tariffs on its goods will do harm to the broader public interest. Glenn Hughes, president of the American Sportfishing Association, noted in testimony Monday that the industry already pays an excise tax that supports state fish and wildlife agencies. "Fewer fishing equipment purchases means less revenue into the trust fund, which ultimately means less funding for programs important to the Trump Administration's priorities to improve public access to the outdoors," he said.
The parade of interests on Monday ranged from the pastoral - Hughes called fishing a sport as "American as Mom and apple pie" - to the precious. Stephen Knerly, a lawyer representing the Association of Art Museum Directors, said the tariffs would injure the American art market, "the largest in the world. Auction houses, dealers and galleries are unlikely to want to import Chinese origin works to sell in the United States because of the tariff and the increased cost. That business may well shift to the other art markets of the world - including the No. 2 auction art market - China."
Both weekend fishermen and art collectors point to important, if distinct, pillars of Trump's base. As Lynch writes, "If the president does follow through with his threat, he will be risking not only a clash with business groups but also consumer unease as he begins his reelection campaign."

Kin Haunted by Veteran's Death Sue to Get Answers From Jail

Texto completo: [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox .]
The only certainty the family of Everett Palmer Jr. has -- after months of demanding answers -- is that he was alive when he was sent to York County Prison and that he was dead 48 hours later.
But what happened to Mr. Palmer during two days in solitary confinement at the Pennsylvania lockup remains a mystery.
When his body arrived at a funeral home, it showed troubling signs: Mr. Palmer's head had been badly damaged and a ring of black and purple bruises ran around his neck, according to the funeral director, who was the first to see the remains.
"I think he was murdered," Mr. Palmer's mother, Rose Palmer, said as she choked back tears last week at the Maranatha Baptist Church in Queens Village, near the family's home.
The Pennsylvania State Police and the York County district attorney will say only that the death, first reported by The York Daily Record, is still under investigation.
After 14 months, Mr. Palmer's family has not been given permission to see video footage of his detention. The York County Coroner's Office concluded in an autopsy report, obtained by The New York Times, that the manner of Mr. Palmer's death was "undetermined."
Adding to the Palmer family's grief and confusion, the former soldier's brain, heart and throat -- perhaps holding clues that could shed light on how he died -- still have not been returned after the autopsy.
On Monday, his mother and six siblings filed a motion in a Pennsylvania court seeking to compel testimony from the guards and others involved, as well as to gain access to evidence, including a video of Mr. Palmer's final moments.
"There has been no explanation of what happened to Everett Palmer," said Lee Merritt, a lawyer representing the family. "We believe that an in-custody death demands a certain level of transparency that has been lacking."
Mr. Palmer's case received nationwide attention recently over the family's claims that his organs had gone missing. (They had not; they are being retained in a lab for investigation, the York County Coroner's Office said.)
But how he died in custody and why the authorities seem reluctant to release their findings remain the bigger mystery.
Though the York County Coroner's Office has said it could not say for sure how Mr. Palmer died, an independent forensic expert hired by Mr. Palmer's family offered a different verdict: homicide, involving physical restraint under police custody.
One contributing factor in his death was methamphetamine intoxication, pathologists for the family and the coroner's office agree, raising questions about how he obtained drugs while confined alone and stripped of his belongings.
The official autopsy report's inconclusive findings help "law enforcement avoid the appropriate scrutiny of their actions," Mr. Merritt said.
David Sunday, the York County district attorney, said he could not provide information about "ongoing investigations." Ryan Tarkowski, a spokesman for the Pennsylvania State Police, also declined to comment, saying the investigation is open.
Mark Walters, a spokesman for York County, said that evidence in the case has not been made public because investigators have not completed their work.
"I don't understand why people don't take a step back," he said in an interview. "This is the way investigations work. You want to make sure that everything is right, and done with integrity. Do you want to have an investigation that lasts five minutes? It's going to take time."
Pamela Gay, who leads the York County Coroner's Office, said that Mr. Palmer's organs would be released to the family once the inquiry is over.
"Things aren't evident right away," she said. "We've done everything by the book. We want to do this with the utmost integrity and professionalism."
Mr. Palmer, a 41-year-old father of two, was a brawny paratrooper turned fitness trainer who most recently lived in Seaford, Del. He had been taking medication for post-traumatic stress disorder, his relatives said.
Mr. Palmer's family said he was on his way to New York on April 7, 2018, to see his mother, who was about to have an operation. He had been hoping to stop in Lancaster, Pa., to resolve an outstanding warrant. A year and a half earlier, he been arrested in rural York County on charges of drunken driving.
But instead of resolving the case and continuing with his trip, he was arrested by the Lancaster police and detained on $ 5,000 bail, the family said.
When Mr. Palmer arrived at the York County jail, he was agitated and "rambling," and talked about having suicidal thoughts, the autopsy report said. He was placed on suicide watch in a single-person cell and medical staff checked on him multiple times.
Two days later, at around 4 a.m., Mr. Palmer was seen striking his head on his cell room door, the autopsy report said, cutting and puncturing the back of his head and leaving bloody traces on the door, the report said.
An officer ordered him to lie down and put his arms behind his back, the report said. When Mr. Palmer failed to comply, an officer used a Taser on him -- twice. Five officers then entered his cell, and a 23-minute scuffle ensued. Mr. Palmer kicked and bit the officers who tried to pin him down.
"The officers secured the decedent by various physical control techniques including securing his midsection and lower extremities, securing his hand by applying handcuffs to his wrists," the report read.
A hood intended to stop him from biting was placed over his head. "The officers lifted him out of the cell and into the restraint chair and applied the lap belt, leg restraints and hand restraints," the report said.
The report confirmed the existence of security camera video of the incident. But the coroner wrote that the "video footage of events inside the decedent's cell did not give a clear picture" of everything the officers did to restrain Mr. Palmer.
Mr. Palmer was taken first to the jail infirmary, then to York Hospital, where he was pronounced dead before 6 a.m. on April 9, the report said.
The coroner's office concluded that Mr. Palmer died of "complications following an excited state, associated with methamphetamine toxicity, during physical restraint."
The doctor who performed the autopsy, Ramon Starling-Roney, noted in the report that Mr. Palmer had "multiple bruises along the head, extremities, left hip and left side of the torso" and said that sickle cell disease was a contributing factor to his death. (Mr. Palmer's family maintains he did not have that illness.)
Zhongxue Hua, the forensic pathologist hired by the family, came to a similar conclusion about the cause of death, but said Mr. Palmer would not have died had he not been violently restrained.
"It should be changed to 'homicide', instead of 'undetermined,"' he said in an interview. "I agree with the cause of death, but I have a real issue with the manner of death."
Ephraim George, a funeral director in New York City, was the first person to look at Mr. Palmer's body after the an autopsy. "You could definitely see the bruising around the neck," Mr. George said. "It went around his neck, on both sides. I told the family, 'You need to look further into it."'
Mrs. Palmer, the mother, said she had not slept well for over a year.
"All I do is think about my child. What happened, how it happened," she said. "And because I don't know, I have all kinds of scenarios going around in my brain."
She added, "It's torture."

Texto completo: NEW YORK - Gloria Vanderbilt, the intrepid heiress, artist and romantic who began her extraordinary life as the "poor little rich girl of the Great Depression, survived family tragedy and multiple marriages and reigned during the 1970s and '80s as a designer jeans pioneer, died Monday at the age of 95.
Vanderbilt was the great-great-granddaughter of financier Cornelius Vanderbilt and the mother of CNN newsman Anderson Cooper, who announced her death via a first-person obituary that aired on the network Monday morning.
Cooper said Vanderbilt died at home with friends and family at her side. She had been suffering from advanced stomach cancer, he noted.
"Gloria Vanderbilt was an extraordinary woman, who loved life, and lived it on her own terms, Cooper said in a statement. "She was a painter, a writer, and designer but also a remarkable mother, wife and friend. She was 95 years old, but ask anyone close to her, and they'd tell you, she was the youngest person they knew, the coolest, and most modern.
Her life was chronicled in sensational headlines from her childhood through four marriages and three divorces. She married for the first time at 17, causing her aunt to disinherit her. Her husbands included Leopold Stokowski, the celebrated conductor, and Sidney Lumet, the award-winning movie and television director. In 1988, she witnessed the suicide of one of her four sons.
Tributes online came from celebrities and fans of her clothes alike. Alyssa Milano called her "an incredible woman, Dana Delany said she treasures one of Vanderbilt's paintings and model Carol Alt hailed her as a "fashion icon and innovator.
Vanderbilt was a talented painter and collagist who also acted on the stage ("The Time of Your Life on Broadway in 1955) and television ("Playhouse 90, "Studio One, "Kraft Theater, "U.S. Steel Hour). She was a fabric designer who became an early enthusiast for designer denim. The dark-haired, tall and ultra-thin Vanderbilt partnered with Mohan Murjani, who introduced a $1 million advertising campaign in 1978 that turned the Gloria Vanderbilt brand with its signature white swan label into a sensation.
At its peak in 1980, it was generating over $200 million in sales. And decades later, famous-name designer jeans - dressed up or down - remain a woman's wardrobe staple.
Vanderbilt wrote several books, including the 2004 chronicle of her love life: "It Seemed Important at the Time: A Romance Memoir, which drops such names as Errol Flynn, whom she dated as a teenager; Frank Sinatra, for whom she left Stokowski; Marlon Brando and Howard Hughes.
She claimed her only happy marriage was to author Wyatt Cooper, which ended with his death in 1978 at age 50. Son Anderson Cooper called her memoir "a terrific book; it's like an older Sex and the City.'
"I've had many, many loves, Vanderbilt told The Associated Press in a 2004 interview. "I always feel that something wonderful is going to happen. And it always does.
Noting her father's death when she was a toddler, she said: "If you don't have a father, you don't miss it, because you don't know what it is. It was really only when I married Wyatt Cooper that I understood what it was like to have a father, because he was just an extraordinary father.
In 2016, Vanderbilt and Anderson Cooper appeared together in the HBO documentary "Nothing Left Unsaid.
Gloria Laura Madeleine Sophie Vanderbilt was born in 1924, a century after her great-great-grandfather started the family fortune, first in steamships, later in railroads. He left around $100 million when he died in 1877 at age 82.
Her father, Reginald Claypoole Vanderbilt, was 43, a gambler and boozer dying of liver disease when he married Gloria Morgan, 19, in 1923. Their daughter was 1 when Vanderbilt died in 1925, having gone through $25 million in 14 years.
Beneficiary of a $5 million trust fund, Vanderbilt became the "poor little rich girl in 1934 at age 10 as the object of a custody fight between her globe-trotting mother and matriarchal aunt.
The aunt, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, 59, who controlled $78 million and founded the Whitney Museum of American Art, won custody of her niece.
A shocked judge had closed the trial when a maid accused the child's mother of a lesbian affair with a member of the British royal family. The fight was chronicled in the best-selling 1980 book "Little Gloria ... Happy at Last, made into a TV miniseries in 1982 with Angela Lansbury playing Whitney.
The "poor little rich girl nickname "bothered me enormously, Vanderbilt told The Associated Press in a 2016 interview . "I didn't see any of the press - the newspapers were kept from me. I didn't know what it meant. I didn't feel poor and I didn't feel rich. It really did influence me enormously to make something of my life when I realized what it meant.
After spending the next seven years on her aunt's Long Island estate, Vanderbilt went to Hollywood. She dated celebrities and declared she would marry Hughes. Instead, the 17-year-old wed Hughes' press agent, Pasquale di Cicco, prompting her aunt to cut Gloria out of her will.
Vanderbilt came into her own $5 million trust fund in 1945 at age 21. She also divorced di Cicco, whom she said had beaten her often, and the next day married the 63-year-old Stokowski. The marriage to the conductor lasted 10 years and produced two sons, Stanislaus and Christopher.
After her marriage broke up, Vanderbilt found herself embroiled in another custody case, this time as the mother. During the closed hearings, Stokowski accused Vanderbilt of spending too much time at parties and too little with the boys. She accused him of tyrannizing his sons and said he really was 85, and not 72 as he claimed.
Justice Edgar Nathan Jr. gave Vanderbilt full-time custody. But he commented that the court had wasted a month on "the resolution of problems which mature, intelligent parents should be able to work out for themselves.
Vanderbilt married Lumet in 1956 and lived with him and her children in a 10-room duplex penthouse on Gracie Square. She divorced Lumet and married Cooper in 1963.
Their elder son, Carter, a Princeton graduate and editor at American Heritage, killed himself in 1988 at age 23, leaping from his mother's 14th floor apartment as she tried to stop him. Police said he had been treated for depression and friends said he was despondent over a break-up with a girlfriend. Vanderbilt says in "Nothing Left Unsaid that she contemplated following him out the window, but the thought of how it would devastate Anderson stopped her.
After her success in designer jeans, Vanderbilt branched out into other areas, including shoes, scarves, table and bed linens, and china, through her company, Gloria Concepts. In 1988 Vanderbilt joined the designer fragrance market with her signature "Glorious.
By the late 1980s, Vanderbilt sold the name and licenses for the brand name "Gloria Vanderbilt to Gitano, who transferred it to a group of private investors in 1993. More recently, her stretch jeans have been licensed through Jones Apparel Group Inc., which acquired Gloria Vanderbilt Apparel Corp. in 2002 for $138 million.
Vanderbilt became the target of a swindle in the late 1970s and early 80s when she made her psychiatrist and a lawyer associates in her business affairs. A court held that the two had looted millions from Vanderbilt's bank accounts.
Vanderbilt also made headlines in 1980 when she filed, but later dropped, a discrimination complaint against the posh River House apartments, which had rejected her bid to buy a $1.1 million duplex. She claimed the board was worried that black singer Bobby Short, who appeared with her on TV commercials, might marry her.
In 2009, the 85-year-old Vanderbilt penned a new novel, "Obsession: An Erotic Tale, a graphic tale about an architect's widow who discovers a cache of her husband's letters that reveal his secret sex life.
In an interview with The New York Times, she said she wasn't embarrassed about the explicitness of her new book, saying: "I don't think age has anything to do with what you write about. The only thing that would embarrass me is bad writing, and the only thing that really concerned me was my children. You know how children can be about their parents. But mine are very intelligent and supportive.

Her life was chronicled in sensational headlines from her childhood through four marriages and three divorces. She married for the first time at 17, causing her aunt to disinherit her. Her husbands included Leopold Stokowski, the celebrated conductor, and Sidney Lumet, the award-winning movie and television director. In 1988, she witnessed the suicide of one of her four sons.
Vanderbilt was a talented painter and collagist who also acted on the stage (“The Time of Your Life” on Broadway) and television (“Playhouse 90,” ”Studio One,” ”Kraft Theater,” ”U.S. Steel Hour”). She was a fabric designer who became an early enthusiast for designer denim. The dark-haired, tall and ultra-thin Vanderbilt partnered with Mohan Murjani, who introduced a $1 million advertising campaign in 1978 that turned the Gloria Vanderbilt brand with its signature white swan label into a sensation.
At its peak in 1980, it was generating over $200 million in sales. And decades later, famous-name designer jeans — dressed up or down — remain a woman’s wardrobe staple.
Vanderbilt wrote several books, including the 2004 chronicle of her love life: “It Seemed Important at the Time: A Romance Memoir,” which drops such names as Errol Flynn, whom she dated as a teenager; Frank Sinatra, for whom she left Stokowski; Marlon Brando and Howard Hughes.
She claimed her only happy marriage was to author Wyatt Cooper, which ended with his death in 1978 at age 50. Son Anderson Cooper called her memoir “a terrific book; it’s like an older ‘Sex and the City.’”
“I’ve had many, many loves,” Vanderbilt told The Associated Press in a 2004 interview. “I always feel that something wonderful is going to happen. And it always does.”
Noting her father’s death when she was a toddler, she said: “If you don’t have a father, you don’t miss it, because you don’t know what it is. It was really only when I married Wyatt Cooper that I understood what it was like to have a father, because he was just an extraordinary father.”
In 2016, Vanderbilt and Anderson Cooper appeared together in the HBO documentary “Nothing Left Unsaid.”
Gloria Laura Madeleine Sophie Vanderbilt was born in 1924, a century after her great-great-grandfather started the family fortune, first in steamships, later in railroads. He left around $100 million when he died in 1877 at age 82.
Her father, Reginald Claypoole Vanderbilt, was 43, a gambler and boozer dying of liver disease when he married Gloria Morgan, 19, in 1923. Their daughter was 1 when Vanderbilt died in 1925, having gone through $25 million in 14 years.
Beneficiary of a $5 million trust fund, Vanderbilt became the “poor little rich girl” in 1934 at age 10 as the object of a custody fight between her globe-trotting mother and matriarchal aunt.
The aunt, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, 59, who controlled $78 million and founded the Whitney Museum of American Art, won custody of her niece.
A shocked judge had closed the trial when a maid accused the child’s mother of a lesbian affair with a member of the British royal family. The fight was chronicled in the best-selling 1980 book “Little Gloria … Happy at Last,” made into a TV miniseries in 1982 with Angela Lansbury playing Whitney.
The “poor little rich girl” nickname “bothered me enormously,” Vanderbilt told The Associated Press in 2016. “I didn’t see any of the press — the newspapers were kept from me. I didn’t know what it meant. I didn’t feel poor and I didn’t feel rich. It really did influence me enormously to make something of my life when I realized what it meant.”
After spending the next seven years on her aunt’s Long Island estate, Vanderbilt went to Hollywood. She dated celebrities and declared she would marry Hughes. Instead, the 17-year-old wed Hughes’ press agent, Pasquale di Cicco, prompting her aunt to cut Gloria out of her will.
Vanderbilt came into her own $5 million trust fund in 1945 at age 21. She also divorced Di Cicco, whom she said had beaten her often, and the next day married the 63-year-old Stokowski. The marriage to the conductor lasted 10 years and produced two sons, Stanislaus and Christopher.
After her marriage broke up, Vanderbilt found herself embroiled in another custody case, this time as the mother. During the closed hearings, Stokowski accused Vanderbilt of spending too much time at parties and too little with the boys. She accused him of tyrannizing his sons and said he really was 85, and not 72 as he claimed.
Justice Edgar Nathan Jr. gave Vanderbilt full-time custody. But he commented that the court had wasted a month on “the resolution of problems which mature, intelligent parents should be able to work out for themselves.”
Vanderbilt married Lumet in 1956 and lived with him and her children in a 10-room duplex penthouse on Gracie Square. She divorced Lumet and married Cooper in 1963.
Their elder son, Carter, a Princeton graduate and editor at American Heritage, killed himself in 1988 at age 23, leaping from his mother’s 14th floor apartment as she tried to stop him. Police said he had been treated for depression and friends said he was despondent over a break-up with a girlfriend. Vanderbilt says in “Nothing Left Unsaid” that she contemplated following him, but the thought of how it would devastate Anderson stopped her.
After her success in designer jeans, Vanderbilt branched out into other areas, including shoes, scarves, table and bed linens, and china, through her company, Gloria Concepts. In 1988 Vanderbilt joined the designer fragrance market with her signature “Glorious.”
By the late 1980s, Vanderbilt sold the name and licenses for the brand name “Gloria Vanderbilt” to Gitano, who transferred it to a group of private investors in 1993. More recently, her stretch jeans have been licensed through Jones Apparel Group Inc., which acquired Gloria Vanderbilt Apparel Corp. in 2002 for $138 million.
Vanderbilt became the target of a swindle in the late 1970s and early ’80s when she made her psychiatrist and a lawyer associates in her business affairs. A court held that the two had looted millions from Vanderbilt’s bank accounts.
Vanderbilt also made headlines in 1980 when she filed, but later dropped, a discrimination complaint against the posh River House apartments, which had rejected her bid to buy a $1.1 million duplex. She claimed the board was worried that black singer Bobby Short, who appeared with her on TV commercials, might marry her.
In 2009, the 85-year-old Vanderbilt penned a new novel, “Obsession: An Erotic Tale,” a graphic tale about an architect’s widow who discovers a cache of her husband’s letters that reveal his secret sex life.
In an interview with The New York Times, she said she wasn’t embarrassed about the explicitness of her new book, saying: “I don’t think age has anything to do with what you write about. The only thing that would embarrass me is bad writing, and the only thing that really concerned me was my children. You know how children can be about their parents. But mine are very intelligent and supportive.”

Resumen: In 10 days, the New York City Police Department has lost a veteran deputy chief, detective and a third police officer Friday – all from suicides.

Texto completo: At 3:50 p. m. Friday afternoon, a 29-year-old New York City police officer shot and killed himself outside the Staten Island Police precinct where he worked.
It marked the latest in a troubling trend: three suicides of New York Police Department officers in 10 days – and the fourth this year.
The deaths in New York are part of a national problem. Last year, for the third straight year, cops who died by suicide outnumbered line-of-duty deaths.
New York's string of tragedies prompted NYPD Commissioner James O'Neill to deliver a call for action and to encourage fellow cops to not be afraid to seek help if they need it.
"This is a mental-health crisis," O'Neill tweeted Friday night. "And we – the NYPD and the law enforcement profession as a whole – absolutely must take action. This cannot be allowed to continue. Cops spend so much of their days assisting others. There is no shame in seeking assistance from the many resources available, both inside and outside the department.
"Accepting help is never a sign of weakness," he added. "In fact, it's a sign of great strength. "
The NYPD has not released the name of the latest police officer who died from suicide.
A funeral was held Monday for Steven Silks, a 62-year-old deputy police chief who shot and killed himself in a car on June 5. The New York Times reported that Silks, a 38-year veteran of the department, parked his car on a quiet street just hours after his mandatory retirement was announced. He shot himself near where his retirement ceremony would have taken place.
His death rattled many in the department.
"Steve truly was one of the most capable and most dependable cops this job has ever seen," O'Neill said. "His entire career, much of his adult life in fact, was devoted to New York City, to its police officers and to fighting crime and to protect all the people that we serve. "
The day after Silks's death, June 6, Detective Joseph Calabrese, 58, a member of the force for 37 years, went missing. His car was found off Belt Parkway in Brooklyn, The New York Times reported. After a widespread search, he was found dead in nearby bushes at Plumb Beach with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.
"Det. Joseph Calabrese kept New Yorkers safe for nearly four decades," Police Chief Terance Monahan tweeted after his burial Wednesday. "Loved by his fellow cops, the loss of Joe is difficult for every member of the NYPD. As he’s laid to rest, our prayers are with his family. Joe’s death has ignited a conversation we must all continue. #StopSuicide"
In 2018, 159 police officers in the USA died from suicide, according to the Massachusetts-based nonprofit BlueH. E. L. P. , which tracks officer suicides while also seeking to prevent such tragedies from occurring.
That's 9% more than the 144 line-of-duty deaths in 2018. The latter includes include causes such as felonious assaults, patrol vehicle accidents, heart attacks and duty-related illness.
“As tragic as these duty deaths are, the single greatest cause of death for law enforcement officers each year is suicide,” Jeff McGill, co-founder of Blue H. E. L. P, said when the group released the 2018 figures.
The number of suicides last year matched the 159 who took their lives in 2017. In 2016, 140 police officers in the U. S. died by suicide.
Blue H. E. L. P. works to expand police officers’ access to mental health services.
Its organizers say that 151 of the suicides last year were male and eight were female. The average age was 41 years old, and the average length of service in the police force was 15 years.
But according to Steven Hough, co-founder of Blue H. E. L. P. , the number of police suicides is likely greater.
“The problem is we know there are other tragic deaths by suicide that we don’t know about,” Hough was quoted saying this year. “So as bad a number as we have this year, we’re saddened by the fact that we know in reality the number is higher. ”

Texto completo: LAS VEGAS – Won a vacation. Having a great time.
Then the cell phone started buzzing.
ESPN and New York Times are reporting the Los Angeles Lakers are sending Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart and three first-round picks including the fourth overall in Thursday's NBA draft to New Orleans for all-star center Anthony Davis.
Now new Pelicans general manager David Griffin can dangle that fourth pick out there and see if he can get a rising star from another team for it.
So New Orleans has the first and fourth overall pick, for now, which changes my most recent mock draft in more ways than one.
Time to hustle back to the hotel resort and adjust my mock.
Probably needed a break. Vegas is wild ya'll.
1. New Orleans Pelicans – Zion Williamson (6-7, 285, F, freshman, Duke)
Top 10 take: The Team USA camp invitee further proves how elite of a talent he is.
2. Memphis Grizzlies – Ja Morant (6-3, 175, PG, sophomore, Murray State)
Top 10 take: He's going to raise everyone's level of play with his passing first, scoring second.
3. New York Knicks – RJ Barrett (6-7, 202, F, freshman, Duke)
Top 10 take: Has made it clear New York is where he wants to be. The Knicks should want the same.
4. New Orleans Pelicans (from Los Angeles Lakers via reported Anthony Davis trade)– Jarrett Culver (6-5, 195, G, sophomore, Texas Tech)
Top 10 take: Culver's size and versatility fits with Pelicans – if they keep the pick.
5. Cleveland Cavaliers – Darius Garland (6-2, 175, PG, freshman, Vanderbilt)
Top 10 take: That would make for a small backcourt, but new coach John Beilein can put Collin Sexton in attack mode have two scoring guards like Portland's Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum, whom are both 6-3.
6. Phoenix Suns– De'Andre Hunter (6-7, 225, F, sophomore, Virginia)
Top 10 take: With good size and ability to stretch the floor (shot 43.8% from 3 this past season), Hunter addresses need at power forward as Phoenix looks to free agency for a point guard.
7. Chicago Bulls – Coby White (6-5, 185, PG, freshman, North Carolina)
Top 10 take: Seen by some as a combo guard, White is fast, athletic and can run the point for the Bulls.
8. Atlanta Hawks – Cam Reddish (6-5, 195, G, sophomore, Texas Tech)
Top 10 take: Reddish's size and skill set fits well with the Hawks' up-tempo game.
9. Washington Wizards– Jaxson Hayes (6-11, 220, F, freshman, Texas)
Top 10 take: Wizards will love Hayes' energy, defense. Has talent to expand game beyond the paint.
10. Atlanta Hawks – Sekou Doumbouya (6-9, 230, F, France)
Top 10 take: Atlanta has a system and style of play that suites Doumbouya because of his size, range.
11. Minnesota Timberwolves – PJ Washington (6-8, 228, F, sophomore, Kentucky)
12. Charlotte Hornets – Rui Hachimura (6-8, 230, F, junior, Gonzaga)
13. Miami Heat – Romeo Langford (6-6, 215, G, freshman, Indiana)
14. Boston Celtics – Nassir Little (6-6, 220, F, freshman, North Carolina)
15. Detroit Pistons – Nickeil Alexander-Walker (6-5, 205, G, sophomore, Virginia Tech)
16. Orlando Magic – Cameron Johnson (6-9, 210, G, senior, North Carolina)
17. Atlanta Hawks (from Brooklyn Nets via reported Allen Crabbe trade) – Keldon Johnson (6-6, 211, G, freshman, Kentucky)
18. Indiana Pacers – Bol Bol (7-2, 235, C, freshman, Oregon)
19. San Antonio Spurs – Brandon Clarke (6-8, 215, F, junior, Gonzaga)
20. Boston Celtics – Kevin Porter Jr. (6-6, 218, G, freshman, USC)
21. Oklahoma City Thunder – Tyler Herro (6-5, 195, G, freshman, Kentucky)
22. Boston Celtics – Mfiondu Kabengele (6-10, 250, sophomore, F, Florida State)
23. Utah Jazz – Matisse Thybulle (6-5, 195, G, senior, Washington)
24. Philadelphia 76ers – Luka Samanic (6-11, 230, F, Croatia)
25. Portland Trail Blazers – Goga Bitadze (6-11, 250, C, Republic of Georgia)
26. Cleveland Cavaliers – Nic Claxton (6-11, 220, F, sophomore, Georgia)
27. Brooklyn Nets – Talen Horton-Tucker (6-4, 238, G, freshman, Iowa State)
28. Golden State Warriors – Bruno Fernando (6-10, 240, F, sophomore, Maryland)
29. San Antonio Spurs – KZ Okpala (6-9, 215, F, sophomore, Stanford)
30. Milwaukee Bucks – Ty Jerome (6-5, 195, G, junior, Virginia)

Waiting for new lungs, advocating for others

Texto completo: Nineteen-year-old Maddi Bertrand of Glen Ellyn is a leading voice in a somber new video by The New York Times, which notes that 11,000 Americans will die this year while waiting for organ transplants. Chicago’s Lurie Children’s Hospital will give Maddi a Hope and Courage award Wednesday for her wide range of contributions, including her advocacy efforts that helped lead to a change in the legal age to buy tobacco products from 18 to 21 in Illinois as of July 1.
She’s been raising money for the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation since she staged Maddi’s Marvelous Mayfair fundraiser at the age of 7. She’s successfully lobbied for smoke-free bike paths and parks. She never turns down a chance as a speaker to raise funds and awareness on behalf of people with cystic fibrosis.
"And I will for the rest of my life until a cure is found," Maddi says. Then she coughs a dozen times into a paper towel, grimaces, removes the oxygen tubes from her nose to blow into a tissue, and pauses for nearly a minute to give her body time to catch up. CF is a life-shortening, progressive, genetic disease that affects the pancreas and causes a thick mucus to form in the lungs.
"I’m definitely sicker than I was a month ago," she says. The attention and awards are nice, but what she really wants is a new set of lungs.
Born in Pennsylvania, one of the few states at the time that tested newborns for cystic fibrosis, Maddi got diagnosed and started treatment earlier than many CF patients, says her mother, Linda Bertrand.
"When I was in elementary school and middle school, I could do sports," Maddi says, noting that she even played the rough game of lacrosse. "Whenever I’d join a team, I’d get sick, end up in the hospital, and then the season would wind down."
She plays the flute and piano, did martial arts with her brother, and was healthy enough to be a section leader in the marching band and take on roles in a couple of plays during high school.
"I’ve gone from this tiny backpack to a tank because I’ve been needing more oxygen," says Maddi, whose senior photos featured one with the oxygen tubes and one without. She takes a couple dozen pills each day, and undergoes three or four daily lung treatments. In spite of missing weeks of school, she made it to prom and graduated from Glenbard West High School in 2018 with the rest of her class. On Feb. 2, 2018, she went on the lung transplant waiting list.
"She’s a very smart, determined and wonderful young woman," says Lisa Mulvaney, coordinator of the creative arts program at Lurie Children’s, and the person who recruited Maddi for the Lurie Children’s Kids Advisory Board in 2013. "From Day One, she was really invested in this group of kids and about making the hospital even better. She never wants to miss a meeting."
Maddi dragged her oxygen tank onto a Metra train and ordered a ride service once she got into Chicago to make one board meeting. Because CF patients can get sick when near other CF patients, Maddi is the only representative of that disease on the board, which has members aged 12 to 19.
"She really displays such hope and such courage," Mulvaney says. "She wants to give as much as she can."
As a freshman in high school, Maddie became the first CF patient to complete the Xtreme Hike: a one-day, 21-mile hike with her mom through the hills of the Manistee National Forest in Michigan. Maddi has helped host three proms for the inpatients at Lurie Children’s. She attended the first International Children’s Advisory Network summit in Washington, D.C. Her mother recalls how Maddi didn’t get a chance to meet with then-U.S. Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois. "But I recognized his wheelchair at the airport," says Maddi, who walked up, introduced herself, and had a nice chat about the importance of funding research for CF and other diseases that affect children.
The New York Times video featuring Maddi was produced by Kendall Ciesemier, an original member of the Lurie Children’s Kids Advisory Board from Wheaton, and a member of the 2010-11 Daily Herald Leadership Team. At age 11, Ciesemier founded Kids Caring 4 Kids, which helps children in Africa impacted by AIDS. Her work was recognized by then-President Bill Clinton and Oprah Winfrey. Born with a rare liver disorder, Ciesemier was the recipient of two liver transplants.
"I want people to know that donating organs is so important and that I wouldn’t be alive without the generosity of a stranger," Ciesemier says via email. "I take the gift that someone gave me very seriously and I focus a lot on paying it forward. … I like to believe that I can give people hope."
Maddi says she maintains her hope.
"Of course, I want new lungs, but I’ll wait as long as it takes. I’m happy," says Maddi, who notes the transplant wait is tricky. "I have to be really sick to be at the top of the list, but I have to be healthy enough for the surgery. This is so crazy."
She gets support from her brother Zach, 16, and sisters Grace, 13, and Gabbi, 11, but Maddi says her strength comes from her Christian faith. "God’s in control," she says. "Whenever I’m down and don’t know if I can do this, I lean on God. I know He will get me the right pair of lungs."
She’s learning to play a new religious song on the piano, with the lyric, "I will fight for you." Transplanted lungs would be free of CF, but recovery from the surgery can be grueling, and requires lifelong medications and care. Imagining her life with new lungs and the ability to breathe, Maddi sees herself going to college and becoming a trainer who works with dolphins at Clearwater Marine Aquarium, the Florida not-for-profit whose care of sick and injured marine animals was made into two "Dolphin Tale" movies. Anchored close to home while she waits for her transplant, Maddi also dreams of traveling to Florida, New York, Hawaii and California, and doing some of those things that CF denied her.
"When I get these new lungs," Maddi says, breaking into a sly grin, "I want to live a little first."

Texto completo: Work.
You wouldn't expect someone who is undergoing chemo to think about such a thing — more specifically, getting back to it.
"This whole time I've been buying 'Wine Enthusiast,' 'Wine Spectator,' [and] 'Whiskey Advocate.' I've been trying to keep up with everything — keeping my mind going — so I can step in as soon as I'm ready to go. I'm just waiting to get through this," James Gibble said.
For Gibble, 50, behind the bar is where he feels most at home. Even in the middle of chemotherapy, an IV needle plunged into his veins, he remains hospitable towards me.
It is something in his soul, that despite his unpleasantries he still wants to make sure you're comfortable — even during something as mundane as a conversation. Perhaps, there's a lost art to it, a level of selflessness, a dedication to the craft of courtesy that has been molded in him after decades in hospitality.
As his 130-pound frame sits somewhat slouched in the hospital chair, a weathered Phillies cap on his head, he tells me about a few of the drinks he's been conjuring up during his absence from Tutoni's in downtown York.
Comfort in conjuring up drinks Like a strawberry rhubarb shrub with gin, lime juice and honey and a bit of sparkling to help kick the aromatics up into your nasal passage, he said, making an explosion gesture near his face with his left hand. He's also thinking about a white birch old fashioned, as a commemorative cocktail to the days of Prohibition in central Pennsylvania, where black Manhattans were once made with root flavors.
His eyes widen with each drink description, his constant hand movements knock the IV needle loose, prompting a galling beep. A nurse soon enters the room, fixing the IV and ensuring he's comfortable. It is at this moment, that I can't help but crack a smile.
Here's a guy, who just months ago was diagnosed with Stage 1 lung cancer. Yet here he is driving himself to a chemotherapy session in his '97 Jeep Cherokee, down nearly 40 pounds since the diagnosis and alive with more passion and energy than many of us can muster during a single work week.
Following his October diagnosis, Gibble would later learn the doctors discovered two more spots on his liver. An unexpected tussle with pneumonia would delay his chemotherapy until May. He hasn't been mixing drinks or opening any bottles of wine since February.
While Gibble is still waiting to know if the spots on his liver are cancerous, he'll continue with the initially scheduled chemo and immunotherapy treatments to address his lung cancer and any potential of it spreading further towards his liver.
The Phillies, and life's memorable moments The hat. I ask him about the Phillies cap.
"I'm still a diehard Phillies fan," he said. He recalls his first game at the former Veterans Stadium when he was around 5 or 6 years old. His father took him. "I was in awe at how many people were there and the excitement [of] watching the players live."
He continues recalling some of his fondest moments as a fan. Living in D.C. and going to a Nationals-Phillies series because it was cheaper than seeing them at Citizens Bank Park. The Matt Stairs home run during Game 4 of the 2008 NLCS. After he moved back to York and began taking the train from Philadelphia to D.C. for a game because it was still cheaper to see the Phillies in the nation's capital than in the City of Brotherly Love.
He then talks about his time in D.C. and his affinity for the town's melting pot of cultures and accessibility to corresponding restaurants, from Caribbean to Thai. He shares his love for D.C. United and the joy of watching international soccer during the World Cup.
Next to him, a few folded sections of The Washington Post sit in the nook of his chair cushion.
He's always enjoyed reading The Washington Post and The New York Times. He wants to stay informed with current events, and one of his close friends, Sarah Woods, a bartender at his beloved First Capital Dispensing in downtown York, ensures he does. She grabs the Post for him every Wednesday and Sunday — for the food section.
How York is keeping Gibble's optimism alive It is individuals such as Woods who keep Gibble's optimism alive. It is no secret he's been a foundation in the York restaurant scene for decades, but since October he is still brought to tears at the notion of how many people have come out to show their support.
"I connected with a lot of people, apparently. I had no idea how many," he said.
After his initial diagnosis last autumn, a GoFundMe was created by his employers. Tutoni's co-owners Toni and Tony Calderone are continuing to support his recovery with a monthly stipend, he said.
The downtown community got together again in December for a support night at the King George Club at Tutoni's and again in February for a benefit concert at the Strand Theatre.
"To see over 300 people come out to support me ... it was overwhelming and humbling at the same time," he said.
He stops himself. His pause is prompted by a reaction to the Benadryl in his IV. In a polite panic, he rings the bell on the desk near his chair to signal a nurse. He apologizes for the interruption and for feeling lightheaded. I shake my head and offer to leave and he encourages me to stay put.
The nurse walks in and confirms what he already knows. He's having a mild reaction to the Benadryl. She offers him a choice of Rold Gold Pretzel or animal crackers and some water to help with the dizziness. He chooses the pretzels, looks at me and asks where we were.
The benefit concert.
'The music just put everything at peace' He picks up the verbal bookmark and recounts one moment in particular that still stays with him. He went on stage during a Bjorn and Francois performance and took a selfie. "I never take selfies," he said.
He recalled seeing the picture after the event ended and being in awe of what he captured.
"[I was] at so much peace and tranquil. The music just put everything at peace for me," he said.
For Gibble, music and hospitality have always been his guiding forces. And now, as he continues to undergo 4-hour treatment sessions, he forces himself to remain optimistic.
Even though he's driving himself to chemo, taking vitamin supplements and using two inhalers to battle shortness of breath, he's aware of how many friends, family members and former patrons are are out there supporting him.
"Other people, it tears them apart, and I'm trying to go the opposite direction," he said.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — In tweets on Sunday morning, President Donald Trump suggested supporters might not want him to leave office after two terms.
"The good news is that at the end of 6 years, after America has been made GREAT again and I leave the beautiful White House (do you think the people would demand that I stay longer? KEEP AMERICA GREAT)," Trump wrote.
The president had also been criticizing the Washington Post and the New York Times, calling them "both a disgrace. "
Trump has talked about the issue before. In March last year, according to a recording obtained by CNN, he told a closed-door fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago that "maybe we'll have to give that a shot some day," in reference to Chinese President Xi Jinping's abolishment of term limits. It was unclear if the comments were made in jest.
The 22nd Amendment to the Constitution explicitly states that "no person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice. "
The only American president to serve more than two terms was Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who died during his fourth term in office.
Some progressive commentators have speculated about the possibility of Trump not leaving office if he loses the election narrowly. Last week, Bill Maher said on CNN that if Trump loses, "he won't go. "
To which conservative commentator Jonah Goldberg responded, "Refusing to leave would make him the crazy guy the Marines escort out of the building. "

SHOWTIME IN NO TIME!; Report: Pelicans agree to trade Davis to Lakers, teaming him with LeBron ; in yet another blow to Knicks

Texto completo: The Pelicans have agreed to trade Anthony Davis to the Lakers for a package that includes Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hard and three first-round picks, reports ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski.
If the deal goes through, it would ends the season-long drama surrounding Davis and the Lakers. After requesting a trade to last season, Davis publicly tried to force his way to the team. In the aftermath of the trade, the young Laker core fractured, with reports circulating that the players resented LeBron James for such public lobbying for them to be traded.
Pairing Davis with James makes the Lakers an instant title contender after missing the playoffs this past season, particularly with Kevin Durant (Achilles) and Klay Thompson (ACL) out for all or the majority of next season. The rest of the roster is a question mark, as many of the players on last season's team were under one-year contracts, but the Lakers did retain sharpshooting forward Kyle Kuzma in the reported deal, which had been a sticking point for the team.
The Lakers are not done yet, either. The team plans to pursue Kemba Walker hard in free agency, according to the New York Times' Marc Stein. Walker had previously stated that he would take less money than the supermax contract he can receive from the Hornets in order to stay with the team, presumably to help build a contender. Under that premise, an offer to play with LeBron James and Anthony Davis would seem appealing. And James' time with the Heat and Cavaliers has shown, past-their-prime veterans are willing to take the veterans' minimum for a chance to win a title with him as well.
For the Pelicans, the deal would pair Ball and Ingram with certain No. 1 overall pick Zion Williamson and incumbent starter Jrue Holiday, giving the Pelicans a young core that could contend within a few seasons, and enough pieces to swing a trade for a veteran if it turns out Williamson is good enough to carry a playoff team before the other young players are.
Pelicans boss David Griffin is not done yet either. Wojnarowski reports that several teams have shown strong interest in the No. 4 pick, and it's possible the Pels can flip it in the next few days for a young All-Star level player. The Wizards' Bradley Beal comes to mind.
The trade is a disaster for the Knicks and other teams that had pinned their hopes to landing Davis, like the Celtics. With the 2019 free agent class crushed by injuries to Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson, and with Walker and Kyrie Irving reportedly leaning toward other destinations, trading for Davis had become an increasingly appealing option for the Knicks, who own the No. 3 pick in next week's draft, compared to Los Angeles's No. 4, which is included in the deal. The Knicks have been reported to be targeting Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard, but he is strongly linked to the Clippers due to his affinity for southern California, and values well-run organizations, such as the Raptors. Both strikes against the Knicks.
The Celtics, meanwhile, are likely to lose Irving in free agency, and have held onto assets for years in hopes of landing Davis in a trade. Passing on deals for players like Paul George, Kawhi Leonard and Jimmy Butler only to see him land with their historic rivals is a massive blow to Danny Ainge's hopes of building another champion in Boston. According to the Times' Stein, Ainge refused to include Jayson Tatum in the deal, which pushed the Lakers over the top.
It was a longshot for the Nets to come out on top in the Davis dogpile, but it was at least a notion. With him out of the picture, the team will have to return to deciding how to handle Irving's reported decision to sign with the team and the restricted free agency of All-Star point guard D'Angelo Russell. After moving all-in with a salary dump for this offseason, they have room to maneuver for other free agents, such as Philly's Butler and Tobias Harris, or a trade for a player like Beal.
Free agency doesn't officially begin until June 30. The draft isn't until this coming Thursday. But already, the landscape of the NBA has shifted. Other big names will follow soon after this. None, yet, are attached to the New York Knicks.
This is a developing story. Check back for further details.

As Trump ponders a nickname for Mayor Pete

Texto completo: This simple wisdom — “Fans don’t boo nobodies” — is courtesy the pinstriped philosopher Reggie Jackson, and it resonates for anyone who has ever been in the public sphere.
Put yourself out there and the cranks crank it up. In the end, they’re still cranks.
When you are being noticed, it’s because you have become a cause for concern, for somebody.
So that’s how I realized early this month that the formerly minor character known as Mayor Pete has become a serious cause for concern for the Republican National Committee as it continues its unethical quest to re-elect the president.
How did I realize this? Because the RNC told me so.
On June 3, its Christiana Purves sent me an email: “Good evening — With less than a month to go before the first 2020 Democrat Presidential debate, we’re still only scratching the surface of truly learning about lesser-vetted candidates like Pete Buttigieg. Unfortunately for Mayor Pete, the more we learn, Californians are more likely to see that he was a lousy Mayor who’s struggling to keep up with the pace of presidential politics.”
Then Purves goes on to cite an odd selection of stories from what the Grand Old Party on a normal day, when it didn’t suit its needs, would term the lamestream media.
“‘I ain’t ever seen the dude’ — Residents of South Bend’s poor neighborhoods say Democratic presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg left them behind,” the RNC quotes CNBC as saying. Oh, how the GOP is in touch with America’s troubled urban youth. And then: “Buttigieg is only top 2020 presidential candidate not offering staffers health care yet.” Ha ha ha. The former deputy press secretary for Trump buddy Sen. Lindsey Graham concerned a Democratic longshot is not yet being able to afford benefits for his ragtag staff? Ha ha ha.
But with the RNC concerned enough about the guy to start doing a lot of opposition research and sending it out to members of the press, maybe he’s not such a longshot, what?
I have by no means figured out who stands the best chance of preventing the global disaster that would be a second term for this president. No one has stood out in particular from the clearly too many candidates clogging the opposition field. Too bad a gutsy moderate Republican won’t come forward to take advantage of the ridiculously tainted incumbent.
The latest poll of California Democratic voters goes: Biden 22, Sanders 17, Harris 13, Warren 18, Buttigieg 10, O’Rourke 3.
So, only 10 percent of California’s Democratic voters right now say Buttigieg is their main man. Or, to look at it another way, a guy who otherwise just leads the fourth-largest city in Indiana is in fifth place among voters in the nation’s largest state. And this sudden GOP attention would lead us to believe that’s fifth place with a bullet. Harvard and Oxford graduate, former Navy Reserve lieutenant who served in Afghanistan — nice resume. Oh, and he’s gay. And he’s getting noticed — pollsters say awareness of Buttigieg shot up from 4% to 48% in the last six months.
Still actually a stretch, though. The problematical guy who is for some reason not a longshot, Joe Biden, is the frontrunner who is really giving the incumbent conniption fits. The president’s own campaign pollster came to him with numbers from a 17-state survey showing Trump losing to Biden in states that he needs to win, including Texas (sweet!), Michigan and Pennsylvania. After seeing the polls, the president told aides to deny them, Annie Karmin reports in The New York Times.
Biden is “Sleepy Joe” to Trump.
What’s he gonna call Buttigieg when the going gets rough on down the road?

Texto completo: After seemingly endless drama, wary negotiations and a season that ended in turmoil, the Lakers have pulled off the mega-deal that’s been talked about for months.
Though later than they might have liked, the A.D. Era has begun in Los Angeles.
The New Orleans Pelicans have agreed to ship off star forward Anthony Davis, a six-time All-Star, to the Lakers for a hefty price: Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart and three first-round draft picks, including the No. 4 overall pick in Thursday’s NBA Draft. A source close to the team confirmed the deal, first reported by ESPN, to the Southern California News Group. The trade cannot be officially completed until July, when teams can begin operating under next season’s salary cap.
While the risk is considerable – the Lakers are betting Davis will choose to stay in Los Angeles when his contract expires in 2020 – the reward might just be worth it. In what NBA observers have dubbed as perhaps the most significant trade for a star in his prime since the Lakers acquired Kareem Abdul-Jabbar 45 years ago, getting Davis for the next year alongside LeBron James forms the foundation of what the Lakers hope is a team that can return to championship-level contention after six consecutive seasons out of the playoffs.
The trade has been discussed since January, when Davis publicly announced his desire to be traded from the only pro franchise he’s ever known. While talks fell flat at the February trade deadline, they reheated in the past few weeks as new power brokers took over for the respective teams.
It’s one of the biggest trades the Lakers have ever made and one that is certain to define the controversial tenure of General Manager Rob Pelinka, who took over basketball operations in April after team president Magic Johnson resigned. It fulfills the organization’s vision of pairing two All-NBA superstars on the same roster – a vision it has touted since Pelinka entered the team’s front office in 2017.
It’s also a bold start to new Pelicans executive David Griffin’s tenure: The unabashed flirtations between Davis and the Lakers touched a nerve for many New Orleans fans, which isn’t likely to quickly heal despite the package the team received back. The Pelicans now hold the No. 1 and No. 4 picks in the upcoming draft, though ESPN reported Griffin was already seeking a trade for the Lakers’ pick.
Since being drafted first overall in 2012, Davis has largely lived up to the expectations that have rested upon his 6-foot-10 frame. He’s become one of the league’s surest double-double men and a scorer from all levels (25.9 ppg, 10.5 rpg, 2.4 bpg) and his defensive prowess has helped make him a six-time All-Star and the third-place candidate for league MVP last season.
There’s one area in which he’s been short: winning. Davis has made the postseason just twice in seven seasons in New Orleans, and he won his first playoff series, a sweep of the Portland Trail Blazers in 2018.
The Lakers are coming off a disappointing season themselves, winning just 37 games and failing to make the playoffs. For James, it was the first time since 2005 he missed the postseason, fueling criticism of the Lakers’ roster construction last summer and adding sting to the bevy of injuries the team suffered.
The connection between James, 34, and Davis has been hotly discussed since September when Davis hired Rich Paul, James’ agent and close friend. James added juice to the subplot when he told ESPN in November it would be “amazing” and “incredible” if he could play with Davis. James raised eyebrows and fanned flames when he selected Davis to his All-Star squad on Feb. 7, the day of the trade deadline when talks had fizzled.
The cost of Davis and trying to win next season was trading in the future: Between Ingram, Ball and the No. 4 pick this year, the Lakers surrendered three former or future lottery picks. Ingram and Ball were once considered the nucleus of the Lakers’ future, and team’s previous attempts to pry them away in trade talks (most notably Kawhi Leonard) had fallen flat. Both ended this season with injuries but showed improvement – particularly Ingram, who played his best stretch of basketball after the All-Star break before being sidelined by a blood clot that required surgery. In two seasons with the Lakers, Josh Hart had also cultivated esteem as a rotation player in the lineup, despite struggling with a knee injury for much of this past year.
The one member of the team’s so-called “young core” the Lakers retained was Kyle Kuzma, who became a starter in his second season (18.7 ppg, 5.5 rpg) and vastly outplayed his end-of-the-first-round draft slot when he entered the league in 2017. Kuzma also has the most salary-cap friendly contract of the four players, due to make just under $2 million next season.
The Lakers’ most visible competition for Davis was the Boston Celtics. ESPN reported that the Lakers’ longtime East Coast rivals essentially withdrew themselves from the running once it was clear they didn’t want to include forward Jayson Tatum in a deal.
The cutthroat Western Conference could be in for a dramatic shakeup this offseason: Golden State, the class of the West for five seasons running, suffered significant injuries to stars Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson during its six-game loss to Toronto in the Finals. With lengthy recovery timelines and Durant’s pending free agency, the Warriors’ dynasty might be as vulnerable as ever, and a star-laden Lakers team could be well-poised to leap into contention with a strong offseason haul once free agency starts June 30.
For the Lakers, the deal could not come at a better time: The franchise has been roiled in drama since the season ended April 9, headlined by Johnson’s dramatic resignation. A tortured coaching search, in which the team eventually selected Frank Vogel, and Johnson’s public accusations of Pelinka’s “backstabbing” have hurt the perception of the Lakers’ stability, which Pelinka and Vogel have vigorously defended.
The Lakers still have ample room this summer to chase free agents to fill out their roster, but the sequence of the trade will affect how much space under the salary cap they’ll have. Davis has a $4 million trade kicker that he can choose to waive. The timing of the deal is also essential: If the Lakers can convince the Pelicans to wait until July 30 to complete the trade, the No. 4 pick will count as salary in the deal, and the Lakers could clear as much as $32.4 million under their salary cap – just enough to sign a third max free agent.
The New York Times reported the Lakers were expected to target All-Star guard Kemba Walker in free agency should they clear a max slot. The Lakers themselves have also emphasized that they will be looking for shooting during free agency.

Texto completo: SALT LAKE CITY — The NBA’s transaction season got off to a roaring start on Saturday afternoon as ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski reported that the New Orleans Pelicans will trade superstar Anthony Davis to the Los Angeles Lakers for Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart and three first-round draft picks, including the fourth overall in next week’s draft.
Although the deal does not directly involve the Utah Jazz, it’ll still surely have a big impact on the team’s standing in the Western Conference. Most notably, the Lakers will add in Davis one of the best players in the NBA to pair with LeBron James, making a fearsome frontcourt duo.
Los Angeles surely isn’t done adding stars either. The Lakers will still have roughly $30 million in salary cap space this summer to sign an elite player, with Charlotte Hornets point guard Kemba Walker set to be a top target, according to New York Times NBA reporter Marc Stein.
Having such a trio would surely vault Los Angeles into the upper echelon of the Western Conference next season, especially since the Golden State Warriors are in a serious state of uncertainty following their NBA Finals loss to the Toronto Raptors.
One item of local note involving the trade is that former University of Utah star Kyle Kuzma will not be included in it, according to Wojnarowski. Multiple reports emerged earlier this week that the Lakers did not want to include him.
As for the Pelicans, they are set to have a very good foundation to build on after Davis’ departure. They are widely expected to take star-in-waiting Zion Williamson with the No. 1 overall pick in next week’s draft, and now they’ll have another top-five pick as well. Ball, Ingram and Hart have shown some signs of being potentially good players, and the group will have the chance to grow together.
Those players will join guard Jrue Holiday, who has been excellent for New Orleans, although his future may be in question with Ball’s arrival. As speculation surrounding Davis swirled, it was widely thought after the Pelicans won the top pick that even if Davis was traded, New Orleans would keep Holiday to pair with Williamson.
With Ball’s inclusion in the deal, however, will that be the case? Ball is pretty strictly a point guard, where Holiday has been playing, although Holiday could likely move to shooting guard if Pelicans head coach Alvin Gentry wanted to have both players in the starting lineup.
If Holiday does get on the trade market, would the Jazz try to make a run at acquiring him to fill the need they have there?
The draft is on June 20 and free agency begins on June 30.

Resumen: In 10 days, the New York City Police Department has lost a veteran deputy chief, detective and a third police officer Friday – all from suicides.

Texto completo: At 3:50 p. m. Friday afternoon, a 29-year-old New York City police officer shot and killed himself outside the Staten Island Police precinct where he worked.
It marked the latest in a troubling trend: Three suicides of New York Police Department officers in 10 days – and the fourth this year.
The situation in New York is part of a national problem. Last year, for the third straight year, cops who died by suicide outnumbered line-of-duty deaths.
New York's string of tragedies prompted NYPD Commissioner James O'Neill to deliver a call for action and to encourage fellow cops to not be afraid to seek help if they need it.
"This is a mental-health crisis," O'Neill tweeted Friday night. "And we – the NYPD and the law enforcement profession as a whole – absolutely must take action. This cannot be allowed to continue. Cops spend so much of their days assisting others. There is no shame in seeking assistance from the many resources available, both inside and outside the department.
"Accepting help is never a sign of weakness," he added. "In fact, it's a sign of great strength. "
The NYPD has not released the name of the latest police officer who died from suicide.
A funeral was held Monday for Steven Silks, a 62-year-old deputy police chief who shot and killed himself in a car on June 5. The New York Times reported that Silks, a 38-year veteran of the department, parked his car on a quiet street just hours after his mandatory retirement was announced. He shot himself near where his retirement ceremony would have taken place.
His death rattled many in the department.
"Steve truly was one of the most capable and most dependable cops this job has ever seen," O'Neill said. "His entire career, much of his adult life in fact, was devoted to New York City, to its police officers and to fighting crime and to protect all the people that we serve. "
The day after Silks's death, June 6, Detective Joseph Calabrese, 58, went missing. A member of the force for 37 years, Calabrese's car was found off Belt Parkway in Brooklyn, the New York Times reported. After a massive search, he was found dead in nearby bushes at Plumb Beach with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.
"Det. Joseph Calabrese kept New Yorkers safe for nearly four decades," Police Chief Terance Monahan tweeted following his burial ceremony Wednesday. "Loved by his fellow cops, the loss of Joe is difficult for every member of the NYPD. As he’s laid to rest, our prayers are with his family. Joe’s death has ignited a conversation we must all continue. #StopSuicide"
In 2018, 159 police officers in the U. S. died from suicide, according to the Massachusetts-based nonprofit BlueH. E. L. P. , which tracks officer suicides while also seeking to prevent such tragedies from occurring.
That's 9% more than the 144 line-of-duty deaths in 2018. The latter includes include causes such as felonious assaults, patrol vehicle accidents, heart attacks and duty-related illness.
“As tragic as these duty deaths are, the single greatest cause of death for law enforcement officers each year is suicide,” Jeff McGill, co-founder of Blue H. E. L. P, said when the group released the 2018 figures.
The number of suicides last year matched the 159 who took their lives in 2017. In 2016, 140 police officers in the U. S. committed suicide.
Blue H. E. L. P. works to expand police officers’ access to mental health services.
Its organizers say that 151 of the suicides last year were male and eight were female. The average age was 41 years old and the average length of service in the police force was 15 years.
But according to Steven Hough, co-founder of Blue H. E. L. P. , the number of police suicides is likely greater.
“The problem is we know there are other tragic deaths by suicide that we don’t know about,” Hough was quoted saying earlier this year. “So as bad a number as we have this year, we’re saddened by the fact that we know in reality the number is higher. ”

Does Biden Believe in the Biden Campaign? The left turns do not signal confidence.

Texto completo: From the moment Joe Biden announced his presidential campaign, he's been the clear polling leader among Democratic candidates and the one best positioned to attract centrist voters. So why does the former vice president keep discouraging people from viewing him as a moderate? In his latest move leftward, Mr. Biden is mimicking Vermont's socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders in demanding more tax revenue from retailer Amazon.
As strong as Mr. Biden has appeared in Democratic polls, survey results make him look even better when it comes to a hypothetical match-up in a general election. But of course it's a long way to November of 2020. Jonathan Easley writes in The Hill today:
Democrats and Republicans alike are skeptical of early polls predicting a landslide victory for Democrat Joe Biden over President Trump on Election Day 2020.
To Trump and Republicans, the polls are fake news and no more reliable than surveys predicting Hillary Clinton would be elected president in 2016.
Some Democrats are equally skeptical, warning their party not to buy into the early data.
"These same geniuses all predicted that Hillary Clinton was unstoppable and inevitable," said Chris Kofinis, a Democratic pollster.
A different group of geniuses is running the Biden operation, and they don't seem to believe in the strength of their campaign, either. In fact, they seem to be rejecting its entire premise.
The Democratic field was already crowded with committed leftists when Mr. Biden entered the race in April. What energized both Wall Street and Main Street Democrats was the arrival of a legitimate contender to win over America's non-leftists, many of whom live in the Midwest.
Shortly after Mr. Biden announced his candidacy Trip Gabriel wrote in the New York Times about the potential for Mr. Biden to build a "traditional" Democratic coalition and even to inspire people outside the party in states like Pennsylvania:
He has the potential to attract suburban moderates defecting from the Republican Party under President Trump, to invigorate black voters who were underwhelmed by Hillary Clinton and to reverse at least some losses among working-class white voters.
Mr. Biden moved out of his home state of Pennsylvania in the 1950s. Since starting his latest presidential campaign seven weeks ago, he has moved further away politically from its voters.
After recently abandoning a position he'd held for decades that taxpayers shouldn't be forced to pay for abortions, Mr. Biden has lately been articulating the economic agenda that helped inspire Pennsylvanians to turn Republican in 2016. In a Tuesday speech he called for higher taxes, more regulation, and more government spending on the alternative energy sources that power very little Midwest manufacturing.
Thursday brought another Biden bouquet to the Democratic left, much of which does not live in the Midwest. In a tweet the former vice president linked to a recent Times piece about companies minimizing their tax bills—in large part by making large capital expenditures. Many people enjoy getting jobs when companies make such investments to build new plants and buy new tools. But the Times found a member of the Democratic Socialists of America who finds this annoying and doesn't mind sharing his thoughts while eating chocolate chip cookies and pondering the words of Karl Marx. Somehow this tale inspired Mr. Biden to tweet:
I have nothing against Amazon, but no company pulling in billions of dollars of profits should pay a lower tax rate than firefighters and teachers. We need to reward work, not just wealth.
The new Sandernista attack on Amazon is perhaps Mr. Biden's way of promising that he will repeal Trump reforms and restore in the U.S. the industrialized world's highest corporate income tax rate.
But there's nothing moderate about putting America last.

Texto completo: U.S. Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell are in bed with each other, and not just as husband and wife.
New revelations of official coziness are a huge problem for Chao, whose leadership of the infrastructure-building agency was already on a shaky foundation. Unless she can explain a slew of suspect decisions, and do it quick, she must step down.
Monday, Politico reported that Chao designated a dedicated liaison to help Kentucky and only Kentucky -- the state represented by her powerful spouse -- with infrastructure grants.
So just as McConnell was gearing up for re-election, Kentucky won nearly $80 million in approved grants, including a highway-improvement project that had been previously rejected twice.
The New York Times reported that in a 2017 proposed trip to China, Chao -- whose family runs an American shipping company with extensive business in China -- attempted to have Beijing Embassy staff coordinate travel for at least one family member and have other relatives sit in on meetings with Chinese government officials.
Last month, the Wall Street Journal revealed that Chao made $40,000 profiting from sale of stock in the country's largest construction materials supplier -- stock she had promised to divest from a year ago.
At this point, we're too exhausted to muster much surprise at the discovery of this type of behavior in the Trump Cabinet. But we're not tired enough to take it lying down.

Visual shortcuts, the ‘angry mob’ and editorial cartoons

Texto completo: A picture, we all know, is worth a thousand words. But which thousand is often up to the individual viewer.
This can be especially true when it comes to editorial cartoons. As a form of expression, a single cartoon panel can have a unique power to make a viewer laugh in agreement or growl with displeasure. Interestingly, the reaction is immediate — a chuckle, a guffaw, a pounding of the fist on the table — but the effect, at least in the best of cases, is long-lasting, as the viewer naturally is induced to reflect on the meaning and intent of a particular issue’s visual portrayal.
Unfortunately, though, nuance is not usually the editorial cartoonist’s stock in trade, so in many, if not most, cases, an individual cartoon must be examined very narrowly, and in some cases, a lack of depth can leave a cartoon open to vastly different interpretations.
All this makes selecting editorial cartoons for publication an imprecise art, no pun intended, for newspapers like the Daily Herald that value presentation of diverse points of view on their Opinion pages. And it can lead to considerable controversy when readers are stung by an artist’s portrayal that they find offensive, wildly exaggerated or simply wrong.
We at the Daily Herald address this challenge by striving to present a wide range of points of view in the editorial cartoons we publish from day to day. The New York Times has decided to deal with it by ending publication of editorial cartoons altogether in its international editions.
The Times’ decision followed an outcry over an April cartoon that lampooned President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Many critics found the image overtly anti-Semitic. The Times later agreed and apologized.
The artist, it’s worth noting, insisted that he did not mean to promote anti-Semitism but just wanted to make a statement about what he saw as President Trump’s blind loyalty to the Israeli leader. He is finding — as legions of Twitter and social media commentators also learn from time to time — that the inherent power of an arresting image or clever phrase can be abused by clumsy presentation.
The Times has never been particularly fond of editorial cartoons and had already ceased publication of them in its domestic editions. In a blog reacting to his newspaper’s decision to cease publishing traditional editorial cartoons in all its editions, Times cartoonist Patrick Chappatte, who did not draw the offending panel, described cartoons as "visual shortcut(s) with an unmatched capacity to touch the mind" and said that quality is both "their strength, and their vulnerability." He lamented that we live in an age when "moralistic mobs gather on social media and rise like a storm" to intimidate publishers and commentators.
In short, combine a moralistic mob and a visual shortcut and you have a formula for trouble. Chappatte thinks the solution is "to stop being afraid of the angry mob," and I’m willing to side with him to a point. But I’ve also found that the degree of people’s objection to the "angry mob" often depends on which angry mob they’re a part of. So, I place my hope and faith in the willingness — even as grudging as it sometimes is — for citizens of a country that values free speech and a free press to, within certain broad boundaries, tolerate views and images they abhor as long as their own views can get a fair hearing.
Or, in the case of editorial cartoons, a fair viewing.
For our part at the Daily Herald, we’re constantly evaluating how we use editorial cartoons and how we select the ones we publish. Like Chappatte, we still think they have a unique capacity to compact a complex idea into an instantaneous picture, as long as we respect the sentiments and diversity of the readers transforming each image into those thousand words.

Texto completo: Seven years ago, a handful of young music students, mostly from the Lehigh Valley area, got together for an ambitious program focusing on innovative instruction for string ensembles. The event was the Techne Music Festival, a five-day program offering master classes with world-renowned soloists, seminars and concerts, all free and open to the public.
The festival, which takes place at Moravian College in Bethlehem, began Wednesday and runs through Sunday, when it culminates in a free concert at Peter Hall. The concert will include works by Beethoven, Bartok, Dvorak and Mendelssohn performed by Techne faculty members, and close with Brahms' Piano Quintet in F Minor, Op. 34, featuring special guest faculty members Todd Phillips, concertmaster of the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra, and pianist Charles Abramovic, Head of Piano at Temple University.
This year's faculty includes violinist Timothy Schwarz, Techne founder and director, and violist Sheila Browne and cellist Lawrence Stomberg, both on the faculty of the University of Delaware. Schwarz, head of strings and assistant professor of violin and viola at Rowan University in Glassboro, New Jersey, was formerly an assistant professor at Kutztown University, where he conducted the Kutztown University Orchestra and taught violin and viola.
Of special interest to violinists this week will be a violin master class presented by Todd Phillips 2 p.m. Saturday at Peter Hall. In addition to being the concertmaster for Orpheus, Phillips is a founding member of the Orion String Quartet and professor at the Manhattan School of Music.
Since making his solo debut with the Pittsburgh Symphony at the age of 13, Phillips has appeared with numerous orchestras throughout the United States, Europe and Japan. He made his Carnegie Hall debut in 1982 with the New York String Orchestra and conductor Alexander Schneider. Return engagements at Carnegie Hall soon followed, as well as solo performances in Avery Fisher Hall, Alice Tully Hall, the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., Boston Symphony Hall, and the Frankfurt Opera House.
Charles Abramovic has won critical acclaim for his international performances as a soloist, chamber musician, and collaborator with leading instrumentalists and singers. On the music faculty of Temple University since 1988, Abramovic made his solo orchestral debut at the age of 14, also with the Pittsburgh Symphony. Since then he has appeared as soloist with numerous orchestras, including the Baltimore Symphony, the Colorado Philharmonic, the Florida Philharmonic, and the Nebraska Chamber Orchestra. He has given solo recitals throughout the United States, France and Yugoslavia, and has appeared at major international music festivals.
Students who attend Techne come from top conservatories and music schools throughout the United States, including the Juilliard School, Eastman School of Music, Rowan University, Peabody Conservatory, University of Maryland, and Temple University. This year's enrollment also includes high school students from Moravian Academy, Exeter High School, North Pocono High School, and Parkland High School.
Techne Music Festival, Wednesday, June 12 through Sunday, June 16, Peter Hall, Moravian College, 1200 Main St., Bethlehem. Closing concert 3 p.m. Sunday, June 16, at Peter Hall. Admission to all events is free and open to the public. 215-880-5869, www.technemusic.com
Met Live in HD presents Gounod's 'Roméo et Juliette'
The Metropolitan Opera Summer Encore Series begins at Miller Symphony Hall in Allentown Wednesday, June 19 with "Roméo et Juliette," Charles Gounod's setting of Shakespeare's timeless tale of star-crossed lovers. The performance, originally simulcast Jan. 21, 2017, features Diana Damrau as Juliette, Vittorio Grigolo as Romeo, Virginie Verrez as Stéphano, Elliot Moadore as Mercutio, and Mikhail Petrenko as Friar Laurent. Gianandrea Noseda conducts.
During the Renaissance, Italy was a land of many small city-states in constant warfare with one another, but at the same time, it was the site of an astounding explosion of art and science. Shakespeare set his story in Renaissance Verona, a beautiful but dangerous world where poetry or violence might erupt at any moment. In the Met's production, Tony Award-winning director Bartlett Sher updates the action to the 18th century.
When Damrau and Grigolo starred opposite each other in "Manon" at the Met in 2015, the New York Times noted that "the temperature rises nearly to boiling every time Damrau and Grigolo are on stage together." Now they're back as opera's classic lovers in Gounod's lush Shakespeare adaptation, so that chemistry should sizzle once more.
Over the centuries, Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet" has inspired all kinds of adaptations, from songs and symphonic poems to ballets, Broadway musicals and film scores. When Gounod turned his attention to the star-crossed lovers in 1867, he'd already had a big hit with another adaptation - an opera based on Goethe's "Faust." For "Roméo et Juliette," he collaborated with the same librettists he worked with on the earlier opera - Jules Barbier and Michel Carre.
Gounod's version stays fairly close to Shakespeare's original play. A few scenes are cut (in addition to the oh-so-French ballet sequence) that don't deal directly with the two lovers, and the ending is a bit tweaked. In the play, when Juliet finally awakens in the tomb, Romeo already is dead. When she wakes up in the opera, Romeo still has a few flickers of life, enough for the two to sing a final duet before Juliet stabs herself and they die together.
The opera is sung in French with English supertitles.
Gounod's "Roméo et Juliette" Live in HD, 6:30 p.m. Wednesday, June 19, Miller Symphony Hall, 23 N. Sixth St., Allentown. Tickets: $18 adults, $16 seniors, $10 students. 610-432-6715, www.millersympnonyhall.org
Beacon Hill to present Stile Antico
The beautiful, privately owned property of Dan Crawford and his wife, Sidnie, nestled in the rolling hills near Stroudsburg, has for the past 12 years provided a wonderful venue for guests to hear high-quality classical music at a time when many local ensembles have taken the summer off.
Now in its 12th season, the Beacon Hill Concert Series is a summer series of free concerts that takes place in the Crawfords' intimate concert hall, holding a maximum of 75 people, with acoustics ideal for musical performance. On Sunday, June 16, Beacon Hill welcomes one of Europe's outstanding vocal ensembles, the 12-member Stile Antico.
Based in London, the group has toured regularly in North America, and on this tour it will be coming to Beacon Hill directly from a performance at the Boston Early Music Festival. These young singers have appeared in all the major venues and festivals in Europe. They recently released their 13th recording, "In a Sorry Land," on the Harmonia Mundi label.
The program, "Queen of Muses," will treat the audience to a selection of English compositions from the court of Elizabeth I, who was the most significant patron of music in British history. We'll hear motets and madrigals from all the great composers of this time, some of whom were suitors of the queen, some whom Elizabeth favored with court appointments (a group that includes William Byrd, Thomas Tallis, and the Italian Alfonso Ferrabosco), and some who were not so favored (such as John Dowland). This is a rare opportunity to hear a world-class ensemble in an ideal, intimate setting.
Stile Antico, 4 p.m. Sunday, June 16, 464 Beacon Hill Road, Stroudsburg. Admission: free, suggested donation $15 adult, $20 senior, $10 student. Guests are advised to reserve seats by calling 570-476-1308, or email Dan Crawford at dcrawford1@unl.edu. More info: http://www.beaconhill

Texto completo: Clare Bronfman, heredera del imperio licorero Seagram’s, aportó más de $14 millones de dólares para financiar la defensa de los acusados, incluyendo ella misma, el líder Keith Raniere y la actriz Allison Mack, en el caso de la secta sexual Nxivm, señalada de tráfico y esclavitud en las afueras de Albany, capital de Nueva York.
Todos los acusados, excepto Raniere (58), se han declarado culpables y están a la espera de la sentencia, en libertad bajo fianza.
Richard Guerci, testigo de la fiscalía y experto del IRS, declaró ayer que Bronfman había depositado más de $14.3 millones de dólares en un fideicomiso irrevocable para cubrir facturas legales para ella y otros acusados , informó New York Post.
La semana pasada, el fiscal Mark Lesko dijo al tribunal que la suma no se había depositado de una vez, sino en seis o siete pagos, sin detallar las cantidades.
Bronfman (40) era considerada la directora de operaciones de la organización Nxvim, junto con su fundador, Raniere, y Mack, actriz de la serie de televisión “Smallville”.
La heredera neoyorquina se declaró culpable en abril de conspiración para ocultar y albergar a un extranjero ilegal con fines de lucro, entre otros cargos.
Guerci reveló que el fideicomiso tuvo otro donante además de Bronfman: Jack Levy, también antiguo miembro de alto rango de Nxivm, donó $1,030 dólares.
Raniere ha negado todos los cargos presentados contra él. Está acusado de dirigir un grupo secreto de esclavas que fueron maltratadas, expuestas a torturas, hambre y tener sexo sólo con él.
Según los fiscales, en 2015 Raniere formó una sociedad secreta dentro de Nxivm llamada “DOS”, acrónimo en latín para “Amo de las compañeras obedientes”, donde él era el único hombre y líder. La secta operaba con los rangos de “maestros” y “esclavas”.
Todo salió a la luz cuando una “esclava” desertó en 2017 y la historia fue reseñada por The New York Times. Raniere huyó del país poco después de esa publicación.
Hoy es el único de los acusados que se mantiene detenido , tras ser arrestado en México y deportado a Nueva York en marzo de 2018. Enfrenta un mínimo de 15 años de prisión y un máximo de cadena perpetua.

Democrats to Question State Dept. Official Today on Arms Sales

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Congressional Democrats are examining whether a former arms-industry lobbyist serving as a midlevel State Department official played a role in the Trump administration's decision last month to sell weapons to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates without seeking legislative approval, lawmakers and current and former government officials said.
A House committee plans to question a senior State Department official on Wednesday over the sales, and in particular over the role of Charles Faulkner, who worked until recently in the department's legislative affairs bureau, congressional aides said. Before joining the State Department, Mr. Faulkner worked for four years for a firm in Washington that lobbied for Raytheon Company, whose precision-guided bombs are a significant part of the arms packages to the gulf and had been blocked by Democratic lawmakers.
Lawmakers from both parties are still furious at the decision by President Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in late May to use a loophole in legislation to push through more than $ 8 billion worth of weapons sales, almost all to the gulf nations. The two countries are leading an air war against rebels in Yemen that has resulted in a humanitarian disaster and thousands of civilian deaths, many of them children.
Lawmakers from both parties are also reviewing ways to block the arms sales, much of which they had held up since last year.
The sales proposal includes a provision allowing Raytheon to join with the Saudis to build high-tech parts of the precision-guided bombs in Saudi Arabia, giving the Saudis access to closely guarded American technology, The New York Times reported last week.
"I want to hear from the State Department official tomorrow: Who all was involved in this decision making?" said Representative Ted Lieu, Democrat of California, who sits on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, which scheduled the Wednesday hearing. "It would be problematic if a former lobbyist for a defense contractor was involved."
Mr. Faulkner declined to comment on Tuesday and referred questions to the State Department. No lawmaker has presented any evidence against Mr. Faulkner.
The Trump administration's unwavering support of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates despite their human rights records has resulted in the biggest foreign policy rift yet between the administration and Congress.
In April, Mr. Trump vetoed a bipartisan congressional resolution that would have forced an end to American support for the gulf-led coalition in the Yemen war. The president's top foreign policy advisers have all encouraged continuing support for the war, and Mr. Pompeo and Mr. Trump have made the final decisions on arms sales to the gulf.
This spring, Mr. Pompeo told State Department officials to find a way to push through the arms sales, officials said. Mr. Trump has spoken publicly of the importance of weapons sales to the Saudis.
Midlevel government officials like Mr. Faulkner advise on legal and practical mechanisms to support policy. Critics say Mr. Faulkner's involvement in the process adds to questions about corporate and lobbying interests that have taken root in the administration despite Mr. Trump's campaign promise to "drain the swamp."
"I'm generally concerned about all the defense industry people who go in and out of government," said Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut. "The revolving door is a big part of the reason we spend a lot of money on military sales that we don't need to."
One person familiar with the discussions in the State Department over the arms sales said that the decisions are made at the highest levels, and that it was "ridiculous" to suggest that a midlevel official pushed Mr. Pompeo to act.
On Tuesday afternoon, the State Department released excerpts from the opening statement to be delivered to the House hearing on Wednesday by R. Clarke Cooper, who was confirmed in April by the Senate as assistant secretary of political-military affairs.
"These sales and the associated emergency certification are intended to address the military need of our partners in the face of an urgent regional threat posed by Iran, promote the vitality of our bilateral relationships by reassuring our partners, and preserve strategic advantage against near-peer competitors," Mr. Cooper plans to say. The mention of competitors is a reference to China and Russia, both large arms sellers.
Mr. Faulkner, who remains employed by the State Department, played a prominent advisory role in the fall when Mr. Pompeo told Congress that Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates were doing enough to minimize civilian casualties in the Yemen war, the officials said.
At the time, Mr. Faulkner was the acting assistant secretary of the legislative affairs bureau, which recommended that Mr. Pompeo go through with the certification even though all offices in the State Department with expertise on the issues opposed it, current and former officials said.
Congress had required the certification from Mr. Pompeo because of rising outrage from Republican and Democratic lawmakers over the American role in the Yemen war. Outrage over the killing of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents also contributed to Congress's continuing to block the sale of arms packages. Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, the top Democrat on the Foreign Affairs Committee, blocked the sale of more than 120,000 Raytheon precision-guided bombs for Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates last year, a package worth $ 2 billion.
Then on May 24, Mr. Pompeo announced that because of what the administration deemed an "emergency" over Iran, the United States would move forward with the arms sales. Both Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are rivals of Iran, though the countries are not at war. The move angered lawmakers, some of whom pointed out that many of the munitions would not even be produced for years, so the emergency appeared to be nothing more than a pretext to justify sales.
[Read the memo here.]
Pressed by reporters on Tuesday, the acting defense secretary Patrick Shanahan offered a mixed response to the move, noting that the decision to declare an emergency was needed to be "responsive in this high-threat environment."
"If they don't buy from the U.S., of which we're a very strong partner, then they for security reasons need to go to either China or Russia," Mr. Shanahan said. But asked whether he supported the decision to sell the munitions by circumventing Congress, Mr. Shanahan responded, "My preference is always to follow the process."
Legislators are now asking whether Mr. Faulkner helped guide Mr. Pompeo to the emergency loophole in the Arms Export Control Act. The act has a provision that allows the president to bypass congressional review of arms sales if he or she deems "an emergency exists that requires the proposed sale in the national security interest of the United States."
Mr. Faulkner worked under Mary Elizabeth Taylor, the assistant secretary for legislative affairs, and in theory, she would have also weighed in on the decision to use the emergency declaration. Ms. Taylor worked on legislative affairs at the White House and for the office of Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican majority leader. Mr. Faulkner left his job on May 10, two weeks before Mr. Pompeo made the announcement.
On Wednesday, legislators plan to ask Mr. Cooper whether Mr. Faulkner and Ms. Taylor helped push through the arms sales. On May 24, Mr. Cooper told members of Congress and aides in a phone call about the decision by Mr. Trump and Mr. Pompeo. At the time, people on the call asked Mr. Cooper about Mr. Faulkner's involvement, and Mr. Cooper responded by saying he did not know anything about that.
That initial scrutiny of Mr. Faulkner was first reported by The Times. Last week, The Wall Street Journal reported that the State Department had forced Mr. Faulkner to leave his job in early May. Mr. Faulkner's name first became publicly linked to the general arms sale policy when The Intercept reported in September on his role in the certification process.
After that appearance of his name, Mr. Faulkner spoke with ethics officials in the department about whether there was a conflict of interest, said people with knowledge of the matter.
Mr. Faulkner joined the State Department in June 2017, according to his LinkedIn page. From 2012 to 2016, he worked for BGR Group, a lobbying firm that represented Raytheon.

Texto completo: The benefits of diversity are seemingly everywhere in California. We celebrate different lifestyles, religions, cultures, music, languages, cuisine and geography. The value of diversity can be seen in other ways, too, practical ones such as the popularity of mutual fund investments, eating a balanced diet or making sure an NFL team has a playbook with multiple options.
Everywhere one looks, we see the value of diversifying. If all your eggs are in one basket, you are more vulnerable should something happen to your basket. Diversifying makes obvious sense.
While California needs to harness its sun, wind and water to make us more energy independent, some people are blindly trying to make California 100 percent electric.
Certainly, most people want to continue expanding energy sources that are earth-friendly. But wearing electricity-only blinders is misguided on numerous levels.
Whether transitioning to electric vehicles or “de-carbonizing” buildings, the importance of a multipronged approach to renewable energy has gotten lost or ignored – even energy sources that are renewable, sustainable, and help the environment.
First, relying on a single source of energy is a dangerous proposition. The last time California regulators tried to micromanage the energy market was two decades ago when the state was gripped by a massive energy crisis that brought electrical shortages and skyrocketing consumers prices. Rolling blackouts threw hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses into darkness and zero power.
Second, consider that our electrical grid is computer based. Hackers – inside the U.S. or around the world – pose a serious threat.
Last summer, the New York Times reported that “State-sponsored Russian hackers appear far more interested this year in demonstrating that they can disrupt the American electric utility grid than the midterm elections, according to United States intelligence officials and technology company executives.”
Third, a shift toward a 100-percent electrical society reneges on the promise of building a vibrant and innovative California. There have been incredible innovations involving many different types of energy sources that are already helping California meet its carbon-reduction goals.
Major developments are taking place in the natural gas and propane industries, which has the flexibility to meet the needs of rural Californians. A growing number of California dairy farmers are converting methane into renewable natural gas, which would help California meet its carbon-reduction goals.
An electricity mandate would kill all of these advances.
Fourth, even if demand for electricity explodes, can California realistically provide enough renewable electricity? For the foreseeable future, the answer is no. And according to the Los Angeles Times, new demand will “tax a system already fragile, unstable and increasingly vulnerable to outside forces.”
Fifth, other sources of energy are simply better for the environment and our California lifestyle. Home and professional chefs prefer cooking with gas – as do consumers who grill with propane. Electricity is not exactly portable. How will restaurants and homeowners conveniently provide outdoor heating without tripping over dozens of extension cords?
Consumers also are vehemently opposed to being stripped of energy choice. By a margin of 5 to 1, Californians prefer natural gas for home heating and cooking. And 80 percent of voters oppose laws that would take away their natural gas appliances.
While most people like and appreciate electricity, they cannot and should not have to imagine a world with only one source of energy. Like everything else, energy diversity needs to be celebrated and promoted as a key to a clean and green future.

Over 180 CEOs sign letter against abortion restrictions

Texto completo: More than 180 CEOs signed an open letter opposing state efforts to restrict reproductive rights, as business leaders weigh how to most effectively exert pressure on abortion bans.
Square Chief Executive and Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey as well as fashion icon Diane von Furstenberg and others wrote that restrictions on abortion access threatens the economic stability of their employees and customers, and makes it harder to build a diverse workforce and recruit talent.
The letter, which appeared Monday as a full-page ad in The New York Times, marks the business community's latest foray into a polarizing societal issue. The chief executives of Bloomberg News, Atlantic Records, Yelp and Warby Parker, among others, aligned themselves with such national organizations as Planned Parenthood, NARAL Pro-Choice America, the American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Reproductive Rights.
The move also comes nearly four weeks after Alabama signed off on the nation's most restrictive abortion law. Other states, including Georgia, have adopted similar laws.
"As anti-choice politicians are escalating attacks on these fundamental freedoms, we encourage the entire business community to join us in protecting access to reproductive health care in the critical months and years to come," Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, said in a statement.
Georgia's law, signed last month by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, bans abortion once a fetal heartbeat can be detected, which typically occurs near the six-week mark and before many women even know they are pregnant. Alabama banned virtually all abortions in the state - including for victims of rape and incest.
Several industries have moved to exert pressure on states that limit access to abortion. Some of the biggest names in Hollywood, including Walt Disney and WarnerMedia, have suggested that they might pull their business from Georgia if its new law survives a court challenge. Filmmaking is a $9.5 billion industry in Georgia that created more than 92,000 jobs last year, according to a McKinsey study.
But even among the law's staunch objectors, there isn't a clear consensus on how companies should respond. Stacey Abrams, who narrowly lost Georgia's gubernatorial race last year, is urging Hollywood to keep its business in the state, saying a boycott would only strip working-class people of their jobs with no guarantee it would reverse the new law.
Instead, Abrams and other business leaders are launching a "#StayAndFight" campaign encouraging Hollywood powerhouses to put their money behind political groups challenging the state's law. Film industry workers are also organizing against any potential boycott and are raising money for a challenge to the law by the ACLU.
Businesses that threaten to take their business elsewhere often have the sharpest influence, said Timothy Coombs, a corporate communications expert at Texas A&M University. There may be an initial debate about leaving a country or state altogether, or trying to "change the system from the inside."
Coombs cited companies that cut ties with Indiana over a 2015 law, signed by then-Gov. Mike Pence, that could have made it easier for religious conservatives to deny service to gay couples. At the time, Marc Benioff, the chief executive of Salesforce.com, said he would cancel all company events in the state. Jeremy Stoppelman, the founder of Yelp, said that "it is unconscionable to imagine that Yelp would create, maintain, or expand a significant business presence in any state that encouraged discrimination."
"To say, 'Oh, we're going to stay and engage,' that's usually pretty hollow," Coombs said. "To say, 'OK, we're going to boycott,' companies need to know that most of their stakeholders are going to support that position."

Texto completo: VIRGINIA BEACH - Kate Nixon had considered taking a gun to work on May 31, the day a co-worker killed her and 11 others in the country's deadliest mass shooting this year, a family attorney said on a radio show Monday.
The public utilities engineer was concerned about DeWayne Craddock "as well as one other person," said Kevin Martingayle, an attorney working with Nixon's family. So on the night of May 30, Nixon had discussed with her husband, Jason, "whether or not she should take a pistol and hide it in her handbag," Martingayle said. She decided against it because of a city policy that prevents employees from bringing weapons to work.
The next day, Craddock, who had worked as a city public utilities engineer for nine years, used a .45-caliber handgun with a legally purchased silencer to fire at colleagues in Building 2 of the city's Municipal Center in Princess Anne.
On Monday, Martingayle revealed the detail about Nixon's worries on WHRV's "HearSay with Cathy Lewis" radio show.
"The night before it happened they had that discussion," he said on the show. "There was obviously something big going on."
Martingayle told Lewis that he didn't have any more details about Kate Nixon's comments.
Julie Hill, a city spokeswoman, said she was not aware of Nixon's concerns. Hill stressed that police are investigating all aspects of the shooting, including the information Martingayle has shared.
"We are going to make sure that we cover everything that is a part of that ongoing investigation," she said.
The New York Times has reported that Craddock had recently begun acting strangely and got into physical "scuffles" with other city workers, including a "violent altercation on city grounds" in the week before the shooting. The Times also has reported he had been told that disciplinary action would be taken.
The Pilot has heard conflicting reports of such scuffles when interviewing city employees, and three said the information was inaccurate.
City Manager Dave Hansen has disputed the report, saying the gunman's job performance was "satisfactory" and that he was not facing any ongoing disciplinary action or forced to resign.
Martingayle was on the radio show Monday to re-emphasize the Nixon family's push for an external investigation into the shooting. Kate Nixon had worked for the city for 10 years.
"Clearly (family members) want answers, and as many answers as they can get," he told Lewis.
A week ago, Martingayle emailed city officials a letter on behalf of Kate Nixon's family, requesting that the city release all records about the gunman and launch an external investigation into what happened. The attorney compared such a review to a comprehensive report that followed the 2017 Charlottesville riots and said on the radio show that he'd love to see the same people take the helm.
If the city doesn't ask for an outside investigation, Martingayle added, "I'm hoping the attorney general will take it on himself and just do it."
A spokesman for Attorney General Mark Herring declined to comment.
In a statement emailed to The Pilot last week, Hill said: "These requests appear premature while the criminal investigation is ongoing."
Martingayle told The Pilot that releasing many of these records would be discretionary under Virginia's Freedom of Information Act, but "the only obvious person with a privacy interest would be the shooter himself."
"In a situation like this, the maximum level of transparency possible is appropriate," he added.
Martingayle told Lewis that he doesn't plan to take the issue to court, in part because he doesn't see "a path to the courtroom" due to sovereign immunity that protects municipalities from claims of legal wrongdoing.

Texto completo: There were significant changes at Vice Media on Monday as the company -- which was once operated more like a frat party than a business -- takes shape under new leadership.
First came the news that HBO was canceling the nightly program "Vice News Tonight" and that the executive who oversaw the show, Josh Tyrangiel, would be leaving the company.
Vice Media quickly followed that report, which appeared in The Hollywood Reporter, with an announcement that Jesse Angelo, the former publisher of The New York Post, would become the company's president of global news and entertainment.
The changes occurred on the watch of Nancy Dubuc, a former head of the A&E cable network who joined Vice Media as chief executive last year and has been charged with the task of stanching the flow of red ink at the company.
"Vice News Tonight" was the first show of its kind on HBO -- a daily news program aimed at a younger audience -- but it had trouble breaking through the din, averaging a little more than 550,000 viewers a day. Its cancellation by HBO, which last year dropped "Vice," a weekly newsmagazine, effectively ends the relationship between the premium cable network and the upstart media brand.
"We've decided not to renew 'Vice News Tonight' after this season," HBO's executive vice president of programming, Nina Rosenstein, said. "We've had a terrific seven years partnering with Vice Media, first with the weekly newsmagazine series and most recently with the nightly news show."
Mr. Tyrangiel was the editor of Bloomberg Businessweek for six years before he jumped to Vice in 2015. "It's been nearly four incredible years of harrowing challenges and huge highs," he said in an email to the Vice Media staff.
Started as a freebie 'zine in Montreal in 1994, Vice Media has grown into a major entity with roughly 3,000 employees, the Viceland cable network, a digital outlet and a film-production company. Mr. Tyrangiel helped make it a player in news.
In addition to her efforts to turn around the company's finances, Ms. Dubuc has worked to change a corporate culture once rife with sexual misconduct. A New York Times investigation in 2017 detailed the mistreatment of women at the company and found four settlements involving allegations of sexual harassment or defamation against Vice employees.
Mr. Angelo, the executive who is scheduled to start at Vice Media this month, left The Post in January after working for two decades in various roles at the tabloid, which is part of Rupert Murdoch's shrinking media empire. He departed soon after Mr. Murdoch's younger son, James, left the family fold.
The Murdoch company, 21st Century Fox, owned a piece of Vice Media for a time; James Murdoch is still on the Vice board as an independent member. He and Mr. Angelo have known each other since they were children, and Mr. Angelo was the best man at his wedding.
The younger Murdoch stepped down as a chief executive of 21st Century Fox after the family sold most of its assets to the Walt Disney Company for more than $ 70 billion. The Fox stake in Vice went to Disney as part of that deal, giving Disney 27 percent of the company.
"With him joining our executive team, Vice's strategic growth plan for news will begin and complement wider partnership opportunities already underway," Ms. Dubuc said of Mr. Angelo in a statement.
A Vice Media spokeswoman disputed the relevance of any connection between Mr. Angelo and Mr. Murdoch. "Nancy made the decision to hire Jesse 100 percent," the spokeswoman said. "Our board was not involved in the decision."
In a statement of his own, Mr. Angelo said, "The quality and impact of Vice News, Viceland and our digital channels are unparalleled, as are the people."
Vice Media recently laid off 10 percent of its staff, placed several of its websites under the Vice.com umbrella and took on $ 250 million in debt financing from several investors, including the billionaire George Soros. Disney said in a filing this year that it had taken a $ 353 million write-down on its stake in the company. Disney had previously written off $ 157 million.
But there are signs of expansion under Ms. Dubuc. Last week, the company announced a new executive managing editor of its website and said it planned to hire roughly a dozen more journalists.

Dems, please don't try to impeach Trump

Texto completo: Many pundits have this unfortunate habit of framing what they want as what the American people want. I've been guilty of this at times. After all, what is more gratifying than the idea that the American masses are marching behind your band?
Similarly, some left-leaning writers are insisting that the great majority of Democrats wants President Donald Trump impeached. And they have inconclusive polls to back their position.
Thus, we have Michelle Goldberg at The New York Times saying that, on the basis of a CNN poll, 76 percent of Democratic voters back impeachment. As she herself concedes, the poll's question did not differentiate between wanting an impeachment inquiry and an impeachment proceeding. One looks for information. The other attempts an ouster. The Republican Senate won't let the latter happen. So Trump wouldn't face eviction while being given the opportunity to play victim in a partisan struggle.
When the Trump camp "leaks" that the president fears impeachment -- and when he calls impeachment a "dirty, filthy, disgusting word" -- do you take them at face value? This is Trump talk for "Democrats, please impeach me. I need your help in the tough election ahead."
Actually, only about a quarter of Democratic House members say they favor impeachment, according to Politico. Of the five House members Goldberg quotes as moving in that direction, all five spoke of an inquiry, not a proceeding.
It's hard for those who spend their days in the liberal bosom of super-safe Democratic districts to understand this: Many of the voters who replaced Republican representatives with Democrats last November do not like Trump but also do not obsess on him as you do.
These are the voters who gave Democrats control of the House. Love you, AOC, but any candidate with a D after his or her name would have won your district.
Town hall meetings are fine events, but who turns up at them? Activists, for sure. Not in attendance are working adults preferring to relax at home in their bathrobes. Nor probably are faithful registered Democrats trying to juggle three kids and four jobs.
This disconnect with ordinary Democratic voters is seen in the surprise lead of "boring" Joe Biden in the polls. This wasn't supposed to happen, according to the passions that dominate liberal Twitter. A follower of those feeds myself, I was surprised by the outpouring of support for the seemingly centrist Biden. These things happen when Democratic voters are simply asked their opinion without having to show up at a rally.
The "no one is above the law" argument is compelling. Trouble is, the great majority of the electorate is well aware that Trump is a tax cheat, habitual liar, nasty creep and trampler of democratic norms. The sad part is that many of his supporters don't care or rationalize away his relentless attacks on our revered institutions.
They may believe the strong economy is entirely Trump's doing and worth the damage. They may dislike the racial insults but think he's seriously addressing illegal immigration, which, until Trump calls for national use of E-Verify, he's not. The idea that the additional information collected in an impeachment process would change lots of minds seems awfully naive.
And what happens to the Democrats' agenda if impeachment becomes the national obsession? Pro-impeachers say they can push legislation at the same time. They can push, but the media won't report -- not in the midst of an impeachment frenzy.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi understands these dynamics and is obviously trying to run out the clock on impeachment fervor as the 2020 election draws closer. The goal, after all, should be replacing Trump. Savvy Democrats will give impeachment a pass and go for the prize.

Even violent inmates get out. Here’s why Utah’s Sen. Mike Lee and others think they should have access to college courses in prison.

Texto completo: Matthew Holman was still locked up at the Utah State Prison when he finished his associate degree. He received his certificate at a small outdoor ceremony, where he got to share a beautiful summer day with his family.
It was a treat, but he didn’t think much of the accomplishment. He had bigger plans that started with finishing his bachelor’s degree within the next year. But then, the funding for the Utah State University program was cut.
This was more than a decade ago, a move that put his education on hold until he was released from prison in 2017 after being incarcerated for 15 years.
He quickly enrolled at the University of Utah, and, last month, donned a cap and gown and accepted his bachelor’s degree.
It was a moment that represented a long journey for Holman, from committing violent crimes while still a college student to spending years in prison to a second chance at life.
“It was awesome,” he said of his graduation ceremony. “It felt incredible.”
It’s an opportunity that state and federal officials hope to bring to tens of thousands of incarcerated people, though it will likely take an act of Congress. Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, is pushing a bill that once again would make prisoners eligible for federal financial aid.
Lee says that even those who commit heinous crimes have the potential to be rehabilitated — and they’ll have better outcomes if they are allowed to learn and acquire new skills.
“Nearly all prisoners at some point will walk free,” he told The Salt Lake Tribune. “And so we have to ask the question: Do we want them to succeed and become law-abiding citizens? Or do we want them to reoffend?”
Convicted
Holman was in his third semester at Brigham Young University in 2000 when he invited a 17-year old freshman to his parents’ house for dinner and a movie. When she arrived, no one but Holman was there. He raped her.
Holman took a plea deal, admitting to forcible sexual abuse and attempted rape. BYU expelled him and banned him from ever returning.
“I felt like I was in control for a moment, like I was in control over someone else like I’m not in control of myself,” Holman said in a videotaped statement to Orem police, according to a Provo Daily Herald story.
Utah County Deputy Attorney David Sturgill told the judge, "Those are the words of a true rapist.”
Holman apologized before being sentenced to a term of up to 15 years in prison.
Shortly after that he was also convicted of robbing a bank.
There wasn’t much to do when he first got to prison, Holman recalled, but he thought he wouldn’t be there that long. He was shocked when he got word months later that his first parole hearing wouldn’t be for six years.
He found out about the college program, and though he hadn’t been a great student, he thought he’d give it a try.
“I wanted to go do that in a sense to make up for some of the mistakes in my life,” he said. “I can’t make up for all of them, but I can make up for a number of them.”
Being a college student behind bars was different than his experience at BYU. His classroom was just down the hall from his cell. He didn’t have access to the internet. But he was learning, challenging himself in ways he hadn’t when he was at a traditional university setting.
“It allowed me to prove to myself that I wasn’t a failure in all things,” Holman said.
And he noticed the prisoners around him were learning, too.
There were some who hadn’t picked up a book in years who had started reading work from philosophers and changing their worldview. Others were older inmates taking their first college courses after getting their high school diploma behind bars.
Getting an education, Holman said, helped him and other inmates realize they could do more once they got out. They didn’t have to get jobs doing menial labor. They could dream bigger.
“You made mistakes and you’ve hurt people,” Holman said. “And you can’t ever make up for the people directly that you’ve hurt. But you can positively affect other people’s lives in other ways. And I think that education gives people the power and the ability to do that.”
‘Not simply warehousing offenders’
Opportunities for people to get an education while incarcerated have dwindled. The program that allowed Holman to earn his degree at the Draper prison was cut in 2007. And years before that, prisoners lost their access to Pell Grants after President Bill Clinton in 1994 signed a sweeping “tough-on-crime” bill that among other things banned incarcerated persons from getting federal aid for college.
In recent years, there’s been a rethinking, pushed by Democrats, such as former President Barack Obama, and Republicans, like Utah’s Mike Lee. So far, the government has tried a pilot program offering Pell Grants to a limited number of inmates in a limited number of locations.
Lee has co-sponsored the REAL Act, a bill that would restore Pell Grant eligibility for inmates nationwide. Lee said the goal is to give inmates more opportunities when they are released.
The Utah senator said he hopes to get the support of the Trump administration. Betsy DeVos, the secretary of education, told The New York Times last year that she felt reinstating Pell Grants for inmates is “a very good and interesting possibility.”
The bill is a follow-up to the First Step Act, sweeping legislation passed last year that overhauled the federal sentencing system to lower mandatory minimum sentences for drug crimes, expand job training and boost early-release opportunities.
“The REAL Act provides another way to ensure we are not simply warehousing offenders,” Lee said, “and we’re providing a meaningful opportunity for rehabilitation.”
Locally, the University of Utah Prison Education Project had been working to bring college-level courses back to the prison. Inmates can earn their associate degree through Salt Lake Community College, according to U. professor Erin Castro, but there’s no way for inmates to earn a bachelor’s degree.
Volunteers teach two courses at the Draper prison, but they are not for credit. Castro says they don’t have the funding to cover tuition for the students — and the students themselves can’t pay for the coursework while incarcerated.
“If we were to go inside right now and say we’ll serve those who can pay right now, that’s going to be a very small sliver of people who are pretty privileged,” she said. “That is not aligned with the mission of what we do.”
To Castro, it’s not just about reducing recidivism rates — a common argument made to support prison education programs — but a way to help inmates learn to problem solve, to empower them in their lives and to help them get jobs where they are treated with respect and dignity.
A recent report from the Vera Institute of Justice estimates that 64% of the 1.5 million people in prison across the United States could be eligible for Pell Grant funding. The institute noted that people who receive post-secondary education behind bars are more likely to get jobs that pay more and are less likely to commit new crimes.
But an education can help change lives, and Holman said it’s changed his.
Just weeks outside of graduation, he’s already at work at a marketing job. He’s thinking of the future, of maybe going back to school for his master’s degree involving data and analytics — though he’s unsure that will be possible if the program doesn’t allow felons.
He’s been trying to volunteer where he can with the U.’s Prison Education Project, but that’s also limited because he can’t go back to the prison now.
Holman knows he’s not the most sympathetic advocate for prisoner education programs, but he sees value in their expansion and in legislation like that pushed by Lee. His degree is what gives him the most hope that he can make it outside of a prison cell.
“I can’t make up or undo the past,” he said. “But moving forward, I’m trying to positively influence lives. Not just to make up for it, but because that’s what I believe is right.”

Texto completo: No han pasado dos días desde que se llego a un acuerdo entre México y Estados Unidos para suspender la imposición de los aranceles a los productos mexicanos para que el presidente Donald Trump volviera a amenzar a López Obrador.
“Sin embargo, si por alguna razón desconocida no hay (cooperación por parte de México), siempre podemos volver a nuestra posición anterior, y muy lucrativa, de (amenazar con) Aranceles; pero no creo que eso vaya a ser necesario” , dijo Trump en Twitter al defender el acuerdo pero sin dejar sus amenazas contra el gobierno de AMLO.
En una serie de tuits, Trump defendió el pacto migratorio logrado este viernes con México, por el que él accedió a suspender los aranceles que planeaba imponer a todas las importaciones mexicanas, después de que el diario The New York Times afirmara que algunos puntos se acordaron hace meses.
“Antes, México no estaba cooperando en la frontera, y ahora tengo una confianza completa, especialmente después de hablar ayer con su presidente (Andrés Manuel López Obrador), en que cooperarán mucho y en que quieren hacer bien el trabajo”, escribió Trump.
El mandatario aseguró que “se acordaron algunas cosas que no se anunciaron en el comunicado” del viernes, “una en particular”, y que eso “se anunciará en el momento adecuado”.
La Casa Blanca no dio más detalles sobre cuál podría ser ese acuerdo inédito, y el secretario en funciones de seguridad nacional, Kevin McAleenan, se limitó a recordar que, como se anunció el viernes, está previsto que siga habiendo negociaciones durante los próximos 90 días.
“Hay un mecanismo para asegurarnos de que ellos (México) hacen lo que prometieron hacer, de que hay un resultado y vemos una reducción grande en los números” de inmigrantes que llegan a EEUU, dijo este domingo McAleenan a la cadena de televisión Fox News.
La embajadora de México en Estados Unidos, Martha Bárcena, precisó después que las conversaciones entre los equipos técnicos continuarán “casi semanalmente”, por lo que en el plazo de 90 días podría haber nuevos anuncios.
“(Lo anunciado el viernes) es una declaración conjunta de principios, que nos da una base para la hoja de ruta que tenemos que seguir en los próximos meses en cuanto a migración” , explicó Bárcena en una entrevista con la cadena televisiva CBS News.
Bárcena apuntó que el objetivo es devolver las cifras de migrantes que llegan a EEUU a los niveles de 2018, y pronosticó que habrá “resultados en un plazo relativamente corto, de un mes o mes y medio”, gracias al despliegue de unos 6.000 efectivos de la Guardia Nacional de México en la frontera de ese país con Guatemala.
Pero la embajadora no confirmó que, como parte del acuerdo alcanzado el viernes, México haya “accedido a empezar inmediatamente a comprar grandes cantidades de productos agrícolas” a EE.UU., como aseguró Trump en un tuit este sábado.
“Estoy absolutamente segura de que el comercio en bienes agrícolas podría aumentar drásticamente en los próximos meses”, debido a la combinación de la suspensión de los aranceles y “la ratificación del (acuerdo comercial) T-MEC” en EE.UU., México y Canadá, subrayó Bárcena.
Su entrevistadora le pidió entonces aclarar si estaba hablando de un acuerdo paralelo logrado durante las negociaciones de esta semana, o si simplemente se refería a tendencias comerciales, y Bárcena respondió: “Estoy hablando sobre comercio”.
El pacto anunciado el viernes permitirá la ampliación a toda la frontera común de un programa que el Gobierno ha aplicado hasta ahora solo en tres puntos de entrada en la zona limítrofe, y que obliga a los solicitantes de asilo a esperar en el país vecino mientras se tramitan sus casos en territorio estadounidense.
Ese proceso puede durar meses o incluso años, y este año ya se ha enviado a México a 10,393 solicitantes de asilo en EEUU, según fuentes oficiales mexicanas.
La oposición demócrata ha criticado a Trump por usar la amenaza de aranceles para extraer compromisos de México sobre inmigración, y dos aspirantes presidenciales, Bernie Sanders y Beto O’Rourke, arremetieron este domingo contra el mandatario por su aviso de que, si no hay avances migratorios, volverá a amenazar con aranceles.
“Necesitamos una relación decente con México. Son nuestros aliados, como Canadá. No deberíamos estar enfrentándonos a ellos cada día”, dijo Sanders a la cadena CNN.

Texto completo: Broadway Notes
A year ago, Kendal Hartse was getting her disco groove on in "Summer: The Donna Summer Musical" at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre on Broadway.
This year, the Shadle Park High School graduate is getting ready to head out on the road, kicking off the first national tour of the "The Band's Visit," winner of the Tony Award for best musical (and nine other categories) in 2018.
Written by David Yazbek and Itamar Moses, and based on the 2007 film of the same name, "The Band's Visit" tells the story of an Egyptian police band that is hired to play a concert in Israel. A mixup at the border finds them in a remote Israeli desert village where there is no hotel and no bus until morning. The result, wrote Ben Brantely in the New York Times, reviewing the Off-Broadway production, is a "beautiful" musical that is "slyly seductive" with an "exquisitely wrought" score.
Hartse, who also acted in the 2013 Broadway revival of "Cinderella" and 2011's "On a Clear Day You Can See Forever," will play Iris, a villager trapped in an unhappy marriage.
"I'm so excited. It's such a beautiful, beautiful show," Hartse said in April, over coffee in Bryant Park in midtown Manhattan.
This will mark her third national tour, following stints in "Cabaret" and "Cats." While touring can be difficult, she said, it can be thrilling as well.
"The different audiences, there's that. And traveling is so fun," she said. "It's so fun. You get to see the country, and you get to go to places you wouldn't maybe go, you get to go to places you maybe always wanted to go. ... And I like the variety of it."
"The Band's Visit" tour begins June 25 in Providence, R.I., and will visit more than 30 cities on its first leg. The closest she'll be to her home town is San Francisco, in May 2020.
Leading the cast are Israeli screen actor Sasson Gabay, reprising his role as the bandleader Tewfiq Zakaria from the 2007 film and the Broadway run, Chilina Kennedy ("Beautiful: The Carole King Musical") as Dina, who owns the village cafe, and three other veterans of the Broadway cast, Joe Joseph as Haled, Pomme Koch as Itzik, and James Rana as Simon.
'Jagged Little' Kumangai
It's official: Max Kumangai will be returning to "Jagged Little Pill" when the new musical opens on Broadway later this year.
Inspired by on the iconic 1995 album by Alanis Morissette, "Jagged Little Pill" is not a typical jukebox musical. It tells the story of a suburban family coming to terms with race and identity, infidelity, addiction and a host of modern troubles.
With music by Morissette, a book by Diablo Cody and directed by Diane Paulus, "Jagged Little Pill" will open at the Broadhurst Theatre for previews on Nov. 3, with an official opening on Dec. 5. The top-billed cast includes Elizabeth Stanley ("On the Town"), Kathryn Gallagher ("Spring Awakening"), Celia Rose Gooding, Derek Klena ("Anastasia"), Sean Allan Krill ("Honeymoon in Vegas"), and Lauren Patten ("Fun Home"), all reprising their roles last year's world premiere at American Repertory Theatre in Cambridge, MA.
Kumangai, a North Central High School graduate, was in the cast for the musical's world premiere last year. He will be reprising his role in the show's ensemble.
Kumangai has been involved with Paulus' other Broadway show, "Waitress," since it opened in 2016, except for his time with the "Jagged" run in 2018. He calls Paulus his hero, telling The Spokesman-Review in April, "She has opened so many doors for me, and challenged me as an actor and I owe my career to her. She is amazing."
The good feelings, it seems, are mutual. In an email, Paulus called herself a "super fan" of Kumangai.
"Max is one of the most creative and generous souls I have ever worked with," the Tony-winning director said. "He is a dream member of any company - he brings out the best in everyone."
Little comes home a winner
Coeur d'Alene's Laura Little took home a Drama Desk award on June 2 for "All Is Calm: The Christmas Truce of 1914," a show she produced Off-Broadway last year with Theater Latté Da at the Sheen Center in Manhattan.
The show won in the category of "unique theatrical experience." "All Is Calm," which was staged in Coeur d'Alene in 2014 and Spokane in 2015 and '16, is short and sweet. It tells the story of the famed 1914 truce during World War I through letters from soldiers, holiday songs and hymns.
Accolades for Caruso
Sophia Anne Caruso, the Spokane-born actress now playing Lydia in the new Broadway musical "Beetlejuice," was among the 12 performers honored with a Theatre World Award, given to "outstanding" performers making their Broadway or Off-Broadway debuts. The award was presented on Monday by her "Beetlejuice" co-star Rob McClure, who won the same award in 2013 for his work as Charlie Chaplin in "Chaplin."
(Other winners include Gbenga Akinnagbe, who is playing Tom Robinson in "To Kill a Mockingbird," veteran TV and film actor Paddy Considine for "The Ferryman" and Phoebe Waller-Bridge for her Off-Broadway production of "Fleabag.")
Caruso also was named one of 11 breakout theater stars last month by the magazine Paper, alongside Amber Gray of "Hadestown," Ali Stroker from the revival of "Oklahoma!" and Jeremy Pope from "Ain't to Proud to Beg," and "Choir Boy."
Meanwhile, a new video of Caruso singing Lydia's anthem "Dead Mom" from "Beetlejuice" dropped on YouTube on May 29, giving fans an early look at the recording of the show's original Broadway cast recording, which was released Friday from Ghostlight Records.
By the way, Caruso is expected to appear on the Tony Awards ceremony tonight, joining her fellow "Beetlejuice" actors in performing a number from the show. Beetlejuice is up for eight Tonys, including best musical and best actor for Alex Brightman.
Speaking of the Tonys ...
The ceremony, hosted by James Corden, will be aired at 8 p.m. today on CBS. In addition to Caruso, the ceremony will also include Patrick Page, the Spokane-born actor portraying Hades in "Hadestown." The musical is the most nominated of the season, and includes a nod to Page for best featured male performance in a musical.
Another Eastern Washington native also could make a splash at the Tony's the year.
As a high school student in Wenatchee, Heidi Schreck entered and frequently won American Legion speech contests about the U.S. Constitution. Her winnings helped pay her way through the University of Oregon. She turned that experience into a play, "What the Constitution Means to Me," which she wrote and now stars in at the Helen Hays Theater on Broadway. She is up for two Tony Awards, for best play and best leading actress in a play.

Texto completo: LONDON - Queen Elizabeth II marked her official birthday Saturday with the annual Trooping the Colours parade, a traditional display of British pageantry. About 1,400 soldiers in scarlet coats and bearskin hats marched past in a ceremony on Horse Guards Parade in Westminster.
Royals taking part included Prince Charles, Prince William and his wife, Kate, and Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan - who appeared in her first public outing since giving birth to their son, Archie, to watch the birthday flyby of military aircraft.
Baby Archie did not appear, but another young royal almost stole the queen's limelight when he made his debut on Buckingham Palace's balcony. Prince Louis, 1, the youngest child of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, waved frantically at the first sight of helicopters.
The queen marks her birthday twice a year - an official ceremony is always held in June, in hopes of holding the parade in good weather. Her actual birthday, April 21, is usually celebrated with close family only. She turned 93.
Thousands of spectators lined the parade ground and gathered in nearby St. James's park to watch the spectacle in sparkling sunshine. They then walked down the road leading to Buckingham Palace, gathering at the gates to honor the monarch ahead of the fly-past.
The queen waved and smiled as she emerged on the balcony and the crowd roared.
The ceremony originated from traditional preparations for battle. The colors - or flags - were "trooped," or carried down the lines of soldiers, so they could be seen and recognized in battle.
London police arrest 5 teens in alleged attack of women on bus
LONDON- Five teen boys were under arrest Saturday in connection with an alleged assault on two women who refused to kiss as they were surrounded on a London bus and taunted as lesbians, according to an account by one of the women.
The alleged attack was revealed in social media posts by one of the women, Melania Geymonat.
The Metropolitan Police announced that four teens had been arrested Friday and said another boy, 16, was arrested Saturday. Police were reviewing footage of the attack.
Geymonat, an Uruguayan flight attendant, said she and her U.S. girlfriend were traveling home on the top deck of a bus to Camden Town, a neighborhood busy with nightlife, on May 30 when they were attacked.
London Mayor Sadiq Khan called the incident "a disgusting, misogynistic attack."
US ambassador says Israel can retain parts of the West Bank
JERUSALEM - The U.S. ambassador in Jerusalem says Israel has the right to retain parts, but not all, of the West Bank.
David Friedman's remarks in an interview with The New York Times published Saturday come about two months after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to begin annexing parts of the West Bank.
It's unclear if the ambassador was revealing a component of the long-awaited Trump administration Mideast peace plan.
The Palestinians want statehood in the West Bank and Gaza, with a capital in east Jerusalem. Last year, Washington announced it recognized the city as Israel's capital.
Most of the world considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem illegal.
Albania president cites tense climate in canceling elections
TIRANA, Albania - Albanian President Ilir Meta on Saturday canceled upcoming municipal elections, citing the need to reduce political tensions in the country. Meta said he would clarify his decision Monday.
Thousands of Albanians who support the political opposition assembled for an anti-government protest Saturday. The Albanian opposition accuses the government of links to organized crime and vote rigging. The government denies the allegations and said protests that started in February have hurt the country's image as the European Union is set to decide this month whether to launch negotiations to include Albania as a member.
The U.S. and EU urged the opposition to disavow violence and sit with government representatives to resolve the crisis.
Hillary Clinton says youngest brother has died
NEW YORK - Hillary Clinton's youngest brother Tony Rodham died Friday night. The former U.S. senator, secretary of state, first lady and Democratic presidential candidate announced the death Saturday on Twitter.
Clinton remembered her brother as a generous person who could walk into a room and "light it up with laughter."
"It's hard to find words, my mind is flooded with memories of him today," she tweeted.
He was survived by his wife, Megan, and three children, Zach, Simon and Fiona. Tony Rodham was born in 1954 to Hugh and Dorothy Rodham. He was raised in the Chicago suburbs along with his older siblings, Hillary and Hugh.
The youngest Rodham held a variety of jobs, including stints as a prison guard, insurance salesman, repo man, private detective and business investor.
Pickup truck hits Amish carriage, killing 2 kids
ALGANSEE TOWNSHIP, Mich. - Authorities say a pickup rear-ended an Amish horse-drawn carriage in southern Michigan, killing two children and seriously injuring two others and a woman who were in the carriage.
State police say the two adults and five children who were in the carriage were ejected when the truck hit it Friday night in Algansee Township, a farming community not far from Michigan's borders with Indiana and Ohio.
The children who were killed were 6 and 2 years old. Authorities say two other children, ages 3 and 4, were hospitalized with life-threatening injuries and that a woman also suffered serious injuries.
Sgt. Todd Price told ABC News that the pickup's driver was intoxicated at the time of the crash and is being held in Branch County Jail.
Rebel soccer icon: A Syrian soccer goalkeeper who became an icon of the rebellion against President Bashar Assad has died of wounds suffered in a battle with government forces, the rebels said Saturday.
Abdelbaset Sarout, 27, rose to fame as a player for his home city of Homs and won international titles representing his country. When peaceful protests broke out against Assad in 2011, Sarout led rallies and became known as the "singer of the revolution" for his songs and ballads.
Following the arc of the Syrian uprising, Sarout later took up arms as the country slid into civil war. Many activists and rebels came to refer to him as the "guardian of freedom," a play on the Arabic word for goalkeeper.

Texto completo: When a group of youths stood up to police raiding a popular gay hangout in New York City on the night of June 28, 1969, they had no idea where their actions would lead.
The kids were mostly what we now would identify as LGBTQ. But 1969 was a different time. The gay rights movement was in its infancy, and police officers weren't in the habit of donning rainbow colors and marching in parades to show their support.
On that summer night in Greenwich Village, New York police raided the Stonewall Inn on Christopher Street, a club where homosexual activities were said to occur.

The kids fought back, and the event became known as the Stonewall riots. The first night of the riots brought out as many as 600 people, according to the website for the Stonewall 50 Consortium, a group that brings together scores of nonprofit groups and other organizations for programs and exhibitions and to produce educational materials . The second night drew perhaps 2,000 people; the sixth and final night attracted as many as 1,000.
There were a handful of arrests but no fatalities.
The riots might have slipped into the nation's memory, as other similar riots have no doubt done. Some Southern Californians may remember the 1959 Cooper Do-nuts disturbances in downtown L.A., when a group of transgender women, lesbians and gay men fought with police who had been arresting LGBTQ folks who gathered along Main Street.
Perhaps because the Stonewall riots took place in New York City, they were noticed.
"The Stonewall Riots were a key turning point and a catalyst for dramatic growth in LGBTQ rights and for a movement that spread around the world," said Eric Marcus, founder and chairman of the Stonewall 50 Consortium.
"What I find so inspiring is that a group of people ... confounded all expectations and had the police on the run," he said.
"When Stonewall happened, it was like we were driving 20 mph and then hit the gas," said Cathy Renna of Target Cue, an LGBTQ-focused PR and communications firm. "The news spread like wildfire to cities like Philadelphia and Washington, where there already were burgeoning gay/lesbian rights groups working."
The next summer, marchers gathered at the Stonewall Inn and marched to Central Park in the first Pride parade. Slowly, gay pride became a household phrase from California to Croatia.
To mark a half-century of progress since the Stonewall uprising, what's now called WorldPride will take place this summer in New York City, its first time in the U.S. Exhibitions and other events are being held during June in what New York City tourism officials are calling "The Year of Pride."
"The arts and cultural communities have really stepped up in powerful ways," said Fred Dixon, president and chief executive of NYC & Co., the city's tourism marketing group. "We'll have exhibitions throughout the five boroughs. The Bronx Museum of the Arts will have an exhibit on an amazing photographer who captured the gay scene in the city in the 1970s. The Met will have an exhibit. The New-York Historical Society will have three exhibitions."
NYC's Pride events "are about standing up for who you are," Dixon said. "And that's a very New York concept."
Four million people are expected to descend on New York City for Pride events this year, many from distant corners of the world.
The June 26 opening ceremony will be at Barclays Center in Brooklyn; guests include Whoopi Goldberg and Cyndi Lauper. The official WorldPride parade on June 30 starts near Madi-son Square Park and passes the Stonewall Inn and the Stonewall National Monu- ment in Greenwich Vill- age.
The monument was established by President Obama in June 2016 and consists of Christopher Park, the Stonewall Inn and the surrounding streets where the 1969 riots took place.
The current Stonewall Inn doesn't bear much resemblance to the original. The bar closed not long after the riots, and the building later housed a Chinese restaurant, a clothing store and a bagel shop. Today it's back in business as the Stonewall Inn, at 53 Christopher St., likely to be an overwhelmingly popular spot throughout June.
Formal accreditation is needed for the official June 30 Pride parade, which shows how far the movement has advanced in 49 years. (Accreditation to march in the official parade must be arranged in advance through World Pride.) Another march on the same day, the Queer Libera- tion March and Rally, is open to anyone who wants to join.
"You won't be able to go anywhere in New York City -- and I don't mean just the Village or Manhattan but anywhere -- and not see the manifestation of support and political relevance of the Stonewall Uprising," Renna said. "WorldPride is like the Olympics of Pride."
Renna remembers taking part in an early Pride march in Washington, D.C., with a few hundred people. This year's event in New York, sanctioned by state and local officials who have embraced LGBTQ issues and the dollars gay tourism brings, will conclude with thousands of people gathered in Times Square.
"It's a physical manifestation every year of the progress we made and community we've created," Renna said. "For some, it's protest and politics. For others, it's just an opportunity to come and be joyous and maybe go to a party."

Trump destroys American greatness

Texto completo: It's hard to work up much sympathy for the hollowed-out husk of a human being that is Mitch McConnell, or Lindsey Graham for that matter. This country is a harder, colder, more mean-spirited place because these senators would rather bootlick a bully than stand for the principles they once espoused.
Surely, they know the price of their vassalage. To serve Donald Trump is to lose all self-respect. You lie for him. You cover for him. You hate for him. 
But Americans should care about a more lasting and damaging corrosion - the destabilizing of venerable institutions. It's one thing to corrupt a politician, the natural osmosis of the species. It's quite another to debase the foundations of a great democracy.
It started on Day 2, when the hapless liar, newly subsidized by taxpayers, tried to conscript the National Park Service into the fantasy that his crowd was the largest ever.
After the inauguration debacle, Trump moved on to bigger targets - the judiciary, the military, the press, and the professional class of bureaucrats who have made the United States a model for competence and incorruptibility in the Civil Service.
With William Barr, Trump now has an attorney general who doesn't care how much lasting damage he does to truth, justice and the American way. His mandate as the nation's top prosecutor is to carry out Trump's private vendettas.
This week, the House will vote on whether to hold Barr in contempt for defying the constitutional role of oversight by the legislative branch. Get used to it. Barr is marshaling the enormous legal muscle of the people's Justice Department as a political hit squad. He'll use the law, which he ignores when it suits him, to try to imprison public servants who launched an early investigation of Russian attempts to subvert a U.S. election.
Barr's job is to muddy the origins of the Russian investigation enough to frame career public servants as traitors.
Normally, the courts would be bulwarks against the barbarians. And indeed, many judges have stood up to some of Trump's most outlandish and illegal behavior. But the Trump effect, turning everything he touches to a cheap commodity, is to denigrate the legal arbitrators as "Obama judges" or "Mexican" judges. You're with him or against him.
You would think that matters of the soul would be harder for the soulless occupant of the White House to tarnish. After a round of golf last Sunday, a disheveled-looking Trump abruptly showed up at a church in Virginia. The White House said Trump wanted parishioners to pray for victims of a recent mass shooting. Instead, they were asked to pray for Trump. The pastor later said he had been blindsided.
The same cannot be said for the man who oversees the Census Bureau, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. He's trying to use a mandate of the Constitution, the decennial census, to shore up power in the Electoral College and Congress for the aging white men of Trump's base.
Any day now, the Supreme Court will rule on Ross' effort to insert, into the census form that goes out to every household, a citizenship question, something that hasn't been asked since 1950. It could mean that about 6.5 million people would go uncounted - citizens and noncitizens.
This is a blatant abuse of power and of an otherwise benign government agency, affecting not just the number of representatives or electoral votes each state gets, but also the fate of numerous cities dependent on federal billions in mostly blue America.
We've had a census every decade since 1790, after the colonies threw off a king and created a governing document establishing an independent judiciary, a legislative branch that writes the rules of the land, and asserting that no man is above the law. To the present occupant of the White House, it's only a piece of paper.

Offensive coach added to program

Texto completo: A day after the Timberwolves hired their defensive coordinator, they hired their offensive coordinator.
The Wolves are adding Pablo Prigioni as an assistant on Ryan Saunders' staff, sources told the Star Tribune. Prigioni was previously a Brooklyn assistant coach, and his hiring comes a day after the team hired David Vanterpool away from Portland to be associate head coach. ESPN first reported Prigioni's hire.
A source said Prigioni will be the "offensive coordinator" that President Gersson Rosas outlined last month when discussing the staff he would like to have under Saunders.
"Ryan's going to be the leader of the program," Rosas said last month. "And he's going to have input in every area. So for me, we're going to get the best offensive coordinator. We're going to get the best defensive coordinator. We're going to get the best player development coordinator. They're going to execute our vision together."
Prigioni, 42, and Rosas have ties dating to Prigioni's playing days. He played one season in Houston in 2015. After playing for several years in Spain, Prigioni made his NBA debut with the Knicks when he was 35. At the time, it made him the oldest rookie in the NBA in 40 years, the New York Times reported.
He played parts of four seasons in the NBA before returning to Spain for one more season in 2016-17 and then joining the Nets staff. The Rockets acquired him in a trade with the Knicks in February 2015 before trading him that offseason to the Nuggets. The Rockets signed him again in the summer of 2016 but waived him in late October of that year.
Prigioni played a role in the development of Nets All-Star guard D'Angelo Russell, a restricted free agent the Wolves may have interest in this offseason, according to a report from the Athletic.
The Wolves did not renew the expiring contracts of three assistants after the season -- Larry Greer, Ed Pinckney and Jerry Sichting -- while retaining Malik Allen. Allen has been linked through multiple reports to an assistant coaching position in Miami, but nothing official has been announced with his status, meaning the Wolves will likely still have a few hires to make before rounding out Saunders' staff.

Men are in trouble. 'Incels' are proof.

Texto completo: The Internet has enabled the flourishing of countless subcultures, from the harmless to the less so. Lately, one of the latter groups has begun to break into the mainstream: the "incels."
"Incel" is short for "involuntary celibate," and as their self-imposed name implies, these mostly young men have come to define themselves by their inability to find a sexual or romantic partner. Men who identify as being #ForeverAlone have gathered online in forums such as Reddit to trade stories of woe.
These communities tend to be self-reinforcing. Members believe that their looks or personal traits have consigned them to lifelong loneliness, and similarly downbeat peers are always willing to add more fuel to that fire. And the incel community has developed elaborate, and elaborately misogynistic, theories to blame others for their plight, centered on the idea that women are shallow, stupid and cruel - exclusively choosing only a handful of the most attractive men to be with and disdaining the rest. All men should deserve a chance with women, incels tell themselves, but some men have all the luck, while they get left out.
Today, the incel subculture has become not just self-reinforcing but self-radicalizing, often with tragic outcomes. At its most horrifying extremes, self-described incels have taken their anger out on the women they believe are refusing them. At least two mass shooters have left behind manifestos identifying themselves as adhering to incel ideology and explaining their actions as taking revenge on the world that hasn't given them the women they think they deserve.
Their conclusions are wrong, to put it mildly. Even the most attractive among us has experienced being single when we might prefer not to be, and women aren't obliged to have relationships, much less sex, with anyone. These men are obviously operating under a dark, self-perpetuating cloud of delusion. But we should still be paying attention to what this level of desperation is telling us - incels are the bleeding edge of a generation of struggling men.
In his book "Man Out: Men on the Sidelines of American Life," author and former New York Times reporter Andrew L. Yarrow describes millennial men as the "new lost boys." As many as 1 in 3 American 18-to-34-year-old men are unemployed, living at home, or at or near the poverty line, because of a confluence of factors ranging from economic shifts to student debt. Women are surging ahead, out- enrolling men in colleges and universities. A new uncertainty about their place in the world is leading men to spiking levels of anxiety and depression.
It's easy to conclude that the incels should just log off, look up and get outside more - in the past, they might have been forced to do so. But human connection in the real world has become rarer, and often feels more difficult, than it used to be. Smartphones and gaming are replacing face-to-face interactions, the sort that might force one to confront one's social difficulties or develop a better understanding of the lives of others. Free-floating pornography, persistently sexualized media and ubiquitous swipe-on-sight dating apps have made sexual relationships - or, at least, sex - seem like something everyone is having without us, and that we might be failing by not having enough of.
The Internet makes the fear even worse: It's easier to deal with a tilting social landscape by living online, where those who feel the most threatened and aggrieved can reiterate their pain, promote their favorite narratives and resist information that doesn't conform to their worldview. And it's those who feel disconnected from society already - in many cases, those men who are short of job opportunities, falling behind in relative education and otherwise confounded by changed expectations - who tend to spend the most time there.
Incel communities illustrate this phenomenon at its most acute. Angry, frustrated men discuss in detail the women they think have rejected them, and how social shifts have become inescapable obstacles the world has arrayed against them. "We have lived our entire lives believing the 'bluepilled' lies that society tells us," wrote one man on Incels.com. "Work hard and you'll be rewarded. Just be yourself and you'll find a nice girl. But life has been hard on us, people have been hard on us, and none of this s--- made any sense until everything suddenly clicked: we live a misreable [sic] life because we are ugly."
It's no surprise that misogyny flourishes in these forums. But the flip side of women gaining ground doesn't have to be men falling behind and lashing out.
The incel phenomenon is a predictable endpoint for a culture that increasingly uses sex as a marker of success, while at the same time losing human connection and substituting the Internet in its stead. The solution won't be just to teach these men how to get offline and find girlfriends, or even just remind them yet again that misogyny is a bad road. To treat modern life's ugliest symptoms, we'll first have to confront the disease.

Utah stands to take a big hit from Trump-ordered tariffs on Mexican goods

Texto completo: Utah would be among the states hurt the most if President Donald Trump follows through with threats to impose tariffs beginning Monday on goods from Mexico in an attempt to force it to crack down on immigrants headed to the United States.
As a share of its overall economy, Utah ranks No. 7 among all states as the most dependent on imports from Mexico, according to research by The New York Times. The Beehive State’s Mexican imports amount to 2% of its gross domestic product.
“About 25% of Utah’s imports come from Mexico and that equates to roughly $3.6 billion per year of products,” said Miles Hansen, president and CEO of World Trade Center Utah.
The proposed 5% tariff, a tax added on goods at the border, “would equate to roughly $180 million of additional costs for Utah businesses,” he said.
It would affect the price of everything from motor vehicles to car parts, medical equipment, metal products and food, he said. “It really impacts a broad set of industries here in Utah for both businesses and consumers.”
Hansen said that, initially, the higher costs would be passed on to Utah consumers, not people in Mexico.
“Whether it’s a business or consumer who is buying products from Mexico, starting Monday — if the tariff goes into effect — they would see a 5% tax on those goods,” he said. “With time, companies can work with their suppliers in Mexico to try to get their Mexican suppliers to bear all or a share of the tax. But that will take time, and almost certainly still will result in additional costs for Utah businesses and consumers.”
Utah Farm Bureau President Ron Gibson is concerned, too.
“Tariffs never help Utah agriculture, especially those with such a large trading partner,” he said. Gibson is a dairy farmer, and notes that 20% of all Utah dairy products are exported — and 25% of those exports go to Mexico. “It may not seem like that much. But it we have product we can’t sell, it makes a huge difference.”
Gibson also raises onions. “There are times of the year that we import onions from Mexico here, and times we export ours to Mexico because of the different harvest seasons,” he said. “Mexico is almost just like another state. It’s nearby” and each depends on the other.
“Tariffs disrupt the trade system we have worked out,” he said.
Hansen said concern about the tariffs is rising among Utah businesses. Also, Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, criticized plans for the tariffs last week.
“There is hope that enough progress can be made on immigration so the administration doesn’t move forward with the tariffs — or if they do, that they are very short-lived,” Hansen said.
However, Trump tweeted this week that progress in U.S.-Mexico talks has been unsatisfactory. He plans to ramp up his tariffs on Mexican goods gradually to 25% by October to pressure Mexico.
Hansen said that while solving immigration problems is important, Utah businesses generally dislike using tariffs as a weapon in fights over policy unrelated to trade.
“There simply are levers other than trade policy to get more Mexican cooperation to address these issues,” Hansen said. Using trade policy “leads to uncertainty for businesses. And that uncertainty can have a dampening effect on economic growth.”
He notes that Utah does 80% more trade with Canada and Mexico “than we do with even China, as big and important as China is.” Officials have noted, for example, that Utah exported $684 million worth of goods in 2017 to Mexico. Hansen worries the U.S. tariffs could trigger retaliatory tariffs by Mexico against U.S.- and Utah-made goods.
Hansen worries the tariffs also could torpedo efforts to ratify a new trade agreement among the United States, Mexico and Canada — which he sees as essential to hundreds of thousands of jobs here that depend on such trade.
Gibson said he realizes Trump is dealing with tough immigration issues. But he hopes that ways to allow more legal immigration or guest workers can be found, saying Utah farmers are finding it difficult to hire enough workers. “Right now I need 10 more people than I have,” he said.
Research by The Times shows that tariffs could cause significant pain for U.S. consumers and businesses even in states far from the southern border.
Michigan is the state that is most dependent on imports from Mexico, largely because the automobile industry there has set up complex supply chains that send components and finished products back and forth across the border.
Michigan imported $56 billion of products from Mexico last year, second only to the $107 billion imported by Texas, which thrives on trade in energy, food and manufactured goods with Mexico.
The few other states more dependent than Utah on Mexican imports in 2017 included Rhode Island, Kentucky, Arizona and Tennessee.

Texto completo: "The Inheritance," an ambitious and award-winning two-part play that explores contemporary gay male lives against the backdrop of recent history, is coming to Broadway this fall.
Although written by an American and set in New York, the play began its life in London, where it was staged last spring at the Young Vic, and then transferred to the West End. It was a commercial hit and a critical success, honored with this year's Olivier Award for best new play.
Written by Matthew Lopez ("The Legend of Georgia McBride"), "The Inheritance" is inspired by E. M. Forster's novel "Howards End." Stephen Daldry ("Billy Elliot") will direct the production, which runs more than six hours over two separately sold sections.
Matt Wolf, writing in The New York Times, called the play "capaciously moving." Dominic Cavendish, writing in The Telegraph, described it as "perhaps the most important American play of the century so far" and said, "Star ratings are almost beside the point when confronted by work of this magnitude but hell, yeah, five."
The Broadway staging will be produced by Tom Kirdahy, Sonia Friedman Productions, and Hunter Arnold. It is scheduled to begin previews Sept. 27 and to open Nov. 17 at the Ethel Barrymore Theater.
John Benjamin Hickey and Vanessa Redgrave were part of a London cast made up mostly of young actors. The Broadway ensemble has not been announced.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Trump on Vietnam: He'd have been 'honored' to serve

Texto completo: 'I make up for it right now,' deferred president says in D-Day interview
Donald Trump, Selective Service registrant No. 50-63-46-580, never served in the military during the Vietnam War. Neither did 15 million other young American men who won student deferments or were otherwise disqualified.
But 9 million Americans did serve during the 11-year conflict, and the cultural and political gulf that opened between them and those who avoided involvement in a bloody, unpopular and losing war remains a festering national wound half a century later.
On Wednesday, as world leaders gathered to mark the 75th anniversary of D-Day, an epic battle in a war that defined national consensus, President Trump said in an interview broadcast Wednesday that he would have been "honored" to serve in Vietnam.
"I would not have minded that at all," Trump said to British broadcaster Piers Morgan. "I would have been honored . . . But I think I make up for it right now . . . because we're rebuilding our military at a level that it's never seen before."
The contradiction between Trump's actions in the 1960s and his latest statement has reignited the long-simmering debate over how and why he avoided service. And the question of how he - like two of his 2020 rivals, Sen. Bernie Sanders and former vice president Joe Biden - managed to avoid the war is now being raised by a new generation of presidential contenders who served in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Trump steered himself around service in Vietnam by obtaining four student deferments and one medical disqualification - something to do with a bone spur in one or both of his heels - between 1964 and 1972.
In the past, Trump has presented his avoidance of service as an accident of timing - his college years and his draft eligibility coincided with a period when the military was generous with student deferments.
"I was never a fan of that war, I'll be honest with you," he told Morgan. "I thought it was a terrible war; I thought it was very far away. You're talking about Vietnam at that time - nobody ever heard of the country." Trump has long said he was against the war, but did not take part in any of the antiwar protests that were regular events on the University of Pennsylvania campus when he was a student.
"The bell rang and Donald Trump was hiding," said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University who has written often on Vietnam. "Many people are proud that they didn't serve, saying it was an immoral war. But it's embarrassing that President Trump is in Great Britain honoring the 75th anniversary of D-Day and pretending to be a wannabe service member in Vietnam. If he wanted to, he could have easily served like John [F.] Kerry or John McCain," the former Democratic senator from Massachusetts and Republican senator from Arizona, respectively, whose Vietnam experiences defined their later political careers.
McCain, who spent five years in captivity by the North Vietnamese after his plane was shot down, said in 2017 that the inequities of the war had always gnawed at him. "I will never countenance . . . that we drafted the lowest-income level of America and the highest-income level found a doctor that would say that they had a bone spur. That is wrong."
Trump until now has presented his avoidance of the draft as a stroke of fortune. "I actually got lucky because I had a very high draft number," he said in a 2011 TV interview. He has said that he felt he had military experience because he went to a high school with a military focus.
This year, some of Trump's younger Democratic opponents have slammed him for avoiding service. Pete Buttigieg, the South Bend, Ind., mayor who is seeking the Democratic nomination, last week called Trump "somebody who, I think it's fairly obvious to most of us, took advantage of the fact that he was a child of a multimillionaire in order to pretend to be disabled so that somebody could go to war in his place." Buttigieg, 37, was an intelligence officer in the Navy Reserve and was deployed to Afghanistan in 2013.
Another presidential candidate, Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.), last week said he'd "like to meet the American hero who went in Donald Trump's place to Vietnam. I hope he's still alive." Moulton, 40, served in Iraq as a Marine Corps captain.
With septuagenarians Trump, Sanders (I-Vt.) and Biden in the race, this is likely to be the last presidential election in which candidates' decisions about serving in Vietnam will be a political issue. Sanders, 77, a vocal opponent of the war while he was at the University of Chicago, applied for conscientious objector status but aged out of draft eligibility before his application was processed. Biden, 76, got student deferments when he was at the University of Delaware and was then reclassified as disqualified for service because he had asthma.
"We used to elect presidents on the basis of their service, from George Washington to Teddy Roosevelt's Rough Riders and JFK's PT-109," Brinkley said. "But starting with Bill Clinton, what the Vietnam generation did became a litmus test. How did you deal with that era? It tells us a lot about somebody's character."
Politicians close to Trump's age have struggled to explain why they did not serve. President George W. Bush, who like Trump is 72, avoided the draft by signing up for Texas's National Guard.
President Bill Clinton, also 72, got student deferments while he was at Georgetown University from 1964 to 1968, after which a family friend in Arkansas arranged for him to enlist in the Navy Reserve to avoid the draft. Clinton later wrote a thank-you note to an Army ROTC officer for "saving me from the draft." The fact-checking service Snopes concluded that the fact "that Clinton went to great lengths to avoid the Vietnam-era draft [is] beyond dispute."
Trump got four student deferments while he was enrolled at Fordham University in New York and then as a transfer student at Penn. As a student at New York Military Academy and in college, he was an active athlete, playing baseball, basketball, golf and football. He was 6-foot-2, 180 pounds, lean and strong. He described himself as "the best baseball player in New York."
After he graduated from the Wharton School at Penn in spring 1968, he was reclassified 1-A - prime eligibility for the draft. He had an Armed Forces physical in September; records of that exam show only that he was declared "DISQ" for "disqualified."
During the 2016 campaign, when Trump was asked what had held him back from serving, he said he could not recall which heel had the spur.
"You'll have to look it up," he told reporters. His campaign later issued a statement saying it was both heels. On the draft registration card he filled out in 1964, Trump listed his only "obvious physical characteristic" that might aid in identifying his body as "birthmark on both heels."
Trump acknowledged during the 2016 campaign that he got out of the draft by providing Selective Service officials with "a very strong letter on the heels."
The New York Times reported last year that the Queens podiatrist who diagnosed Trump with bone spurs did so as a favor to the doctor's landlord - the president's father, real estate magnate Fred Trump.
In 2016, Trump's campaign said his medical deferment was temporary and when his name was entered into the draft lottery in 1969, he drew a 356 out of 365, making it exceedingly unlikely that he would be drafted.
In 1998, Trump said on Howard Stern's radio show that sex in the 1980s New York dating scene was his version of Vietnam.
"It is a dangerous world out there," he said. "It's like Vietnam. It's my personal Vietnam. I feel like a great and very brave soldier."

Less debate over when to use the L-word

Texto completo: It's (almost) official: The president of the United States is a liar.
This will not come as a revelation to people who have closely followed President Trump's public statements and Twitter feed and have long doubted his veracity. It is, instead, a late-dawning recognition by mainstream news organizations, which until fairly recently shied away from branding the president's many questionable utterances as outright lies.
Nowadays, many in the news media are no longer bothering to grant Trump the benefit of the doubt. In routine news and feature stories, Trump's dishonesty carries no fig leaf. It is described baldly.
A recent sampling:
l CNN: "The Mueller report: A catalog of 77 Trump team lies and falsehoods."
l Minneapolis Star Tribune: "President Trump lies to troops about pay raise."
l Financial Times: "The real reason Donald Trump lies."
l Los Angeles Times: "Mueller report exposes all the president's liars."
l Chicago Tribune: "Why are Trump's lies not ruinous to him? Because truth can be in the eye of the beholder."
l The New Yorker: "It's True: Trump Is Lying More, and He's Doing It on Purpose."
l Foreign Policy: "Does It Matter That Trump Is a Liar?"
As recently as last summer, a debate still raged within newsrooms: Could a presidential statement, no matter how blatantly false, be deemed a "lie" since, by definition, the word implies awareness of falsity and intent to deceive? How can journalists know what's in Trump's mind, even when he repeatedly says transparently untrue things, such as "the wall is under construction right now" on the southern border with Mexico, or that the United States pays "a disproportionate share" of the cost of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)?
This dictionary definition of "lie" still keeps some media organizations from applying it to Trump. FactCheck.org, the nonprofit fact-checking organization, hasn't used the term in the past 10 years, according to Director Eugene Kiely. The Washington Post's Fact Checker column, despite having documented more than 10,000 "false or misleading" claims by Trump, has used it only once.
"You can't get into someone's head," said Glenn Kessler, the Fact Checker's editor and chief writer. "Trump especially is very situational, so he may actually believe what he is saying, despite all evidence to the contrary."
But Kessler thinks the sheer volume of "false and misleading" statements by Trump may have led other journalists to stop giving the president the benefit of the doubt. Kessler used the word for the first time last year in describing Trump's denials about paying hush money to adult-film actress Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election, given that an audio recording and other evidence clearly showed that Trump spoke falsely.
The story - which was published online under the headline "Not just misleading. Not merely false. A lie.' - appeared on Page 1 of the newspaper.
White House press secretary Sarah Sanders did not respond Wednesday to a request for comment on this story. But last year, in an exchange with CNN host Chris Cuomo, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway took umbrage at the suggestion that Trump lies. She called it a "slur" to say the president didn't tell the truth about his relationship with Daniels.
Prompted by Trump's frequent excursions from the truth, the Fact Checker late last year created the "Bottomless Pinocchio ," a new category for falsehoods that have been repeated so often "that there can be no question the politician is aware his or her facts are wrong."
The most prominent early adopters of "lie" were the New York Times and the Associated Press, both of which slapped a big L on Trump's "birtherism" assertions during the presidential campaign. After Trump's inauguration, the Times also called his statement that he would have won the popular vote if it hadn't been for voter fraud a lie (headline: "Trump Won't Back Down from His Voting Fraud Lie. Here Are the Facts").
But the Times's executive editor, Dean Baquet, has said his newsroom strives to use the word "judiciously" because using it repeatedly "could feed the mistaken notion that we're taking political sides."
Post Managing Editor Cameron Barr also said The Post is "careful" in its use. "When evidence tells us that a person had such a motive in making a false statement, it's accurate to say it was a lie," Barr said.
One of the first mainstream journalists to systematically brand Trump's comments as lies was Daniel Dale, the Toronto Star's Washington bureau chief. Dale, who this week joined CNN as a reporter on the fact-checking beat, began compiling a database in 2015 and started counting the false statements the following year. He uses the word "lie" frequently, and he freely refers to Trump as a "serial liar."
"I think both are objectively true," Dale says. "It isn't a departure from objective journalism to use these words. . . . Why should the rules of objective journalism mean we have to dance around the obvious, objective truth? If we're going to get readers to trust us, we have to be straight with them."
Dale uses "lie" more frequently when Trump repeats a false claim multiple times. "Perhaps the first couple [of instances] were confusion," he notes. But after dozens, and sometimes hundreds of instances, "I think the active disregard for accuracy is sufficient" grounds for calling the statement a lie.
However, Dale thinks the terminology isn't as important as simply calling out statements as wrong or inaccurate in the first place. "News stories and segments are still being completed without readers and viewers being informed, in any way, that the president made 10 or 15 or 35 false statements in the speech being covered," he said.
Angie Drobnic Holan, the editor of PolitiFact, the Pulitzer Prize-winning fact-checking organization, agreed: "It's much more important to point out why Trump is wrong and what the actual evidence shows," she said.
PolitiFact doesn't use the word "lie" explicitly, although its most extreme rating - "Pants on Fire" - certainly implies it, Holan acknowledged. It also awards a "Lie of the Year," which spells out things rather plainly (PolitiFact has given the award to Trump three times in the past four years).
Holan says she worries the public is being "pummeled" with headlines that suggest they're being lied to, which "can breed cynicism at a minimum."
But Dale has no such qualms. "If someone committed 100 felonies, we don't report that he committed two felonies and 98 nonlegal activities, we just say it was 100 felonies. Trump lies all the time. If we're only going to point out some of them, he wins with the other ones."

Texto completo: Books could be written about the important role various Lyon County sites, communities and people have played in our nation's arts and entertainment history. Today much of that history is still unrecognized.
For instance, in the 1960's Silver City denizens founded the Red Dog Saloon and developed its lineup of music. The venue became key to creating the formula for the psychedelic dance hall that became the backbone of the psychedelic music scene in San Francisco and beyond. The Red Dog Saloon stage of the 1960's was graced by many whose later music became legendary, including Janis Joplin, Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane and The Charlatans.
Another rarely mentioned part of Lyon County arts history involves the work of internationally known artist Michael Heizer, who created one of his early earthworks near Stagecoach in 1969. Called "Displaced/Replaced Mass," it included a massive granite boulder that was moved from Spooner Summit above Lake Tahoe down to the desert south of Stagecoach, where it was put into a depression in the earth. William Fox, Director for the Center for Art + Environment at the Nevada Museum of Art, describes the site where "Displaced/Replaced Mass" was originally located as "a micro-playa on private land." It is no longer extant, but while it existed, was "owned in situ" by American art collector Robert Scull.
Since 1969, Heizer has become very famous and is widely recognized as one of the important artists working in what's categorized as environmental art, land art or earth art. His artwork "City," located near the borders of Lincoln and Nye counties in Nevada, was declared a national monument in 2015. LA County Museum of Art Director Michael Govan has said that it "is one of the most ambitious and singularly important works of contemporary art, particularly in the United States." The collection of large-scale ceremonial mounds and abstract forms made of earth, rock and concrete is expected to be completed in 2020 after nearly 50 years of work. Surrounded by about 704,000 acres, "City" is about the size of the national mall in Washington, D.C., making it one of the largest sculptures ever created (roughly 80 feet high, a quarter of a mile wide and over a mile long).
Heizer first came up with the idea for "City" when he was 24 years old, while in the Yucatan studying a serpent motif at Chichen Itza. He had recently finished "Double Negative," a "1,500-foot-long, 50-foot-deep, 30-foot-wide gash cut onto facing slopes of an obscure mesa in Nevada, a project that required blasting 240,000 tons of rock."
Heizer's family came to Nevada in the 1800's. Michael Kimmelman wrote in a 1999 New York Times article, "You can't understand Michael Heizer without remembering what his father and grandfather did. At the root of his art are archaeology, geology and anthropology." One of Heizer's grandfathers was a mining engineer and the other was the chief geologist for the state of California. Heizer's father, an archaeologist from Lovelock, taught at the University of California, Berkeley and specialized in the Great Basin and the Yucatan, and also worked in Egypt, Bolivia and Peru. At the time of his death, he was writing a book about the ancient transport of huge rock monoliths.
If anyone witnessed or recalls details about the creation of Heizer's earthwork near Stagecoach, please contact me. I'd love to learn more from firsthand accounts.

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
On Monday morning, just after 11 o'clock, The New York Times sent out a news alert that read:
"If you don't want to know what happens to James Holzhauer on today's 'Jeopardy!' with an all-time record at stake, don't open this."
Mr. Holzhauer, who had become the show's most dominant player in years, was poised to surpass the $ 2.52 million that Ken Jennings had won during his record 74-game winning streak in 2004. The show is prerecorded, and The Times had learned from representatives of the show that on the episode airing June 3, Mr. Holzhauer would lose to Emma Boettcher.
To prevent spoiling the surprise for "Jeopardy!" viewers, the Culture desk agreed to keep the news under embargo until the show aired. The desk began preparing two H.F.O. -- "hold for orders" -- stories by the reporter Julia Jacobs. One story reported that Mr. Holzhauer had lost, and the other was a profile of Emma Boettcher, the victor. (On Sunday, a day before the show's air date, a video leaked that showed Mr. Holzhauer losing, but The Times decided not to report on the leak.)
On Twitter, some readers expressed dismay that The Times had released the news before the show aired on the East Coast.
Ian Trontz, a deputy editor for news on the Culture desk, explained how The Times approached its coverage of Mr. Holzhauer's upset -- including our decision to send a news alert, which was made in consultation with our executive editor, Dean Baquet.
What are our guidelines for reporting on television news ahead of a show's air date?
Some shows let us view episodes ahead of time. They'll send us a DVD or a special link to access them. It is almost always on the condition that we hold our coverage until the show airs. We didn't actually get to see this particular "Jeopardy!" episode ahead of time, but they told us that on June 3, James would lose to Emma Boettcher.
Who was involved in the conversation about the stories and the news alert?
Rebecca Blumenstein, a deputy managing editor who is in charge of the web report, was involved. So was Eric Bishop, who oversees the push alerts. And then we went to Dean Baquet, our executive editor. I think we walked in the office and my words to him were: "This is the most fun, difficult decision you are going to make today." We had a conversation in which we debated the right time to do it on Monday, and how we should frame it.
What were some of the considerations?
There are a number of very reliable "Jeopardy!" fan websites, and I had a printout of which markets see the show at what time. A majority of the country sees it at 7 p.m. local time. But the very first airing is at the CBS station in Montgomery, Ala., at 9:30 a.m. Central time. I think Houston sees it at 1 p.m. Central time -- pretty early in the day.
If we wanted to wait for everyone to see the show, we'd have to wait until 11 p.m. Eastern -- and by then, the outcome would have been all over social media, and the "Jeopardy!" fansites would have written about it. There is no way we could wait that long.
We decided we would publish it at 10 a.m. Central time, which is when the Montgomery airing concludes. Even though we'd been told by the show that this was going to happen, and I trusted them, I still hired a freelancer in Montgomery to watch the show -- just to make double sure. She then FaceTimed us, so the reporter here was watching the show through her phone. What if "Jeopardy!" got the day wrong? This was like wearing suspenders and a belt. We did the same thing on Friday, as a dry run, to make sure it all worked.
We decided to publish at 11 a.m. Monday but to hide the news behind some spoiler alerts.
There were three possibilities. One was that he would break the record. The other was that he would win but not break the record. The third was that he would lose. The push alert was written to allow for all three possibilities. The headline was written the same way. And then there was a spoiler message right below that that said, "This article contains news about what happens in the game being broadcast on Monday. It began airing in some cities on Monday morning." So we felt like we had given people enough opportunity to bail. We did get some criticism from people -- like, "Why did you ruin this?"
The news, if you look, is in the fourth paragraph. This was not a hard-news event; it wasn't, for example, a big policy shift by the Trump administration. So, we wrote a lede about how James Holzhauer was dominating the show. In this case, pushing the news down gave the reader one last chance to leave the story.
How did the leak on Sunday influence our plans?
The leak was unfortunate, but it wasn't a big enough news event for us to break our embargo. "Jeopardy!" gave us this information on the condition that we wait until Monday to publish it, and we felt like we should honor that promise.
Under what circumstances would we break an embargo?
We would honor an embargo if some city agency said, "We're announcing this policy at 10 a.m., and you can get a story ready, but you cannot publish anything until the press conference begins." But if the commissioner of that department mentioned the policy in public a day early, then we would say, "You've gone public. We cannot hold back."

Texto completo: Uno de los crímenes más horrendos en la historia de Central Park se convirtió además en una de las mayores vergüenzas en la historia judicial de Nueva York, cuando cinco adolescentes negros –incluyendo un hispano- fueron enviados a la cárcel por error.
En medio de la euforia, muchos neoyorquinos, incluyendo a Donald Trump, incluso pidieron “restaurar la pena de muerte” para ellos, recordó The New York Times.
Es la infame historia de injusticia conocida como “The Central Pak Five” (“Los 5 de Central Park”), “un recordatorio del tipo de ciudad que fue Nueva York y, en cierto modo, todavía lo es”.
Todo comenzó el 19 de abril de 1989, cuando la banquera Trisha Meili casi murió cuando fue violada y golpeada salvajemente mientras corría en Central Park, a los 28 años de edad (su identidad no fue revelada hasta que publicó sus memorias en 2003, bajo el título “I Am the Central Park Jogger: A Story Of Hope and Possibility”).
Cinco adolescentes negros, de 14 a 16 años de edad, fueron condenados por el crimen de 1989: Korey Wise, Yusef Salaam, Antron McCray, Kevin Richardson y el boricua Raymond Santana.
Pasaron de 6 a 13 años en prisión. Finalmente sus condenas fueron anuladas en 2002, después de que otro boricua (Matías Reyes), que ya estaba en prisión por delitos similares, confesó el ataque y su ADN coincidió con la evidencia de la escena del crimen (tenía 18 años en 1989).
En 2003, los cinco jóvenes exonerados demandaron a la ciudad de Nueva York por la condena injusta. En 2014, la ciudad resolvió el caso y acordó pagarles $41 millones de dólares.
¿Por qué los cinco adolescentes fueron condenados?
Fueron arrestados por la policía después del ataque e interrogados detenidamente. En algún momento, confesaron. Más tarde se retractaron y dijeron que habían sido coaccionados para admitir su culpa. Los fiscales procedieron de todos modos.
Con evidencia física no concluyente, las declaraciones fueron una parte clave del caso de la fiscalía. También fueron condenados por la prensa y la opinión pública. The Times y otros medios se referían a ellos como una “manada de lobos”.
Trump publicó anuncios en los periódicos atacándolos y pidiendo la reactivación de la pena de muerte en Nueva York. Años después, mantuvo su postura.
En 2012 PBS produjo el documental “Los 5 de Central Park”, realizado por Ken Burns, David McMahon y Sarah Burns. Trump lo atacó vía Twitter en 2013: “El documental de Central Park Five fue un pedazo de basura parcializado que no explicó los crímenes terroríficos de estos jóvenes mientras estaban en el parque”.
Después del acuerdo de 2014, Trump escribió en un artículo de opinión para Daily News: “Mi opinión sobre el arreglo del caso del Central Park Jogger es que es una desgracia. Un detective cercano al caso, y que lo ha seguido desde 1989, lo llama ‘el atraco del siglo'” (…) “La solución no significa inocencia”.
Trump no cambió el tono durante su carrera presidencial. “Admitieron que eran culpables”, dijo a CNN en 2016. “La policía que está haciendo la investigación original dice que fueron culpables. El hecho de que ese caso se resolviera con tanta evidencia en su contra es indignante”.
“Miro a Donald Trump y lo entiendo como una representación de un síntoma de Estados Unidos”, dijo recientemente Salaam, uno de los acusados, citado por Esquire. “Fuimos condenados por el color de nuestra piel. La gente pensaba lo peor de nosotros. Ellos crearon leyes de superpredadores debido a lo que sucedió. Y todo esto debido a neoyorquinos prominentes, especialmente Donald Trump”.
Siempre vigente
Jim Dwyer, columnista del Times, cubrió el caso durante años. Dijo que mostraba cómo el sistema de justicia penal podía ser “distorsionado por fuerzas como la raza, y cómo está formado por una atmósfera de miedo”.
Es un “ideal mítico que nuestras cortes y nuestro sistema de justicia penal puedan ser inmunizados o aislados de estas fuerzas”, dijo. Dwyer comentó además que cuando la ciudad resolvió el caso civil, no hubo admisión de irregularidades.
Zachary Carter, abogado de la ciudad, dijo en 2014: “Nuestra revisión del expediente sugiere que tanto los detectives investigadores como los fiscales de distrito asistentes involucrados en el caso actuaron de manera razonable”.
Esta historia nunca ha perdido vigencia, porque representa un patrón que se repite de injusticia, racismo, prejuicios y estereotipos en todo el país, incluso en una ciudad como Nueva York que presume de vanguardia, igualdad, civismo, mentalidad abierta y diversidad.
Apenas en la década siguiente, fueron varios los casos de detención injusta adjudicados al infame ex detective de NYPD Louis Scarcella. Algunos de los sentenciados han recuperado recientemente su libertad tras pagar por crímenes ajenos y otros aún luchan por revertir aquellas condenas.
Scarcella ha sido señalado de apresar a docenas de afroamericanos y latinos en Brooklyn en la década de 1990 por crímenes que no cometieron.
Más recientemente, las muertes de los afroamericanos Trayvon Martin (Florida 2012), Eric Garner (NYC 2014) y Sandra Bland (Texas 2015) también han despertado el debate de la discriminación racial por parte de la policía.
Ahora la historia de 1989 fue adaptada como una miniserie de cuatro partes que Netflix acaba de estrenar, llamada “When They See Us”, dirigida por Ava DuVernay. También es el tema de una ópera a debutar el 15 de junio en San Pedro (California), con música de Anthony Davis y libreto de Richard Wesley.

Democrats vs. Nuns; The Little Sisters of the Poor are again forced to defend their liberty in federal court.

Texto completo: Nationwide, Democratic politicians are testing the boundaries of extremism on issues related to reproduction, while a few liberal voices warn of potential repercussions in the 2020 elections.
More than two years after Barack Obama left the White House, there's still no cease-fire in a legal war on women of faith. The non-profit law firm Becket said today that a group of nuns will once again have to defend their beliefs in a San Francisco federal courthouse this week:
The Little Sisters of the Poor will be in court Thursday to ask for protection from a lawsuit by California Attorney General Xavier Becerra threatening their religious ministry. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit will hear arguments in California v. Little Sisters of the Poor and decide if California and... other states can force Catholic nuns to provide services such as the week-after pill in their health care plan in violation of their faith. In 2017, following an Executive Order, a five-year legal battle resulting in a Supreme Court victory, and a new HHS rule protecting religious non-profits, the Little Sisters finally received a religious exemption that applies to non-profits nationwide. Yet California immediately sued the federal government to take that exemption away. Joined now by 12 other states and the District of Columbia, Attorney General Becerra is forcing the Little Sisters back to court to defend their hard-earned religious protection.
Hasn't Mr. Becerra heard of letting women decide such issues? Including California, the relevant elected officials in the 14 jurisdictions attempting to dictate birth-control policies to nuns are all Democrats—and most of them are men. Among the states participating in this legal assault is Virginia, led by those paragons of progressive morality Gov. Ralph Northam, Lieutenant Gov. Justin Fairfax and Attorney General Mark Herring, who is responsible for the case. Last month in the Journal Mark Hemingway provided a recap of their recent political history :
Gov. Northam, a pediatrician, was asked during a Jan. 30 radio interview to defend state Democrats' proposed legislation loosening restrictions on late-term abortion. In response, he appeared to endorse infanticide as an option when a child is born during a botched abortion. On Feb. 1, medical-school classmates offended by Mr. Northam's comment released a photo from the governor's 1984 yearbook page, showing a young man in blackface next to someone in a KKK outfit. Mr. Northam first acknowledged then denied being one of the men in the photo.
It emerged that Lt. Gov. Fairfax, who would take over following a Northam resignation, had been accused of sexual assault by a college professor and the Washington Post had been investigating the story for months. (Mr. Fairfax has since been accused by a second woman. He denies the allegations and says the encounters were consensual.) Then Mr. Herring, who had initially called for Mr. Northam to step down, announced that he, too, had been photographed in blackface.
For such esteemed public servants, it seems that allowing nuns to decline to provide the week-after pill is simply beyond the pale. Such intolerance for dissenting views on social issues is not limited to the characters currently running Virginia. The national Democratic party and many of its presidential candidates for 2020 have been moving quickly toward an absolutist position on abortion at any stage of a pregnancy. Emma Green writes in the Atlantic:
Although local Democrats supported the abortion restrictions that passed just this week in Louisiana, and the state's Democratic governor, John Bel Edwards, signed the bill into law, the national party has thoroughly purged its anti-abortion members...
Ms. Green offers a word of caution to the party as it careens leftward:
Public opinion on specific abortion policies is still mixed, including among Democrats... Roughly two-thirds of Americans say abortion should generally be illegal in the second trimester, and more than 80 percent say it should generally be illegal in the third trimester—numbers that have held steady since the 1990s, when Gallup first polled the question.
... The crucial swing states that helped Trump secure victory over Clinton—including Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Florida—have only razor-thin majorities supporting abortion in all or most cases, according to research from Pew. These voters could really matter: Some moderates and conservatives who were initially uncomfortable with Trump specifically point to the third presidential debate, when Hillary Clinton endorsed third-trimester abortion, as the decisive moment that solidified their reluctant support for Trump. Given the way the current Democratic primary is shaping up on this issue, that dynamic could conceivably play out again in 2020.
Beyond policy, pro-choice rhetoric has become so extreme that even the "fact checkers" at the Washington Post recently felt compelled to expose the whoppers being told by abortion absolutists.
Calling the politics of abortion "tricky," columnist David Leonhardt at the New York Times opines today that "it's a big mistake for Democrats to imagine that the country is as liberal as their own social circles. And I think signaling an openness to compromise on many issues is both smart and reasonable."

Texto completo: All three "Jeopardy!" contestants Monday night answered the final round question correctly. But it was Emma Boettcher who walked away not only with a win and $46,801, but a unique role in show history: the challenger who finally brought down superstar James Holzhauer.
“I lost to a really top-level competitor,” Holzhauer said in an interview with The New York Times. “She played a perfect game. And that was what it took to beat me. ”
Holzhauer came up just $56,484 shy of besting the all-time record set by Ken Jennings for non-tournament play. He made waves on the show by strategically making large bets, and his downfall came partially after placing an uncharacteristically low one in the final round.
The final clue, per the Times: "The line, 'A great reckoning in a little room' in 'As You Like It' is usually taken to refer to this author's premature death. (For those non-English majors, "Who is Kit Marlowe?" was the correct response. )
Boettcher went into the final question $3,200 ahead of Holzhauer. He bet only $1,399, bringing his total for the day to $24,799. She bet $20,201. Her scoreboard flashed a total of $46,801 as Holzhauer walked over to high five his successor.
As a viewer, Boettcher said she kept track of her scores in a notebook, calculating her percentage of right answers.
“I knew going in that Daily Double hunting was something that I could do and feel confident doing,” she told The Times. “I don’t need to be cautious around that. ”
Currently a user-experience librarian at the University of Chicago, Boettcher earned an undergraduate degree from Princeton University in 2014 and a master's two years later from the University of North Carolina.
In the host chat, she told host Alex Trebek she wrote a master's paper on "Jeopardy!" "I ran a series of text-mining experiments to see if a computer could predict how difficult a clue was," based on factors including its length, syntax and audio or visual elements. What did she predict? Trebek wondered. "That it's very hard to do. "
But she knows what goes into building good questions: Her resume cites experience writing "pub quiz-style trivia questions" for the Museum of the American Revolution's History After Hours events.
Musical theater and history buffs alike would love this one: " 'What's Your Name, Man?' was (a category) about the pseudonyms used by Alexander Hamilton," Boettcher shared.

Texto completo: RICHMOND, Va. -- "The joke was that when we opened up, we had three Civil War books," said Ward Tefft, owner of Chop Suey Books, "But we're in Richmond so we see a lot more now, and it's grown since then." Since it first opened 17 years ago, the store has grown more than just its local history holdings, and has become a well-stocked stop for book lovers strolling the vibrant Carytown district of Virginia's capital (and former capital of the Confederacy). As described on its website, Chop Suey Books offers "gently used literature, art, photography, architecture, design, philosophy, poetry, theater, film and the like" volumes.
Tefft, 47, knew the Carytown area from his days as an undergraduate studying English at nearby Virginia Commonwealth University. After earning a master's degree in English from the State University of New York at Buffalo, he ended up making a living largely by working in independent bookstores, including the late, lamented Skyline Books that once brightened Manhattan's West 18th Street.
Although the move was already in the works before the September 11 attacks on the city, Tefft left New York and moved back to Richmond in October 2001 with a truck of "about 3,000 or 4,000 books" he'd collected and an idea for a used-books shop of his own. A few months later, he found a retail space and a name for his store -- in a building at 1317 W. Cary Street that still sported a rusted hanging sign for "George's Chop Suey," a long-gone restaurant.
[Heading south? Read "36 Hours in Richmond, Virginia." ]
While the store's culinary-themed name is a nod to neighborhood history, it's also sincerely inspired by the concept of the dish itself, considered to be a Chinese-American creation. As Tefft explains, the name "chop suey" is thought to have derived from the Mandarin "za sui," which translates to "a little bit of this, a little bit of that" -- much like the contents of a used-books shop.
The store opened in 2002 and has expanded in many ways since. Chop Suey Books moved from its original building in 2008 and is currently located in a larger space at 2913 W. Cary Street across from Richmond's landmark Byrd Theatre, a 1928 movie palace still in operation showing second-run films. Tefft handles the daily business of buying, selling and trading books for store credit with the help of six employees and WonTon, the store's affable tuxedo cat, who freely patrols the place.
WonTon has a lot of room to roam. In addition to the ground-floor sales area -- where newly released titles can also be purchased -- Tefft was able to expand the store bit-by-bit over the years and now rents the entire second floor of the building. A trip up the stairs reveals five more rooms packed with shelves and free-standing racks of books.
The Children's Room is organized chronologically from expectant-parent guides to board books to picture books and all the way around to the young-adult titles. The walls of the room are decorated with brightly painted murals of the store's cat having fantasy adventures, but other whimsical bits turn up elsewhere around the store -- including a large stuffed pink unicorn perched atop a shelf of adult memoirs and biographies.
The second floor also houses the store's Fiction Room. "This is our most popular room," said Tefft, who said he's tried to make the literary-fiction titles for sale there inclusive and representative of different points of view. "We try to get a strong international selection, African-American and indigenous authors."
Chop Suey Books hosts a book club and literary events with authors. Paintings by area artists decorate the shop's walls, but the store's support of Richmond's creative community goes even further. In 2014, aided by a Kickstarter campaign to raise money, Tefft teamed up with the artist Noah Scalin to release a hardcover catalog of Scalin's "Skull-a-Day" multimedia art project. Since then, Tefft's Chop Suey Books Books publishing project has released several other titles showcasing the work of local creators, including a "Murals of Richmond" photo book and "River City Secrets: Stories From Richmond," a short-fiction collection aimed at middle-grade readers.
Those self-produced titles are prominently displayed in the store and Chop Suey Books now houses more than 45,000 titles under its roof -- with more on the way to keep the browsing experience unpredictable. As Tefft noted, "We have three storage spaces full of books that are just waiting to come into here."

Fassbinder's Cruel Love Story

Texto completo: Not simply a great filmmaker, Rainer Werner Fassbinder (1945-82) was an imposing physical presence. I vividly remember a stocky, scruffy, leather-clad figure, flanked by an entourage, striding across the lobby of Alice Tully Hall for a New York Film Festival news conference in the late 1970s.
The German auteur -- a wildly prolific wunderkind whose sardonic melodramas served to re-establish German cinema on the international stage -- appeared at once affable and menacing. It was an affect far different from the one he chose a few years earlier for his movie "Fox and His Friends" (1975). Not quite 30, the director cast himself as a working-class hustler, boyish and naïve, who performs in a traveling circus as Fox the Talking Head. After winning a lottery jackpot of 500,000 marks (roughly $ 1 million these days) he loses his head to love -- shamelessly exploited by a bourgeois male lover, Eugen (Peter Chatel), who takes his money while berating him for not using a dessert fork.
As a portrait of class relations, "Fox and His Friends" is not subtle. (Fox's real name, Franz Biberkopf, is a reference to the victimized proletarian antihero of Alfred Döblin's great novel "Berlin Alexanderplatz.") But the film is no less affecting for that. Fassbinder avails himself of blunt Brechtian political allegory as well as his knowledge of the Hollywood melodramatist Douglas Sirk, particularly Sirk's use of interior décor to comment on his characters' emotional states. Every object in the frame is precisely placed to drive the point home. The mood of acrid self-pity is further reinforced by the occasional use of Leonard Cohen's melancholy dirge "Bird on the Wire."
Fassbinder once wrote that Sirk's films convinced him that "love is the best, most insidious, most effective instrument of social control." So it is with "Fox." The movie's title could have been that of a subsequent film "I Only Want You to Love Me" -- precisely Fox's motivation as he lends money to bail out Eugen's father's business, as well as buying (and furnishing) an apartment, a new wardrobe and a fancy car.
"Fox" evokes the cruelty of a dog-eat-dog world. A major scene is set in Marrakesh, where Fox has taken Eugen on vacation. The two men pick up a Moroccan (El Hedi Ben Salem, the male lead in Fassbinder's "Ali: Fear Eats the Soul") and take him back to their luxury hotel only to be informed that Arabs are not allowed. Of course, after the Moroccan is escorted out, the desk clerk offers to send a hotel employee to their room. Love is a commodity; social class is absolute. The idea that West Germany might also be a sort of colony is introduced by the presence of two American soldiers whom Fox vainly attempts to hustle.
Despite its outrageously downbeat ending, "Fox" was promoted at the 1975 New York Film Festival as a daring display of "homosexuality without tears" -- presumably because the movie is so matter-of-fact in representing its gay milieu. Four decades ago, "Fox" was something of a novelty, as was Fassbinder, perhaps the first openly gay or bisexual filmmaker of note since Jean Cocteau.
The New York Times critic Vincent Canby, an important supporter of Fassbinder's work, chose not to review "Fox," first shown as "Fist-Right of Freedom"; the movie was dismissed in The Times by Richard Eder as "a 'Blue Angel' done in drag." When "Fox" opened commercially in New York it was at the Waverly (the same Greenwich Village theater where, two months later, "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" appeared), with the word "homosexual" prominently used in its ads.
Positioned as a niche film, "Fox" caused controversy. Some critics and activists took offense at Fassbinder's depiction of gay life or, more precisely, his use of a gay milieu to make fresh a familiar story of sexual exploitation. Discussing "Fox" before it went into production, Fassbinder made no mention of his main characters' sexual orientation, blandly describing it as the story of "a young entrepreneur whose company is on the verge of bankruptcy, and who manages to trick money out of someone to save the firm." When "Fox" had its premiere at the Cannes Film Festival, he maintained that "homosexuality is shown as completely normal," adding that the "problem" is social inequality and it's "something quite different."
Hollywood movies like "The Killing of Sister George" or "The Boys in the Band," are told from an outsider's perspective. "Fox" is not. Fassbinder's on-camera presence in virtually every scene gives the film a confessional aspect. Still, if "Fox" is a psychodrama, Fassbinder is playing a role. That he did not see himself as the character Fox may be gleaned from the movie's dedication to his real-life lover, Armin Meier, and "the others." A few years later, Fassbinder and Meier, who soon after committed suicide, played themselves, as bully and abject partner, in Fassbinder's contribution to the 1978 anthology film "Germany in Autumn."
Fassbinder gave himself cameos in a number of films including his superbly insolent second feature, "Katzelmacher" (1969). Here, as in "Fox," he appears as an underclass pariah -- a sullen Greek immigrant worker in Munich. The director also starred in other people's films. Trim and 25, he plays a loutish, charismatic poet in Volker Schlöndorff's TV adaptation of Brecht's expressionist play "Baal"; scarcely a dozen years later, squeezed into an incongruous leopard skin suit, the mature, paunchy Fassbinder starred as a police detective in Wolf Gremm's punk science-fiction satire, "Kamikaze '89." The film was released shortly after his death, at age 36, apparently of a drug overdose.
Reviewing "Kamikaze" in 1983, Canby wrote that its focal point was "Fassbinder's easy, neo-Wellesian control of every scene in which he appears -- a control that has as much to do with wisdom as with weight."
"Fox and His Friends," "Katzelmacher" and "Baal" are all available for streaming from the Criterion Channel; "Kamikaze '89" streams from Film Movement Plus.

The 'Daily' Guests You've Met Before

There's a long tradition in journalism of meeting people, interviewing them, telling their stories and then moving on. Not out of any coldness or insensitivity, but because the next story must be told. The news is relentless that way. It leaves little time for following up or checking back in.
We've tried to break that cycle on the show.
On Tuesday, you heard from Nicolae Hent, a New York City taxi driver. It was not our first conversation with him. We first met Nicolae in May 2018, when Theo Balcomb, Jessica Cheung, Annie Brown and I loaded into his taxi outside the Times building.
During a long drive around Manhattan, he told us the story of a taxi industry beleaguered by competition from apps like Uber and Lyft, which had, he believed, undercut the value of his taxi medallion. The financial situation had become so dire that his best friend, a fellow cabdriver named Nicanor, had taken his life. It was a powerful episode that changed how many of us saw the taxi industry.
Then it was back to the news. The U.S. pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal. A historic summit with North Korea was scheduled. Riots broke out in Gaza. We moved on from Nicolae.
But we wondered how he was doing. So when our colleague Brian Rosenthal investigated why the value of taxi medallions had plunged over the past decade and discovered a complex story of predatory lending and reckless government promotion, Lisa Tobin and Jessica Cheung had an idea: tell that story and check back in with Nicolae in a single episode. It turned out Nicolae had followed Brian's reporting and was eager to discuss it. So we reached him inside his taxi and reinterviewed him.
Over the past two years, we've followed up with several memorable guests: Sheriff Mark Napier, who polices a vast stretch of Arizona at the Mexican border; David Green, the founder of Hobby Lobby, who took a fight over Christian values all the way to the Supreme Court; and Mitch Jacques, a doctor in coal country whose patients rely on the Affordable Care Act.
In each case, by returning to a familiar figure who had already told us his story, it felt as if we could drill even deeper, explore greater nuance and connect more dots. By the end of our second interview with Nicolae, it was clear that his own understanding of what had happened to his industry had changed since we met him -- and with it, so had ours.
So the question is: Who do you want us to follow up with next?
Talk to Michael on Twitter: @mikiebarb .
______
So what about Uber and Lyft?
On Tuesday, Brian Rosenthal told us about the taxi industry's reckless loan practices that devastated a generation of New York City taxi drivers. While the industry's leaders got rich, thousands of drivers paid the price, he told us. In response, some of you wrote in saying that we let ride-hail companies off the hook. So we asked Brian how he thinks Uber and Lyft had a role in the crisis:
"Everybody who has played Jenga knows it's largely an exercise in scapegoating. In the game, players take turns removing the building blocks of a tower until one of the removals causes the tower to fall. The player who removes that block is deemed the loser. But do they really deserve the blame?
"I want to be clear: Ride-hailing has hurt yellow taxicabs. As I said on 'The Daily,' government data clearly shows that on a per-cab basis, New York City taxi revenue has dropped 10 percent since Uber arrived.
"Some people have criticized our use of that statistic. They have said the impact could look a little bigger if we compared overall industry revenue, changed the time frame or factored in taxes and tips. They have argued that 10 percent is huge in a low-margin field and that a business is not just about revenue.
"Instead of debating that number, I think it's important to focus on the wrongdoing we uncovered: We found industry leaders manipulated the medallion market to inflate prices, and virtually everybody in the industry agreed prices never should have hit $ 1 million. We found many medallion buyers had to sign reckless loans that made them forfeit almost all their income, indefinitely. And we found the whole thing worked only if prices kept skyrocketing forever, a dynamic some compared to a Ponzi scheme.
"The taxi industry was inflated, exploitative and unsustainable. Ride-hailing may have 'caused' the industry to fall. But does it really deserve the blame?"

She's the reason for this newsletter
Before Samantha Henig, there was no audio team. She's moving on to new things, but not without a quick note of thanks from Lisa Tobin:
"If you're reading this newsletter, it's because of Samantha Henig. Back in 2017, The New York Times asked her to look into creating an audio team. Two and a half years later, here we are, nearly 30 of us, and we're growing.
"I was initially skeptical that The Times -- this incredible force in print journalism -- could succeed in audio. But the first time I spoke to Samantha, sitting at a picnic table in the middle of Times Square, I immediately understood her vision, and she convinced me that it just might work. She's the reason I came on, as her partner in building a brand new department from scratch. It was scary, and hard and, because I got to do it with Samantha, incredibly fun. She was key to shaping high-level editorial and business strategy, recruiting so many of the incredibly talented producers and editors on this team, but she also never shied away from unglamorous work -- in the early months of 'The Daily,' she woke up at 5 a.m. every morning to do a final listen and hit publish on the episode.
"Now that we're off and running, she's moving on to new challenges and opportunities. We all -- this team and everyone who listens to 'The Daily' -- owe her a gigantic thank you for getting us here. We will miss you, Samantha! It's hard to imagine how we are going to do this without you."
______
On "The Daily" this week
■ As New York City taxi drivers continued to fall into debt, everyone blamed Uber and Lyft. But, Brian Rosenthal explained, the story is much more complex.
■ Coral Davenport told us about the Trump administration's strategy to undermine climate change science.
■ "Because Mueller is so literal, we have to read between the lines," Mike Schmidt said after the special counsel made his first public statement. "Mueller thinks the president obstructed justice."
■ Secret recordings shared with Ellen Gabler revealed that physicians at UNC Children's Hospital were concerned that children seemed to fare poorly after heart surgery. Their hospital kept doing the operations.
