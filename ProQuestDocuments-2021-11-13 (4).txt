You could say that the Donald Trump presidency effectively ended when the polls closed election night or when news outlets called the contest for Joe Biden four days later. You could say that it ended when the Electoral College voted Monday to make Biden the president, or that it will end when Biden is sworn in on Jan. 20.
But by one measure, the Trump presidency ended in mid-November, when online conservatives went bonkers over a picture of Harry Styles in a dress.
The photo of the British singer on the cover of the December Vogue prompted YouTube personality Candace Owens to tweet, “Bring back manly men.” To Ben Shapiro, the photo shoot was an assault on the concept of manhood itself: “Anyone who pretends that it is not a referendum on masculinity for men to don floofy dresses is treating you as a full-on idiot.”
What does all this have to do with the president’s impending exit? First, it suggests that other conservatives are retaking the role of Troll-Warrior-in-Chief that Trump conferred on himself.
But it’s also a reminder that the kind of button-pushing cultural politics that predated him — that in many ways helped make a President Trump possible — will survive his tenure.
‘Duck Dynasty’ Politics
A million years ago in the Obama era, proxy wars over culture were handled on the periphery of conservatism, in social media and right-wing talk. It was the era of the Gamergate attacks on feminists in the video gaming community, of umbrage over the foreign-language lyrics of a Coca-Cola commercial and over a female-cast reboot of “Ghostbusters.”
With the election of Trump, a pop-culture figure himself who intuited the connection between cultural fandom and political tribalism (he himself made a “Ghostbusters” outrage video the year he announced his campaign), the political and culture-war wings of conservatism merged.
For four years, we had a president whose portfolio of concerns included protests at NFL games, speeches at TV awards ceremonies, the loyalty of Fox News and the reboot of “Roseanne.” He scoured and fretted over Nielsen ratings — his own and those of shows he saw as allies and enemies — with the intensity a wartime president might devote to troop movements.
Now, with a waning Trump self-soothing with OANN and Newsmax and tweeting out the elaborate sci-fi serial that the election was stolen from him, command of that battle is returning from the White House to the field.
For decades, the expression of politics through culture war has been a staple of conservative media. Andrew Breitbart, the right-wing online publisher, declared that “politics is downstream from culture” (borrowing an idea from Marxist theorists like Antonio Gramsci). Fox News made an annual production of the “war on Christmas” (with occasional spinoffs like “Santa Claus and Jesus are white”).
The appeal was emotional; people have a personal connection to family holidays and their favorite shows that they don’t to, say, marginal tax-rate policy. But it was also a way to appeal to a specific audience in a country where, increasingly, people had not just different political beliefs but entirely different cultural experiences.
As far back as the early 1970s, the “rural purge” in TV — which eliminated bucolic sitcoms like “Green Acres” to make room for urban ones like “All in the Family” — reinforced the idea that there were different Americas with different, and even competing, popular cultures. This dynamic only spread with cable TV and the internet, which sliced and diced us into a nation of niche demos, sharing a geography but occupying different psychic spaces.
As historians Kevin M. Kruse and Julian E. Zelizer write in “Fault Lines,” their study of American polarization since the 1970s, all this led to “a world with fewer points of commonality in terms of what people heard or saw.” This was true in politics and in entertainment, and the two often overlapped.
There was now identifiable red and blue pop culture. A 2016 New York Times study found a TV divide that mirrored the rural-urban split in the election. “Deadliest Catch,” the reality show about Alaskan crab fishing, was popular in red America; in blue zones, “Orange Is the New Black,” the Netflix drama and critique of the prison system.
A 2014 poll found that 53% of Democrats, compared with 15% of Republicans, believed “Twelve Years a Slave” should win the best-picture Oscar. Neither party had taken a position on the movie; the culture war was just well-enough ingrained that people could intuit where their side would land, just as the Iraq War movie “American Sniper” became a conservative favorite and liberal target.
Knowingly or not, audience members enlisted in the culture war as volunteers. For conservatives in particular, the liberal tilt of Hollywood was a useful font of grievance, allowing them to claim cultural victimhood no matter how much political and judicial power they held.
And people increasingly saw their favorite stars as their proxies and champions. When Phil Robertson, the bayou patriarch of “Duck Dynasty,” was briefly suspended from the reality show in 2013 for homophobic and racist comments, one America saw it as political correctness taking down a beloved star for speaking his mind. Another America — if they had ever heard of “Duck Dynasty” at all — saw a bigot getting what he had coming to him.
The Culture-Troll-in-Chief
All of this, in retrospect, was an advance trailer for the it-came-from-“The Apprentice” Trump era.
Politicians, especially on the right, have dabbled in culture war before: George H.W. Bush vs. “The Simpsons,” Dan Quayle vs. “Murphy Brown,” Bob Dole vs. rap. But their forays tended to be awkward, tone-deaf and often as not, self-defeating.
But Trump, a child of TV who made himself into a TV character as an adult, understood media instinctively. It was where he lived, ever since he gave up his youthful fantasies of running a movie studio, vowed to “put show business into real estate” and forged his tabloid persona in the 1980s.
Having used media to build a reality-show career and a business-success myth, having experienced the rush of prime-time celebrity, he knew that culture makes the kind of gut connection that mere politicians can only dream of. Ordinary politics argues: Those other people don’t believe what you believe. Culture-war politics argues: Those other people don’t love what you love.
So Trump’s campaign, as much as it was about wall-building or Islamophobia or “law and order,” was also about a promise to defend and uphold his followers’ culture over the enemy’s. His rallies combined a concert vibe with the theatrics of pro wrestling (another genre Trump had experience with).
To an audience that had been told for years that showbiz celebrities disdained their values, here was one of their celebrities, a real celebrity from TV, taking their side. An alt-rightist essay on Breitbart.com hailed the erstwhile NBC host as “the first truly cultural candidate for president” since Patrick J. Buchanan, the CNN “Crossfire” co-host who declared a “cultural war” for “the soul of America” at the 1992 Republican National Convention.
Trump’s 2016 RNC didn’t have a lot of high-profile politicians, but it did have a “Duck Dynasty” star. As president, he gloried in inviting conservative celebrities like Kid Rock and Ted Nugent (who once called President Barack Obama a “subhuman mongrel”), as well as the newly conservative-curious Kanye West, to take photos in the Oval Office.
The pictures felt like spoils of war, a political end-zone dance. And his fiercest celebrity critics often played into his me-vs.-Hollywood narrative, cursing him out at the Tony Awards or feuding with him on Twitter.
He praised Western culture as superior because “we write symphonies,” tooting a white-nationalist dog whistle from the orchestra pit. And he threw himself wholeheartedly into fights like the one over ABC’s reboot of “Roseanne,” whose star, Roseanne Barr, had become a real-life, vituperative Twitter Trumpist, and which worked her politics into the storylines.
He didn’t, like previous presidents attending the Kennedy Center honors or sharing a something-for-everyone Spotify playlist, see culture as a way to find common ground. He saw it as a battleground with winners and losers, and one full of opportunities to inflame divisions.
When the “Roseanne” premiere dominated the ratings, he crowed about it as his team trouncing the enemy. “It’s about us!” he told a crowd of supporters.
Later, when ABC fired Barr from the show over a racist tweet, Trump joined the argument, not to condemn Barr’s remarks but to accuse the network of hypocrisy because of “HORRIBLE statements made and said about me on ABC.” It echoed his Twitter attack on the network in 2014 when it picked up the sitcom “black-ish”: “Can you imagine the furor of a show, ‘Whiteish’! Racism at highest level?”
His bellyaching against Hollywood wasn’t just a bread-and-circuses distraction. It was political messaging. Pushing back on Barr’s firing — for likening a Black former Obama aide to an ape — echoed the right’s fixation on “cancel culture.” The message: Your stars are being canceled. Your shows are being canceled. You are being canceled. Only I am the network executive who can ensure your renewal.
His fixation on ratings (dating back to “The Apprentice,” whose ratings he routinely lied about) vibed with his worldview of competition and scorekeeping. Fights about representation, American identity and the boundaries of acceptable speech aligned with messages expressed, in more blunt and ugly ways, by Trump’s campaign and supporters — especially the insidious language of “replacement.”
“Now they’re making ‘Ghostbusters’ with only women. What’s going on!” was a way of telling men that he would protect them from becoming superfluous. “We can say ‘Merry Christmas’ again” was a way of saying: Your culture used to be the assumed default in America, and I’m going to bring that back. The enemy wants to demote you to a supporting player; I’m going to make you the star again.
The Tug-of-Culture-War Goes On
Much of this, of course, was a reaction to the expansion of the American story implied by the election of America’s first Black president and by the representative pop culture of Obama’s era, like “black-ish” and “Hamilton.” Often, there’s a sense (at least in retrospect) of a new cultural era beginning with a new presidential administration: JFK, the New Frontier and youth culture; Reagan, “Family Ties” and “greed is good.”
Though the Biden administration has yet to begin, it doesn’t feel like that kind of definitive shift at the moment, so much as the flag moving to the other side of the centerline in a continuing tug of war. Things may get quieter on the surface; Biden is neither as big a pop-culture guy nor as zealous a culture warrior as the president he’s replacing.
But as every tempest over a Vogue cover proves, the fight goes on. The divides are too deep, the incentives for widening them too great. Whether Trump continues to have a major part in this after he leaves office, or whether his ratings ragetweets simply echo in some musty corner of the internet, the ongoing narrative he has left us with will continue.
The secret of a long-running show, after all, is that it can survive a cast change.

TORONTO — During the applause, the celebratory elbow bumps, the camera flashes, Colette Cameron watched through tears as four of her colleagues got jabbed Monday with the country’s first coronavirus vaccinations. Then she removed her suit jacket to follow them herself.
“It was overwhelming,” said Cameron, a registered nurse and social worker, who runs a nursing home in Toronto that experienced one of the city’s first outbreaks. “I wish everyone could have this support so nobody has to feel as alone as we did. We were desperate.”
The start of Canada’s vaccine campaign was an emotional one, with the first precious doses going to people from nursing homes: health care workers in Toronto, and residents in both Montreal and Quebec City.
That was recognition that nursing homes have been ground zero in Canada when it comes to both COVID-19’s cruel ravages and the storm of criticism over the country’s lack of preparation for it. More than 460,000 people have tested positive for the coronavirus in Canada, and 13,400 have died from it.
“We have never distributed so many Kleenex boxes as the last few days,” said Sue Graham-Nutter, chief executive officer of the Rekai Centres, which runs two nursing homes in Toronto tapped to receive the country’s first vaccinations. “We have the images of what happened on the floors.”
Less than a week after Canada became the third country in the world to approve the vaccine created by American drugmaker Pfizer and a German firm, BioNTech, the first shipment arrived at a Montreal airport Sunday night. From there, kicking off the country’s largest largest-ever inoculation program, the boxes of frozen vials were dispersed to 14 sites across most of the country that were equipped with special freezers for the vaccine, which needs to be kept at ultracold temperatures.
With a relatively small population of just 38 million, Canada has agreed to buy up to 76 million doses from Pfizer and 414 million doses of other potential vaccines from other companies. Anita Anand, Canada’s minister of public services and procurement, described that as “the most number of doses per capita of any country in the world” at a news conference Monday.
The first inoculations were a moment of triumph for the Canadian government, and it could not have come at a more welcome time: The virus is raging across the country in its second wave, and much of Canada is in lockdown.
By the end of August, 80% of Canada’s coronavirus deaths had been linked to nursing homes, among the highest rates in the world. At one point, the military was sent in to nursing homes in Ontario and Quebec to shore up staffing.
For a country that prides itself on socialized health care and a strong social safety net, those deaths have been cause for much anger and soul searching.
“When I got the call to go get the vaccine, I sobbed and sobbed,” said Samantha Hallgren, a registered nurse at Ottawa’s Perley and Rideau Veterans’ Health Centre, who was scheduled to get vaccinated Tuesday.
She was both relieved and overwhelmed with bruising memories of the people she had watched die. She spoke of trying to offer comfort and love to patients denied more than one family visitor or a tender ungloved hand.
“You are not supposed to hug and touch,” Hallgren said, recalling the death of a veteran she attended with a colleague. “But we just held him and the two of us cried.”
Few can really understand what the fight was like if they were not in the ring themselves, she said. “There’s been so much criticism of long-term-care homes — people don’t know what it’s like,” she said.
In late March, when there still little known about the coronavirus, an outbreak hit the first of the Rekai’s two homes, a block apart in the urban center of Toronto. A week later, cases emerged in the second home.
About one-third of the 360 staff stopped showing up, according to Graham-Nutter.
One of her staff members spent nights calling hundreds of former interns, desperate for help to sustain the remaining workers who were doing double shifts and sleeping at a nearby hotel, so as not to infect their families.
“People were scared,” Graham-Nutter said. “We know what COVID-19 looks like, we’ve seen it, and it’s scary.”
Eventually, the city’s largest hospital network stepped in, sending some 75 doctors, nurses and psychiatrists to support Rekai staff members over a six-week period. Between the two nursing homes, 117 residents and 44 employees tested positive for the virus. Thirty-six residents died.
“This is such an emotional day,” Graham-Nutter said Monday, adding that she would never forget the call from the president of the University Health Network and his words: “I hear you need help.”
At other nursing homes, in Ontario and Quebec, the military was sent in during the virus’s first wave to handle basic duties like cleaning and delivering meals to residents.
A graphic report of what Canadian forces found at five Ontario homes shocked the public: patients left in soiled sheets or no sheets at all; untrained and overworked staff members feeding patients who were lying down or asleep, causing one person to choke to death; and rooms that were infested with ants and cockroaches.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the report “deeply disturbing,” and in September, his government announced that it planned to both criminalize “those who neglect seniors under their care” and work with provincial governments to set national standards for nursing homes.
In Quebec, where the vaccinations were being administered at two different nursing homes Monday, the first person to get the shot was 89-year-old Gisèle Lévesque, Premier François Legault announced on Twitter.
While Toronto, Montreal and Quebec City offered vaccinations first, other cities were set to follow quickly behind, mostly giving priority to workers in hospitals and nursing homes. Over the next few weeks, the country expects to receive a continual supply, and by March, have vaccinated some 3 million people, according to Dr. Howard Njoo, Canada’s deputy chief public health officer.
Hallgren said she hoped the vaccine would allow her to hug her own mother, who suffers from dementia and was moved into an assisted-living apartment during the pandemic. She called the vaccine a “Christmas present.”
Her fellow nurse, Cameron, has hopes of seeing someone she has never met before: her first grandchild, whose birth was expected in New York City this week.
“That’s also what brought tears to my eyes,” she said. “It’s very special for me.”

WASHINGTON — Alejandro N. Mayorkas opened a 2016 speech on immigration by recounting his personal connection to the subject — his story of being a political refugee. Then it took only minutes for Mayorkas, the deputy secretary of homeland security at the time, to address criticism of his department’s immigration record.
“Many have taken great issue with the administration’s removal of individuals who have not qualified for refugee status or asylum status in the United States and our practice of removing those who have not qualified for relief under law,” Mayorkas said during the address at Georgetown Law. “Whether we expand the basis of which we seek to welcome these individuals fleeing for a better life is a question that is answered by thinking of who we want to be as a country.”
His remarks not only highlighted some of the experiences that prompted President-elect Joe Biden to name him homeland security secretary last month — fleeing Cuba during the Castro revolution to come to the United States, where he rose to U.S. attorney for Southern California — but they also foreshadowed one of the first dilemmas he will most likely face at the helm of the department.
There are early indicators that migration will swell at the southwestern border, presenting the Biden administration with an early test of human consequences. In November, border officials apprehended a child crossing the border alone 4,467 times. That is a slight drop from the 4,661 in October, but a stark increase from the 712 recorded in April, when various countries imposed national lockdowns and the Trump administration invoked a public health emergency rule to put new border restrictions in place.
Nearly all of the 70,052 arrests at the border in November involved a lone migrant adult, whom border officials can still rapidly return to Mexico under the public health rule. But immigration experts have pointed to two recent hurricanes that devastated Central America as well as the pandemic’s damage to the economy in warning that the United States in the coming months will most likely face the question of what to do with parents and children crossing the southwestern border in search of protection.
The new administration’s approach to the issue will be expected to balance the demands of the left for more lenient immigration policies with the concerns of moderates and law enforcement officials who believe any show of tolerance could lead to an uptick in illegal migration.
“On the one hand, they get pressure from the right that you’re just giving amnesty and letting all these illegals in and from the left that you’re being too tough,” said Janet Napolitano, a homeland security secretary under President Barack Obama. “And the challenge is to enforce the rule of law and to do it intelligently.”
The Trump administration has sought to restrict the ability to obtain asylum through myriad regulations and policies, including one that forces migrants to wait in Mexico for decisions in their cases rather than be released into the United States.
The United States has also cited public health authority granted to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in empowering border officials to rapidly “expel” migrants at the border back to Mexico or their home countries without hearing their asylum claims. That policy has had the unintended consequence of encouraging migrants to repeatedly cross the border illegally.
A federal judge in November blocked the administration from applying the rule to migrant children at the border, a decision that departing Trump administration officials have said will fuel migration north.
While Biden has not said whether he will lift the public health restrictions, he has said he will end the “remain in Mexico” policy that has forced tens of thousands of migrants back across the border.
“Most transitions are somewhat uneventful immediately. However, with respect to immigration, that could be different,” Mark Morgan, the acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, told reporters on Monday. “If they do what they say they’re going to do, you’re going to have a full-blown crisis. I hope they don’t do what they say they’re going to do.”
In October and November, the Border Patrol detained about 150 migrant children a day at the southwestern border, compared with about 80 a day in the fiscal year that ended on Oct. 1, according to the agency. The more than 4,600 detentions of children at the border in November is still fewer than the 5,615 arrests recorded in 2016.
Biden has said he will cut funding used to detain migrants and instead rely on programs that track them after they are released into the United States to ensure they appear in court. His transition team focused on immigration has in recent weeks discussed surging asylum officers to the border to process more cases, as well as lobbying Congress for additional bed capacity at the Office of Refugee Resettlement at the Department of Health and Human Services, according to interviews with advisers.
After children are detained at the border, they are required by law to be moved to shelters managed by the department within 72 hours. They are then supposed to be matched with relatives acting as sponsors or placed in foster care facilities. The refugee office has about 3,300 children in its custody out of roughly 8,700 slots that have been made available during the pandemic, according to a statement from the agency.
Both the Trump and Obama administrations have been criticized for the care children received in border facilities and for how long it took to transfer them to health and human services.
In 2014, the demographic at the border shifted from single Mexican adults, who can be quickly deported, to Central American families and unaccompanied children seeking asylum. Those families by law cannot be quickly deported because they had not traveled from a neighboring country.
The Obama administration responded by expanding the number of detention facilities for families, converting a warehouse in McAllen, Texas, into a facility that could hold more than 1,000 migrants in chain-linked enclosures. Mayorkas was confirmed as the deputy secretary of homeland security in December 2013 after leading Citizenship and Immigration Services, which oversees legal immigration.
“I think he knows well the way the administration handled the 2014 crisis fell short,” Doris Meissner, the immigration commissioner in the Clinton administration, said of Mayorkas. And under Trump, asylum processing has been effectively “shut down.”
“How do you unwind from that but put a system in place that actually makes it possible to have border control, as well as a system for adjudicating protection claims that is fair and timely?” Meissner said.
Biden’s advisers have said that the new administration will recommit to restoring the asylum process. But it remains unclear how he will combat a backlog of more than 1 million cases in the immigration court system that has left immigrants waiting for years in the United States for decisions.
The Trump administration added another hurdle for Biden last week, when it completed sweeping rules that restrict the eligibility criteria for asylum seekers and that direct asylum officers to deny most claims based on domestic abuse or gang violence.
Immigration advocacy organizations have called for Mayorkas not only to roll back those policies, but to revamp a system at the border that has been the point of contention for multiple administrations.
But he has walked the tightrope when faced with those questions before.
When Mayorkas finished his speech at Georgetown in 2016, an audience member pressed him on whether the Obama administration’s funding for detention centers allowed it to prevent “undue suffering from the family separation and community disruption that immigrant detention inevitably causes.”
“Things are in tension. Many have expressed profound concern with the detention of families, with the detention of children,” Mayorkas said, while also acknowledging the concern of deportation officers who had warned that some migrants would not appear at their court hearings if they were released. “Where one comes out on that, one has to give due consideration to all of the factors and answer it fundamentally with what you think is most important.”

The murder attracted global attention: A white South African farmer was shot dead in his home last year, not long after seeing his vineyards invaded by shack dwellers.
The farmer, Stefan Smit, reported receiving death threats after seeking to evict the squatters, whose housing occupation had become a flash point in a wider political fight over land in South Africa.
So when Smit was killed in June 2019, some people saw the case as evidence of targeted attacks against white farmers — a rallying point among local white minority rights groups and their allies in the United States who claim, despite contrary evidence, that white farmers are killed at higher rates than other South Africans.
That narrative has been upended now, after the arrest of three people on murder charges — including Zurenah Smit, 54, Stefan Smit’s widow.
Police began the arrests Thursday, bringing in two Cape Town men, including a former police officer whom Stefan Smit had hired to help with security. A police spokesman said that day the police had also raided the home of a 54-year-old woman who escaped and became a fugitive, but they would not identify her.
On Monday, Zurenah Smit turned herself in at the Stellenbosch police station, officials said, and she was confirmed as the third person to be charged with murder in connection with Stefan Smit’s shooting.
In text messages with a reporter for The New York Times, Zurenah Smit claimed she was the victim of “conspiracies” and said, without producing evidence, that she had received multiple death threats. She would not respond to questions about being considered a suspect in the case.
According to local news reports, Zurenah Smit was present the night of the shooting, when four men entered the farmhouse through an unlocked door and fired several times at her husband. A bodyguard hired by Stefan Smit, Bradley van Eyslend, was in an adjoining room but later told investigators that he hadn’t heard any gunshots.
Van Eyslend was not one of the men charged, officials said. But his half brother, Derek Sait, who was also part of Stefan Smit’s security team, was one of the two men arrested Thursday.
Stefan Smit was known to be extremely vigilant about security, and the unlocked door struck people who knew him as suspicious, said Julian Jansen, a journalist who has covered the case. Stefan Smit’s electric perimeter fence showed no signs of forced entry, and video footage showed no attackers arriving or leaving.
Yet in a country where farm killings have become a divisive and combustible issue, Stefan Smit’s killing immediately made headlines. Provincial authorities pledged to establish a new farm safety program, calling Smit’s murder “an attack on the economy.” On Fox News, Tucker Carlson devoted a segment to what he called “racist violence as brutal and indefensible as anything that happened under apartheid.”
While there are cases of white farmers being murdered in South Africa, sometimes brutally, there is no indication this stands out from the nation’s generally high levels of violent crime, according to researchers and fact-checking groups. Nechama Brodie, a researcher who studies violence in South Africa, said that farm killings were typically associated with criminal violence, not politically motivated attacks on white farmers.
In Smit’s case, media coverage is starting to focus on an apparent dispute between his family and Zurenah Smit, his second wife.
Several months before his death, according to local news media, he had removed Zurenah Smit from his will, excluding her from an estate worth at least $7 million. Included in that figure was about $3 million from selling the occupied portion of his farm to the local municipality. But after he was shot, Zurenah Smit produced a different will proclaiming her to be the executor of the estate. Zurenah Smit claimed that she had found the document folded inside a Bible.
In recent court filings, one of Stefan Smit’s daughters, Martine Smit, submitted a forensic report by a police handwriting expert claiming that Stefan Smit’s signature on that document had been forged.
Smit’s daughters and first wife declined to comment on the case for this article.

After Electoral College Votes, More Republicans Warily Accept Trump’s Loss

Support for President Donald Trump’s attempt to overturn his election loss began to collapse in the Senate on Monday after the Electoral College certified President-elect Joe Biden’s victory, with many top Republicans saying the time had come to recognize results that have been evident for weeks.
While they insisted that Trump could still challenge the results in court, the senators said the certification should be considered the effective conclusion of an election that has fiercely divided the country. And after weeks of silence as Trump and others in their party sought to overturn the results in increasingly extreme ways, some urged their colleagues to move on.
“I understand there are people who feel strongly about the outcome of this election, but in the end, at some point, you have to face the music,” Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the Republicans’ No. 2 in the Senate, told reporters in the Capitol. “And I think once the Electoral College settles the issue today, it’s time for everybody to move on.”
Even Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who initially fanned Trump’s claims of fraud in key battleground states, said he now saw only “a very, very narrow path for the president” and had spoken with Biden and some of his likely Cabinet nominees.
“I don’t see how it gets there from here, given what the Supreme Court did,” he added, referring to the justices’ decision Friday to reject a long-shot suit by Texas seeking to overturn the results in a handful of states Biden won.
During a virtual event with supporters Monday night, Biden expressed optimism about how Republicans would respond to him as president, and said he had already heard from seven Republican senators “saying they want to work with me.”
The comments amounted to a notable and swift sea change in a body that for weeks has essentially refused to acknowledge the inevitable, although the shift was far from unanimous. Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate majority leader, stayed conspicuously silent Monday, declining to acknowledge Biden’s victory. He dedicated his only public remarks to stimulus negotiations and ignored a question about the Electoral College proceeding shouted by a reporter in the Capitol.
A small group of Republican senators congratulated Biden almost immediately in November. But a majority had gone to great rhetorical lengths to avoid enraging a president who could turn their own voters against them — even as they privately conceded he had lost.
It was unclear Monday if those who relented were a harbinger of a larger shift by elected Republicans to accept Trump’s defeat, or a sign of a growing rift within the party between those willing to accept reality and those — a loyal core in the Senate and the vast majority in the House — who appear ready to follow him wherever he leads.
McConnell’s allies said that he would honor the election outcome come January, but did not want to pick a fight with Trump now, for fear of damaging Republicans’ chances in a pair of January Senate runoff elections in Georgia that will decide control of the chamber. He is also concerned, they said, that doing so could jeopardize a string of year-end legislative priorities that will require the president’s signature, including a catchall spending measure and the stimulus package to address the continuing toll of the pandemic.
But the effect has been that the most powerful Republican on Capitol Hill has, by intention or inaction, left unchecked insidious claims by Trump and those backing him undermining faith in the democratic process and Biden’s legitimacy as president.
One by one Monday, many of McConnell’s closest allies, including most of his leadership team, began to break ranks.
“I think he is president-elect, subject to whatever additional litigation is ongoing,” said Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the former second-ranking Republican, referring to Biden as the winner of the election for the first time. “I’m not aware of any.”
Cornyn sought to discourage members of his own party from challenging the electoral results further when Congress meets in a joint session in early January to tally and finalize the outcome.
“That would be a bad mistake,” he said. “I think there comes a time when you have to realize that despite your best efforts, you’ve been unsuccessful. It’s sort of the nature of these elections. You’ve got to have a winner and you’ve got to have a loser.”
Sen. Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the longest-serving Republican, captured the grudging acceptance of many of his colleagues after the Electoral College action when asked by a reporter if he now considered Biden the president-elect.
“I don’t have to — the Constitution does,” he said as he hustled to a vote. “I follow the Constitution.”
Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, a Republican who rode Trump’s coattails to reelection last month, called Biden the “presumptive president,” pending the outcome of any lawsuits yet unresolved.
Others were more direct.
“We’ll deal with Vice President Biden as the president-elect,” said Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri, chair of the Republican Policy Committee and the congressional panel planning next year’s inauguration.
After initially dismissing a query about the Electoral College results as a “gotcha question,” Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, the third-ranking Republican leader, said he would “respect the result of the Electoral College vote today” even if he was disappointed.
“The presidential election is over,” said Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, a close ally of McConnell’s. “States have certified the votes. Courts have resolved disputes. The electors have voted. I hope that President Trump will put the country first.”
Still, many of Trump’s most ardent backers did not appear ready to change course.
Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., planned to convene a hearing Wednesday to give Trump’s claims an airing in the halls of Congress.
That posture has infuriated Democrats and even some Republicans, who warned again Monday that by pressing Trump’s false claims about the election, the party was willfully misleading voters and abetting a threat to the democratic process itself.
“It is unacceptable for political candidates to treat our election system as though we are a third-world nation and incite distrust of something so basic as the sanctity of our vote,” Rep. Paul Mitchell of Michigan wrote in a letter to Ronna McDaniel, the Republican National Committee chair, and Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California, the party’s top House leader.
Mitchell, a member of his party’s leadership who is retiring, released the letter shortly after his state cast its 16 electoral votes for Biden. He wrote that he was leaving the Republican Party over its refusal to accept Trump’s defeat, and warned that his colleagues were risking “long-term harm to our democracy.”
“If Republican leaders collectively sit back and tolerate unfounded conspiracy theories and ‘stop the steal’ rallies without speaking out for our electoral process, which the Department of Homeland Security said was ‘the most secure in American history,’ our nation will be damaged,” Mitchell wrote.

A Day That Settled an Election and Brought Hope for Defeating a Pandemic

WASHINGTON — When future historians close the books on the misery of 2020, a grueling year of disease, death, racial strife, street violence, economic collapse and political discord the likes of which have not been seen in the United States in generations, they may look back on Monday, Dec. 14, as a pivotal juncture.
It was on that day that Americans began rolling up their sleeves for a vaccine produced in record time to defeat a virus even as the death toll crossed 300,000. And it was on that day that members of the Electoral College gathered in each of the 50 states to ratify the end of the most polarized election in more than a century.
None of that erases the enormous damage of the past 12 months, nor does it mean there will not be pain and protest to come. Many Americans will get sick and die in the months before the vaccine is universally available. Many Americans will remain aggrieved by the result of an election they wish had gone the other way. It is still an era of hardship and division. But after so much uncertainty, after so much doubt, the way forward appears clearer at least in two major respects.
“It is a cosmic convergence,” said Benjamin L. Ginsberg, a leading Republican election lawyer who has been critical of President Donald Trump’s efforts to overturn the vote that he lost. “And what’s good about both of the events occurring on the same day is it really can provide a turning point for a nation that really wants a turning point.”
The day played out in a remarkable fashion as television viewers watched images of health care workers receiving lifesaving injections juxtaposed with live shots from state capitals around the country showing electors casting votes formally confirming the victory of President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris.
It was the definitiveness of both developments that stood out after months of political, medical and economic turmoil: At last, Americans can look ahead to the day when they will be immunized from the COVID-19 virus even if takes until spring. And now they know despite all the postelection noise from the White House and its allies who will be the next president.
“I honestly can’t recall two independent events of such extreme importance occurring on the same day,” said David Oshinsky, a professor of medicine at New York University’s Langone Health and a historian who wrote a Pulitzer Prize-winning account of the development of the polio vaccine that eliminated a scourge of the 20th century.
He said it was as if one were to combine the seminal election of 1800 between John Adams and Thomas Jefferson that set the precedent for presidential contests with the day that President Dwight D. Eisenhower thanked Dr. Jonas Salk for developing the polio vaccine. “In our bitterly divided country, Dec. 14, 2020, should remind us of who we are and what we are capable of,” Oshinsky said.
For Trump, the dean of denial who has refused to accept either the election results or the severity of the coronavirus pandemic, the clarity of Dec. 14 was not entirely welcome. He had reason to celebrate the debut of the vaccine, which he made a top priority and will surely count as a major part of his legacy even though he otherwise has played down the threat of the virus and undercut public health efforts to stem the outbreak through masks and social distancing. “First Vaccine administered,” he wrote on Twitter. “Congratulations USA! Congratulations WORLD!”
But he was not so ready to congratulate Biden, or accept the verdict of the Electoral College, even though it is vested by the Constitution with the power to determine the next president by majority vote. Trump remained out of sight all day, offered no concession and continued to pump out false claims of fraud supposedly so prevalent that it would justify overturning the will of the people.
Indeed, in what came across as an effort to distract attention from his loss in the Electoral College, Trump just minutes after California’s electors meeting in Sacramento put Biden over the top abruptly announced the departure of Attorney General William Barr, who had angered the president by refuting his fantastical assertions about widespread election corruption.
With that process complete, Trump’s refusal to accept defeat became little more than railing against the weather. There may be more futile lawsuits filed to go with the dozens that have already been dismissed all the way up to the Supreme Court, and some of his allies may object when Electoral College votes are officially counted by Congress on Jan. 6, but none of that will change the outcome.
Never in American history has a majority vote by the Electoral College been reversed. Like it or not, Biden will be sworn in on Jan. 20.
“This day feels like a turning point because in both cases we have reality breaking through — a legally mandated deadline to end the election cycle being met in an orderly way and a carefully reviewed and tested vaccine being brought into general use,” said Yuval Levin, director of social, cultural and constitutional studies at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.
“In both cases,” he added, “institutionalism and professionalism have made it through the storm and are functioning under pressure. It’s a relief, and also an indication of what we need more of in the years to come to recover our balance as a society.”
Not everyone was quite ready to write off the tumult of 2020, which has been marked by the deadliest pandemic in a century, the most cataclysmic economic collapse since the Great Depression, the worst racial strife since the civil rights era and the most divisive and contested aftermath to an election since shortly after the Civil War. Some were not sure a corner had really been turned.
“It’s a good day,” said Jill Lepore, the prominent Harvard University scholar who has written sweeping books on American history. “But these last years, it has often felt as though the country is falling down an empty well. You keep thinking, OK, finally, we’ve hit bottom, and can begin trying to crawl our way up and out. But then you realize, we haven’t hit bottom; we’re just on a ledge, and then we start falling all over again. A few weeks ago, it seemed like the bottom. And today, maybe someone has sent down a rope. Two ropes! Hard to trust, though.”
It is only in that context that such normally prosaic acts as a nurse giving someone a shot and electors casting votes become so noteworthy. With America having failed so miserably at controlling the virus, which is now at or near records in new cases, hospitalizations and deaths, the mere promise of a vaccine had television news crews tracking trucks delivering the miracle doses as they began making their way across the country.
The Electoral College has never merited wall-to-wall coverage before either. What is typically a ministerial process simply translating the Election Day results into 538 votes divided among the states and the District of Columbia became a daylong event for CNN and MSNBC — CNN even had a graphic at the bottom of its screen tabulating the votes as they came in as if there were any actual suspense.
But it is still a polarized country. Over at Fox News, even as California sealed the victory for Biden, the hosts were busy instead hashing through the latest in the investigation of his son Hunter Biden, although some of them did refer to his father as the “president-elect.” The new president-to-be sought to ignore that and to focus on the day’s events.
Even as Trump remained cloistered in the White House, Biden emerged to try to pivot the country forward. “Now it’s time to turn the page, as we’ve done throughout our history,” he said. “To unite. To heal.”
At least for one day.

In the end, democracy carried the day.
Wisconsin’s 10 electors calmly walked into a quiet State Capitol on Monday, seeing more police officers than protesters. As they waited to officially cast their ballots, the socially distanced Democratic officials and activists took selfies in an ornate wood-paneled room. When the vote finally came, one elector added hearts to the checks on the lines for the Democratic president ticket, in a rare display of emotion.
“We made it,” said Gov. Tony Evers, relief flooding his voice, after announcing the final tally — a unanimous vote for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.
When the Electoral College cast its ballots for Biden on Monday, the moment felt both extraordinary and repetitive. After all, the president-elect and his team have been winning the election since November, emerging victorious again and again in court cases, legislative hearings and recounts.
Yet the extraordinary assault by President Donald Trump and his allies on the election and their efforts to disenfranchise millions of voters exposed the creaky, administrative mechanics of American democracy.
And on Monday, the bureaucracy bit back.
From Hillary Clinton flashing a thumbs up after casting her vote as a New York state elector to the shadow gatherings held by Republicans in battleground states, it was a day marked more by symbolism, and emotion for some, than by surprise.
Robin Smith, a Democratic activist and librarian in Lansing, got choked up as she cast her ballot for the president-elect, wearing a Biden/Harris face mask and a red, white and blue jeweled donkey pin for the Democratic Party.
“‘Stay present, Mom. Stay in the moment,’” Smith said her daughter urged over text. “As a Black female, it really means everything to me.”
Before the official votes in Maryland, Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican who was an early critic of Trump’s efforts to sow doubt in the election results, called the event a “civics lesson” — perhaps a nameless dig at the president.
“The peaceful transition of power that we formally take part in here today is a hallmark of our democracy that has been handed down for more than 220 years,” Hogan said. “It is a reminder that despite our differences, we are united as Americans who honor the will of the people.”
As Hogan noted, the history of American democracy was on display — as were its many quirks.
In Kentucky, electors pledged that they had not been involved in a duel with a deadly weapon, a part of the state’s oath added in the early 1800s because too many residents were killing one another.
In Alabama, electors listened to a lecture on the history of their role from an actor dressed as Uncle Sam before casting their nine votes for Trump.
And in New Hampshire, Mary Carey Foley, a retired high school teacher who first met Biden nearly four decades ago, described her political lineage as a third-generation elector, detailing the votes of her mother in 1972 and grandmother in 1946.
Most unusual, perhaps, was that anyone was talking about electors at all. As the country marked 300,000 deaths from the coronavirus, and anxiously watched the rollout of a vaccine, Americans found themselves bombarded by obscure officials casting ballots and signing them multiple times — proceedings that were shown on cable news throughout the day.
Over glitchy internet streams, the electors aimed for transparency, both an effort to defang the conspiracy theories that have gained traction among Trump backers and a tacit admission that some conservatives are unlikely to ever accept the outcome of the election. Those theories flourished on the live chat streams that accompanied the meetings, a uniquely 2020 mix of champagne emojis and conspiracy theories.
In Nevada, six electors meeting over a publicly livestreamed video chat held signed ballots to their screens to be counted by Mark Wlaschin, the state’s deputy secretary of state for elections. As they did, the chatter offered a glimpse into a nation divided.
“We all know Trump is having a meltdown right now!” wrote a user who went by Clorox Bleach, followed by four laughing emoji faces.
Based Hillbilly shot back: “I’m a Trump supporter and I’m not mad cuz Biden will never be president.”
Last week, the Supreme Court rejected a desperate effort by Trump allies to change the outcome of the election, shredding a long-shot strategy that depended on barring four states won by Biden from casting their electoral votes and persuading Republican-controlled state legislatures to select alternative slates of friendly electors.
Trump now finds himself with few remedies to change the outcome of the election, though that hardly stopped some supporters from continuing to push fantastical plans.
Much of the last-ditch efforts centered on what some Trump allies called “an alternate slate of electors” — die-hard supporters who gathered in state capitols to vote for Trump. The self-proclaimed electors are not certified by state executives and have no legal standing, according to legal experts.
That didn’t stop them from a little live-action role-playing of the typically mundane inner workings of democracy.
Outside the Michigan State Capitol on Monday, 10 of the so-called Republican electors vowed to cast their ballots for Trump before being denied entry by the state police.
Bernadette Comfort, the Pennsylvania chair of the Trump campaign, called the shadow event in her state a “procedural vote” taken at the request of the campaign.
“This was in no way an effort to usurp or contest the will of the Pennsylvania voters,” she said.
Josh Shapiro, the state’s Democratic attorney general and one of its 20 electors, cast the effort in far less sympathetic terms: “A ridiculous charade,” he told CNN shortly after voting for Biden.
Across the country, some of Trump’s allies seemed far more ready to accept electoral reality. After California officially affirmed Biden’s victory, several Republican senators finally acknowledged the Democrat as the president-elect on Monday evening, a reversal from weeks of public denial among GOP lawmakers on Capitol Hill.
The top Republican leaders in the Michigan Legislature acknowledged Trump’s loss on Monday, reiterating their refusal to cave to the president’s calls to interfere with the electoral process.
“I fought hard for President Trump — nobody wanted him to win more than me,” said Speaker Lee Chatfield. “But I love our republic, too. I can’t fathom risking our norms, traditions and institutions to pass a resolution retroactively changing the electors for Trump.”
He added: “I fear we’d lose our country forever.”
After weeks of harassment and death threats aimed at election officials, only a handful of Trump supporters gathered outside state capitol buildings on Monday — a sign of diminishing hope even among the president’s more ardent backers that he could prevail.
In Madison, a small group made a slow march around the Capitol on a frigid afternoon, carrying rosaries, statutes of the Blessed Virgin and plenty of grievances about the election.
“We’re not protesting, we’re praying,” explained Geralyn Kettermann, 65, of Fulton Township, Wisconsin, who held a sign that read: “Jail Wisconsin Election Commission! All Trump votes stolen!”
Democrats, too, saw some opportunity to fuel their political battles. Nikema Williams, the Democratic state party chairwoman of Georgia, opened the proceedings by taking a bit of a victory lap. As she spoke, long voting lines grew across the state, with the start of in-person balloting in two crucial runoff races that will determine control of the Senate.
“Georgian voters are very powerful, and we’re going to prove it again soon,” Williams said. “Georgians have known it for years, and now the nation knows that Georgia is a blue state.”
Williams was looking ahead to next month. And others were looking ahead too — with less of an assured view that this chapter is really closing.
Since Nov. 7, when Biden won the presidency and the Trump campaign accelerated its attacks on the process, Americans had looked to the Electoral College vote as a finish line.
Now, as the country crossed it, not everyone was so confident.
“As this event comes to a close, it is evident that this is not the end of the discussion about the 2020 election nor how we conduct elections going forward,” said Katie Hobbs, Arizona’s Democratic secretary of state. “This is likely the beginning of a lengthy debate.”

Texto completo: La cantante FKA Twigs ha demandado a su exnovio Shia LaBeouf por presunta agresión sexual, violencia física y maltrato psicológico reiterado, afirmando que el actor abusó de ella “sin descanso” durante el período en que estuvieron juntos.
La artista de 32 años presentó su denuncia en Los Ángeles, donde habrían ocurrido parte de los graves hechos que expone. La pareja salió durante menos de un año antes de su ruptura en mayo de 2019.
La demanda detalla, entre otras acusaciones, que en una ocasión LaBeouf conducía a toda velocidad en febrero de 2019 cuando se sacó el cinturón y amenazó con estrellar el vehículo si FKA no le profesaba su amor y le decía que lo amaba.
Según recoge The New York Times, ambos regresaban en ese momento de un viaje por el desierto, donde la estrella de la saga ‘Transformers’ se habría enfurecido con la cantante llegando incluso a mitad de la noche, en una oportunidad, a intentar asfixiarla mientras dormía .
La artista le habría entonces suplicado que la dejara salir del auto. Ante ello, especifica la denuncia, Shia se detuvo en una estación de servicio y, cuando ella sacó su equipaje del baúl, LaBeouf habría comenzado a seguirla y a agredirla, arrojándola contra el auto mientras le gritaba en la cara obligándola a regresar al coche, indica la demanda. FKA también acusa al actor de agredirla con fuerza en distintas partes del cuerpo y en distintas ocasiones hasta provocarle moretones .
La artista declaró en una entrevista que su objetivo al denunciar los hechos de los que habría sido víctima se centra en explicar cómo incluso una figura aclamada por la crítica, “con dinero, un hogar y una sólida red de seguidores, podría verse atrapada” en tal situación.
“ Me gustaría poder crear conciencia sobre las tácticas que usan los abusadores para controlarte y despojarte de ti misma “, dijo la también bailarina, productora y actriz nacida como Tahliah Debrett Barnett.
LaBeouf respondió a las acusaciones de FKA y de una segunda exnovia que lo acusó de comportamiento abusivo, enviando un email a The New York Times y refiriéndose a su propia conducta personal y sus problemas de adicción.
“No estoy en posición de decirle a nadie cómo les hizo sentir mi comportamiento. No tengo excusas para mi alcoholismo o agresión. He sido abusivo conmigo mismo y con todos los que me rodearon durante años. Tengo un historial de lastimar a las personas más cercanas. Me avergüenzo de esa historia y lo siento por los heridos. No hay nada más que pueda decir”, reconoció el actor. Y agregó que permanece en tratamiento de rehabilitación. “No me he curado de mi trastorno de estrés postraumático y alcoholismo”, escribió, “pero estoy comprometido a hacer lo que tenga que hacer para recuperarme”.
La demanda fue presentada ante el Tribunal Superior de Los Ángeles y dice también que LaBeouf contagió a FKA Twigs, a sabiendas, una enfermedad de transmisión sexual .

The Next Vaccine Challenge: Reassuring Older Americans

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
He can barely see or hear, but 95-year-old Frank Bruno lives on his own terms: alone, unafraid and now — thanks to the coronavirus vaccine — “ironclad,” as he describes it.
Bruno, an artist and World War II veteran, volunteered for the Moderna clinical trial only because his nephew was doing so. He thought he may have received the vaccine and not a placebo because he had some mild side effects; he became certain after he tested positive for antibodies.
He was delighted with the freedom the shot afforded him. He needed to have his shower fixed and wanted to see his nephew; he felt able to do both without fear of the virus.
As for side effects? “I’ve had mosquito bites bothered me worse than that,” he said. “I just can’t understand why people are afraid.”
Bruno and older Americans like him are pivotal to the success of the vaccination campaign now rolling out across the United States. Members of his age group are the most likely to be hospitalized and to die from COVID-19, and the least likely to muster a strong immune response to the coronavirus.
In some states, nearly 40% of deaths from COVID-19 have occurred among residents of nursing homes. That’s why an advisory committee of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine be given first to the nearly 3 million residents of long-term-care homes.
But one member of the committee, Dr. Helen “Keipp” Talbot, voted against the recommendation, saying that the vaccines had not been tested enough in frail populations and that bad medical outcomes coinciding with the immunization — common in that age group — could undermine public confidence in the new vaccine. (Talbot declined to be interviewed for this article.)
But other experts on the committee said all available evidence indicated the vaccine is safe and effective for nursing home residents and older Americans generally.
“The vaccine seems to be performing as well as one would like, even in very old populations,” said Dr. Stanley Perlman, an immunologist at the University of Iowa and a member of vaccine advisory committees of both the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration.
“There’s nothing to say it won’t be safe,” he added.
There was some reason for scientists to wonder whether a coronavirus vaccine might not work as well in the elderly. As people age, bodily defenses against pathogens weaken, and the response to vaccines also falters.
The drugmakers Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline said on Friday that their vaccine seemed not to work well in older people, because the dosage was too low to generate a sufficient immune response in that population.
“For many, the immune response can sometimes be diminished or dampened or delayed,” said Dr. Sharon Inouye, a geriatrician at Harvard Medical School.
Scientists have devised workarounds by overloading vaccines with the viral proteins that provoke an immune response, or turbocharging them with adjuvants — chemicals that strengthen the immune response.
“That’s why the shingles vaccine has twice as much antigen as the chickenpox vaccine,” Perlman said.
Pfizer and Moderna did not provide statistics regarding their vaccines’ effectiveness in people over age 80, but the data do show the vaccines have performed well in all volunteers over age 65.
Dr. Timothy Farrell, a geriatrician at the University of Utah, said he was surprised but thrilled by the vaccines’ effectiveness in this group. “It’s going to be very important to see the subgroup analysis,” he said — that is, to learn whether there are significant differences after age 85.
Even so, he has been recommending the vaccine to all of his patients, who range in age from 65 to 106 years old.
“We have a clear and present danger of COVID, and we have social isolation,” Farrell said. “We know that that’s an independent risk factor for mortality, even stronger than individual chronic diseases.”
Inouye also arrived at the same conclusion, both professionally and personally.
Her 91-year-old mother, who lives in an assisted living facility, is independent and spry, still playing piano and bridge and exercising regularly. Still, her mother’s age, medical condition and living situation put her at “very, very, very high risk for COVID,” Inouye said.
“We’re just desperately worried about her every single day,” she added. “When you balance that tremendous fear, I just think the risk for her of getting COVID is so much higher than the risk of a side effect, which we know is going to be very rare.”
For many people, the prospect of receiving a new vaccine for a new virus is daunting.
Fear of side effects deterred Jeffrey Balkind’s wife from volunteering for the vaccine trials, but Balkind, 74, has stared down death twice — once during a 13-day hijacking in Pakistan in 1981, and again three years ago when his Vespa crashed.
“When you’ve come to near-death experiences twice, volunteering for a vaccine trial — it wasn’t a great sense of worry or apprehension for me,” Balkind said.
Balkind had no side effects after he received his shot, leading him to believe he got the placebo. He is now trying to see if he can qualify for the vaccine along with other volunteers who received placebos.
Some people worry, incorrectly, that the vaccine may somehow give them COVID-19. In fact, the vaccine carries instructions to make only a single protein from the virus.
“I think if I get the corona shot, I will get the corona,” said Mahine Ebrani, 79, who lives in New York City. No amount of persuasion from her grandchildren and their partners — five of whom are medical professionals — has convinced her otherwise.
Every time she gets a flu shot, Ebrani said, she feels unwell for three days, with headaches and a deep exhaustion. But she gets that vaccine anyway, because she feels healthy the rest of the year and because her doctor has told her she should.
Reaching patients like Ebrani, as well as the many homebound older people in subsidized housing units or rural areas who are unlikely to line up at a CVS or a Walgreens for the vaccine, will require close coordination between state and local governments — and geriatricians, experts said.
“How are they going to know where to go?” Farrell said. “How are they going to get there?”
Bruno, for example, lives alone in the tiny town of Rio Rico, Arizona, 3 miles from the closest mailbox and a 20-minute drive from his nephew Neil.
Put off at first by the litany of possible side effects recited by the doctor who screened him for the trial, Bruno later became impressed with the thoroughness of the experiment. He said he was closely monitored and never doubted that the vaccine was safe.
He pooh-poohed the idea that people in nursing homes might be frailer than him, and may not fare as well.
“I’m pretty darn frail, when you get right down to it,” he said. “You know, if my mother was alive, she’d be about 130, and I would recommend the shot to her.”

One of the traditions of modern-day election cycles is the two-step dance that candidates perform in launching their campaigns. First comes the string of obvious clues: a listening tour, speeches delivered at Sunday church, and perhaps even an announcement of an exploratory bid.
Then comes the actual launch, normally filled with live fanfare, music and hope, and accompanied by an introductory campaign video.
In the race for New York City mayor, both parts of the two-step dance were on display last week. Shaun Donovan, a former housing secretary and budget director under President Barack Obama, officially launched his campaign Tuesday; two days later, Kathryn Garcia, who recently stepped down as the city’s sanitation commissioner, did the same.
Amid those intentional campaign rollouts, a seemingly unintentional launch also materialized Thursday: Rep. Max Rose registered a mayoral campaign committee with the city Campaign Finance Board. Two days later, in an interview with The New York Times, he confirmed that he had begun an exploratory bid.
If that wasn’t enough, next year’s dozens of races — including the mayor’s — also saw a curious $1 million contribution, although it was not immediately clear which candidate might benefit the most from it. Here are takeaways from the week that was.
Real Estate’s $1 Million Bet
Real estate developer Stephen M. Ross, who has been casting about for a way to influence next year’s elections, appears to have found a means to do so.
The Hudson Yards developer donated $1 million in December to a new independent expenditure committee called Common Sense NYC, according to state finance records. The committee has raised nearly $1.5 million so far, the rest of it from real estate and business executives like Jack Cayre of Midtown Equities and Isaac Ash, chief executive of United Legwear and Apparel, each of whom donated $100,000.
Business leaders in New York have long been frustrated with Mayor Bill de Blasio, and have been looking for a more business-friendly candidate to support. The pandemic-fueled financial crisis has only deepened the business community’s resolve, and some leaders had successfully encouraged Raymond J. McGuire, a Wall Street executive, to enter the race.
Independent expenditure committees are not allowed to coordinate with a candidate or a campaign. While no one affiliated with Common Sense NYC would comment for this story, a person familiar with its goals — driving the conversation surrounding the future of the city, including its fiscal health, quality of life, public education, infrastructure and homelessness — said it only just began raising money and plans to accumulate significantly more before too long.
That person also said the group was focused on many of next year’s New York City elections, not just the mayor’s race. In 2021, more than 30 of the City Council’s 51 seats are up for grabs, as are the mayor’s and the comptroller’s offices, according to New York City’s Campaign Finance Board.
Look Who’s Running
In the unsexy area of managerial competence, Garcia and Donovan are hoping to distinguish themselves from the field, and from de Blasio, whose management style has become the subject of intense criticism.
Both leaned heavily on their experience captaining large, complicated bureaucracies — not the flashiest pitch for mayor, but one they hope will resonate at a time of profound crisis for New York City.
Garcia, de Blasio’s go-to crisis manager in addition to being his former sanitation commissioner, launched her campaign for mayor with a 14-minute announcement on Zoom and a straightforward message.
“You won’t find a candidate who has more experience in New York City government than me,” she said.
She spoke from the same Park Slope living room from which she has participated in several mayoral forums. She cited her energy, her work ethic and her first notable endorsement, from Harry Nespoli, president of the Uniformed Sanitationmen’s Association.
She called for converting Rikers Island into a composting and renewable energy zone and for electrifying school buses. But above all, she called for good management and “grit.”
“For 14 years, my job has been to solve problems for New York, and I’ve got no plan to stop now,” she said. Garcia was also the interim head of the New York City Housing Authority, among other duties. But she made no mention of de Blasio by name.
Two days earlier, Donovan made his own formal announcement, also by Zoom. He made passing reference to his time working as city housing commissioner, but, like Garcia, made no explicit mention of the mayor for whom he worked, Michael Bloomberg.
Instead, he spoke in soaring tones about equity and New York City resilience, and about his time working for the Obama administration as budget director and housing secretary. He pitched his federal connections as a salve for local problems.
“I know the heart, talent and values of the president- and vice president-elect firsthand,” he said. “The remarkable, diverse team they’re putting together includes many I have been proud to serve with and call my friends.”
This week, he is expected to roll out his climate agenda, which will call for the city to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, in part by working to close the city’s dirtiest power plants, known as “peaker plants,” and improving bus transportation by creating dedicated busways throughout the city.
Look Who’s Likely Running
It may be a few weeks before the official announcement, but it appears clear that Andrew Yang intends to enter the mayoral race.
Yang, who was born in New York state and lives in Manhattan, gained a loyal following as a Democratic presidential candidate, largely because of his proposal to give every American a universal basic income.
He has been meeting with political power brokers in the city, and has told some of them that he plans to run. He has also enlisted two prominent New York-based political strategists with ties to Bloomberg.
As for Rose, who lost his bid for reelection last month in a conservative district that covers Staten Island and South Brooklyn, he refused to explain or elaborate on his registration with the Campaign Finance Board.
“If you want someone with experience and guts and ability to end our broken politics, then I could be your candidate,” he told the Times on Saturday.
Public-School Parents
De Blasio is a rarity among New York City mayors: He is believed to be the first mayor in half a century who has had a child in public schools while in office.
His son, Dante, attended Brooklyn Technical High School in Brooklyn, and his daughter, Chiara, graduated from Beacon High School in Manhattan before he became mayor.
A front-runner in the race to replace de Blasio, Scott Stringer, the city comptroller, has two young sons who attend public schools. He discussed his struggles as a parent during the pandemic in an interview with the Times last week. Stringer has already declared himself a candidate.
Yang has a son, Damian, 5, who attends a public school. His older son, Christopher, who is 8 and has autism, attends a private school. Both are learning online during the pandemic.
Two others — McGuire and Maya Wiley, a former top counsel for de Blasio who has declared that she is running — send their children to private schools. De Blasio often mentions how navigating the public school system informs his decisions as mayor.
Ranked-Choice Voting
Several members of the City Council’s Black, Latino and Asian Caucus filed a lawsuit in state Supreme Court in Manhattan last week to stop the implementation of ranked-choice voting. Repercussions soon surfaced.
The lawsuit charges that voters have not been properly educated about ranked-choice voting and that it will lead to Black voters being disenfranchised. Two Black mayoral candidates, Eric Adams, the Brooklyn borough president, and Raymond J. McGuire, a business executive, have raised similar concerns.
Under the new system, voters can rank up to five candidates in order of preference. If one candidate receives a majority of first place votes, they win. But if no candidate receives a majority, the last-place winner is eliminated and the second choice votes of those ballots are counted. The process continues until one candidate has won a majority.
But two Black women running for mayor — Maya Wiley and Dianne Morales, an Afro-Latina — support ranked-choice voting.
And at a virtual forum about ranked-choice voting for Brooklyn borough president candidates, Robert E. Cornegy Jr., a councilman from Brooklyn, was criticized by his fellow candidates for participating in the lawsuit.
Many of the candidates at the forum, sponsored by Rank the Vote NYC among other groups, supported ranked-choice voting.
Antonio Reynoso, also a councilman from Brooklyn, said the lawsuit would “insert doubt” and discourage Black people from voting because all six council members who filed the suit are Black, and four of them represent Brooklyn.

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
WASHINGTON — Lawmakers crept toward a possible consensus on Monday on a stimulus deal to address the toll of the pandemic, as a bipartisan group of centrist members of Congress pared back their compromise plan to omit the most contentious sticking points.
The moderate lawmakers proposed a $748 billion package to fund an array of programs that have generated agreement in the stimulus talks — including the revival of federal unemployment payments and a popular small-business loan program — as well as money for vaccine distribution, rental assistance and food aid, and resources for schools and other institutions struggling to stay afloat because of the pandemic.
Notably absent were the two most hotly contested items in the negotiations — $160 billion to bolster state and local governments, and limits on workers’ ability to sue companies that opened during the pandemic — which the group included in a separate bill.
The group’s bifurcated plan amounted to an effort to generate a deal before the holidays that all sides could embrace after months of stalled negotiations. But it also underscored how, with divisions remaining on liability protections for businesses, nonprofits, schools and hospitals and on an allocation of billions of dollars to state and local governments, lawmakers may ultimately jettison both ideas.
Democrats have been resistant to a liability shield, which they say could harm worker protections, and Republicans have been staunchly opposed to what many of them have derided as a “blue-state bailout” for state and local governments facing fiscal crises.
There is no guarantee that leaders in either party will embrace the proposals, with many Democrats still pressing for a more generous package that includes direct payments to struggling Americans, and with many Republicans continuing to oppose another costly round of federal aid.
“We haven’t seen anybody else step forward,” said Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, who urged leadership to use the bills in their final days of talks. “We’ve got your gift. Take it.”
With government funding set to lapse on Friday, any additional pandemic relief is expected to be wrapped into a catchall spending package to keep the government open for the remainder of the fiscal year. With lawmakers nearing an agreement on that legislation, there is little time left to haggle over a stimulus plan.
Millions of Americans could lose jobless benefits when two federal programs that expand and extend the unemployment insurance system expire soon after Christmas. A number of other pandemic relief programs are set to lapse at the end of the year.
The bipartisan proposal would not only extend those unemployment programs for 16 weeks, but it would revive a lapsed supplemental benefit at about $300 a week — half of the original amount — and extend student loan forbearance and eviction moratoriums.
Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the majority leader, had previously proposed discarding the liability protections, a top priority of his, and the state and local aid, a suggestion Democrats initially panned. But after the moderates proposed the two bills on Monday at a news conference on Capitol Hill, Sen. Richard Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, and at least one other Democrat signaled a willingness to abandon both issues in the absence of an agreement.
“It’s a really complicated issue, and trying to reach a full resolution by Friday is going to be very difficult,” said Sen. Angus King, independent of Maine and one of multiple lawmakers who negotiated over the liability language. “We’re going to keep working on it, but it may be that it has to hold over into January.”
It remained unclear whether the moderates’ bipartisan compromise, first outlined shortly after Thanksgiving, would be part of any final deal. Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California spoke with Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, on Monday evening for roughly 20 minutes and continued to push for the inclusion of funds for state and local governments.
Members of the centrist group — including Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Mark Warner, D-Va., as well as Reps. Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., and Tom Reed, R-N.Y. — have huddled for days to hammer out the details. The bipartisan House coalition that Gottheimer and Reed led, known as the Problem Solvers Caucus, is continuing work to merge the two bills into one.
The $748 billion agreement would provide $300 billion for small businesses, restaurants and live-performance venues, as well as $13 billion for emergency food assistance, $82 billion for education, $45 billion for airlines, airports, Amtrak and public transit and $16 billion for testing, tracing and vaccine development and distribution, according to a summary.
Standing at the news conference behind the two stacks of legislation, lawmakers from both parties emphasized that the compromise legislation would not include every priority and that additional legislation could move under the incoming Biden administration.
“These bills are comprehensive, but they don’t cover everything everyone would want,” Collins said. “Undoubtedly, depending on the course of this pandemic, we may have to do more, but surely we can come together and provide this relief before we break for the Christmas holiday.”
But Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has warned Democratic leaders that he would oppose any agreement that did not include direct payments to Americans of $1,200 per adult and $500 per child, a provision that was not expected to be included in either of the bipartisan plans. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., has also lobbied for the inclusion of the direct payments.
“If the United States government wants the American people to have faith in their government in this time of emergency, it has got to respond,” Sanders said in a phone interview. “My immediate demand is two things: You’ve got have strong unemployment benefits, and we’ve got to have the $1,200, plus $500. That’s what has to be in any proposal that is passed.”
Sanders expressed frustration that Democrats appeared poised to accept less than $1 trillion in pandemic relief after the House approved a $3.4 trillion measure in May and after Mnuchin floated a $1.8 trillion package to Pelosi just before the election.
“That’s not a compromise, that’s a collapse, and that is not something that the American people — certainly working families — want to see,” Sanders said. “In my view, Congress just simply cannot go home for the Christmas holidays and turn its back on the suffering of tens of millions of families in this country.”

Early Voting Begins in Georgia for High-Stakes Senate Runoffs

ATLANTA — For weeks, the runoff races for Georgia’s two Senate seats have virtually been impossible for residents to escape, as campaign coverage has dominated the local news and advertisements praising or attacking the candidates have filled every commercial break.
In and around Atlanta, signs on roads and lawns and messages on face masks have urgently pleaded residents to vote one more time.
On Monday, thousands did, as in-person early voting started for the runoff contests that carry considerable stakes for both parties. With Republican control of the Senate hanging in the balance, the races have drawn considerable interest and hundreds of millions of dollars — much of it from outside the state.
President Donald Trump campaigned in Georgia this month for the Republican candidates, and President-elect Joe Biden is scheduled to arrive in Atlanta on Tuesday.
“I feel like all eyes are on Georgia right now,” Joanne Williams, 27, said after she cast her ballot in Atlanta. “It can go in any direction.”
In November, both of the state’s Republican senators, David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, were forced into runoffs, scheduled on Jan. 5, against Democratic challengers.
Perdue faces Jon Ossoff, the chief executive of a media production company; Loeffler is being challenged by the Rev. Raphael G. Warnock, the senior pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church, a prominent pulpit in Atlanta that had once belonged to Martin Luther King Jr.
Democrats have been buoyed by the victory of Biden, the first presidential candidate from the party to win Georgia since 1992. Yet, as Democrats contend that the election signaled the state’s transformation from a reliably Republican stronghold, the runoffs present a major test.
The voting on Monday began amid the turbulence that has trailed the presidential election, as Trump has focused on Georgia while spreading baseless claims of election fraud. Every effort to overturn his loss in the state failed, and on Monday afternoon, the state’s electoral votes were officially awarded to Biden.
Still, Trump continued his attacks against Georgia’s governor, Brian Kemp, a Republican. “What a fool,” the president said in a post on Twitter early Monday. He repeated his argument that Kemp should have called a special session of the state legislature as part of Trump’s effort to win the state.
And in a nod to just how much the presidential election and Trump looms over the runoff, he argued that the situation could spell for a “bad day for two GREAT Senators on January 5th.”
There were concerns that Trump’s barrage of claims — railing against the vote-counting machines that the state used and falsely alleging that mail-in ballots were rife with fraud — could undermine trust in the electoral process and dissuade some voters, particularly his supporters, from participating.
In a news conference on Monday, Brad Raffensperger, the Georgia secretary of state, sought to underscore the integrity of the state’s electoral process. He also rebuffed the barrage of criticism he had received in recent weeks from other Republicans.
“Georgia’s elections are secure,” Raffensperger said. “There are many telling you they aren’t.” He added: “Every person’s vote is important and vital in our system. Every vote matters. Do not let anyone tell you otherwise.”
On Monday, election officials said there had not been any reports of technical problems or other interference at polling locations around the state. Though experts do not expect the runoff to attract as much participation as the general election, many are anticipating high levels of turnout.
Roughly 1.2 million mail-in ballots have so far been requested, state officials said. Many others opted to vote in person. Outside a library near midtown Atlanta, a line of approximately 50 people — in jackets and scarves on a nippy afternoon — spilled out the front door on Monday and snaked around the packed parking lot.
Raymond Floyd, 37, said he felt the charged energy and excitement of the moment as he waited in a line outside the High Museum of Art in midtown Atlanta, a few miles from the state Capitol building where 16 electors voted on Monday to give the state’s 16 electoral votes to Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris.
“I like democracy at work,” said Floyd, who planned to vote for Ossoff and Warnock. Still, he added, “Once this election is over, I’m ready for a sense of normalcy and a sense of respect.”

Some electors received police escorts. Some cast their votes in an undisclosed location. Some drew a nationwide audience for what is usually a procedural and obscure constitutional undertaking. Most wore masks and adhered to social distancing rules in deference to the coronavirus pandemic that has defined this long campaign.
And in the end, President-elect Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 presidential race was affirmed Monday, as he topped the 270 Electoral College votes he needed to move into the White House next month, despite President Donald Trump’s relentless promotion of conspiracy theories and attacks on the integrity of the results.
All of the electors in the key battlegrounds, whose results Trump has contested, delivered their support to Biden.
Here are four takeaways on the longer-term effects of Trump’s refusal to accept the outcome, Biden’s victory and the future of the democratic process in the United States.
Biden Wins, Again
Joe Biden has been elected the 46th president of the United States.
That may not sound like news to those of you who have followed the events of the last five weeks, considering the fact that Biden defeated Trump by more than 7 million votes. But the election is not fully over until the Electoral College weighs in, and that took place Monday. It fell, appropriately enough, to California — a state at the center of the opposition to the president — to put Trump’s Democratic challenger over the top.
The question now is how Republicans who have refused to acknowledge the election outcome will respond to this unsurprising news. Many, including Sen. Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, had argued that the race had simply been called by the news media, and not yet by the Electoral College. They used that reasoning to decline to consider Biden as the president-elect, much less meet with him.
Such an argument is now far more difficult to make. “Now it is time to turn the page,” Biden is expected to say in a speech Monday night.
Democracy Prevailed, but at a Great Price
Yes, a majority of the electors called their ballots for Biden.
But Monday began with a top White House adviser, Stephen Miller, declaring on Fox News that there had been a “fraudulent election result” and saying that “an alternate slate of electors” in contested states would vote and would send their results to Congress from states the president lost.
Miller is not alone; much of the Republican Party still refuses to fully and publicly acknowledge the election results, even as they have been certified by all 50 states, the Electoral College electors have voted and the Supreme Court has declined to hear a legal challenge that Trump had teased as “perhaps the most important case in history.”
Democracy is fragile, and built upon public trust. And while the outcome of this year’s race has been affirmed, the acid messaging of Trump and his allies threatens to weaken the pillars of the institutions that run America’s elections.
“The greatest danger to America is the naive belief that there is something unique that guarantees America will remain a democratic civil society,” Stuart Stevens, a longtime Republican strategist turned vocal Trump critic, said on Twitter. “Much of a major party has turned against democracy. It’s foolish to believe that doesn’t have consequences.”
There are some dissenters. Rep. Paul Mitchell of Michigan, who is retiring and served in House Republican leadership, said Monday that despite voting for Trump last month, he was quitting the party for the remainder of his term, turned off by the efforts to overturn the election.
“I believe that raw political considerations, not constitutional or voting integrity concerns, motivate many in party leadership to support the ‘stop the steal’ efforts, which is extremely disappointing to me,” he wrote in an open letter to party leaders.
The system survived the messy 2000 recount and two presidents elected in the 21st century despite them losing the popular vote. There were some “faithless,” if ultimately meaningless, electors in 2016. The great unknown is the cumulative impact of those past bouts and this year’s further erosion of democratic norms on the next inevitably close and contested election.
Who Knew? These are What Electoral College Meetings Look Like
“I hope you can see me smiling behind the mask.”
Those words from Nancy Mills, chair of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party, came at the end of the balloting in Pennsylvania on Monday, after the state awarded its 20 Electoral College votes to Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris. Biden defeated Trump there by about 81,000 votes.
Mills was serving in her official capacity as president of the Pennsylvania Electoral College delegation. In almost any other presidential election, her role in history would be ceremonial and mostly unnoticed.
Not this year. One of the many unusual things about this election was that Americans were able to see — and wanted to see — what is usually a postscript to Election Day. Starting Monday morning, delegations of electors began gathering in states across the nation, the proceedings carried by live video streams or even on television.
Because of the pandemic, Electoral College members observed social distancing rules and wore masks. But the country could see the solemnity and ceremony that accompany the process even in years when no one is watching. The appointment of the officers for the day. The distribution of the secret ballots. The wait for the official count.
The vote in Pennsylvania was free of any disruption. But Mills did allude to the drama that hung over the day as she brought the proceedings to a close.
“We are the state that put Joseph R. Biden and Kamala Harris over the 270 Electoral College threshold,” she said. “We are the state that returned the dignity and honor to the United States of America.”
Republicans Are (Still) Resisting Reality
Inside the Georgia Capitol, Democratic electors gathered on the floor of the state Senate to cast their votes for Biden as president and Harris as vice president, the first time the state had voted Democratic in 28 years.
“Today, we will fulfill our constitutional duty,” Nikema Williams, chair of the Georgia Democratic Party and a congresswoman-elect, declared as she called the meeting to order.
Elsewhere in the Capitol, a group of Republicans gathered for something of a shadow ceremony, anointing their own slate of pro-Trump electors. The group’s vote had no actual bearing on the Electoral College tally. David Shafer, chair of the Georgia Republican Party, explained the vote of the nonelectors as a bid to keep Trump’s legal options open.
“Had we not meet today and cast our votes, the president’s pending election contest would have been effectively mooted,” he wrote on Twitter.
A similar effort was underway elsewhere, including in Pennsylvania, where the state Republican Party announced a meeting of “electors” for Trump in Harrisburg. The second-slate efforts follow a precedent from the 1960 presidential election between John F. Kennedy and Richard M. Nixon, when some Democrats in Hawaii cast conditional electoral votes for Kennedy while counting and legal challenges continued.
In 2020, the Republican goal posts for when the election will be fully decided keep moving.
The latest circled date is Jan. 6, when Congress has its final say on the election. Some Trump allies are organizing a floor challenge to Biden’s victory.

Joe Biden was affirmed as the president-elect Monday as members of the Electoral College pushed him past the 270 threshold to win the White House, all but ending a disruptive chapter in American history in which President Donald Trump sought to use legal challenges and political pressure to overturn the results of a free and fair election.
The president-elect passed the threshold after California cast its 55 votes for Biden on Monday evening, capping a day marked by heightened security in battleground states and an unusual level of scrutiny for what is normally a formal, procedural affair.
With supporters of Trump promising to mount protests outside of some statehouses, officials took extra steps to ensure the safety of the electors. Lawmakers in Michigan, citing credible threats, closed the Capitol building to the public, as did Wisconsin, where electors in Madison were ushered into a side entrance at the state Capitol for the noon vote.
Yet Monday’s votes were largely smooth; there were no protests that disrupted the proceedings. Indeed, in many battleground states, police officers at the scene outnumbered protesters, and the normally staid process carried out by the Electoral College went uninterrupted.
“It’s not just out of tradition but to show folks, especially now more than ever, our system works,” Gov. Chris Sununu, R-N.H., said before the electors in his state all cast their votes for Biden on Monday morning.
The vote Monday officially sends Biden to the White House, assuming the presidency after a trying election marked by deep divisions and a devastating pandemic that crippled the country and disrupted voting. Biden has been working aggressively to fill out his Cabinet to prepare for when he takes office in January, aiming to have a team ready to combat the coronavirus and begin the long recovery.
The president-elect was expected to speak Monday night about the Electoral College results.
The vote follows six weeks of unprecedented efforts by Trump to intervene in the electoral process and change the outcome of an election he lost by about 7 million votes. He was joined by many Republicans who supported his unfounded claims of voter fraud, including 126 party members in Congress and 17 state attorneys general who supported a case before the Supreme Court that legal experts said had no merit. The court rejected the case Friday.

Claims of ‘Bleak’ Environmental Justice Record Appear to Fell a Biden Favorite

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
WASHINGTON — When Joe Biden won the presidential election, his top candidate to lead the nation’s most powerful environmental agency appeared clear: Mary Nichols, California’s clean air regulator and arguably the country’s most experienced climate change official, was seen as a lock to run the Environmental Protection Agency.
Now Biden’s team is scrambling to find someone else, according to several people who have spoken with the presidential transition team. The chief reason: This month, a group of more than 70 environmental justice groups wrote to the Biden transition charging that Nichols has a “bleak track record in addressing environmental racism.”
Possible last-minute candidates, those people said, include Michael Regan, a senior North Carolina environmental official, and Richard Revesz, a New York University law professor, neither of whom had been in serious contention for the job until late last week. The Biden team is also considering asking Gina McCarthy, who ran the agency in the Obama administration, to return.
The environmental justice groups cited Nichols’ role in pushing California’s cap-and-trade program, which is designed to broadly reduce pollution of planet-warming greenhouse gases — but disproportionately does so at the expense, the groups said, of communities of color by exposing them to more pollutants like smog and soot. The groups charged that Nichols had repeatedly disregarded or dismissed the concerns of those communities about the effects of the climate policies she enacted.
The letter appears to have resonated: One of Biden’s key campaign pledges was a promise to address environmental justice, highlighting the need to protect poor and minority communities that are exposed to more pollution than rich communities.
While Biden had expected that Nichols would be criticized by Republicans for her history of pushing tough regulations on industries, he was caught off guard by the intense objections to Nichols from liberals.
The influence of those groups, and Biden’s reactions to their push, appears to be another signal of the increasing tensions between the left and moderate factions of the Democratic Party. Biden has already been subject to criticism from the left for some of his Cabinet picks, even as he explicitly attempts to build a Cabinet of racial and gender diversity.
The Biden transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
From the perspective of environmental progressives, the push to oust Nichols in the name of environmental justice is of a piece with “the battle for the soul of the party,” said Rich Gold, an energy and environment lobbyist and former senior EPA adviser in the Clinton administration.
Progressive groups and advocates of environmental justice policies say they are heartened that their voices are being heard, and say that elevated consideration of those matters is long overdue.
“Equity and justice were on the ballot,” said Tina Johnson, director of the National Black Environmental Justice Network, who signed the letter urging Biden not to appoint Nichols. “Being transformative means being willing to walk the walk.”
“I’m happy to hear those concerns, from the environmental justice perspective, have been heard,” Johnson said.
But many veteran professionals in the world of environmental policy say that by dropping Nichols from consideration to head the government agency that will likely be Biden’s most important tool in confronting global warming, the president-elect is significantly weakening his chances of enacting tough, legally sound rules to fight climate change.
“There is no one like Mary,” Gold said. “I don’t always agree with her. But let’s talk about the qualifications for the job. There’s just no one who has the leadership experience on climate at the state level, and at the senior political level at EPA.”
Even Nichols’ opponents agree that her experience would have made her a formidable executor of Biden’s climate agenda.
“If I was Joe Biden and I was looking for someone to implement the green agenda, I’d pick Mary Nichols,” said Steven J. Milloy, who led Donald Trump’s transition team and now runs a website promoting the false information about climate change. “She’s dedicated, she’s experienced, she knows the job backward and forward. I don’t agree with a single thing she does. She is a ‘damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead’ type of environmentalist.”
Nichols, 75, was first appointed to run California’s clean air program in 1979 by Gov. Jerry Brown. In the decades since, she has been at the helm of that program as California has been at the vanguard of environmental policy, passing ambitious, first-in-the-nation measures on pollution control and conservation that have often served as models for national and even international environmental law.
During the Clinton administration, she joined the EPA as its top clean air official, then returned to California, where she ran the state’s pioneer cap-and-trade climate change program under Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. During the Obama administration, it was Nichols who helped broker a deal with the federal government and the nation’s largest automakers, which took California’s stringent regulations on planet-warming auto emissions and applied them nationwide. Just as Barack Obama borrowed clean air and climate change strategies from California, Biden is widely expected to do the same.
In an interview last week, when she was still seen as a top contender for the EPA job, Nichols pushed back forcefully at the contention that she has been insensitive to environmental justice issues.
“California is at the forefront of actions anywhere in the nation and the world to direct attention and funding to underfunded communities,” she said.
Nichols noted that the primary objection of environmental justice groups has been her embrace of California’s cap-and-trade policy, a system under which the state has placed a tightening cap on greenhouse emissions from stationary sources but allows companies to buy and sell permits to pollute.
She noted that the program had been put in place because it was the one preferred by Schwarzenegger, the Republican governor who passed the state’s climate bill in 2006 and recruited her to implement it in 2007.
In pushing the system, Schwarzenegger was following the recommendations of policy experts: Economists have said for years that the most effective way to reduce climate pollution is to put a price on emissions, thus driving the market away from pollution.
But environmental justice advocates have maintained that the cap-and-trade system privileges corporations over communities by allowing companies to pay to pollute.
“It’s a moral objection to the notion of people paying to pollute, and the very concept as a way for companies to trade allowances to comply,” Nichols said.
But Nichols said that, under her guidance, the California cap-and-trade program has allocated 40% of the revenues collected from the program to be spent in underprivileged and minority communities.
Even if Biden chooses another person to head his EPA, many of his top climate officials, including John Kerry, the former secretary of state who will serve as the new White House climate envoy, remain proponents of carbon pricing policies.

No, I Am Not Getting Rid of My Thousands of CDs

In the late 1970s, when I was living in Boston, the record store of choice for classical music fans was the Harvard Coop. It had an extensive catalog and informed salespeople eager to offer invariably strong opinions on which albums to buy. I’d often bump into friends and fellow musicians, all of us flipping through bins of LPs. After making a purchase I’d have to squeeze yet more shelf space out of my cramped apartment, but I was pleased at my growing home library.
Then, in 1982, CDs arrived. Slowly everyone started converting from 12-inch vinyl LPs to 4 1/2-inch plastic CDs in jewel-box cases that required a completely different storage setup. And what were you supposed to do with your old LPs?
Now the cycle has repeated itself, with CD sales dwindling to a fraction of their heights a couple of decades ago. Download and streaming services have taken hold, and physical discs have become obsolete. After all, with everything available online, why clutter up your living space?
This question has taken on newly personal significance as two albums of Virgil Thomson’s music that I made as a pianist in the early 1990s were recently reissued. While a two-CD set is available, online options have immediately made these recordings vastly more accessible than ever before. And bringing attention to some wonderful yet little-known music was the main impetus for the original project.
And yet I can’t imagine giving up my home collection. Yes, finding room in a Manhattan apartment to store ever-increasing numbers of CDs is a constant challenge. In my front hallway and living room I have five wall-affixed cabinets made for me by a carpenter friend, more than 90 feet of shelf space. In my home office I also have an industrial-looking file cabinet that efficiently holds nearly 2,000 CDs. I probably have, in total, more than 4,000 discs. (And I know people who have twice that many!)
And, perhaps out of nostalgia, I still have a stereo cabinet with a long shelf for some old LPs, along with a good turntable in the living room. (Vinyl has been making a comeback over the last decade. And when I’ve popped into stores selling used and just-released LPs, the majority of customers seem to be young people looking for rock and pop albums. Go figure.)
Books have gone digital, too, so we all could certainly clear out our shelves. Yet many of us still love holding real books in our hands and keeping a personal library, however crammed. It means so much to me to have bookcases in my apartment filled with novels I love by Charles Dickens, Theodore Dreiser, Thomas Hardy and Philip Roth; dozens of biographies and histories; a complete edition of Shakespeare’s plays; and a 12-volume 1911 edition of Jane Austen’s works that I found in a used bookstore.
I feel the same about having right at hand the historic 22-disc edition of Stravinsky conducting his own works; the EMI collection of Maria Callas’ recordings of dozens of complete operas, both studio accounts and live performances; big boxed sets of Benjamin Britten, Olivier Messiaen, Franz Liszt and Gyorgy Ligeti; multiple surveys of Beethoven’s 32 piano sonatas, from Artur Schnabel’s influential recordings of the 1930s to young Igor Levit’s recent, extraordinary nine-disc set. At last count, I have 15 complete recordings of Richard Wagner’s “Ring.”
Most of these recordings are available online. But not organized in volumes like archival documents, with extensive notes, essays and information.
And then there is the issue of audio quality. For decades, starting in the 1950s, the demand for ever-improving, more faithful sound was driven by devotees of classical music. Rock and pop fans were quicker to latch on to MP3s and iPods, excited to be able to store hundreds of favorite songs on devices they could put in their pockets and quite ready to sacrifice audio excellence for convenience.
The classical music contingent held out — but not for long. In time, even those choosy collectors decided that being able to listen through earbuds to Bach’s “Brandenburg” Concertos as they jogged in a park, or to Claude Debussy’s “La Mer” as they rode the bus, was worth the trade-off in richness of sound. And, at least at home, it’s possible to hook up your computer or device to high-end stereo component systems or to speakers that rival them.
My system, though very good, is hardly top of the line; I’m not a fervent audiophile. Yet the act of going to a shelf, pulling out a recording of the piece I want to hear and sitting down to listen focuses my attention and enriches the experience.
For a while, my husband, Ben, deferred to me about what was, after all, an essential element of my life’s work. And in earlier days, when he was looking forward to joining me for a concert of Jean Sibelius symphonies or a performance of Giuseppe Verdi’s “Falstaff,” he was quite glad to have my library of recordings available to prep himself. But he has gone 100% Spotify. And even if, at home, he can channel online recordings through a small Flip 5, an external Bluetooth speaker that actually sounds very good, he also loves his earbuds.
Years ago, as my collection kept expanding, Ben reached a breaking point and instituted a household regulation: For every new CD I bring in, I must give up an old one. That’s actually reasonable. And when I leave the giveaways in the lobby, they are usually scooped right up, which suggests to me that many other music lovers also still like physical discs and box sets. Maybe it’s generational. My young critic colleagues at The New York Times have minuscule numbers of actual CDs, they tell me. They stream everything.
If streaming has its shortcomings in terms of compensating artists, it may be better from an environmental standpoint. I’ve always assumed that, as with books, CDs can at least be recycled. But a recent Times story set me straight. CDs can be processed into polycarbonate flakes, with some difficulty. But the global market for this material is fast disappearing. So is my home CD library not just a relic, but also an environmental disaster?
Perhaps there’s a middle ground. Many recordings may reach more listeners, do more good and remain available longer online. But it is worth keeping at home recordings I cherish and albums of archival value, like a six-disc set of Bela Bartok at the piano or Artur Rubinstein’s 82-disc RCA catalog. Perhaps it will suffice for me to read an electronic version of Barack Obama’s new memoir, whereas I am very glad to have a hardcover of my friend Alex Ross’ latest book, “Wagnerism.”
And in truth, now and then, despite Ben’s household rule, I sneak new CDs into the apartment. There are worse habits.

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
RIO DE JANEIRO — As countries rushed their preparations to inoculate citizens against the coronavirus, Brazil, with its world-renowned immunization program and a robust pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity, should have been at a significant advantage.
But political infighting, haphazard planning and a nascent anti-vaccine movement have left the nation, which has suffered the pandemic’s second-largest death toll, without a clear vaccination program. Its citizens now have no sense of when they may get relief from a virus that has brought the public health system to its knees and crushed the economy.
“They’re playing with lives,” said Denise Garrett, a Brazilian American public health researcher at the Sabin Vaccine Institute, which works to expand access to vaccines. “It’s borderline criminal.”
Experts had held out hope that Brazil’s immunization prowess might allow it to handle the end of the pandemic better than it handled the beginning.
Soon after COVID-19 was first identified in the country in February, Brazil became an epicenter of the global health crisis. President Jair Bolsonaro dismissed scientific evidence, called the virus a “measly” cold that did not warrant shutting down the region’s largest economy, and berated governors who imposed quarantine measures and business closures.
As vaccination efforts get underway in Britain and the United States, giving their populations a chance to begin to imagine a post-pandemic life, the moment found Brazilian officials once again unprepared and mired in loud disputes over vaccine politics.
The health ministry last week presented a vaccination plan in response to an order from the Supreme Court. The plan established the order in which vulnerable groups would be vaccinated, but it lacked a detailed timeline and a clear estimate of how many doses will be available. The ministry had previously said it intended to start the vaccination campaign in March.
Days after the announcement, the health ministry was still scrambling to place orders with overextended vaccine suppliers. Officials at the ministry also faced questions over why the country did not have enough syringes and vials on hand to embark on the ambitious vaccination campaign, necessary to cover a country with 210 million residents, where more than 180,000 have succumbed to the virus.
On top of that, Anvisa, Brazil’s health regulatory agency, has yet to approve any coronavirus vaccine for general use.
“People are going to start to panic if Brazil continues to lag behind in having a plan, a clear and objective strategy,” Rodrigo Maia, the speaker of the House, said on Dec. 7, warning that Congress would take the reins of the process if the executive branch continued to fumble.
The discussion of vaccine access and safety has also become mired in a partisan dispute.
Bolsonaro has repeatedly maligned the CoronaVac vaccine, which is being developed by the Chinese firm Sinovac Biotech, and nixed his health ministry’s plan to purchase 46 million doses.
Instead, the government placed its faith in the vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University, which is lagging in the race to receive approval from health regulators.
The president’s crusade against the Chinese vaccine created a golden political opportunity for one of his chief political rivals, João Doria, the governor of São Paulo state. Doria negotiated directly with the Chinese for doses of the vaccine, which is being developed in partnership with the São Paulo-based Butantan research center.
Doria said state officials could not wait for the federal government, which has cycled through three health ministers over the course of the pandemic, to get its act together.
“We can’t wait until March to start using a vaccine that can be used in January,” he said in an interview. “There’s a consensus in the state of São Paulo and other states that waiting poses a big risk for the population, affecting mortality rates and the public health care system.”
Doria promised his constituents last week that São Paulo intended to start vaccinating people in late January — a pledge contingent on obtaining approval from federal regulators, who have yet to receive the final results of studies of the vaccine’s efficacy and safety.
The president’s office condemned Doria’s plan to start vaccinating people in January, calling it “cheap and irresponsible populism.”
The increasingly bitter spat between Doria, who is widely expected to run for president in 2022, and the federal government has dangerously politicized vaccination plans in Brazil.
Carla Domingues, a public health researcher who ran Brazil’s immunization program until last year, lamented that the coronavirus vaccine had become a partisan issue.
“That has never happened in immunization efforts,” she said. “This is going to leave people confused. It’s surreal.”
As the number of cases shot up again this month, leaving hospitals in several cities running low on beds for critically ill patients, pressure mounted on the federal government from increasingly worried regional authorities.
Several governors converged in the capital, Brasília, last week to meet with the health minister and demand a national immunization plan. A group representing city governments, the National Federation of Municipalities, also issued a statement asking the federal government to buy and distribute “all vaccines recognized as effective and safe against COVID-19.”
Some governors, including in the southern state of Paraná and northeastern state of Bahia, began trying to procure, and ultimately produce, doses of the Russian-made Sputnik V vaccine.
Carlos Lula, president of the national council of health secretaries, said the flurry of state-level vaccine diplomacy and deal-making was surprising in a country that has spent decades building one of the most well-respected immunization programs in the developing world.
“It’s a source of pride for the country because it became a model for other nations,” he said. “Yet suddenly, we can’t handle the tasks that are the bare minimum.”
Even when supply and logistical challenges are overcome, health experts say Brazil will face a new problem: a rising anti-vaccination movement that they say the president and his allies have fueled with falsehoods.
Roberto Jefferson, a former congressman who is a vocal supporter of the president, claimed early this month in a message on Twitter that “globalists were preparing a vaccine to change our DNA.”
The message, which was retweeted more than 3,000 times, claimed that Bill Gates, the American billionaire and philanthropist, was behind a “genocidal” scheme to “kill millions of people and replace our DNA with the mark of the beast," a reference to the devil.
The growing anti-vaccine movement has led some governors, including Doria, to defend making certain vaccinations mandatory.
Bia Kicis, a lawmaker who is one of Bolsonaro’s top surrogates, argued that the coronavirus vaccinations should not be mandatory because they are “experimental” and could alter people’s DNA. Vaccine experts called the assertions baseless.
Bolsonaro has said vaccines should be mandatory only for dogs.
While vaccines have never been mandatory for adults in Brazil, their efficacy and safety has never been widely questioned.
A poll released over the weekend by Datafolha, a well-respected Brazilian public opinion firm, found that 22% of respondents said they did not intend to get the coronavirus vaccine, up from 9% in August.
The issue is now before the Supreme Court, which this month is hearing two cases that could give health officials the authority to make certain vaccines mandatory.
Garrett of the Sabin institute studied the rise of the anti-vaccination movement in the United States, where she worked for two decades at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. She said she long feared the movement would find a foothold in Brazil, but she has been dismayed by the speed and intensity of its rise in the Bolsonaro era.
“It emboldened the anti-vaxxers in Brazil to come out sooner than they would have,” she said. “They’re empowered and have a loud voice.”

Every year, while braving the crowds and jammed parking lots at the mall, I vow that the next holiday season will be different: I’ll spend less time rushing and more time with my family. And yet, one harried holiday seems to blur with the next, like an annual form of amnesia set off by the sweet smell of freshly cut Christmas trees.
But this year, that wish may have come true. Like the part in “It’s a Wonderful Life,” when George Bailey is granted his request that he had never been born, the coronavirus pandemic is giving us a holiday season in which many of our hectic traditions have been brought to a halt.
Office parties are canceled. Malls are operating with reduced hours and staffing. Restaurant tables are roped off with police tape. On Black Friday, 50% fewer people, by one estimate, shopped in stores than they did in 2019. Santa Claus performers during holiday events, those who are actually at the stores, are not fielding wish lists from children. Hark, the Herald Angels Sing? Not this year. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has advised people not to sing during holiday gatherings. Really, the agency prefers that we not gather at all.
The holidays, for many people, are about creating a sense of cheer and wonder with bright lights and special gifts. But the sight of a Santa in a surgical mask instantly brings reality crashing back in.
Last week, I found myself browsing through the store at the Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan, a place normally thronged with shoppers. But I was one of only a handful of customers. Part of me reveled in not being rushed, or feeling claustrophobic from all the bag-toting masses. I had the undivided attention of the upbeat sales staff. But even after finding what I wanted, I left deflated.
It was a reminder that a nearly empty store two weeks before Christmas was not a good thing for anyone.
Consumerism is still alive and well, of course. The National Retail Federation expects that holiday sales could increase more this year than they did in 2019, despite widespread unemployment and another deadly wave of infections.
But much more shopping is happening online. An estimated 3 billion packages — about 10 parcels for every man, woman and child in the United States — will be shipped this season. That’s 800 million more than last year, according to ShipMatrix, which provides technology to the shipping industry.
E-commerce has proved safe and reliable, two of the most important qualities during the pandemic. But it is also a little lonely.
If the vaccines are successful, life in many public spaces will be far more normal next December. It should be safer to gather again in places of worship, restaurants and along parade routes.
But even as the health risks subside, there will still be fewer people in stores, now that online shopping has truly taken hold. Many stores that shut down during the lockdowns will stay closed.

Texto completo: The claim: The COVID-19 vaccine can cause infertility in women
An image going viral on Facebook and elsewhere on social media is lodging a concerning complaint: The COVID-19 vaccine could lead to infertility in women. This comes as the first doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine are delivered and administered across the USA.
The image, a screenshot of what appears to be a news article, declares the vaccine is "female sterilization," according to an unidentified Pfizer head of research. How exactly this is accomplished is through a protein contained in the vaccine, one integral for placenta formation.
"The vaccine contains a spike protein (see image) called syncytin-1, vital for the formation of the human placenta in women," the article's nameless author writes.
"If the vaccine works so that we form an immune response AGAINST the spike protein, we are also training the female body to attack syncytin-1, which could lead to infertility for an unspecified duration."
Similar images on Facebook attribute the fertility concern to Drs. Wolfgang Wodarg and Mike Yeadon. Wodarg, a German physician, and Yeadon, a former Pfizer chief science officer and research head, jointly filed a petition with the European Medicines Agency on Dec. 1 calling for suspension of Pfizer-BioNTech and other biotech/pharmaceutical companies' COVID-19 vaccine efforts.
Yeadon has been criticized for making misleading and inaccurate claims about the virus; he has not worked at Pfizer since 2011, according to his LinkedIn profile. Wodarg himself has been controversial, calling the 2009-2010 H1N1 swine flu pandemic "fake" and contributing to a COVID-19 misinformation video.
USA TODAY has reached out to the Facebook users who shared the images.
Fact check: Posts falsely claim first vaccine recipients in the UK are 'crisis actors'
What is syncytin-1?
In February 2000, researchers at the now-defunct Genetics Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts, discovered a gene, residing within the human genome, containing hallmarks of a recently discovered human endogenous defective retrovirus.
The protein encoded by the viral gene was produced only by cells of the placenta – an organ made only during pregnancy that exchanges oxygen and nutrients from mother to fetus – that come into direct contact with the uterus. A sturdy bond between maternal uterine and fetal placental cells was entirely dependent on this protein, which the researchers called syncytin from the word syncytium, a cell-like structure formed from the joining of many other cells.
Later research discovered that humans were not the only ones carrying this anchoring protein: Chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans and gibbons possessed the same gene along the same spot in their genomes, hinting at inheritance from a common hominid ancestor. Syncytin was also found in other mammals, although the gene did not appear to originate from the same virus.
A second syncytin was identified by French virologist Dr. Thierry Heidmann and colleagues in 2003. Both syncytins – dubbed syncytin-1 and 2 – were important for placenta formation, but syncytin-2 played an additional role in preventing the mother's immune system from attacking the fetus, a typical reaction of any healthy immune system when confronted with a foreign presence.
Fact check: List of 'deadliest days in American history' is partly false
Not the same proteins
Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna's COVID-19 vaccines both use messenger RNA, a single-strand of genetic code that provides manufacturing instructions for a particular protein, much like a recipe. For the vaccine, the recipe is for SARS-CoV-2's spike protein, which cells will mass produce, triggering and teaching the body to make antibodies in response.
The mRNA degenerates once its purpose is fulfilled, but the anti-SAR-CoV-2 spike protein antibodies live on to fight future infection.
While the coronavirus spike protein and syncytin-1 do share a minute string of amino acids – the building blocks of proteins – the similarity is too small to warrant an immunologic offensive, said virologist Dr. Ian Jones of the University of Reading, United Kingdom, to FullFact.org.
Fact check: Obama, Bush and Clinton would publicly get vaccinated to boost confidence
Duke University immunologist Dr. Stephanie Langel also agreed, saying in an interview with the New York Times that the two proteins have "almost nothing in common, making the vaccine highly unlikely to trigger a reaction."
Additionally, Pfizer spokeswoman Jerica Pitts confirmed the vaccine did not affect female fertility.
"It has been incorrectly suggested that COVID-19 vaccines will cause infertility because of a shared amino acid sequence in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and a placental protein," she said in an email to the Associated Press.
"The sequence, however, is too short to plausibly give rise to autoimmunity."
It is also worth noting that since late January, there have been over 44,000 COVID-19 cases among pregnant women, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. If anti-SAR-CoV-2 spike protein antibodies produced by the mother were attacking syncytin-1, and thereby the placenta, pregnancy complications or miscarriages would prevail, said Dr. Mary Jane Minkin, clinical professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Yale School of Medicine, to USA TODAY. So far, there has been no evidence of the kind reported among pregnant women.
Fact check: US COVID-19 deaths from Dec. 1-5 rival the toll from the Pearl Harbor attack
Our ruling: False
We rate the claim that the COVID-19 vaccine causes female infertility as FALSE because it is not supported by our research. The claim originates from a petition filed by Drs. Wolfgang Wodarg and Mike Yeadon, the latter an ex-employee of Pfizer who last worked with the company in 2011. The protein mentioned in the claim, syncytin-1, is important for placenta formation, but it bears no resemblance to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein save a very small amino acid sequence. Experts agree this similarity is not enough to trigger an immune response leading to female infertility.
While the vaccine has not been tested in pregnant women, there are over 44,000 COVID-19 cases among pregnant women in the USA. Any indication of an adverse immune reaction related to syncytin-1 would manifest in pregnancy complications or miscarriages; thus far, none has been reported.

The first shots were given in the American mass vaccination campaign Monday, opening a new chapter in the battle against the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more people in the United States — over 300,000 — than in any other country and has taken a particularly devastating toll on people of color.
Shortly after 9 a.m., the new Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was administered in Queens, New York, the first known inoculation since the vaccine was authorized by the Food and Drug Administration late last week. It was a hopeful step for New York state, which the pandemic has scarred profoundly, leaving more than 35,000 people dead and severely weakening the economy.
“I believe this is the weapon that will end the war,” Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Monday morning, shortly before the shot was given to Sandra Lindsay, a critical care nurse and the director of patient services in the intensive care unit at Long Island Jewish Medical Center. State officials said the shot was the first to be given outside of a vaccine trial in the United States.
Lindsay, who has treated patients throughout the pandemic, said that she hoped her public vaccination would instill confidence that the shots were safe.
“I have seen the alternative, and do not want it for you,” she said. “I feel like healing is coming. I hope this marks the beginning of the end of a very painful time in our history.”
President Donald Trump posted on Twitter: “First Vaccine Administered. Congratulations USA! Congratulations WORLD!”
Shortly afterward, Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City said at a news conference that “To me, we were watching an incredibly historic moment, and the beginning of something much better for this city and this country.”
While the first dose of the vaccine was administered in New York, people across the nation began receiving it Monday as well. There was plenty of applause and some tears as news cameras captured the mundane rituals of an injection, underscoring the pent-up hope that this was the first step in getting past the pandemic.
“Today is the first day on the long road to go back to normal,” Mona Moghareh, a 30-year-old pharmacist, said after administering the first dose at a hospital in New Orleans.
But the joy was tempered by the harsh reality of the devastation the virus continues to inflict. The United States surpassed 300,000 virus-related deaths Monday, and cases continue to surge across the country.
The vaccinations started after the Food and Drug Administration’s emergency authorization of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine Friday night.
On Sunday, trucks and cargo planes packed with the first of nearly 3 million doses of coronavirus vaccine had fanned out across the country, as hospitals in all 50 states rushed to set up injection sites and their anxious workers tracked each shipment hour by hour. But the rollout is less centralized in the United States than in other countries that are racing to distribute it.
According to Gen. Gustave F. Perna, chief operating officer of the federal effort to develop a vaccine, 145 sites were set to receive the vaccine Monday, 425 on Tuesday and 66 on Wednesday. There appeared to be few logistical problems, though Puerto Rico received half the number of doses it expected, and had to scramble to adjust its distribution plan. The remaining doses are expected to arrive Tuesday and Wednesday.
A majority of the first injections given Monday are expected to go to high-risk health care workers. In many cases, this first, limited delivery would not supply nearly enough doses to inoculate all of the doctors, nurses, security guards, receptionists and other workers who risk being exposed to the virus every day. Because the vaccines can cause side effects including fevers and aches, hospitals say they will stagger vaccination schedules among workers.
Lindsay emphasized the symbolic importance that she was the first American to receive the vaccine — as a Black woman, she is among the demographic most disproportionately devastated by COVID-19. African Americans also have long been subjected to unethical medical research, raising some concern that they may be more hesitant to take the vaccine.
“I want people who look like me and are associated with me to know it’s safe,” she said. “Use me as an example. I would not steer the public wrong.”
Residents of nursing homes, who have suffered a disproportionate share of COVID-19 deaths, are also being prioritized and are expected to begin receiving vaccinations next week. But the vast majority of Americans will not be eligible for the vaccine until the spring or later.
In an interview with MSNBC on Monday, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, laid out a timeline for a return to normalcy that stretched well into 2021. He stressed that until then, social distancing and masks will remain crucial in the fight to stop the spread of the virus.
He predicted that the average person with no underlying conditions would get the vaccine by the end of March or beginning of April. If the campaign is efficient and effective in convincing people to get the vaccine, most people could be vaccinated by late spring or early summer, he said.
“I believe we can get there by then so that by the time we get into the fall, we can start approaching some degree of relief, where the level of infection will be so low in society we can start essentially approaching some form of normality,” he said.
Until then, he stressed, the standard public health measures — distancing, masks, avoiding indoor gatherings — remain necessary.
“A vaccine right now is not a substitute for the normal standard public health measures,” he said, adding, “It’s not a substitute. It complements it. Only when you get the level of infection in society so low that it’s no longer a public health threat, can you then think about the possibility of pulling back on public health measures.”

OAKLAND, Calif. — In 2000, just two years after it was founded, Google reached a milestone that would lay the foundation for its dominance over the next 20 years: It became the world’s largest search engine, with an index of more than 1 billion web pages.
The rest of the internet never caught up, and Google’s index just kept on getting bigger. Today, it is somewhere between 500 billion and 600 billion web pages, according to estimates.
Now, as regulators around the world examine ways to curb Google’s power, including a search monopoly case expected from state attorneys general as early as this week and the antitrust lawsuit the Justice Department filed in October, they are wrestling with a company whose sheer size has allowed it to squash competitors. And those competitors are pointing investigators toward that enormous index, the gravitational center of the company.
“If people are on a search engine with a smaller index, they’re not always going to get the results they want. And then they go to Google and stay at Google,” said Matt Wells, who started Gigablast, a search engine with an index of around 5 billion web pages, about 20 years ago. “A little guy like me can’t compete.”
Understanding how Google’s search works is a key to figuring out why so many companies find it nearly impossible to compete and, in fact, go out of their way to cater to its needs.
Every search request provides Google with more data to make its search algorithm smarter. Google has performed so many more searches than any other search engine that it has established a huge advantage over rivals in understanding what consumers are looking for. That lead only continues to widen, since Google has a market share of about 90%.
Google directs billions of users to locations across the internet, and websites, hungry for that traffic, create a different set of rules for the company. Websites often provide greater and more frequent access to Google’s so-called web crawlers — computers that automatically scour the internet and scan web pages — allowing the company to offer a more extensive and up-to-date index of what is available on the internet.
When he was working at the music site Bandcamp, Zack Maril, a software engineer, became concerned about how Google’s dominance had made it so essential to websites.
In 2018, when Google said its crawler, Googlebot, was having trouble with one of Bandcamp’s pages, Maril made fixing the problem a priority because Google was critical to the site’s traffic. When other crawlers encountered problems, Bandcamp would usually block them.
Maril continued to research the different ways that websites opened doors for Google and closed them for others. Last year, he sent a 20-page report, “Understanding Google,” to a House antitrust subcommittee and then met with investigators to explain why other companies could not recreate Google’s index.
“It’s largely an unchecked source of power for its monopoly,” said Maril, 29, who works at another technology company that does not compete directly with Google. He asked that The New York Times not identify his employer since he was not speaking for it.
A report this year by the House subcommittee cited Maril’s research on Google’s efforts to create a real-time map of the internet and how this had “locked in its dominance.” While the Justice Department is looking to unwind Google’s business deals that put its search engine front and center on billions of smartphones and computers, Maril is urging the government to intervene and regulate Google’s index. A Google spokesperson declined to comment.
Websites and search engines are symbiotic. Websites rely on search engines for traffic, while search engines need access to crawl the sites to provide relevant results for users. But each crawler puts a strain on a website’s resources in server and bandwidth costs, and some aggressive crawlers resemble security risks that can take down a site.
Since having their pages crawled costs money, websites have an incentive to let it be done only by search engines that direct enough traffic to them. In the current world of search, that leaves Google and — in some cases — Microsoft’s Bing.
Google and Microsoft are the only search engines that spend hundreds of millions of dollars annually to maintain a real-time map of the English-language internet. That’s in addition to the billions they have spent over the years to build out their indexes, according to a report this summer from Britain’s Competition and Markets Authority.
Google holds a significant leg up on Microsoft in more than market share. British competition authorities said Google’s index included about 500 billion to 600 billion web pages, compared with 100 billion to 200 billion for Microsoft.
Other large tech companies deploy crawlers for other purposes. Facebook has a crawler for links that appear on its site or services. Amazon says its crawler helps improve its voice-based assistant, Alexa. Apple has its own crawler, Applebot, which has fueled speculation that it might be looking to build its own search engine.
But indexing has always been a challenge for companies without deep pockets.The privacy-minded search engine DuckDuckGo decided to stop crawling the entire web more than a decade ago and now syndicates results from Microsoft. It still crawls sites like Wikipedia to provide results for answer boxes that appear in its results, but maintaining its own index does not usually make financial sense for the company.
“It costs more money than we can afford,” said Gabriel Weinberg, chief executive of DuckDuckGo. In a written statement for the House antitrust subcommittee last year, the company said that “an aspiring search engine startup today (and in the foreseeable future) cannot avoid the need” to turn to Microsoft or Google for its search results.
When FindX started to develop an alternative to Google in 2015, the Danish company set out to create its own index and offered a build-your-own algorithm to provide individualized results.
FindX quickly ran into problems. Large website operators, such as Yelp and LinkedIn, did not allow the fledgling search engine to crawl their sites. Because of a bug in its code, FindX’s computers that crawled the internet were flagged as a security risk and blocked by a group of the internet’s largest infrastructure providers. What pages they did collect were frequently spam or malicious web pages.
“If you have to do the indexing, that’s the hardest thing to do,” said Brian Schildt Laursen, one of the founders of FindX, which shut down in 2018.
Schildt Laursen launched a new search engine last year, Givero, which offered users the option to donate a portion of the company’s revenue to charitable causes. When he started Givero, he syndicated search results from Microsoft.
Most large websites are judicious about who can crawl their pages. In general, Google and Microsoft get more access because they have more users, while smaller search engines have to ask for permission.
“You need the traffic to convince the websites to allow you to copy and crawl, but you also need the content to grow your index and pull up your traffic,” said Marc Al-Hames, a co-chief executive of Cliqz, a German search engine that closed this year after seven years of operation. “It’s a chicken-and-egg problem.”
In Europe, a group called the Open Search Foundation has proposed a plan to create a common internet index that can underpin many European search engines. It is essential to have a diversity of options for search results, said Stefan Voigt, the group’s chairman and founder, because it is not good for only a handful of companies to determine what links people are shown and not shown.
“We just can’t leave this to one or two companies,” Voigt said.
When Maril started researching how sites treated Google’s crawler, he downloaded 17 million so-called robots.txt files — essentially rules of the road posted by nearly every website laying out where crawlers can go — and found many examples where Google had greater access than competitors.
ScienceDirect, a site for peer-reviewed papers, permits only Google’s crawler to have access to links containing PDF documents. Only Google’s computers get access to listings on PBS Kids. On Alibaba.com, the U.S. site of the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, only Google’s crawler is given access to pages that list products.
This year, Maril started an organization, the Knuckleheads’ Club (“because only a knucklehead would take on Google”), and a website to raise awareness about Google’s web-crawling monopoly.
“Google has all this power in society,” Maril said. “But I think there should be democratic — small d — control of that power.”

Can Congress Overturn the Electoral College Results? Probably Not

The Electoral College’s certification Monday of President-elect Joe Biden’s victory left just one final venue for President Donald Trump and his supporters to challenge the results of the 2020 election: a joint session of Congress in January.
Every four years, the House and Senate come together to formally tabulate the electoral votes and raise any final concerns about the results. Normally, it is a perfunctory confirmation of the Electoral College vote. But this year, some of the president’s most strident supporters are threatening to transform it into a messy last stand by objecting to the results.
They are all but certain to fail, but not before a potentially divisive spectacle on the floor of the House that could thrust Vice President Mike Pence into the politically perilous position of confirming that Trump lost. Here’s how the process works.
The Constitution gives Congress the final say in the election.
When the Electoral College met on Monday, each state formally cast its electoral votes for president, affirming Biden’s win.
But the Constitution leaves it up to Congress to make the results final shortly before Inauguration Day. Article II, Section 1 says, “The president of the Senate shall, in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all the certificates, and the votes shall then be counted.”
To that end, on Jan. 6, envelopes containing certificates showing the electoral results from all 50 states will be carried into the House chamber inside two bound mahogany boxes that date from the 19th century. Representatives of the newly sworn-in House and Senate, called “tellers” for the occasion, will pull them out one by one to determine whether each “seems to be regular in form and authentic” and present them to the president of the Senate — in this case, Pence — for inspection and approval.
Lawmakers can object to any state’s results, but there is a high bar for rejection.
Congress has long interpreted the constitutional language to mean that lawmakers can lodge objections to the results as they are tallied. The current process was circumscribed in the Electoral Count Act of 1887.
It says that as the tellers read through the electoral results state by state, members of the House and Senate can submit objections in writing to a given state’s results. The objections only hold weight if they are co-signed by at least one member of each chamber; if not, they fail and the session quickly moves on.
It is not uncommon for a member of just one chamber to submit an objection as an act of protest. It happened most recently in 2017, when several Democrats objected to Trump’s win in key states, based on Russian election interference. But Trump’s opponent, Hillary Clinton, had already conceded and no Democratic senator joined the effort, so the objections were quickly rejected.
Instances of a House member and a senator teaming up are more rare and last took place in 2005. If it occurred, the joint session would immediately pause so lawmakers could go back to their respective chambers to debate the objection for up to two hours. They would then vote on whether to toss out the electoral results of the state in question. Both chambers would have to agree to reject the votes, something that has not happened since the Reconstruction era.
“By ensuring that both chambers must reject a submission, you reduce the risk of Congress going rogue electorally and repudiating the results of a state,” said Edward B. Foley, a constitutional law professor at Ohio State University who studies the electoral process.
Win or lose, Trump’s allies can succeed in casting a shadow on Biden’s victory.
Trump’s allies, led by Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama, have their sights set on challenging five states — Arizona, Pennsylvania, Nevada, Georgia and Wisconsin — where they claim that widespread voting fraud occurred, despite the fact that all five states have certified that the results are valid and there is no evidence of any widespread impropriety.
The key will be recruiting a Republican senator to join them, and so far none has publicly committed to doing so. Without a senator, their efforts will quickly fail and Biden could be formally declared president-elect in less than an hour.
If a senator did sign on to challenge the results, Republicans could force Congress into a final, messy debate over Trump’s refusal to concede defeat and his baseless claims of election fraud, which have been roundly rejected in court.
Given Democrats’ control of the House and Republicans’ narrow Senate majority, almost no one expects that they would have the votes to succeed in disqualifying a state — much less five. But the debate and vote alone would put Republicans in a difficult position, forcing them to choose between an uncompromising president and their belief in the electoral process. Their choices could likely go a long way in setting the future course of the party, faith in American elections and the perceived legitimacy of a Biden presidency by the Republican base.
Pence may have the most uncomfortable task of all.
At the end of the process, it will be left to Pence to declare Biden the winner once and for all, albeit in tangled prose.
“This announcement of the state of the vote by the president of the Senate shall be deemed sufficient declaration of the persons elected president and vice president of the United States, each for a term beginning on the 20th day of January 2017,” Biden himself declared when he oversaw the tallying for Trump’s vote as vice president in 2017.
Pence is far from the first vice president to be put in the uncomfortable position of certifying his own ticket’s loss. Overseeing the session in 2001, Vice President Al Gore had to rule against objections that would have delivered the presidency to himself if they were sustained, eventually declaring George W. Bush the victor.
But Pence serves a uniquely mercurial president with a penchant for disregarding the democratic process. The joint session will be a final dilemma, forcing him to balance his loyalty to Trump and his own political interests against his constitutional and legal obligations.
Precedent and statute give the vice president little wiggle room.
“There’s not much he can do,” said Donald A. Ritchie, the Senate’s former in-house historian. “His job is really just to read them out aloud. It’s up to the members if they are going to do anything.”
His only other option may simply be not to show up, leaving the task of overseeing the session to Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, who is the Senate president pro tempore, a distinction reserved for the longest-serving member of the chamber’s majority party.

With high stakes for both parties, early voting started Monday in the Senate runoff races in Georgia. The two contests will determine whether Republicans can maintain their majority in the chamber.
Both of the state’s Republican senators, David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, were forced into runoffs against Democratic challengers. Perdue faces Jon Ossoff, the chief executive of a media production company; Loeffler is being challenged by the Rev. Raphael G. Warnock, the senior pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church, a prominent pulpit in Atlanta that had once belonged to Martin Luther King Jr.
Since Election Day, the runoffs, scheduled for Jan. 5, have been impossible to escape for Georgia voters. Ads from candidates have blanketed local television and radio stations, and coverage of the campaigns dominates the local news media. In and around Atlanta, roadside signs urge residents to get out and vote — once again.
“I feel like all eyes are on Georgia right now,” said Joanne Williams.
“It can go in any direction,” Williams, 27, said, “but I hope that people show up and practice their right to vote.”
The voting began as Georgia has been in the center of the national political spotlight for weeks. Because of their outsize role in deciding the partisan balance of the Senate, the runoffs have drawn a substantial amount of outside attention and investment.
State Democrats have been newly invigorated, with President-elect Joe Biden becoming the first presidential candidate from the party to win Georgia since 1992. Biden will visit the state Tuesday to campaign for Warnock and Ossoff.
Georgia has also been a primary stage in President Donald Trump’s fight to challenge the outcome of the presidential election, sparking conflict among state Republicans as Trump raised baseless claims of election fraud and attacked the state’s governor, Brian Kemp, a Republican.
Trump continued his criticism over the weekend.
“What a fool Governor @BrianKempGA of Georgia is,” the president said in a Twitter post Sunday. He repeated his argument that Kemp should have called a special session of the state Legislature in an effort to overturn the election in his favor. And he argued that the situation could spell for a “bad day for two GREAT Senators on January 5th.”
Raymond Floyd, 37, said he felt the charged energy and excitement of the moment as he waited in a line outside the High Museum of Art in Midtown Atlanta, a few miles from the state capitol building. Floyd, who planned to vote for Ossoff and Warnock, said, “I like democracy at work.”
But he added, “Once this election is over, I’m ready for a sense of normalcy and a sense of respect.”

Texto completo: The Chief Wahoo logo was officially removed last year and soon the "Indians" nickname will be gone as well.
Cleveland's Major League Baseball team announced Monday it is beginning the process of dropping the nickname the team first assumed in 1915.
The move is part of continuing social changes in sports and follows a similar decision by the NFL's Washington Football Team, which in July dropped its "Redskins" nickname under pressure from corporate sponsors such as Nike and FedEx.
Hours after Washington first announced it would review the team’s name, Cleveland's organization issued a statement saying they would "determine the best path forward with regard to our team name.”
CHANGE COMING: Cleveland dropping racist nickname part of continuing social change in sports
Here's the latest on the Cleveland baseball team's nickname, and potential next steps.
WHY ARE THEY DOING IT?
For years, Native American groups and others have protested against Cleveland’s use of the nickname as well as other imagery used by the team such as the smiling, cartoonish Chief Wahoo logo.
Washington's move to drop "Redskins" opened the door for Cleveland.
After Cleveland said in July that it would review its use of the nickname, manager Terry Francona said it was time to “move forward” with the name change.
Since then, officials from the Cleveland team have spoken with numerous Indigenous groups, including The Cleveland Indigenous Coalition and the National Congress of American Indians, "to learn how our team name affected different constituencies.
"As a result of that process, we have decided to move forward with changing the current team name and determining a new, non-Native American based name for the franchise," the team said in a statement.
"By agreeing to change the team name away from Indigenous themes, the Cleveland baseball team is helping to create a place where Native American children and their families feel valued and fully seen," The Cleveland Indigenous Coalition said in a statement.
WHEN WILL THE NEW NAME BE OFFICIAL?
The timetable for when a new name will be selected is not entirely clear, but owner Paul Dolan told the Associated Press that the team will continue to play under its current name in 2021.
As the Washington Football Team's name change has shown, the transition to a new name can be a complicated and lengthy process.
In October, Washington team president Jason Wright said there was a "pretty good chance" the team will keep its current name through 2021.
"The team’s decision to change the current name is phase one of a multi-phase process," Dolan said. "Future decisions, including new name identification and brand development, are complex and will take time."
WHAT WILL BE THE NEW NAME?
That's yet to be determined but Dolan told the Associated Press that no new name or interim name has been chosen yet and "Tribe" will not be a future option.
Will Cleveland go into its history for its new moniker? If so, the team will have options.
Prior to the current nickname, the American League franchise's names included the Naps, Bronchos and Blues. Other options might include Cleveland Spiders, a team in the now-defunct American Association and the National League in the late 1800s; or Cleveland Buckeyes of Negro leagues fame, as suggested by Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown.
Or the team could go with something completely new.
CAN I STILL BUY INDIANS GEAR?
Short answer is yes.
There's plenty of gear available on MLB.com.
And although the team last year removed the Chief Wahoo logo from its caps and jerseys, merchandise bearing its image is still sold around the Internet.
ANY OTHER NAME CHANGES COMING?
The Kansas City Chiefs, Atlanta Braves and Chicago Blackhawks, as the New York Times notes, have all said recently they have no plans to change their nicknames.
But with Washington and Cleveland changing their names, the pressure on those teams will only mount.

The move follows a decision by the Washington Football Team of the NFL in July to stop using a name long considered a racial slur, and is part of a larger national conversation about race that magnified this year amid protests of systemic racism and police violence.
Cleveland could announce its plans for the change as soon as this week.
It's not immediately clear what Cleveland's exact steps will be beyond dropping the Indians name. The transition to a new name involves many logistical considerations, including work with uniform manufacturers and companies that produce other team equipment and stadium signage.
Cleveland may keep the Indians name and uniforms for the 2021 season while working to shift as early as 2022.
Cleveland spent much of the year before the 2019 season phasing out the logos and imagery of the cartoon mascot Chief Wahoo.

College basketball: Remy Martin hit a 3-pointer with 9 seconds left and scored 23 of of his 31 points points in the second half, lifting No. 23 Arizona State to a 71-70 victory over Grand Canyon in Phoenix. The Sun Devils (4-2) were without leading rebounder Marcus Bagley (left calf) for the second game in a row. ... Sue Donohoe, former director of both the women's and men's D-I tournaments, died after a brief illness not related to COVID-19. She was 61. Donohoe was to be inducted during the summer into the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame, but the ceremony was postponed until 2021 by the pandemic.
NFL: The Raiders fired defensive coordinator Paul Guenther after nearly three seasons.
NHL: Pierre Lacroix, the astute executive who was the architect of two Avalanche Stanley Cup championship teams, died. He was 72. No cause of death was given. Lacroix was a driving force behind turning the Avs into a perennial power after the team relocated from Quebec to Denver for the 1995-96 season. The Avalanche hoisted the '96 Cup in their first season in the Mile High City and again in 2001. Known for his shrewd trades, Lacroix struck a deal with the Canadiens to acquire Hall of Fame G Patrick Roy during the '95-96 season.
Soccer: Neymar was taken off on a stretcher deep into stoppage time as defending champion Paris Saint-Germain lost 1-0 at home to Lyon to drop to third place in the French league. Neymar incurred a left ankle injury in the seventh minute of injury time at Parc des Princes following a heavy tackle from Thiago Mendes, who was then red carded. PSG coach Thomas Tuchel said there would be an update on Neymar's condition after more tests Monday.

The hidden 'fourth wave' of the pandemic

Texto completo: Nine long, deadly months into the pandemic, Americans report severe psychic distress. It's dark, we're stuck inside, and we're isolated from friends and family. Politics is fevered, the economy continues to struggle, and the coronavirus rages on. Many of us may be at a breaking point. According to a new Gallup survey, Americans' assessment of our mental health is "worse than it has been at any point in the last two decades."
But now comes winter and the holidays, a time of special dread. Even in ordinary years, this season turns up the needle on stress. The pandemic winter promises a new layer to our mental anguish. In addition to so much death, the next three months could bring a level of collective grief, anxiety, depression and overall stress that may eclipse all that we've experienced so far this terrible year.
"This year is very unlikely to be a good year for you if have had a history" of mental health issues, Ken Duckworth, chief medical officer of the National Alliance on Mental Illness, told me. "You're going to have fewer connections, more isolation and more uncertainty."
Yet we might be as ill prepared for the mental toll of the pandemic as we were for its physical toll. I spent the past few days talking to experts about Americans' mental health needs during the next few months. The picture is bleak. Even before the pandemic, the United States had too few mental health professionals to meet the nation's needs. The shortage is most dire in rural areas and in urban communities that are home to marginalized groups. Demand for treatment has skyrocketed, but supply has not.
"It takes eight months to explode demand," Duckworth told me, but several years to make a social worker.
Worse, at the national level, there has not been a real focus on the pandemic's toll on our mental health -- not from the Trump administration and not, so far, from the incoming Biden administration. Last month the president-elect announced a COVID-19 task force that was widely praised for its deep expertise. None of its members, though, is an expert on mental health.
That's a big mistake, according to Luana Marques, a clinical psychologist who directs Community Psychiatry PRIDE, a program at the Massachusetts General Hospital that offers care to underserved populations. She predicted that mental health issues could create a kind of "fourth wave" of the pandemic.
"Once we get the pandemic under control, people are going to come up for air, and they will not be OK," Marques told me. "I think we need a national force to help us guide this and have a coordinated effort toward mental health."
The coronavirus winter will bring special challenges for our already battered psyches. Many of the ways that people have been counseled to keep up their spirits during the pandemic -- maintaining connections, getting lots of exercise, going outdoors -- are more challenging in the winter. There is also winter's singular misery, darkness. Millions of Americans suffer from seasonal affective disorder, a kind of depression thought to be exacerbated, in part, by reduced exposure to sunlight.
Then there are the holidays themselves, which create their own well-known difficulties.
"There's often a disconnect between the idealized portraits of what we might expect from the holiday season and what actually happens," said Joshua Gordon, director of the National Institute of Mental Health.
In American pop culture, this season is often depicted as a time of effortless cheer, a wonderland of snowmen and cozy fireplaces and skating in the park. Many people often feel terrible about the holidays because they rarely go as well as they do on TV, and this year, more than ever, the disconnect will be unavoidable -- and triggering.
The mental health system is already struggling to keep up. In June, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 40% of U.S. adults reported at least one adverse mental or behavioral health condition, including experiencing symptoms of mental illness or substance abuse related to the pandemic.
There is a bit of encouraging news: When the pandemic hit, many therapists and their patients managed to move their sessions to the internet, allowing people to get help even as the virus kept them at home. Experts were also encouraged by the public discussion about mental health in the past few months -- mental health organizations and the news media have highlighted the importance of maintaining social connectedness despite the need for physical distancing.
The experts I spoke to offered a variety of well-meaning strategies for people to maintain their mental well-being this season. None of it will be new to people who have dealt with serious mental health problems: Eat well, sleep well, maintain social connections, spend time outside in the sun and get a lot of exercise, which has been shown to provide significant improvements for a range of mental health problems.
Advice like this may be helpful to some, but it is also woefully insufficient. Like telling people to car pool and turn down the thermostat to defeat climate change, it shifts responsibility for addressing a crisis from the systemic level to the individual and will almost certainly not be adequate for the people most in need.
Winter is coming: We need a real plan to address Americans' unraveling mental health, and we need it fast.

Texto completo: Following years of protests from fans and Native American groups, the Cleveland Indians have decided to change their team name, moving away from a moniker that has long been criticized as racist, The New York Times reported on Sunday night.
The move follows a decision by the Washington Football Team of the NFL in July to stop using a name long considered a racial slur, and is part of a larger national conversation about race that magnified this year amid protests of systemic racism and police violence.
Cleveland could announce its plans for the change as soon as this week.

Cleveland may keep the Indians name and uniforms for the 2021 season while working to shift as early as 2022.
Cleveland spent much of the year before the 2019 season phasing out the logos and imagery of the cartoon mascot Chief Wahoo.
One option the team is considering is moving forward without a replacement name - similar to how the Washington Football Team proceeded - then coming up with a new name in consultation with the public.
The Cleveland baseball franchise has been known as the Indians since 1915, but Native American groups and others have for decades opposed the use of Indigenous names, mascots and imagery for sports teams, insisting they are demeaning and racist.
Other professional sports teams, including the Atlanta Braves, the Kansas City Chiefs and the Chicago Blackhawks, have said in recent months that they have no plans to change their names. Many universities and high schools abandoned Native American names and mascots long ago.
- The New York Times
"It's always just great to see him out on the floor. ... He's definitely a sight for sore eyes."

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES (AP) - Singer FKA twigs filed a lawsuit Friday alleging that Shia LaBeouf was physically and emotionally abusive during their relationship from 2018 to 2019, saying her experience was part of a pattern of terrorizing women for the 34-year-old actor.
"Shia LaBeouf hurts women," the lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court said in its opening lines. "He uses them. He abuses them, both physically and mentally. He is dangerous."
FKA twigs - a 32-year-old British singer and actress whose legal name is Tahliah Barnett - alleges in the lawsuit that LaBeouf left her in a constant state of fear and humiliation, once slammed her into a car, tried to strangle her and knowingly gave her a sexually transmitted disease.
An email sent to a representative seeking comment from LaBeouf was not immediately returned, but in an email to The New York Times the actor said: "I have no excuses for my alcoholism or aggression, only rationalizations. I have been abusive to myself and everyone around me for years. I have a history of hurting the people closest to me. I'm ashamed of that history and am sorry to those I hurt."
The two met and became a couple after Barnett was cast in "Honey Boy," an autobiographical film about LaBeouf's upbringing as a child actor that portrayed his father as abusive but loving. Barnett had a supporting role alongside LaBeouf.
After what the lawsuit described as an early "charm offensive," LaBeouf convinced Barnett to move in with him, leading to what the lawsuit characterized as a "living nightmare."
LaBeouf isolated FKA twigs from family and friends, demanding absolute fealty, and constant verbal abuse led to several physical attacks on her, the lawsuit claimed.
He was ferociously jealous of everyone from waiters she was polite with to her ex-fiance, actor Robert Pattinson, the lawsuit alleged.
On a Valentine's Day getaway in 2019, FKA twigs awoke to LaBeouf choking her and she was paralyzed with fear, the lawsuit said. He later drove wildly and threatened to crash his car if she didn't profess eternal love for him and she feared for her life, the lawsuit claimed.
When she tried to get out of the car and get away from her at a gas station, he slammed her against the car, tried to strangle her, and forced her to get back in, the lawsuit said.
When she was attempting to end the relationship and leave him the following month, he violently grabbed her and lifted her off the ground as she was attempting to depart, according to a housekeeper who witnessed the incident and was cited in the lawsuit.
The lawsuit also alleged that LaBeouf knowingly gave her an unspecified sexually transmitted disease that he went to great lengths to hide from her for much of their relationship, including his use of makeup.
LaBeouf kept guns in the house where they were living and he sometimes slept with them, putting Barnett in a constant state of fear," the lawsuit said.
She made several attempts to leave him that he resisted, but he later ended the relationship himself, the lawsuit said.
Karolyn Pho, a stylist who LaBeouf dated in 2010 and 2011, said in the lawsuit that she received similar treatment from LaBeouf - including constant threats and humiliation that sometimes escalated to physical violence.
The lawsuit said Pho allied herself with Barnett in an attempt to protect women from LaBeouf, although Pho is not listed as a plaintiff.
LaBeouf told The New York Times that many allegations in the lawsuit and from other women who spoke about him with the newspaper for its report "are not true" but added that he owed the women "the opportunity to air their statements publicly and accept accountability for those things I have done." He did not tell the newspaper which allegations he contests.
LaBeouf said he is in recovery and therapy over alcoholism and PTSD, saying he "will forever be sorry to the people that I may have harmed along the way."
LaBeouf is known for his intensity as an actor, and sometimes self-lacerating public performances.
He first gained fame as a teenager on the Disney Channel show "Even Stevens," and is best known for his roles in 2007′s "Transformers" and in 2008′s "Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull."
He has had several run-ins with the law during his career, including a 2017 New York City arrest for public drunkenness and disorderly conduct that was captured on a livestreamed video. He was sent to court-mandated rehabilitation.
The lawsuit seeks monetary damages to be determined at trial. Barnett said in the lawsuit that she will donate a significant part of any money received to a charity for abused women.
"This action has been brought not for personal gain, but to set the record straight, and to help ensure that no more women undergo the abuse that Shia LaBeouf has inflicted on his previous romantic partners," the lawsuit said.

JOHN LE CARRE, 1931 - 2020; Briton redefined spy-genre novel; Instead of focusing on action, he explored human frailty

Texto completo: Kim Philby, the notorious Soviet mole who burrowed into the upper echelons of Britain's Cold War-era intelligence services, was a subject of fear-driven fascination for novelist John le Carre. The two men, Le Carre felt, had far too much in common as upper-class-hating sons of dissolute fathers "so oversized that your only resort as a child was to subterfuge and deceit."
For Le Carre, Philby's traitorous life could have been his own.
"I knew, if you like, that Philby had taken a road that was dangerously open to myself, though I had resisted it," Le Carre wrote in the introduction to a 1991 edition of his "Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy" novel of deceit, double agents and moral ambiguity. "I knew that he represented one of the -- thank God, unrealized -- possibilities of my nature."

Still, Le Carre was not above subterfuge. As part of the British foreign service from 1959 to 1964, Le Carre worked for British intelligence, a role from which he drew fodder for his novels and that necessitated he adopt a pen name to hide his true identity of David Cornwell. Fittingly, after Cornwell was outed and had to leave the service, his real name faded into the shadows as Le Carre became the multimillion-selling novelist whose spy novels transcended the pulp genre to, in the eyes of some critics, literary art.
"He's a brilliant writer for whom spies are merely subject matter," Robert Gottlieb, who edited some of Le Carre's books for Alfred A. Knopf in the 1970s and '80s, told the New York Times Magazine in 2013. "Calling him a spy writer is like calling Joseph Conrad a sea writer, or Jane Austen a domestic-comedy writer."
Still writing until late in life, Le Carre died Saturday evening at his home in Cornwall after a short illness, according to a statement from Jonny Geller, chief executive of literary agency Curtis Brown Group. He was 89.
In a career that began in 1961, Le Carre wrote 25 novels ranging from post-World War II espionage in Europe to the post-9/11 struggle against terrorism, with side trips to such places as Panama, Nigeria and Gibraltar.
Although best known for his spy stories, he also wrote about Russian money launderers ("Our Kind of Traitor," 2010), Africans caught up in the turmoil of the Congo ("The Mission Song," 2006), and a British actress drawn into an Israeli plot to assassinate a Palestinian terrorist ("The Little Drummer Girl," 1983).
With fellow Briton Graham Greene, Le Carre helped redefine the spy novel, and showed that, when done well, such works could be read as high art. Le Carre won few literary awards -- primarily because he refused to enter the contests and routinely declined nominations. At least seven of his works were adapted to film, beginning with "The Spy Who Came in From the Cold" in 1965 and including the Oscar-nominated "Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy" in 2011 and "The Constant Gardener" in 2005, for which Rachel Weisz won a best supporting actress Oscar.
Although most spy-genre novels focus on action, Le Carre's work stood out for his obsession with the gray areas of morality, human weakness and failure, and the machinations of governments -- which can become meat grinders for the truth.
"As the systems for propagating information and speeding it around the globe are becoming ever more sophisticated, so do the opportunities to manipulate information," Le Carre told the Washington Post in 1996. "The manipulation of truth seems to go hand-in-hand with the availability of information."
David Cornwell was born Oct. 19, 1931, in Poole, England, one of two sons of Ronald and Olive Cornwell. His father was a mercurial con man who spent time in prison for insurance fraud but who also connived his way into London's upper society. It made for a fractious father-son relationship, which found its way into several of Le Carre's novels and a memoir published in the New Yorker in 2002. Le Carre's mother ran off with another man when Le Carre was 5, and he spent most of his childhood in boarding schools, an experience that fueled his dislike for the British class system.
Having a knack for languages, Le Carre worked with British army intelligence, interviewing German-speaking defectors from the Eastern bloc, then in 1951 entered Oxford, where he studied modern languages -- and worked for MI5, England's domestic intelligence agency, trying to ferret out Soviet agents.
By 1960, Le Carre was working for MI6, the foreign intelligence service, in Hamburg and Bonn. And he was writing. His first novel, "Call for the Dead," came out in 1961. His superiors forbade him to publish under his real name, and for reasons that in ensuing years he lied about, obscured or seemed to have forgotten, he came up with the Le Carre pen name.
That first novel also introduced George Smiley, the rotund and unkempt spymaster who would become the main or side character in at least eight of Le Carre's novels. Unlike the most famous literary spy of the era, Ian Fleming's James Bond, the debonair womanizing man of international action, Smiley was a plodding, bureaucratic Everyman with a razor-sharp mind, a dogged nature, and an ability to be immediately forgotten.
"He sat leaning back with his short legs bent, head forward, and plump hands linked across his generous stomach," Le Carre wrote in "Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy." "His hooded eyes had closed behind the thick lenses. His only fidget was to polish his glasses on the silk lining of his tie, and when he did this his eyes had a soaked, naked look that was embarrassing for those who caught him at it."
The first two novels received little attention, but Le Carre's third, 1963's "The Spy Who Came in From the Cold" -- a cynical exposition on the moral failing of both the East and the West -- was an international bestseller. Le Carre made so much money from the book, he stashed away his real-world cloak and dagger and devoted himself to writing full time.
The fame was overwhelming, and Le Carre initially didn't handle it well. "I made an awful mess of my first marriage," he said in the New York Times Magazine interview. "It was hard to live with me being me."
He and his wife, Alison, with whom he had three sons -- Simon and Stephen, who are involved in film adaptations of Le Carre's novels, and Timothy -- divorced in 1971. The next year, he married Valerie Jane Eustace, a former book editor. They had one son together, the British novelist Nick Harkaway.
In his novels, Le Carre sought to mix real terminology from the spy world with invented terms and uses, such as "honey pot" for the use of a pretty woman to seduce a target, "scalphunter" for an assassin, and "lamplighter" for someone who gathers information from surveillance and couriers. Le Carre was surprised to learn that over time many of his invented phrases found their way into the spy world's lexicon; some even credit him with coining the word "mole" for a highly placed spy, though he said he believed he took the term from the KGB.
But Le Carre was, foremost, a writer of tales that explored human frailty and notions of patriotism, as well as the dehumanizing aspects of strict adherence to political doctrine at a time when extremism threatened to plummet the world into nuclear war. "As a storyteller, he's simply one of the best we have," Nan Graham, publisher of Scribner, told the Associated Press in 2008.
The embrace was not universal, however. In a 1989 Guardian review of "The Russia House," author Salman Rushdie dismissed Le Carre as a genre writer who wanted to be taken seriously. "Much of the trouble is, I'm afraid, literary," Rushdie wrote. "There is something unavoidably stick-figure-like about le Carre's attempts at characterization."
The two later descended into a famous literary feud. While deploring the fatwa placed on Rushdie's head by Iranian spiritual leader Ayatollah Khomeini over perceived slights to Islam in Rushdie's "The Satanic Verses," Le Carre argued in 1997 that "there is no law in life or nature that says great religions may be insulted with impunity." Le Carre added that he "was more concerned about the girl in Penguin Books who might get her hands blown off in the mailroom than ... that Rushdie's royalties."
Rushdie responded by calling Le Carre "a pompous ass." It was 15 years before the two reconciled.
Espionage, of course, comes in the service of politics, and Le Carre was a persistent critic of post-9/11 U.S. policies and actions. A few weeks before the invasion of Iraq, Le Carre wrote a scathing indictment in the Times of London under the headline, "The United States of America Has Gone Mad," and called the marshaling of public support for war "one of the great public relations conjuring tricks of history." Le Carre blamed collusion between "U.S. media and corporate interests" for an environment in which, "as in McCarthy times, the freedoms that have made America the envy of the world are being systematically eroded."
And Le Carre saw literature -- his literature -- as a way to perhaps goad a lethargic body politic to action.
"Every writer wants his book to change people in some way," he told the Weekly Australian in 2003 after publication of his novel "Absolute Friends," about American military globalization and the fragility of truth. "I want to break through the apathy. I think this book is really saying something that isn't being said, that we have gone clean off the rails. I hope it entertains. But I also hope it stirs."

Why Social Networks Can't Catch the Fakes

Texto completo: Facebook, Twitter and other companies have gotten better at catching bots. But fake accounts created by real humans are trickier.
Every few months, social media companies say they removed another billion fake accounts. So how did a 21-year-old delivery driver in Pennsylvania impersonate Trump family members on Twitter for nearly a year, eventually fooling the president?
The answer has to do with the enormity of the social networks, the complexity of catching fakes, and the business incentives of the companies that run the sites.
The bot problem
Facebook said it blocked 4.5 billion accounts in the first nine months of the year, and that it caught more than 99 percent of those accounts before users could flag them. That number of accounts -- equivalent to nearly 60 percent of the world's population -- is mind-boggling. It's also inflated.
The vast majority of those accounts were so-called bots, or automated accounts that are often created en masse by software programs. Bots have been used for years to artificially amplify certain posts or topics so they are seen by more people.
In recent years, Facebook, Twitter and other tech companies have gotten much better at catching bots. They use software that spots and blocks them, often during the registration process, by looking for digital evidence that suggests the accounts are automated.
As Facebook has caught more bots, it has also reported increasingly colossal statistics on how many fake accounts it takes down. Those numbers have brought the company plenty of positive headlines, but "they're actually not used internally that much," said Alex Stamos, Facebook's former chief information security officer, who left the company in 2018. "One person can blow out the stats, because there's no cost to do an attempt."
In other words, one person can create a software program that attempts to create millions of Facebook accounts, and when Facebook's software blocks those bots, its tally of deleted fakes swells.
Facebook has admitted that these statistics are not that helpful. "The number for fake accounts actioned is very skewed by simplistic attacks," Alex Schultz, Facebook's vice president of analytics, said last year. The prevalence of fake accounts is a more telling metric, he said. And it shows the company still has a big problem. Despite removing billions of accounts, Facebook estimates that 5 percent of its profiles are fake, or more than 90 million accounts, a figure that hasn't budged for more than a year.
Handmade fakes
The social media companies have a much harder time with fake accounts that are created manually -- that is, by a person sitting at a computer or tapping away on a phone.
Such fakes don't carry the same telltale digital signs of a bot. Instead, the companies' software has to look for other clues, like an account sending multiple strangers the same message. But that approach is imperfect and works better for certain kinds of fakes.
That in part explains why Josh Hall, the Pennsylvania delivery driver, was able to repeatedly impersonate President Trump's relatives on Twitter and attract tens of thousands of followers before the company took notice.
Manual fakes can be more pernicious than bots because they look more believable. Political operatives use such fakes to spread disinformation and conspiracy theories, while scammers use them to defraud people. Criminals have posed as celebrities, soldiers and even Mark Zuckerberg on social media to trick people into handing over money.
Twitter's effort to catch impostor accounts is complicated by its policy allowing parody accounts. The company requires parody accounts to be clearly labeled.
Facebook also still struggles with accounts that pose as those belonging to public figures, but periodic reviews by The New York Times suggest the company has gotten better at removing them. Instagram, which Facebook owns, has not made as much progress.
Asking users to help
One way to combat the fakes is to require more documentation to create an account. The companies have begun to often require a phone number, but they are loath to make it more difficult for people to join their sites. Their businesses are predicated on adding more users so they can sell more ads to show them. Plus, Twitter in particular prizes its users' anonymity; the company said it enables dissidents to speak out against authoritarian governments.
So to whittle down the number of questionable accounts they should review, the companies rely on users to flag them. The strategy is far more efficient and cost-effective for the companies. It also means that as a fake account gains more attention, the more likely that it will be flagged for a closer look.
Yet it still sometimes takes a while for the companies to act. Mr. Hall gained 77,000 followers posing as President Trump's brother and 34,000 followers as the president's 14-year-old son before Twitter took down the accounts, which Mr. Hall had used to spread conspiracy theories. And from 2015 to 2017, people working for the Russian government posed as the Tennessee Republican Party on Twitter, attracting 150,000 followers, including senior members of the Trump administration, while posting racist and xenophobic messages, according to a federal investigation.
A Twitter spokesman said in a statement, "We're working hard to ensure that violations of our rules against impersonation, particularly when people are attempting to spread misinformation, are addressed quickly and consistently."
Still, most fakes fail to attract many followers. Mr. Stamos argued that impostor accounts that few people notice don't have much of an impact. "It gets pretty Zen but: If nobody follows a fake account, does the fake account exist?" he said.
Mr. Stamos said that tech companies face so many threats, they must make difficult decisions on what issues to work on, and sometimes, the tricky work of rooting out each fake account isn't worth it.
"The companies are usually putting effort behind the things that they can show are the worst, not just the things that look bad," he said. "How do you apply the always finite resources that you have to the problems that are actually causing harm?"

New York Mayor Race Starts a Slow Dance

Texto completo: As Kathryn Garcia and Shaun Donovan officially launched their campaigns last week, two newcomers, Andrew Yang and Rep. Max Rose, seemed poised to soon join them.
One of the traditions of modern-day election cycles is the two-step dance that candidates perform in launching their campaigns. First comes the string of obvious clues: a listening tour, speeches delivered at Sunday church, and perhaps even an announcement of an exploratory bid.
Then comes the actual launch, normally filled with live fanfare, music and hope, and accompanied by an introductory campaign video.
In the race for New York City mayor, both parts of the two-step dance were on display last week. Shaun Donovan, a former housing secretary and budget director under President Barack Obama, officially launched his campaign on Tuesday; two days later, Kathryn Garcia, who recently stepped down as the city's sanitation commissioner, did the same.
Amid those intentional campaign rollouts, a seemingly unintentional launch also materialized on Thursday: Representative Max Rose registered a mayoral campaign committee with the city Campaign Finance Board. Two days later, in an interview with The New York Times, he confirmed that he had begun an exploratory bid.
If that wasn't enough, next year's dozens of races -- including the mayor's -- also saw a curious $ 1 million contribution, although it was not immediately clear which candidate might benefit the most from it. Here are five takeaways from the week that was.
Real estate's $ 1 million bet on the mayoral race
The real estate developer Stephen M. Ross, who has been casting about for a way to influence next year's elections, appears to have found a means to do so.
The Hudson Yards developer donated $ 1 million in December to a new independent expenditure committee called Common Sense NYC, according to state finance records. The committee has raised nearly $ 1.5 million so far, the rest of it from real estate and business executives like Jack Cayre of Midtown Equities and Isaac Ash, the chief executive of United Legwear and Apparel, each of whom donated $ 100,000.
Business leaders in New York have long been frustrated with Mayor Bill de Blasio, and have been looking for a more business-friendly candidate to support. The pandemic-fueled financial crisis has only deepened the business community's resolve, and some leaders had successfully encouraged Raymond J. McGuire, a Wall Street executive, to enter the race.
Independent expenditure committees are not allowed to coordinate with a candidate or a campaign. While no one affiliated with Common Sense NYC would comment for this story, a person familiar with its goals -- driving the conversation surrounding the future of the city, including its fiscal health, quality of life, public education, infrastructure and homelessness -- said it only just began raising money and plans to accumulate significantly more before too long.
That person also said the group was focused on many of next year's New York City elections, not just the mayor's race. In 2021, more than 30 of the City Council's 51 seats are up for grabs, as are the mayor's and the comptroller's offices, according to New York City's Campaign Finance Board.
Look who's running, Part 1
In the unsexy area of managerial competence, Ms. Garcia and Mr. Donovan are hoping to distinguish themselves from the rest of the field, and from Mr. de Blasio, whose management style has become the subject of intense criticism.
Both leaned heavily on their experience captaining large, complicated bureaucracies -- not the flashiest pitch for mayor, but one they hope will resonate at a time of profound crisis for New York City.
Ms. Garcia, Mr. de Blasio's go-to crisis manager in addition to being his former sanitation commissioner, launched her campaign for mayor with a 14-minute announcement on Zoom and a straightforward message.
"You won't find a candidate who has more experience in New York City government than me," she said.
She spoke from the same Park Slope living room from which she has participated in several mayoral forums. She cited her energy, her work ethic and her first notable endorsement, from Harry Nespoli, president of the Uniformed Sanitationmen's Association.
She called for converting Rikers Island into a composting and renewable energy zone and for electrifying school buses. But above all, she called for good management and "grit."
"For 14 years, my job has been to solve problems for New York, and I've got no plan to stop now," she said. Ms. Garcia was also the interim head of the New York City Housing Authority, among other duties. But she made no mention of Mr. de Blasio by name.
Two days earlier, Mr. Donovan made his own formal announcement, also by Zoom. He made passing reference to his time working as city housing commissioner, but, like Ms. Garcia, made no explicit mention of the mayor for whom he worked, Michael R. Bloomberg.
Instead, he spoke in soaring tones about equity and New York City resilience, and about his time working for the Obama administration as budget director and housing secretary. He pitched his federal connections as a salve for local problems.
"I know the heart, talent and values of the president- and vice president-elect firsthand," he said. "The remarkable, diverse team they're putting together includes many I have been proud to serve with and call my friends."
This week, he is expected to roll out his climate agenda, which will call for the city to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, in part by working to close the city's dirtiest power plants, known as "peaker plants," and improving bus transportation by creating dedicated busways throughout the city.
Look who's running (unofficially), Part 2
It may be a few weeks before the official announcement, but it appears clear that Andrew Yang intends to enter the mayoral race.
Mr. Yang, who was born in New York State and lives in Manhattan, gained a loyal following as a Democratic presidential candidate, largely because of his proposal to give every American a universal basic income.
He has been meeting with political power brokers in the city, and has told some of them that he plans to run. He has also enlisted two prominent New York-based political strategists with ties to Mr. Bloomberg.
As for Mr. Rose, who lost his bid for re-election last month in a conservative district that covers Staten Island and South Brooklyn, he refused to explain or elaborate on his registration with the Campaign Finance Board.
If you want someone with experience and guts and ability to end our broken politics, then I could be your candidate," he told The Times on Saturday.
Will the next mayor be a public school parent?
Mr. de Blasio is a rarity among New York City mayors: He is believed to be the first mayor in half a century who has had a child in public schools while in office.
His son, Dante, attended Brooklyn Technical High School in Brooklyn, and his daughter, Chiara, graduated from Beacon High School in Manhattan before he became mayor.
A front-runner in the race to replace Mr. de Blasio, Scott Stringer, the city comptroller, has two young sons who attend public schools. He discussed his struggles as a parent during the pandemic in an interview with The New York Times last week. Mr. Stringer has already declared himself a candidate.
Mr. Yang has a son, Damian, 5, who attends a public school. His older son, Christopher, who is 8 and has autism, attends a private school. Both are learning online during the pandemic.
Two others -- Mr. McGuire and Maya Wiley, a former top counsel for Mr. de Blasio who has also declared that she is running -- send their children to private schools. Mr. de Blasio has often mentioned how navigating the public school system informs his decisions as mayor.
The furor over ranked-choice voting continues
Several members of the City Council's Black, Latino and Asian Caucus filed a lawsuit in State Supreme Court in Manhattan last week to stop the implementation of ranked-choice voting. It did not take long for repercussions to surface.
The lawsuit charges that voters have not been properly educated about ranked-choice voting and that it will lead to Black voters being disenfranchised. Two Black mayoral candidates, Eric Adams, the Brooklyn borough president, and Raymond J. McGuire, a business executive, have raised similar concerns.
Under the new system, voters can rank up to five candidates in order of preference. If one candidate receives a majority of first place votes, they win. But if no candidate receives a majority, the last-place winner is eliminated and the second choice votes of those ballots are counted. The process continues until one candidate has won a majority.
But two Black women running for mayor -- Maya Wiley and Dianne Morales, an Afro-Latina -- support ranked-choice voting.
And at a virtual forum about ranked-choice voting for Brooklyn borough president candidates, Robert E. Cornegy Jr., a councilman from Brooklyn, was criticized by his fellow candidates for participating in the lawsuit.
Many of the candidates at the forum, sponsored by Rank the Vote NYC among other groups, supported ranked-choice voting.
Antonio Reynoso, also a councilman from Brooklyn, said the lawsuit would "insert doubt" and discourage Black people from voting because all six council members who filed the suit are Black, and four of them represent Brooklyn.

Texto completo: The Indians will change the name of their franchise, the New York Times reported Sunday night.
The Indians had announced in July that a "thorough review" would take place regarding the franchise name. They did not commit to a name change at that time, though it was always very likely getting rid of the Indians moniker would be the end result.
The Times report indicated a more formal announcement could come within the next week, and that the team plans to stick with the Indians name and uniforms in 2021 before potentially shifting away from them in 2022.
One option could be to proceed without a team name, as the Washington Football Team has done, until a new name can be selected and implemented, the Times reported. The next team name is not yet known, but some of the more popular options include "Spiders," "Guardians," "Blues" and several others pertaining to music or aquatic themes.
The Indians dropped the Chief Wahoo logo from their uniforms and from view of the playing field before the 2019 season, though they retained the trademark and rights to the logo in part to disallow others to use it on a larger scale.
Cleveland's baseball team has gone by the Indians nickname since 1915.

Trump Rescinds Plan for White House Staff to Be Quickly Vaccinated

President Donald Trump said Sunday night that he would delay a plan for senior White House staff members to receive the coronavirus vaccine in the coming days, hours after The New York Times reported that the administration was planning to rapidly distribute the vaccine to its staff at a time when the first doses are generally being reserved for high-risk health care workers.
Trump, who tested positive for the coronavirus in October and recovered after being hospitalized, also implied that he would get the vaccine himself at some point in the future, but said he had no immediate plans to do so.
“People working in the White House should receive the vaccine somewhat later in the program, unless specifically necessary,” Trump tweeted, hours after a National Security Council spokesperson had defended the plan. “I have asked that this adjustment be made. I am not scheduled to take the vaccine, but look forward to doing so at the appropriate time. Thank you!”
It was not immediately clear why the president decided to change the policy, or whether he had even been aware of it ahead of time. But White House staff members who work in close quarters with him had been told that they were scheduled to receive injections of the coronavirus vaccine soon, two people familiar with the distribution plans said.
The goal of distributing the vaccine in the West Wing was to prevent additional government officials from falling ill in the final weeks of the Trump administration. The hope was to eventually distribute the vaccine to everyone who works in the White House, one of the people said.
It was not clear how many doses were being allocated to the White House or how many were needed, since many staff members had already tested positive for the virus and recovered. While many Trump officials said they were eager to receive the vaccine and would take it if it were offered, others said they were concerned it would send the wrong message by making it appear as if Trump staff members were hopping the line to protect a president who has already recovered from the virus and bragged that he is now “immune.”
The first doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine left a facility in Michigan early Sunday, with UPS and FedEx teaming up to ship doses to all 50 states for distribution.
“Senior officials across all three branches of government will receive vaccinations pursuant to continuity of government protocols established in executive policy,” John Ullyot, a spokesperson for the National Security Council, had said in a statement earlier Sunday, defending the planned vaccinations. “The American people should have confidence that they are receiving the same safe and effective vaccine as senior officials of the United States government.”
The picture was murky on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers have struggled for months to balance the need to carry on with legislative business despite fluctuating numbers of coronavirus cases in its own ranks. A congressional aide said Sunday evening that leaders on Capitol Hill had not yet been told how many doses would initially be available for lawmakers. Dr. Brian P. Monahan, the attending physician of Congress, has overseen the coronavirus response inside the Capitol complex, but he has yet to make public any plans for vaccine distribution there.
A spokesperson for President-elect Joe Biden declined to say whether Biden or incoming officials would receive early doses of the vaccine. But the president-elect said in a recent CNN interview that he would take the vaccine to serve as an example once Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, said it was safe. “It’s important to communicate to the American people it’s safe; it’s safe to do this,” Biden said.
After months during which Trump and his senior advisers played down the virus, hosting campaign rallies and holiday parties where face masks were encouraged but never required, the news of White House officials suddenly taking the virus seriously enough to claim early doses of a vaccine was greeted by outrage from Democrats as well as the president’s longtime critics.
George T. Conway III, a prominent conservative lawyer and a vocal critic of Trump, noted that because the vaccine required a second dose 21 to 28 days after the first injection, there was little public benefit for White House staff members to receive them. The president has only 37 days left in office.
“If they were truly interested in protecting staffers,” Conway wrote on Twitter, “they would have been better off not holding super spreader events.”
Tim Hogan, a Democratic consultant and a former top aide to Sen. Amy Klobuchar’s presidential campaign, said that Washington “will not come close to covering every health care worker with its first allotment of the vaccine, but a White House that downplayed the virus and held a half-year nationwide superspreader tour gets to cut the line.”
He called the White House vaccinations “a final middle finger to the nurses and doctors on the front lines from the Trump administration.”
A senior administration official said that vaccinating officials was necessary for “providing visible leadership to the nation and the world, and maintaining the trust and confidence of the American people.” The official added that vaccinating West Wing officials would help to “continue essential operations, without interruption” to help continue to fight the pandemic nationwide.
There have been multiple outbreaks of the coronavirus at the White House in recent months. Trump, the first lady and a half-dozen advisers tested positive at the end of September and in early October. Fauci later called a Rose Garden ceremony to announce Trump’s choice of Judge Amy Coney Barrett for the Supreme Court a “superspreader event.”
A few weeks later, Vice President Mike Pence’s chief of staff, Marc Short, and a group of other Pence staff members and advisers tested positive.
And a third wave hit the West Wing after the president’s election night party at the White House, where supporters gathered indoors and did not wear masks. Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, got sick around that time, as did a number of other Trump advisers.
Most recently, Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani tested positive, along with Jenna Ellis, another lawyer on the president’s legal team.

Big Tech Turns Its Lobbyists Loose on Europe, Alarming Regulators

A leaked document jolted the European Union capital of Brussels in October, laying out in painstaking detail plans by Google to undermine new legislation that could severely damage its digital advertising business.
“Academic allies” would raise questions about the new rules. Google would attempt to erode support within the European Commission to complicate the policymaking process. And the company would try to seed a trans-Atlantic trade dispute by enlisting U.S. officials against the European policy, according to a copy reviewed by The New York Times and confirmed by Google.
For many officials in Brussels, the document confirmed what they had long suspected: Google and other American tech giants are engaged in a broad lobbying campaign to stop stronger regulation against them.
As the European Union has become the global leader in tech regulation, these companies have increasingly focused on Brussels in hopes of choking off even stiffer rules before they spread. American lawmakers and regulators have already become much more aggressive. Last week, federal and state officials accused Facebook of illegally crushing competition. In October, the Justice Department accused Google of illegally protecting its monopoly over search.
In Europe, the companies are spending more than ever, hiring former government officials, well-connected law firms and consulting firms. They funded dozens of think tanks and trade associations, endowed academic positions at top universities across the Continent and helped publish industry-friendly research by other firms.
In the first half of 2020, Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft declared spending a combined 19 million euros (about $23 million) equal to what they had declared for all of 2019 and up from 6.8 million euros in 2014, according to Transparency International, a group that monitors EU lobbying. The spending is helping to deliver access; the companies and their allies reported hundreds of meetings with officials at the European Commission and the European Parliament.
“The budgets are really unrivaled — we’ve never seen this kind of money being spent by companies directly,” said Margarida Silva, a researcher at Corporate Europe Observatory, a group that also tracks lobbying in Brussels. The totals are probably much higher, she noted, because disclosure rules do not capture all the spending on law firms, academic partnerships and activities in individual countries.
While the spending is less than in the United States, the growing influence industry is alarming EU officials who believe that Big Tech is contributing to a Washingtonization of Brussels, giving money and connections an upper hand over the public interest.
“This is a trend that has been going on for years — a professionalization of the lobbying industry in Brussels,” said Max Bank, an investigator at LobbyControl, a German-based group that has been studying corporate influence.
Google, Amazon, Apple and Facebook declined to comment. In public statements, all have expressed a desire to work with European officials, while voicing concerns that the proposed laws could harm innovation and the European economy. Casper Klynge, who oversees European government affairs for Microsoft, said in a statement that the European Union “has been and remains an important stakeholder for our company” and that Microsoft sought to be a “constructive and transparent partner to European policymakers.”
Despite the lobbying, the industry has had few major successes. European leaders like Margrethe Vestager, who oversees digital policy, have called the companies threats to democracy and anti-competitive and have taken several steps to rein them in. Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook either are under antitrust investigation or have already been penalized billions of dollars. In recent years, the EU has adopted industry-opposed laws on issues including privacy and online copyright.
Alexandra Geese, a German member of the European Parliament who works on digital issues, said many officials viewed the companies with suspicion. Before in-person meetings were scaled back because of the pandemic, she regularly turned down invitations from tech lobbyists to social gatherings, she said.
“I don’t think we should have these conversations over a very expensive bottle of Bordeaux,” Geese said.
But the industry does not seem deterred, even as it faces what many believe will be its toughest fight yet.
On Tuesday, EU officials led by Vestager will introduce some of the world’s most far-reaching technology regulations. The rules take aim at so-called gatekeeper platforms, like Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google, which have an outsize role in the digital economy.
Among the expected changes are rules for Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, which is owned by Google, about moderating user-generated content. Other requirements would make companies disclose more about how services like Google and Facebook’s digital advertising products worked. The largest companies could be forced to share some data with small rivals. Stiffer competition rules could prevent the companies from giving their services preferential treatment over small rivals, and limit their ability to move into new product categories.
“There is a lot to lose for the tech industry with the new legislation,” Bank of LobbyControl said.
The laws are not expected to be approved before 2022, giving the companies ample time to influence the debate.
In October, the leaked document showed how Google tried to influence the European debate before a draft was even introduced. It included plans to enlist U.S. officials from embassies across Europe and in the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. It suggested talking points for Google supporters, such as the risk to the economy during the pandemic.
After details of the document were published by Le Point, a French magazine, many European officials expressed outrage and resolved to press ahead with the new laws. In a meeting after the leak, Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive officer, apologized to Thierry Breton, a European commissioner helping to draft the new rules.
Yet Google and its allies appeared to be moving forward with ideas in the plan nonetheless. In Washington, the Internet Association, a trade group representing Google and other tech giants, submitted comments to the U.S. trade representative, encouraging the federal government to “act decisively and quickly in order to prevent the rapid expansion of harmful initiatives” in Europe.
Tiemo Wölken, a member of the European Parliament from Germany who has been involved in the policy writing, said tech companies had allies in Brussels. After he introduced a proposal to explore a ban on targeted advertising, which would have a devastating effect on Google and Facebook, the industry worked with news publishers to get an amendment introduced to remove the wording, he said. Wölken, who has pushed for tougher lobbying rules, said he had fought off the effort by a single vote, but expects the issue to come up again.
European officials criticized the biggest tech companies for laundering their influence through groups that appear impartial. In October, the European Center for International Political Economy published a report that said new tech regulations would cost the European economy 2 million jobs and 85 billion euros in lost gross domestic product. The European Center for International Political Economy is one of at least 36 trade groups, associations and think tanks that Google funds, according to Corporate Europe Observatory.
“People will always claim their political, academic or intellectual independence — they’d reject that they’ve been influenced,” said Marietje Schaake, a former member of the European Parliament who now teaches at Stanford University. “But the question then becomes, why are the firms spending so much money in Brussels?”
At one influential nonprofit, European Digital Rights, Jan Penfrat recalled getting phone calls last year from Google, Facebook and others seeking cooperation and offering support soon after he took a leadership position.
“It was like they were trying to co-opt us and get us on their side,” Penfrat said. “That was the first hint and it was alarming.”
Paul Hofheinz, a former Wall Street Journal reporter who co-founded the Lisbon Council, a research group in Brussels that has faced criticism from watchdog groups for accepting money from Google, said having corporate partners ensured that research was more well rounded.
“Our views are independent. Period,” Hofheinz said in an email. “I don’t know why these campaigning organizations think we’re putzes who can’t reason things out for ourselves. There’s something very insulting in that idea. And very wrong.”
Few predict that lobbying in Brussels will reach the scale of Washington, where corporations and individuals face fewer restrictions to spending money on political campaigns. But European officials are seeing more signs of the influence industry’s growth, including a robust commercial real estate market bolstered by the arrival of new corporations, lobby firms and think tanks.
Before the pandemic, Silva of the Corporate Europe Observatory offered a “lobbyist walking tour” around Brussels, including a pass by Google’s office overlooking the pond in Leopold Park.
“The risk,” she said, “is we are creating a system that benefits those with the most money.”

NEW YORK — A man was fatally shot by police after he opened fire near a crowd of hundreds of people gathered for a Christmas concert Sunday afternoon outside the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in Morningside Heights, authorities said.
It was not immediately clear if the gunman was shooting at anyone in the crowd, but witnesses said he appeared to be angling his shots upward. No one else was struck by gunfire, police said.
Police Commissioner Dermot F. Shea said at a news conference outside the church that the man had a gun in each hand and opened fire from behind a marble pillar in front of the church’s large wooden doors, which were decorated with Christmas wreaths.
Three officers who were working nearby returned fire, striking the gunman at least once in the head, Shea said.
Shea said a motive for the shooting was not yet clear, but according to several witnesses, the man had yelled, “Kill me.”
He said police recovered two semi-automatic firearms from the scene along with a bag filled with gasoline, wire, rope, multiple knives, tape and a Bible.
“It is by the grace of God today that we don’t have anyone struck,” Shea said.
The police said they were waiting for fingerprints to confirm the man is the person on his identification: a 52-year-old with a lengthy criminal record, including a conviction for second-degree murder in 1990, police officials said.
The shooting began minutes after the end of the concert, said Lisa Schubert, a cathedral spokesperson who witnessed the incident.
“It was just beautiful, and then at the end this person started shooting. Everybody is in shock,” she said. “The shooter could have killed a lot of people. There were hundreds of people here, and he shot at least 20 times.”
Schubert said she was standing on the driveway of the cathedral when the shooting began.
“We had been planning this concert for weeks as a gift to the community, and the weather was beautiful, so the whole community was out, physically distanced with masks, people with dogs and people with babies,” she said. “It was something like we haven’t seen since last March.”
Matthew Bishop, 56, who was watching the concert with his wife, son and friends, said that after the concert ended, people were invited inside the church. Moments later, the shooting started, he said.
“Suddenly everyone looked at each other and started running,” he said.
Yuri Nakamura, 36, and her husband were inside the cathedral after listening to the concert. The singers had finished “Ave Maria” and more people were coming in when a loud hammering sound erupted, Nakamura said.
The couple did not see the shooting, but soon security officers and police began rushing in.
Madeline Tsingopoulos attended the concert and listened to the choir sing a mix of carols, hymns, spirituals and modern tunes, she said. She had hoped to shake the conductor’s hand, but she decided to walk back to her home nearby. Within minutes, she heard helicopters.
“It was one of the most beautiful, spectacular, peaceful events,” she said. “It was very welcomed during this pandemic. Fortunately, I left right away, then almost immediately, we heard helicopters overhead.”
Narine Sargsyan was in the area at the time of the shooting and said it sent terrified people running down Amsterdam Avenue, some of whom rushed to the nearby Hungarian Pastry Shop where employees let them inside.
“We heard shooting like fireworks, and everyone was like, ‘There was a shooting at this event in front of the church,” said Sargsyan, who was at the shop. “People were panicked because no one knew what was going on. They were running down the street and hiding themselves wherever they could. Some kids hid in the bathroom.”
Dozens of police vehicles with their lights flashing lined Amsterdam Avenue outside the church’s three-block front Sunday night. Counterterrorism officers, some with long guns, milled about as crowds of civilians waited behind yellow police tape in front of the church.
The Cathedral of St. John the Divine is the seat of the Episcopal Diocese of New York, and many of the leaders of the diocese were present for the concert and witnessed the shooting, including the Rt. Rev. Clifton Daniel III, the dean of the cathedral, and the Rt. Rev. Andrew M.L. Dietsche, the bishop of New York. Both men declined to speak to a reporter Sunday.
“The Cathedral of St. John the Divine parishioners, concert audience, clergy and staff are all safe after a shooting at our outdoor Christmas Carols for the Community Concert today,” Isadora Wilkenfeld, another spokesperson, said in a statement. “Our prayers are with all those affected by this.”

Kremlin-backed hackers breach US Treasury and Commerce: Report

Texto completo: A "sophisticated hacking group" backed by the Russian government reportedly infiltrated the Department of Treasury's systems and stole information related to internet and telecommunications policymaking as part of a broader campaign that also hacked the Commerce Department and other government agencies.
The FBI is investigating the attacks and is looking into the Russian hacking group APT29, also known as Cozy Bear, as a potential culprit, according to the Washington Post. The foreign-backed hack was first reported by Reuters. An FBI spokesperson told the Washington Examiner the bureau "is aware of today's reporting and is appropriately engaged, however, we decline to comment further.”
As a result of the hack, the National Security Council held a meeting at the White House on Sunday.
The Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency confirmed the incident in a statement but did not suggest who was behind the attack.
"We have been working closely with our agency partners regarding recently discovered activity on government networks," the agency said. "CISA is providing technical assistance to affected entities as they work to identify and mitigate any potential compromises."
SolarWinds, an IT company, runs network management systems that were breached by the hackers, as first reported by the Washington Post.
"We are aware of a potential vulnerability which if present is currently believed to be related to updates which were released between March and June 2020 to our Orion monitoring products," Kevin Thompson, the president and CEO of the company, told the Washington Examiner in a statement. "We believe that this vulnerability is the result of a highly-sophisticated, targeted and manual supply chain attack by a nation state. We are acting in close coordination with FireEye, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the intelligence community, and other law enforcement to investigate these matters. As such, we are limited as to what we can share at this time.”
NSC spokesman John Ullyot said that the government is "aware of these reports" and was "taking all necessary steps to identify and remedy any possible issues related to the situation." The Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment.
A Commerce Department spokesperson told the Washington Examiner that "we can confirm there has been a breach in one of our bureaus" and that "we have asked CISA and the FBI to investigate, and we cannot comment further at this time." The Wall Street Journal reported that the hack of Commerce Department systems targeted the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, which advises the executive branch and the president on information policy.
The New York Times reported that the cyberattacks on Treasury and Commerce gave the hackers “free access to their email systems.”
APT29 has been linked to several high-profile hacking campaigns, including attempts to steal coronavirus vaccine research. The group was also connected to a Tuesday attack on FireEye, a cybersecurity firm that works with government agencies and specializes in exposing and fighting foreign cyberattacks.
FireEye, a $3.5 billion Silicon Valley company famous for helping governments and its large corporate clients respond to cyberattacks, announced last week that a "state-sponsored attack" resulted in the cyber theft of secretive “Red Team” cybertools that mimic a cyber adversary’s online attacks and assist clients with defending against them. The group said it was working with the FBI and Microsoft to investigate, and the New York Times reported at the time that the “evidence points to Russia’s intelligence agencies” while the Wall Street Journal reported that “a person familiar with the matter said Russia is currently seen by investigators as the most likely culprit but stressed that the investigation was continuing.”
Kevin Mandia, the president of FireEye, wrote a blog post late Sunday night, saying that the company “identified a global campaign that introduces a compromise into the networks of public and private organizations through the software supply chain." He said “this compromise is delivered through updates to a widely-used IT infrastructure management software — the Orion network monitoring product from SolarWinds.” Mandia added that “the campaign demonstrates top-tier operational tradecraft and resourcing consistent with state-sponsored threat actors.”
The FireEye leader said “we have now identified multiple organizations where we see indications of compromise dating back to the Spring of 2020, and we are in the process of notifying those organizations” and that his company had determined that “each of the attacks require meticulous planning and manual interaction.”

“We have been in close coordination with SolarWinds, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and other key partners,” Mandia said. “We believe it is critical to notify all our customers and the security community about this threat so organizations can take appropriate steps.”

In a separate post, FireEye said it had identified hacking victims which include “government, consulting, technology, telecom and extractive entities in North America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East” and “we anticipate there are additional victims in other countries and verticals.”

Microsoft, which is also believed to be helping with the broader investigation into the cyber intrusions against the U.S. government, released a threat warning on Saturday about malicious behavior detected by Microsoft Defender Antivirus which it had dubbed “Win32/Solorigate.C!dha” — a likely reference to the SolarWinds hack.
The incident comes weeks after President Trump fired Chris Krebs, who had headed CISA. His role has not been permanently filled.
Last week, the National Security Agency released a cybersecurity advisory warning that “Russian state-sponsored malicious cyber actors are exploiting a vulnerability” in products created by the California-based VMware software company, and that the vulnerability was “allowing the actors access to protected data and abusing federated authentication.” The NSA said then that it “encourages National Security System, Department of Defense, and Defense Industrial Base network administrators to prioritize mitigation of the vulnerability on affected servers.”
If Russian culpability is definitively established for the hacks of U.S. government agencies, it would harken back to Russia’s large-scale hacking of the State Department in 2014. Cyber actors affiliated with Russia's Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff, or GRU, were also named by the U.S., including in federal indictments from special counsel Robert Mueller, as responsible for the hacking of the Democratic National Committee’s email systems in 2016.
The Washington Examiner reached out to the Treasury Department for further comment.

After a report The New York Times published Friday detailing a lawsuit performer FKA twigs filed against actor Shia LaBeouf, accusing him of sexual battery, assault and inflicting emotional distress, the reaction on social media was enormous and swift. The topic, trending on Twitter, became the subject of conversation among women who said they had also been abused by a partner.
The 32-year-old singer and actress, born Tahliah Debrett Barnett, told The Times that she had chosen to come forward to explain how someone so well-known, with money and a strong support network, could be caught in a cycle of abuse. Karolyn Pho, another former girlfriend of LaBeouf's, described similar experiences to The Times.
In an email, LaBeouf wrote that many of the allegations that the women raised were not true. He broadly addressed his behavior in an email. “I have no excuses for my alcoholism or aggression, only rationalizations. I have been abusive to myself and everyone around me for years,” he told The Times.
Barnett later posted a thread on Twitter, which has since been liked and retweeted thousands of times, acknowledging the reaction to the suit and her story.
“I hope that by sharing my experience I can truly help others feel like they are not alone and shed some light on how those who are worried somebody they care about may be in an abusive relationship can help because I understand it can be confusing and hard to know what to do,” she wrote in the thread.
Readers responded to her account by sharing their own stories, as well as expressing support for Barnett and her decision to speak out. Among those weighing in were Angelica Jade Bastién, a critic at Vulture, who wrote that she had witnessed and experienced abuse, and Karen Attiah, the global opinions editor for The Washington Post, who posted about leaving an abusive relationship.
On Saturday night, Australian singer-songwriter Sia also shared her support for Barnett, posting on Twitter that she had been “hurt emotionally” by LaBeouf. A representative for LaBeouf did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding that accusation.
During her relationship with LaBeouf, Barnett was finishing her album “Magdalene,” which was ultimately released in November 2019 after several delays. Gary Suarez, a freelance journalist and music critic, wrote that the album “was already such a powerful and emotionally potent listening experience” before he learned what Barnett had been through while working on the album.
Others also pointed to Barnett’s descriptions of isolation. “Abusers steal their victims’ freedom through tactics of coercive control,” Myriam Gurba, a writer and artist, posted on Twitter. Ayesha A. Siddiqi, a trends forecaster and writer, noted that isolation occurs outside the relationship as well.
Statistics from the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence state that 1 in 4 women is a victim of sexual violence, physical violence and/or stalking by an intimate partner during her lifetime. Intimate partner violence occurs at a disproportionately high rate in Black communities, where systemic discrimination can create barriers to safety and justice, according to the organization.
Domestic violence calls have increased during the pandemic as stay-at-home orders were imposed, according to the Domestic Violence Hotline.

Authorities in Washington, D.C., said Sunday that they had arrested a man in connection with the stabbing of four people Saturday night as supporters and opponents of President Donald Trump clashed blocks from the White House.
The four were stabbed outside a bar at 11th and F streets northwest around 9 p.m. Saturday, the Metropolitan Police Department said in a statement. A Washington resident, Phillip Johnson, 29, was arrested and charged with assault with a dangerous weapon, a police spokesperson said. A police report said he had used a knife.
The confrontation was one of several angry encounters in Washington and in state capitals across the country Saturday as supporters of Trump, incensed by a Supreme Court ruling that further dashed the president’s hopes of overturning the results of the November election, clashed with counterprotesters.
In some places, those confrontations escalated into violence, including in Olympia, Washington, where police declared a riot and one person was shot.
The police incident report on the Washington, D.C., stabbing said officers who were working the demonstrations responded to reports of a fight outside Harry’s Bar on F Street Northwest, where they found four people with stab wounds. The Washington Post reported that the bar was being used Saturday as a gathering point for the Proud Boys, a right-wing group known for inciting violence at protests.
A photographer who witnessed the confrontation as he was covering the protests for The New York Times said it occurred after dozens of supporters of Trump, many of whom appeared to be members of the Proud Boys, gathered on the street outside Harry’s Bar. The photographer, Victor J. Blue, said some of the Trump supporters shouted and pointed at a Black man in dark clothes who was alone and against a wall.
At least three of the Trump supporters offered to let the man leave and implored the others to let him go in peace. After about a minute, as the man hesitated, more demonstrators closed in and began to punch and kick him, according to Blue and video footage of the confrontation that was shared by The New York Post.
At that point, the man pulled out a knife and began slashing with it as more demonstrators piled onto him. The man broke free twice, but was then grabbed and beaten again, the photographer said. Police officers intervened after the man was face down on the ground. Several protesters yelled that the man had a knife and had stabbed someone. Blue said that the man’s face was swollen and bloodied when police officers picked him up.
The victims were conscious and breathing when they were taken to a hospital, a Police Department spokesperson said Sunday. Douglas Buchanan, a spokesperson for the D.C. Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department, said Sunday that their injuries were not life-threatening.
Police identified the men who had been stabbed as Franklin Todd Gregory of McMinnville, Tennessee; Corey Owen Nielsen of Robbinsdale, Minnesota; Jeremy Bertino of Locust, North Carolina; and Gregory Lyons, whose hometown was not released. Police said that Gregory identified Johnson as the man who had stabbed him.
Johnson could not be reached Sunday. It was not immediately clear if he was still in custody or whether he had a lawyer.
Minutes before the stabbings, supporters of Trump tore down a Black Lives Matter banner and burned it on the street, videos on social media show. The flag was removed from outside the Asbury United Methodist Church, one of the oldest Black churches in Washington, which has stood at the corner of 11th and K Streets Northwest since 1836.
The church’s senior pastor, the Rev. Dr. Ianther M. Mills, said in a statement that the scene reminded him of a cross burning.
“We are a resilient people who have trusted in God through slavery and the Underground Railroad, Jim Crow and the Civil Rights movement,” he said, “and now as we face an apparent rise in white supremacy.”
Another video showed a sign bearing the Black Lives Matter slogan being torn down from the Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church near the corner of 15th and M Streets Northwest. A Police Department spokeswoman said the authorities were aware of the incidents and were investigating them as possible hate crimes.
“DC’s faith-based organizations are at the very heart of our community, giving us hope in the face of darkness,” Mayor Muriel Bowser of Washington said in a statement on Facebook. “They embody our DC values of love and inclusivity. An attack on them is an attack on all of us.”
A Police Department spokesperson said that eight officers were injured during the protests Sunday. Two of those officers sustained serious but not life-threatening injuries and were also taken to hospitals, said Buchanan, the Fire and Emergency Medical Services spokesperson.
A total of 33 people were arrested in Washington, D.C., from Saturday afternoon into Sunday morning in connection with the protests, mostly for various types of assault, including assault on police officers, according to a Police Department arrest database.
In videos of a separate clash in Olympia, Washington, that were posted on social media, a single gunshot can be heard as counterprotesters advance on members of a pro-Trump group Saturday, including one person on a sidewalk who is waving a large Trump flag. After the gunshot, one of the counterprotesters can be seen falling to the ground as others call for help. In another video, a man with a gun can be seen running from the scene and putting on a red hat.
Authorities said Sunday that they had arrested a 25-year-old man from Shoreline, Washington, on a first-degree assault charge, said Chris Loftis, a spokesperson for the Washington State Patrol. Loftis did not release the man’s name Sunday.
The gunfire in Olympia came after supporters of Trump and counterprotesters gathered near the state Capitol on Saturday afternoon and clashed before the shooting.
Olympia police said there were four arrests and that four officers had been injured, according to CBS affiliate KIRO.

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
With Iowa’s closely watched presidential caucuses more endangered than ever after a disastrous showing in February that delayed results for days, the Iowa Democratic Party on Saturday sought to shift blame for the meltdown onto the Democratic National Committee.
More than 10 months after the fiasco marred Iowa’s first-in-the-nation nominating contest, the state party circulated a blistering internal report asserting that the national party had meddled in and delayed the development of an app for reporting results, implemented coding errors in its back-end result reporting system and required new data that further complicated the process.
The renewed sniping between Iowa Democrats and the national party comes at a critical time for the future of Iowa’s standing at the beginning of the presidential nominating calendar. The caucuses are a cherished tradition for Iowans, but an increasing number of national Democrats say they are outdated and undemocratic.
The heart of the 26-page Iowa report blames the DNC for the delay in results on caucus night. It states that the national party, weeks before the Feb. 3 caucuses, demanded a new tool to give it real-time results. This new tool, the report states, included coding errors that delivered inaccurate results, leading to a dayslong delay before former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont finished in a virtual tie for first place.
“When the DNC’s database conversion tool failed to work correctly, it caused the DNC to wrongly stop the IDP from reporting its results, and the IDP’s entire planned reporting process was thrown into disarray,” the report says. “If the DNC had not interjected itself into the results reporting process based on its erroneous data conversion, caucus night could conceivably have proceeded according to the IDP’s initial plan.”
Iowa’s first-in-the-nation status was in jeopardy even before the 2020 disaster.
Black and Hispanic Democrats argued that a state, whose population is 90% white, did not properly represent an increasingly diverse party. The caucuses themselves, which require people to attend in person, often for hours, and navigate labyrinthine rules, are less democratic than primaries, critics say. And the party’s internal record-keeping from caucus sites has been proved shoddy for a second presidential election in a row.
“The caucus system itself is an anti-democratic relic that we must do away with,” Julián Castro, the former U.S. housing secretary who as a 2020 presidential candidate was most vocal in attacking Iowa’s early-state status, said Saturday. “But it also must be a priority for the next DNC chair to reorder our primaries so that they reflect our party’s diversity and values. Iowa and New Hampshire are wonderful places, but they should no longer go first.”
Iowa Democrats no longer have an ally leading their party in Washington. While Barack Obama owed his presidency to a surprise victory in the 2008 Iowa caucuses, President-elect Joe Biden never built the robust Iowa organization of his top 2020 caucus rivals and finished a distant fourth once the results were finally released.
Biden, as president, will select the next DNC leader. He has yet to reveal his selection, but the party began a review over the summer of its presidential nominating procedures that it expects will “make improvements to the 2024 nominating process.”
The DNC declined to participate in the Iowa Democratic Party’s report. David Bergstein, a committee spokesperson, said the DNC’s involvement in the caucus setup had been validated by a litany of errors in the result reporting process.
“Underlying technical problems were caused by errors from the IDP’s vendor,” he said, referring to a technology firm that built the smartphone caucus result reporting app.
The New York Times found that more than 100 Iowa caucus precincts had reported results that were internally inconsistent or missing data.
Iowa has long held its place at the beginning of the nominating calendar by working in a bloc with its fellow early states New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada, but for months there have been signs that those alliances have frayed.
Harry Reid, the former Senate majority leader who remains the functional head of the Nevada Democrats, in February called for all Democratic presidential caucuses to end. Jaime Harrison, the former South Carolina Democratic Party chair who is a leading contender to lead the national party, declined Saturday to say whether Iowa should retain its first-in-the-nation status.
There is no indication that Republicans will replace Iowa at the front of their 2024 presidential nominating calendar.
Of 10 key “takeaways” in a fact sheet distributed to Iowa Democratic Party members, six blame the DNC for caucus-night problems.
The report, prepared by Bonnie Campbell, a former Iowa attorney general, and Nick Klinefeldt, a former top federal prosecutor in Iowa, also places blame on the Iowa Democratic Party for failing to anticipate problems in its caucus-night “boiler room,” citing a lack of training and too few telephone lines to receive results. Just 439 of 1,765 precincts successfully submitted results through the party’s smartphone app, and phone lines were jammed as precinct leaders tried calling instead.
Troy Price, who oversaw the bungled caucuses as chair of the Iowa Democratic Party, resigned a week later.
The New York Times reported in February that the Iowa official in charge of the boiler room did not know how to use the Google spreadsheet application that Iowa Democrats used to enter data once the result-reporting app failed.
The report also criticized news reporters for calling county officials and the party’s caucus-night headquarters in search of information when no results were being made public.
“The media indirectly interfered with the results reporting process by reaching out to county chairs directly for information and calling the boiler room hotline, tying up the already busy phone bank,” the report states.

For many, sparkling water is the perfect beverage — versatile and utterly refreshing, able to cleanse the palate and it contains zero calories. And it sure seems to be having a moment. Sales of packaged sparkling water have skyrocketed since the pandemic confined so many seltzer fans to their homes, with MarketWatch reporting a dramatic 52% jump in March alone. That same month, the demand trickled down to the aluminum can industry and U.S. sales rose 24% by volume. If these trends continue, experts predict a widespread can shortage could be on the horizon.
Of course, there are ways of getting your bubbly fix without putting a strain on aluminum reserves or hoarding plastic Polar Seltzer bottles in your pantry. Countertop carbonators like SodaStream are one popular method, but if you drink enough seltzer — as so many of us do — the constant hand pumping, frequent gas cylinder exchanges and limited output (1 liter at a time, who can live like that!) are reasons enough to look for bigger, better and more sustainable options. Enter the selzterator, a DIY sparkling-water draft machine guaranteed to revolutionize your home hydration game.
The idea may seem innovative, but it’s actually just a repurposed kegerator, a retrofitted refrigerator device home-brewers and other small-scale beverage makers have been using for decades. The build out is simple once you get into the swing of things, and the majority of the materials can be picked up either new or used from an online marketplace, or from a hardware store or a local home-brew shop. It’s best to research home-brew shops and online forums first, as those folks tend to be full of helpful advice about everything from construction tips and fixes to where to get the best prices on equipment.
The whole exercise takes about a day and can run less than $150 if you buy used and do your research. After that initial investment, you’re looking at a near-endless stream of perfectly calibrated sparkling tap water that costs zero dollars and results in zero waste.
TOOLS
7/8-inch diameter hole saw
Power drill and drill bits
Flathead screwdriver (for tightening metal clamps)
Hex wrench
Spray bottle filled with soapy water
EQUIPMENT
Working mini-fridge with interior shelving removed and no freezer
Five-pound CO2 tank
Clean five-gallon Cornelius/home-brew keg (small enough to fit inside the fridge)
Faucet tower with rubber tower gasket, faucet head, and tap handle (can be purchased separately but buying it as a kit makes things easier)
Liquid line (a standard clear vinyl hose used for kegging systems; runs 3- to 5-foot with a 3/16-inch diameter and should come included in any faucet tower kit)
CO2 line (the same 3- to 5-foot 3/16-inch diameter clear vinyl hose as above)
Liquid line connector (ball lock-style quick disconnect)
CO2 line connector (ball lock-style quick disconnect)
Three to five metal screw clamps for both lines
CO2 regulator
METHOD
1. Center your faucet tower on the top of the mini-fridge, then mark the spots where you plan to install the liquid line and tower bolts. Using the hole saw, cut a 1- to 1.5-inch hole through the roof of the fridge for the liquid line, careful not to disrupt any mechanical elements. Then drill corresponding holes for the tower bolts.
2. Unravel the liquid line from the bottom of the tower kit and thread it through the hole into the fridge. Connect the open end of the line to the liquid line connector and secure the connection with a metal clamp.
3. If it’s not already attached, affix the tap handle and faucet head to the tower according to its instructions, then lower the tower down onto the top of the fridge. Insert the tower bolts into their holes and secure each to the interior of the fridge with a washer and nut. Close the fridge, plug it in and leave it to chill at its coldest setting.
4. While the fridge is cooling, connect one end of the CO2 line to the CO2 regulator and secure it with a metal clamp. Attach the CO2 line connector to the other end of the CO2 line and secure it with a metal clamp.
5. Connect the regulator to the CO2 tank and tighten the connection with the hex wrench, making sure the tank and regulator are both in the closed or off position.
6. Fill the keg with clean, cold tap water and lock the lid into place. Using the CO2 line connector, connect the CO2 line to the keg’s “IN” valve — it should snap on smoothly.
7. Twist the CO2 tank to the open position and open the regulator’s valve so CO2 starts flowing through the line and into the keg. Spray the system with soapy water and look for bubbles to indicate gas leaks.
8. Slowly turn the regulator’s knob until the needle on the pressure gauge reaches 40 psi. At this level, it should take about 24 hours to carbonate the tank. If you want to speed things up, gently roll the keg on the ground for about 10 minutes while maintaining the connection to the CO2 tank. The agitation will help spread the bubbles faster than letting it sit.
9. Carefully place the tank and regulator into the chilled fridge and slide the keg in beside (or in front of) the tank. Connect the liquid line to the keg’s second valve using the liquid line connector. Allow the keg to carbonate for 24 to 36 hours before serving (less if you’ve used the rolling method). When ready to pour, adjust the regulator’s psi gauge down to 15 to 25 psi for dispensing (more or less depending on how bubbly you like your seltzer). Grab a glass and enjoy.

Slightly uneven little spheres dusted in cocoa to simulate the soil on a freshly dug fungus — the black Tuber melanosporum — defines a chocolate truffle at its most basic. Inside is a firm yet velvety center, a confection called ganache. Truffles are never cheap, but before you take out the credit card consider the homemade variety; they could not be easier to produce and do not require special equipment. With supervision, an 8-year-old can shape and dip truffles for a nice afternoon activity.
In addition to the classic cocoa-coated version, chocolate truffles are often encased in a chocolate shell, sometimes embellished with nuts, icing and even gold leaf. Their flavor can also be varied according to whether you opt for dark, milk or white chocolate, add ingredients like raspberry purée, nuts and coffee, or spirits like port, brandy and even Champagne. Size matters, too. Chocolate truffles should be one-bite affairs, no more than 1 inch in diameter — 3/4-inch is ideal.
— RECIPES:
Grapy Chocolate Truffles
Time: 4 hours, including chilling
Yield: About 40
Ingredients:
6 ounces high-quality semisweet or bittersweet chocolate, 70% cacao
1/2 cup heavy cream
3 tablespoons ruby port or grape juice
1/2 cup unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa
Preparation:
1. Break chocolate into small pieces, place in a small, heavy saucepan and add cream. Place over low heat, stirring occasionally, until chocolate has melted. Remove from heat, stir in the port or juice; transfer to a bowl. Cover and refrigerate until mixture is firm, about 2 hours.
2. Spread a sheet of waxed or parchment paper on a baking sheet. Have a bowl of ice water handy. Use a spoon or spoons, or melon-baller, to scoop mounds of the mixture about 3/4-inch in diameter. Roll lightly between your palms to make nice spheres and place them on the paper. Occasionally moisten the spoon and your hands with ice water to keep the chocolate from sticking. Chill until firm, about 2 hours or overnight.
3. Spread cocoa on a chilled plate. Remove truffles from the refrigerator, roll each in cocoa and return them to the baking sheet. Refrigerate until firm. Truffles can be frozen for up to one week.
White Chocolate Prosecco Truffles
Time: 6 hours, including chilling
Yield: About 40
Ingredients:
6 ounces high-quality semisweet or bittersweet chocolate, 70% cacao
1/2 cup heavy cream
3 tablespoons prosecco
1/2 pound high-quality white chocolate for coating
Preparation:
1. Break dark chocolate into small pieces, place in a small, heavy saucepan and add cream. Place over low heat, stirring occasionally, until chocolate has melted. Remove from heat, stir in the prosecco and transfer to a bowl. Cover and refrigerate until mixture is firm, about 2 hours.
2. Spread a sheet of waxed or parchment paper on a baking sheet. Have a bowl of ice water handy. Use a spoon or spoons, or melon-baller, to scoop mounds about 3/4-inch in diameter. Roll lightly between your palms to make nice spheres and place them on paper. Occasionally moisten the spoon and your hands with ice water to keep the chocolate from sticking. Chill until firm, about 2 hours or overnight.
3. Break white chocolate in pieces and melt in the top of a double-boiler or place in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave for 1 minute at 50% power, stirring every 15 seconds. Allow chocolate to cool at room temperature to around 90 degrees, stirring from time to time. Drop chilled truffles one at a time into melted chocolate, quickly lifting them out with a small fork or a professional wire dipping loop, allowing excess to drip off. Arrange on baking sheet and refrigerate for about 2 hours.

Among all the tools that health agencies have developed over the years to fight epidemics, at least one has remained a constant for more than a century: paper vaccination certificates.
In the 1880s, in response to smallpox outbreaks, some public schools began requiring students and teachers to show vaccination cards. In the 1960s, amid yellow fever epidemics, the World Health Organization introduced an international travel document, known informally as the yellow card. Even now, travelers from certain regions are required to show a version of the card at airports.
But now, just as the United States is preparing to distribute the first vaccines for the virus, the entry ticket to the nation’s reopening is set to come largely in the form of a digital health credential.
In the coming weeks, major airlines including United, JetBlue and Lufthansa plan to introduce a health passport app, called CommonPass, that aims to verify passengers’ virus test results — and soon, vaccinations. The app will then issue confirmation codes enabling passengers to board certain international flights. It is just the start of a push for digital COVID-19 credentials that could soon be embraced by employers, schools, summer camps and entertainment venues.
“This is likely to be a new normal need that we’re going to have to deal with to control and contain this pandemic,” said Dr. Brad Perkins, the chief medical officer at the Commons Project Foundation, a nonprofit in Geneva that developed the CommonPass app.
The advent of electronic vaccination credentials could have a profound effect on efforts to control the coronavirus and restore the economy. They could prompt more employers and college campuses to reopen. They may also give some consumers peace of mind, developers say, by creating an easy way for movie theaters, cruise ships and sports arenas to admit only those with documented coronavirus vaccinations.
But the digital passes also raise the specter of a society split into health pass haves and have-nots, particularly if venues begin requiring the apps as entry tickets. The apps could make it difficult for people with limited access to vaccines or online verification tools to work or visit popular destinations. Civil liberties experts also warn that the technology could create an invasive system of social control, akin to the heightened surveillance that China adopted during the pandemic — only instead of federal or state governments, private actors like employers and restaurants would determine who can and cannot access services.
“Protecting public health has historically been used as a proxy for discrimination,” said Michele Goodwin, a law professor who directs the Center for Biotechnology and Global Health Policy at the University of California, Irvine. “That is the real concern — the potential to use these apps as proxies for keeping certain people away and out .”
She added that tech developers often rush to deploy and scale innovations before governments have the chance to test and regulate them.
In the U.S., for instance, the federal government plans to give out personal record cards to people receiving coronavirus vaccinations to remind them of their medical provider, vaccine manufacturer, batch number and date of inoculation. But federal health agencies have not yet issued guidance on third-party digital vaccination credentials, leaving it open for companies and nonprofits to introduce COVID-19 health pass apps. Neither the Department of Health and Human Services nor the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention responded to requests for comment.
Nonprofits and tech companies developing COVID-19 health pass apps say their aim is to create credentials as trustworthy as the WHO’s paper yellow card. And they argue that the smartphone apps — which people may use to retrieve their virus test results and immunizations directly from their heath providers — are more reliable than paper health documents, which may be forged.
“To restart the economy, to save certain industries, I think you need a solution like this,” said Eric Piscini, a vice president at IBM who oversaw the development of the company’s new health passport app. IBM recently completed a pilot test of the app, called Digital Health Pass, with an employer, he said, and is in discussions with a major sports stadium. Without such apps, Piscini said, “people will limit their engagement in travel and entertainment because of lack of confidence.”
Clear, a security company that uses biometric technology to confirm people’s identities at airports and elsewhere, is already operating a COVID app. Called Health Pass, the app has been adopted by some professional sports teams and insurers, where employees may use it to confirm their coronavirus test results. Once vaccines become available, the company said, the app will be able to check users’ immunizations as well.
But no COVID-19 health pass has received as much fanfare as the CommonPass app, developed by the Commons Project, a nonprofit focused on building technology for public use. The group began developing software to help people retrieve and use their medical data well before the start of the pandemic. But spikes in virus cases around the world this spring accelerated its work.
First, the group helped build a health pass app for some East African nations that aims to verify truck drivers with negative coronavirus test results, enabling them to pick up food shipments at ports and deliver them across borders to landlocked countries. A few months later, the group partnered with the World Economic Forum to build a more global digital health pass system for COVID-19. Their first target: international air travel.
The resulting app, CommonPass, notifies users of local travel rules — like having to provide proof of a negative virus test — and then aims to verify that they have met those rules, enabling them to board international flights. In October, United Airlines tested the app on a flight from Heathrow Airport in London to Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey.
Peter Vlitas, an executive at Internova Travel Group, a travel services company based in Manhattan, signed up for the United flight. He said he first downloaded the app, which informed him that he needed to test negative for the coronavirus before traveling. Next, he said, the app directed him to a rapid-testing center at the airport. Soon after he took the test, the app displayed his negative test results and generated a confirmation code.
United and four other airlines plan to start using the CommonPass app in the coming weeks on some international flights. Passengers may be asked to show their confirmation codes at airline check-in counters or departure gates.
Perkins said the Commons Project designed the app’s credentialing system to work for a broad audience. If international air travelers who lack smartphones need to confirm their health status, he said, they could print their confirmation codes and show them at an airport much as they would a paper boarding pass.
​
But the great leap forward to 21st-century digital health credentials from 19th-century paper vaccination certificates represents much more than a technological shift. Some civil liberties experts say the vaccine passport apps signal a troubling privatization of public health practices and caution that the technology comes with privacy risks.
“The corporate part of it, the ​extent to which this is going to be privatized is​ ​quite new​,” said Michael Willrich, a history professor at Brandeis University and the author of “Pox: An American History,” a book ​on health control during 20th century smallpox epidemics. “It raises concerns about privacy, about the right to be free from everyday surveillance.”
App developers said they had seriously considered the privacy risks and designed their systems to help mitigate them.
The CommonPass, IBM and Clear apps, for instance, allow users to download their virus test results — and soon their vaccinations — to their smartphones. The apps can then check the medical data and generate unique confirmation codes that users can show at airports or other locations to confirm their health status.
But the health passes do not share specific details — like where and when a user was tested — with airlines or employers, developers said. The QR codes, they said, act merely as a kind of green light, clearing users for entry.
Even so, some tech executives are wary. Zac Cohen, chief operating officer of Trulioo, an identity verification company, said society would be better off if app developers invested their considerable energy in pushing for the equitable distribution of coronavirus vaccines before pushing for apps to confirm that some people have been vaccinated.
“What we’re seeing today is a jump forward to try to create pockets of safe environments while ignoring the broader ethical concerns that that creates,” Cohen said.
He recently wrote an op-ed for an industry site warning that health passport apps could easily prevent people who cannot prove their identities or health status from accessing essential services.
“Until we figure out how to do that in a fair way,” Cohen said, “we really need to be cautious about deploying that technology.”

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
MANILA, Philippines — Nikko Flores bought his first bicycle with borrowed money when public transit was restricted in the Philippine capital because of the coronavirus pandemic.
The secondhand mountain bike cost nearly half a month’s salary, but it proved essential for getting across metro Manila, a sprawling urban area with nearly 14 million residents and notorious traffic jams.
Now Flores, 23, sees cycling not only as a logistical convenience but also as a means of personal liberation.
“You just want to go farther and farther away,” he said on a recent morning after working a graveyard shift as a security guard at a Manila condominium. “It’s really fun, like you’ve unlocked something overwhelming.”
As the need for social distancing forces governments around the world to reduce public transportation service, city dwellers from Paris to Tokyo are hopping on bikes instead. Global bicycle sales have surged to the point where even Giant, the world’s largest bike-maker, has struggled to fill orders.
Manila’s cycling surge is notable because the Philippines has not only one of the highest coronavirus caseloads in Asia — more than 445,000 infections, according to a New York Times database — but also some of the region’s worst urban congestion.
Last year, a study by the Asian Development Bank found that metro Manila, an area roughly six times the size of Paris, was the most congested of 24 cities that it surveyed across South and Southeast Asia. Japan’s development agency estimates that the cost of traffic to Manila’s economy is more than $72 million, or 3.5 billion Philippine pesos, a day.
Metro Manila was shuttered in March as part of a wider lockdown of Luzon, the country’s most populous island, imposed by President Rodrigo Duterte. When stay-at-home orders began to lift a few months later, public transit was still operating at limited capacity.
Some regular bus and train commuters started driving instead. But for many Manila residents, walking or cycling became their only means of getting to work.
Biking on Manila’s snarled, potholed roads can be hazardous, in part because some drivers regard cyclists as obstacles. Sidewalks, too, are often clogged with street vendors and makeshift parking areas. The Manila metropolitan area had 19 bicycle-related fatalities last year, according to official figures. By comparison, New York officials counted 28.
On his first few rides, Flores, who bought his mountain bike in August, came close to having an accident while weaving through cars in the sweltering heat.
“Which lane is safe?” he wrote in a Facebook group called Bike to Work that now has more than 7,000 members. “Cars honk behind me and I lose my balance.”
Another user, Mamer Toldo, replied: “It’s better if they’re honking. At least you know they see you.”
Another challenge was keeping his bike in working order when parts were in high demand. His chain kept breaking, and he had to sell his video game collection for about $20 to buy cycling lights and to replace his brakes.
Eventually, though, he settled into a routine of sorts, and his crosstown trips began to feel like major victories.
“For others it would be a small achievement, but for me it’s huge because I managed to do it even though I was afraid of being on the road,” Flores said.
The government has been gradually easing restrictions on public transit in metro Manila since June. But by now, Flores and many other commuters are hooked on cycling, and some downtown streets where vendors once sold vegetables and electronics are filled with bikes and accessories for sale.
The biking boom prompted Philippine officials to announce a plan in August for building a 400-mile bike lane network that would be financed through a pandemic-related stimulus fund.
“Even I bought a bike so I would personally feel and understand the needs of our cyclists,” Mark Steven Pastor, an assistant transportation secretary, said by telephone.
Toix Cerna, a cycling advocate in Manila, said that while the bike lane plan was a major milestone, there was still widespread skepticism among local officials toward biking as a means of transport.
“We will need to continue the campaign to change mindsets,” she said. “Personally, I still feel that we’ll have to try to win this thing every year — every time it’s budget season.”
Flores said he planned to take biking excursions outside the city on his days off. For now, though, he mostly commutes on roads swarmed with cars, buses, motorcycles, tricycles and jeepneys, the locally produced passenger trucks that are fixtures of Manila’s pollution-choked streets.
Before he sets out in the early evening, he checks his bike chain and puts on his helmet. Then he starts pedaling south toward downtown from his home in Caloocan City, a part of metro Manila — a journey that takes him under train tracks, into drainage culverts and across chaotic intersections.
When he arrives at work about 40 minutes later, he changes out of his cycling clothes and irons out the creases in his work uniform. During breaks, he pops outside to make sure that his bike hasn’t been stolen, or to cover it with a recycled plastic laundry bag to protect it from rain.
When his shift ends around daybreak, he cycles home, where he washes his uniform and falls asleep. The intensity of the traffic fluctuates, he said, but one thing is constant: a lingering fear of being sideswiped by a car.
“I pray for my safety,” he said. “My mind is focused on the road. My eyes move right and left.”

The Electoral College Is Voting Monday. Here’s What to Expect.

The members of the Electoral College will gather in their respective states Monday to cast their official ballots for president. Ordinarily, the process is little more than a formal duty to rubber-stamp the results of the November election.
Not this year.
For weeks, President Donald Trump and his allies have pressured Republican officials to ignore the popular vote in close-fought states won by President-elect Joe Biden and appoint their own electors who would favor Trump. They have also asked courts to hand victory to the president in states he lost.
But judges and Republican state lawmakers have shown little appetite for subverting the democratic process, and the electors have remained. As they vote Monday, Trump is essentially guaranteed to end the day as he began it: a one-term president.
Here is more on how the voting will work, and on the next steps in the process:
Can I watch the Electoral College vote?
Yes — most states offer livestreams to watch the proceedings, including crucial battlegrounds won by Biden.
The electors don’t meet in one place or at one time; some start at 10 a.m. ET, and most vote in the afternoon. California, the crucial state for Biden to achieve 270 Electoral College votes, meets at 5 p.m. ET.
Electors for each state and the District of Columbia meet at a location chosen by the state Legislature, most often the state’s Capitol. The Delaware electors are meeting in a gym. Nevada is the only state holding its meeting virtually this year.
How does the Electoral College voting work?
The electors cast their ballots for president and vice president via paper ballot. Thirty-three states and D.C. legally require their electors to choose whoever won the state’s popular vote, so there should be no surprises there. The other 17 states don’t “bind” their electors, meaning they can vote for whomever they choose.
The electors were chosen by state parties (if Biden won a state, for example, the Democrats’ slate of electors casts the votes). Typically, electors are political activists, officials, donors and people with close relationships to the candidates — meaning they are very likely to vote for the candidate they pledged to support. In 2016, seven electors lodged protest votes for someone other than their party’s candidate. But the likelihood of “faithless electors” switching sides and handing the election to Trump is essentially zero.
After the electors cast their ballots, the votes are counted and the electors sign certificates showing the results. These are paired with certificates from the governor’s office showing the state’s vote totals. The certificates are sent to Vice President Mike Pence, in his capacity as president of the Senate; the Office of the Federal Register; the secretary of state of the respective state; and the chief judge of the U.S. District Court where the electors meet.
What happens next?
Congress officially counts the votes in a joint session held in the House chamber Jan. 6, with Pence presiding. Pence opens the certificates — in alphabetical order by state — and presents them to four “tellers,” two from the House and two from the Senate, who count the votes. When Biden reaches a majority with 270 votes, Pence announces the result.
The proceeding is strictly prescribed by federal law, down to where various politicians sit in the chamber. (Pence gets the speaker’s chair, Speaker Nancy Pelosi sits to his left, and the “tellers” sit at the clerks’ desks.)
The session cannot be ended until the count is complete and the result publicly declared. At this point, the election is officially decided. The only remaining task is the inauguration Jan. 20.
Which Congress runs the process?
Since the new members will be sworn in Jan. 3, the next Congress will conduct this joint session. Democrats will hold control of the House. And Republicans will control the Senate, regardless of the results of the Georgia runoff elections Jan. 5, because Pence will still be in office to act as the tiebreaking vote if the chamber is split 50-50.
Can members of Congress block the results?
There is no debate permitted during the counting of the electoral votes. But after the result is read, members of Congress get one opportunity to lodge their concerns.
Any objection to a state’s results must be made in writing and be signed by at least one senator and one member of the House. The two chambers would then separate to debate the objection. Each member of Congress can speak only once — for five minutes — and after two hours the debate is cut off. Each body then votes on whether to reject the state’s results.
Since the Electoral Count Act was passed in 1887, there have been just two instances of congressional objections, in 1969 and 2005. Neither passed either the House or the Senate.
What’s the likelihood of Congress changing the outcome?
Stopping Biden from assuming office remains a long-shot strategy for Republicans.
For an objection to stand, it must pass both houses of Congress by a simple majority. If the vote followed party lines, Republicans could not block Biden’s victory.
Democrats control the House, so an objection would already be doomed there. In the Senate, Democrats would need to pick off only a couple of Republicans to side with them to vote down the objection. A number of Republican senators have declared Biden the president-elect.
With some Trump allies already planning objections, the congressional session is likely to make for good political theater. But the process has little chance of changing the outcome of the election.

Texto completo: At harvest time, as neighbors and relatives reap their crops, 80-year-old Jamal Khan can only look in despair on the plot of land that was the source of his family's livelihood - until the American forces arrived over a decade ago.
Just before sunset one day, armored vehicles drove into fields of knee-high corn stalks, claimed about 30 acres that were co-owned by about as many families and quickly cordoned off the area with barbed wire. This was now Combat Outpost Honaker-Miracle, one of the roughly 1,000 military installations the United States and its coalition partners would prop up across Afghanistan.
"In the whole vastness of the lord's world, I had this plot of land and this house that I am living in and nothing else," said Khan, who lives the Watapur District of Kunar province, in eastern Afghanistan. "We told them this is our private land, how do you suddenly put up here? They said nothing."
Khan is one of countless Afghans whose land became a casualty of the U.S.-led war and the sprawling military infrastructure born from it. They have been forced to navigate a maze of Afghan and American bureaucracy and indifference, stoking a growing bitterness toward coalition forces and the Afghan government alike.
Despite the drawdown of American forces in Afghanistan from more than 100,000 in 2011 to fewer than 5,000, some of the property they occupied has not been returned. Instead, the bases and the land have been transferred to Afghan security forces.
The Americans have left Watapur but Khan does not have his land back, and similar conflicts linger across the country. In at least half a dozen of Afghanistan's 34 provinces, The New York Times has found land disputes involving owners who said they had simply been shut out.
In a country where due process is nearly impossible in the face of corruption and state erosion, the U.S. presence has added to a long history of land disputes that have often served as an underlying cause of local conflicts.
The Taliban touts the swift resolution of disputes in its shadow courts as a strength, and the unresolved discord over land bolsters the insurgents' message that not only are Afghans deprived of justice under the American- backed government, but that the U.S. military presence has added to the injustice.
Khan still carries a pile of documents: petitions to the government, and even confirmation letters from the U.S. Army that say he is the rightful owner. On several occasions, he says, delegations from Kabul came to investigate - and they asked the villagers for money to cover their expenses during the stay.
But the most painful reminder of the trespass is his collection of small receipts. Although the Afghan army now occupies his land, Khan is still required to pay tax on the plot.
Over the years of fighting, the size of the U.S.-constructed installations varied greatly. Some bases were sprawling, even housing their own fast-food chain restaurants. In other cases, coalition forces would briefly occupy empty Afghan homes, destroying or modifying walls for defensive purposes before leaving.
Today, most installations are controlled by Afghan security forces; the few U.S. bases that remain are shuttering now as part of the U.S. deal with the Taliban.
In northern Balkh province, the U.S.-led coalition forces built a base next to the provincial capital's airport. Amanullah Balkhi, a local business owner, says the installation occupied about 20 acres of his land.
The defense ministry said it was government land, Balkhi was told, but if he proved he owned it, the coalition would compensate him and pay rent. He says he fought a six-year legal battle that cost him about $2 million, which he covered by selling two of his apartment buildings, renting out more land and taking on $500,000 of debt.
"I have the deed, and the government and the courts have attested that this is my land," he said. "But the Americans still have the land and they still deny me."
Balkhi has become deeply depressed, he said, adding, "I have ruined my life to get my right, but I have gotten nothing."
The story of a base in Panjwai, in southern Kandahar province, is almost identical - and speaks to the troubling legacy the United States has left behind.
About 10 years ago, dozens of coalition vehicles arrived at the small village and eyed about 10 acres of vineyard owned by half a dozen villagers. They even tasted the grapes before getting to work building a new base.
"They didn't carve a road where there was a trek, where we came and went - they carved a road for themselves through people's lands, people's gardens," said Fida Muhammad, a tribal elder from Panjwai and one of the vineyard's owners.
In the initial days, there was word that the coalition forces were offering compensation, but the area was so restive that approaching the base for money meant taking potentially lethal risks. Villagers feared the Americans would mistake them for the Taliban. And they knew that if they did manage to get their money, the Taliban, who were everywhere, would know and come after them for profiting from the occupiers.
The area was so lush that "you had to squint your eyes to find a dry patch," said Rashid Gul, a village resident. But these days it's desolate except for one small patch of vineyard.
"It ruined the irrigation system too - for five years, the irrigation canals were ruined, the land dried," Muhammad said of the coalition base. "Many families left the area. They went to the city for daily labor."
As one of the village elders, Muhammad took the lead in trying to get compensation and reclaim the land, to no avail. When the Americans ran the base, he said, the villagers' claim was simply lost in bureaucracy; come tomorrow, come the next day, he was told repeatedly.
"We have lost hope of finding someone who can get us our right," said Muhammad, who said he had made about 30 trips with petitions. "It's just tiring ourselves, losing more money, but we can't find a door to knock on for justice."

Texto completo: "When you have seven days in isolation in an ICU, though, you have time to do a lot of thinking, follow CDC guidelines in public no matter where you are and wear a mask to protect yourself and others."
Chris Christie
Former NJ governor and adviser to President Trump
I still remember exactly where I was sitting decades ago, during the short film shown in class: For a few painful minutes, we watched a woman talking mechanically, raspily through a hole in her throat, pausing occasionally to gasp for air.
The public service message: This is what can happen if you smoke.
I had nightmares about that ad, which today would most likely be tagged with a trigger warning or deemed unsuitable for children. But it was supremely effective: I never started smoking and doubt that few if any of my horrified classmates did, either.
When the government required television and radio stations to give $75 million in free airtime for antismoking ads between 1967 and 1970 – many of them terrifyingly graphic – smoking rates plummeted. Since then, numerous smoking "scare" campaigns have proved successful. Some even featured celebrities, like Yul Brynner's posthumous offering with a warning after he died from lung cancer:
"Now that I'm gone, don't smoke, whatever you do, just don't smoke."
As the United States faces out-of-control spikes from COVID-19, with people refusing to take recommended, often even mandated, precautions, our public health announcements from governments, medical groups and health care companies feel lame compared with the urgency of the moment. A mix of clever catchphrases, scientific information and calls to civic duty, they are virtuous and profoundly dull.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urges people to wear masks in videos that feature scientists and doctors talking about wanting to send kids safely to school or protecting freedom.
Quest Diagnostics made a video featuring people washing their hands, talking on the phone, playing checkers. The message: "Come together by spending time apart."
As cases were mounting in September, the Michigan government produced videos with the exhortation, "Spread Hope, Not Covid," urging Michiganders to put on a mask "for your community and country."
Forget that. Mister Rogers nice isn't working. It's time to make people scared and uncomfortable. It's time for some sharp, focused, terrifying realism.
"Fear appeals can be very effective," said Jay Van Bavel, associate professor of psychology at New York University, who co-authored a paper in Nature about how social science could support COVID response efforts. (They may not be needed as much in places like New York, he noted, where people experienced the constant sirens and the makeshift hospitals.)
I'm not talking fear-mongering, but showing in a straightforward and graphic way what can happen with the virus.
From what I could find, the State of California came close to showing the urgency: a soft-focus video of a person on a ventilator, featuring the sound of a breathing machine, but not a face. It exhorted people to wear a mask for their friends, moms and grandpas.
But maybe we need a PSA featuring someone actually on a ventilator in the hospital. You might see that person "bucking the vent" – bodies naturally rebel against the machine forcing pressurized oxygen into the lungs, which is why patients are typically sedated.
(Because I had witnessed this suffering as a practicing doctor, I was always upfront about the trauma with loved ones of terminally ill patients when they were trying to decide whether to consent to a relative being put on a ventilator. It sounds as easy as hooking someone to an IV. It's not.)
Another message could feature a patient lying in an ICU bed, immobile, tubes in the groin, with a mask delivering 100% oxygen over the mouth and nose – eyes wide with fear, watching the saturation numbers rise and dip on the monitor over the bed.
Maybe some PSAs should feature a so-called COVID long hauler, the 5% to 10% of people for whom recovery takes months. Perhaps a professional athlete like the National Football League's Ryquell Armstead, 24, who has been in and out of the hospital with serious lung issues and missed the season.
These PSAs might sound harsh, but they might overcome our natural denial. "One consistent research finding is that even when people see and understand risks, they underestimate the risks to themselves," Van Bavel said.
Graphs, statistics and reasonable explanations don't do it.
They haven't done it.
Only after Chris Christie, an adviser to President Donald Trump, experienced COVID, did he start preaching about mask-wearing:
"When you have seven days in isolation in an ICU, though, you have time to do a lot of thinking," Christie said, suggesting that people, "follow CDC guidelines in public no matter where you are and wear a mask to protect yourself and others."
We hear from many who resist taking precautions. They say, "I know someone who had it and it's not so bad." Or, "It's just like the flu."
Sure, most longtime smokers don't end up with lung cancer – or tethered to an oxygen tank – either. (That, in fact, was the justification of smokers like my father, whose two-pack-a-day habit contributed to his death at 47 of a heart attack.)
These new ads will seem hard to watch. "We live in a Pixar era," Van Bavel reflected, with traditional fairy tales now stripped of their gore and violence.
But studies have shown that emotional ads featuring personal stories about the effects of smoking were the most effective at persuading folks to quit. And quitting smoking is much harder than maintaining physical distance and mask-wearing.
Once a vaccine has proved successful and enough people are vaccinated, the pandemic may well be in the rearview mirror. In the meantime, the creators of public health messaging should stop favoring the cute, warm and dull. And – at least sometimes – scare you.

Prosecutors interview Trump's bank, insurer as NY probe ramps up

Texto completo: State prosecutors in Manhattan have interviewed several employees of President Donald Trump's bank and insurance broker in recent weeks, according to people with knowledge of the matter, escalating an investigation into the president that he is powerless to stop.
The interviews with people who work for the lender, Deutsche Bank, and the insurance brokerage, Aon, are the latest indication that once Trump leaves office, he faces the potential threat of criminal charges that would be beyond the reach of federal pardons.
It remains unclear whether the office of the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus Vance Jr., will ultimately bring charges. The prosecutors have been fighting in court for more than a year to obtain Trump's personal and corporate tax returns, which they have called central to their investigation. The issue now rests with the Supreme Court.
But lately, Vance's office has stepped up its efforts, issuing new subpoenas and questioning witnesses, including some before a grand jury, according to the people with knowledge of the matter, who requested anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the investigation.
The grand jury appears to be serving an investigative function, allowing prosecutors to authenticate documents and pursue other leads, rather than considering any charges.
When Trump returns to private life in January, he will lose the protection from criminal prosecution that his office has afforded him. While The New York Times has reported that he discussed granting preemptive pardons to his eldest children before leaving office -- and has claimed he has the power to pardon himself -- that authority applies only to federal crimes, and not to state or local investigations like the one being conducted by Vance's office.
The investigation by Vance, a Democrat, has focused on Trump's conduct as a private business owner and whether he or employees at his family business, the Trump Organization, committed financial crimes.

Person of the Year: Time magazine has named President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris its "Person of the Year."
Time's Editor-in-Chief Edward Felsenthal says Biden and Harris won the honor for "changing the American story, for showing that the forces of empathy are greater than the furies of division, for sharing a vision of healing in a grieving world."
Felsenthal notes, "Every elected President since FDR has at some point during his term been a Person of the Year, nearly a dozen of those in a presidential election year. This is the first time we have included a Vice President."

Museums blocked: A lone senator from Utah has singlehandedly blocked the bipartisan approval of two new national museums to honor American Latinos and women, arguing that "last thing we need is to further divide an already divided nation."
Republican Sen. Mike Lee objected Thursday to the creation of the two proposed Smithsonian museums, stalling two projects that have been in the making for decades and enjoy broad bipartisan support. Senate approval would have sent the legislation approving the Latino museum to President Donald Trump for his signature. The Senate was attempting to pass the measures by voice vote, which requires every senator's consent.
The dispute on the Senate floor came amid the impasse over a new coronavirus relief bill and highlighted the difficulty of achieving even widely supported goals in the polarized Congress. Lawmakers could still find a way to move forward on the creation of the museums, including by adding the bills to a must-pass spending package, but doing so could further complicate passage of that legislation.

Argentina abortion bill passes: Lawmakers in Argentina's lower house passed a bill Friday that would legalize abortion in most cases, a proposal from President Alberto Fernandez in response to long-sought demands from women's rights activists.
The bill, which needs approval from the country's Senate in a debate expected before the end of the year, allows for voluntary abortions to be carried out up to the 14th week of pregnancy.
The proposed law was approved in a 131-117 vote with six abstentions after a marathon debate that extended from Thursday into the early hours of Friday.
Demonstrators in favor of decriminalizing abortion, who had spent the night outside the congress building in Buenos Aires, erupted with joy and embraced each other as they listened to the parliamentary speaker reading the vote's results on screens.
Hundreds of yards away, not far from the parliament building, hundreds of opponents dressed in light blue and carrying the national flag deplored the result, with some shedding tears.

Media tycoon charged: Hong Kong pro-democracy activist and media tycoon Jimmy Lai has been charged under the city's national security law, amid a widening crackdown on dissent, according to local media reports.
Lai, who founded the Apple Daily tabloid, was charged on suspicion of colluding with foreign forces and endangering national security, local broadcaster TVB reported Friday.
He is the most high-profile person out of more than two dozen charged under the law since it was implemented in June.
Lai is scheduled to appear in court Saturday and could face a maximum punishment of life imprisonment.

Actions against porn site: Mastercard and Visa said Thursday they would block their customers from using the credit cards to make purchases on Pornhub following accusations the pornographic website showed videos of rape and underage sex.
They reacted following an investigation by opinion columnist Nicholas Kristof of The New York Times that also alleged the site depicts revenge pornography and video taken without the consent of participants.
Mastercard said it is terminating use of its cards on Pornhub after its own investigation confirmed violations of standards prohibiting unlawful conduct on the site. Mastercard said it also investigating other websites for potential illegal content.
Pornhub, in a statement, called the actions "exceptionally disappointing." Earlier this week, the company announced steps to protect against images of abuse, nonconsensual activity and underage models on the site, including a ban on unverified users uploading material.
"This news is crushing for the hundreds of thousands of models who rely on our platform for their livelihoods," Pornhub said.
CAPTION: Photo: Face mask to face mask: A woman wearing a face mask takes a picture of a lion statue with a face mask Friday at a park in Seoul, South Korea. The country is expanding the use of rapid tests and deploying hundreds of police and soldiers to help with contact tracing as it deals with its worst surge of COVID-19 since the early days of the pandemic.

Texto completo: It's a little before 10 a.m. on a Monday, and Harry Bliss has just wrapped up a call at his Cornish, New Hampshire, retreat
"I was on the phone with Steve," he says. "We were talking about the next book we're doing."
Steve being Steve Martin. The actor, comedian, writer, producer and musician.
The next book being a follow-up to their first, the newly released New York Times and Amazon bestseller "A Wealth of Pigeons," a collection of more than 120 single-panel cartoons (and a dozen or so multi-panel works) written by Martin and drawn by Bliss, who gets top billing on the cover.
The retreat being J.D. Salinger's old place, where the reclusive novelist moved two years after publishing "The Catcher in the Rye." Bliss bought the rustic property four years ago and splits his time between it and a residence he shares with his wife in Burlington, Vermont.
Not bad for a kid from upstate New York, who was around 13 when he first became aware of Martin, then a wild and crazy guy who wore a fake arrow through his head and was having phenomenal success doing stand-up.
"I remember going into my sister's room and seeing "Let's Get Small" and listening to it, and I just laughed," Bliss says of Martin's 1977 platinum-selling, Grammy-winning comedy album. "I have been a fan since day one."
The idea that decades later, Martin would become a fan of Bliss, the two would work as collaborators and even be dubbed "2 wild and crazy guys" in a New York Times headline is something that not even Bliss, a wildly imaginative guy, could have envisioned.
"It's bizarre," he says.
From Nyack to 'The New Yorker'
In the late 1990s, as a single dad living in a basement apartment in Nyack, and trying to make ends meet as a waiter and book-cover artist, Bliss sent a handful of cartoons to The New Yorker. That led to him being invited to try illustrating a cover for the magazine and, based on that work, he was hired. His first cover – a drawing of man and a woman walking up a staircase, leaving behind a trail of New Year's Eve party debris – published on Jan. 5, 1998.
To date, Bliss has done 22 New Yorker covers and hundreds of New Yorker cartoons. He also has illustrated more than 20 books, including a children's book he also wrote, "Bailey, "about a dog that goes to school and charms his human classmates. His single-panel cartoon, Bliss, runs six days a week in more than 50 newspapers in the United States and Japan.
His initial professional breakthrough and the success that's followed hasn't solely resulted from talent, he says.
"I knew that my work was good enough," he says. "I didn't have any apprehension about that. But persistence is an integral piece of this. If you are not savvy about people and not good at being persistent in a non-annoying way, you're gonna have a hard time."
"A Wealth of Pigeons" has exposed him to an even larger, more mainstream audience – the kind delivered not only by a bestselling book, but by appearances on shows like CBS Sunday Morning, Good Morning America and The View.
Bliss doesn't mind doing publicity for the project, despite preferring the solitude of rural New Hampshire, where he notes his Zoom connection isn't all that strong. But it's the work itself that drives him. And it is informed, to a large extent, by those early experiences growing up in Henrietta, New York.
Meeting Martin
Bliss' drawing style may be whimsical and sweet, but the content of his work can tend toward the dark side. That's why it's been nice to team with Martin, he says. "He pulls me back from that a little bit."
The two were introduced by Francoise Mouly, art and cover editor for The New Yorker. A couple years ago over cocktails, Martin, having conquered every other form of entertainment, told her he had some ideas for single-panel cartoons and asked whether she could recommend an artist. Right away she suggested Bliss.
Martin's response was, "I love him."
Bliss had no idea that Martin – also a serious art collector – was aware of his work, much less an admirer, but "Francoise knows I like to collaborate. You have certain cartoonists who are purists and only want to do their own ideas," Bliss says. "I don't have that."
Once Martin and Bliss connected, they agreed they wouldn't want their project to be sardonic or cynical. "There's just way too much of that in the world right now," Bliss says.
Instead, the humor in "A Wealth of Pigeons" is sophisticated and sly but light and nonpolitical.
In one panel, Santa Claus sits atop a chimney, looks off into the distance and, with a cellphone to his ear, says, "I'm here. Flash your nose." Another panel shows a group of people introducing themselves above a caption that reads, "This is our son, Charley. He's a souvenir from Woodstock." In a third, a dog sleeping in its bed dreams of itself sleeping in its bed below the headline, "Never give up on your dreams."
Martin and Bliss did the majority of the work from a distance, via email or phone. In the book's introduction, Martin jokes that Bliss is the perfect creative partner because, "We rarely speak to each other, and we live in different states."
In reality, the process involved continual back and forth and give and take. "We'd workshop things," Bliss says. Sometimes Martin would send Bliss a concept or a caption in need of an illustration. Sometimes Bliss would send Martin "orphan cartoons" in search of punchlines.
Overall, Bliss deferred to Martin on the writing.
"Steve is an expert at humor and mirth and writing," Bliss says. "He's the consummate entertainer. To be on Johnny Carson 70 times – that's just unbelievable to me. ... But the thing I like about Steve is that recently he said, 'I'm the writer. But Harry is the director and the casting agent and the lighting guy. He's all these other things.' So Steve writes the gags and hands them off to me, and I still direct (the panel) and flesh it out. Super fun."
Up next
As for their forthcoming project, "The only thing I can say is that it will have more comic strips in it, more narrative in it – strips that are two and three pages long, and my dog's in a lot of them," Bliss says.
And once again, he and Martin will collaborate from across the miles, with Martin likely working from New York City and Bliss based in Cornish. He's good with that.
"There is an energy here that I can't explain to you," he says. One recent night around 11 o'clock, he finished a sketch and stepped outside. "The full moon above the house lit the entire landscape. It's like I was standing in a Maxfield Parrish painting. It was incredible. That sort of environment for me, it fuels my creativity and gives me hope. It's what I need. It's the thing that keeps me going."

"Now that I'm gone, don't smoke, whatever you do, just don't smoke."
As the United States faces out-of-control spikes from COVID-19, with people refusing to take recommended, often even mandated, precautions, our public health announcements from governments, medical groups and health care companies feel lame compared with the urgency of the moment. A mix of clever catchphrases, scientific information and calls to civic duty, they are virtuous and profoundly dull.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urges people to wear masks in videos that feature scientists and doctors talking about wanting to send kids safely to school or protecting freedom.
Quest Diagnostics made a video featuring people washing their hands, talking on the phone, playing checkers. The message: "Come together by spending time apart."
As cases were mounting in September, the Michigan government produced videos with the exhortation, "Spread Hope, Not Covid," urging Michiganders to put on a mask "for your community and country."
Forget that. Mister Rogers nice isn't working. It's time to make people scared and uncomfortable. It's time for some sharp, focused, terrifying realism.
"Fear appeals can be very effective," said Jay Van Bavel, associate professor of psychology at New York University, who co-authored a paper in Nature about how social science could support COVID response efforts. (They may not be needed as much in places like New York, he noted, where people experienced the constant sirens and the makeshift hospitals.)
I'm not talking fear-mongering, but showing in a straightforward and graphic way what can happen with the virus.
From what I could find, the State of California came close to showing the urgency: a soft-focus video of a person on a ventilator, featuring the sound of a breathing machine, but not a face. It exhorted people to wear a mask for their friends, moms and grandpas.
But maybe we need a PSA featuring someone actually on a ventilator in the hospital. You might see that person "bucking the vent" – bodies naturally rebel against the machine forcing pressurized oxygen into the lungs, which is why patients are typically sedated.
(Because I had witnessed this suffering as a practicing doctor, I was always upfront about the trauma with loved ones of terminally ill patients when they were trying to decide whether to consent to a relative being put on a ventilator. It sounds as easy as hooking someone to an IV. It's not.)
Another message could feature a patient lying in an ICU bed, immobile, tubes in the groin, with a mask delivering 100% oxygen over the mouth and nose – eyes wide with fear, watching the saturation numbers rise and dip on the monitor over the bed.
Maybe some PSAs should feature a so-called COVID long hauler, the 5% to 10% of people for whom recovery takes months. Perhaps a professional athlete like the National Football League's Ryquell Armstead, 24, who has been in and out of the hospital with serious lung issues and missed the season.
These PSAs might sound harsh, but they might overcome our natural denial. "One consistent research finding is that even when people see and understand risks, they underestimate the risks to themselves," Van Bavel said.
Graphs, statistics and reasonable explanations don't do it.
They haven't done it.
Only after Chris Christie, an adviser to President Donald Trump, experienced COVID, did he start preaching about mask-wearing:
"When you have seven days in isolation in an ICU, though, you have time to do a lot of thinking," Christie said, suggesting that people, "follow CDC guidelines in public no matter where you are and wear a mask to protect yourself and others."
We hear from many who resist taking precautions. They say, "I know someone who had it and it's not so bad." Or, "It's just like the flu."
Sure, most longtime smokers don't end up with lung cancer – or tethered to an oxygen tank – either. (That, in fact, was the justification of smokers like my father, whose two-pack-a-day habit contributed to his death at 47 of a heart attack.)
These new ads will seem hard to watch. "We live in a Pixar era," Van Bavel reflected, with traditional fairy tales now stripped of their gore and violence.
But studies have shown that emotional ads featuring personal stories about the effects of smoking were the most effective at persuading folks to quit. And quitting smoking is much harder than maintaining physical distance and mask-wearing.
Once a vaccine has proved successful and enough people are vaccinated, the pandemic may well be in the rearview mirror. In the meantime, the creators of public health messaging should stop favoring the cute, warm and dull. And – at least sometimes – scare you.

Texto completo: Jaws dropped Thursday at St. Elizabeth Healthcare when leaders saw the Fort Thomas hospital listed in the New York Times as one of the busiest COVID-19 care centers in the nation.
St. Elizabeth's main COVID-19 facility, its Fort Thomas hospital, has been busy, the leaders said, but not as busy as that, and they went on the hunt for the mistake.
"When we're living and breathing these numbers by the hour, you know that there was an error there," said Vera Hall, St. Elizabeth's chief nursing executive. "When you hit the New York Times, you stop and drop everything."
Hall and other St. Elizabeth officials pinned the problem on the Kentucky Hospital Association, but a KHA official said the culprit was a coding bug in the computers of the Kentucky Department of Public Health. That agency is compiling bed capacity data across the commonwealth and reporting it to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
Hall said the mistake was not St. Elizabeth's but "a double counting" at the KHA that added the total number of COVID-19 patients at Fort Thomas than the average for the week of Nov. 27 – 145 – and the number of the facility's negative-pressure rooms, which was 100, and came up with 224.
That's the number released Monday when the federal government initially made its bed capacity data public. The Times then analyzed the data to create lists of the nation's most overtaxed intensive-care units that were published Thursday. Fort Thomas came in fourth among larger-population centers, which came as a surprise to Hall and other Fort Thomas officials.
"I know that data is kind of a hot spot, how accurate is the data?" Hall said. "We don't want to further continue the suspicion that the numbers are inflated. But even so, 145 patients – that's a lot of patients."
At the KHA, Melanie Moch, vice president of of data and health information services, said the source of the problem was not at the KHA, although she understood how the St. Elizabeth officials would think so. The trade association has been working with the state health department to push hospitals to report their bed capacity daily.
"I'm on all the Zoom calls with them, so I can see how they would think it's us," Moch said, but the KHA is not handling the data. The association discovered that earlier this week, St. Elizabeth updated their number, which triggered a coding bug to double-count the Fort Thomas census.
Moch said the health department and the Kentucky Department of Emergency Management went through the coding Thursday and the problem shouldn't happen again.
In August, the Trump administration directed hospitals to stop sending the information to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and instead send it to HHS.
Dr. James Horn, St. Elizabeth's chief quality officer and an emergency doctors, said more patients are seeking care now than on Nov. 27. As of Thursday, the system had 170 patients with COVID-19, and some are getting treated at St. Elizabeth Florence.

US leaves more than Afghan bases Land disputes are also casualties of the American-led war

Texto completo: At harvest time, as neighbors and relatives reap their crops, 80-year-old Jamal Khan can only look in despair on the plot of land that was the source of his family's livelihood - until the American forces arrived over a decade ago.
Just before sunset one day, armored vehicles drove into fields of knee-high corn stalks, claimed about 30 acres that were co-owned by about as many families and quickly cordoned off the area with barbed wire. This was now Combat Outpost Honaker-Miracle, one of the roughly 1,000 military installations the United States and its coalition partners would prop up across Afghanistan.
"In the whole vastness of the lord's world, I had this plot of land and this house that I am living in and nothing else," said Khan, who lives the Watapur District of Kunar province, in eastern Afghanistan. "We told them this is our private land, how do you suddenly put up here? They said nothing."
Khan is one of countless Afghans whose land became a casualty of the U.S.-led war and the sprawling military infrastructure born from it. They have been forced to navigate a maze of Afghan and American bureaucracy and indifference, stoking a growing bitterness toward coalition forces and the Afghan government alike.
Despite the drawdown of American forces in Afghanistan from more than 100,000 in 2011 to fewer than 5,000, some of the property they occupied has not been returned. Instead, the bases and the land have been transferred to Afghan security forces.
The Americans have left Watapur but Khan does not have his land back, and similar conflicts linger across the country. In at least half a dozen of Afghanistan's 34 provinces, The New York Times has found land disputes involving owners who said they had simply been shut out.
In a country where due process is nearly impossible in the face of corruption and state erosion, the U.S. presence has added to a long history of land disputes that have often served as an underlying cause of local conflicts.
The Taliban touts the swift resolution of disputes in its shadow courts as a strength, and the unresolved discord over land bolsters the insurgents' message that not only are Afghans deprived of justice under the American- backed government, but that the U.S. military presence has added to the injustice.
Khan still carries a pile of documents: petitions to the government, and even confirmation letters from the U.S. Army that say he is the rightful owner. On several occasions, he says, delegations from Kabul came to investigate - and they asked the villagers for money to cover their expenses during the stay.
But the most painful reminder of the trespass is his collection of small receipts. Although the Afghan army now occupies his land, Khan is still required to pay tax on the plot.
Over the years of fighting, the size of the U.S.-constructed installations varied greatly. Some bases were sprawling, even housing their own fast-food chain restaurants. In other cases, coalition forces would briefly occupy empty Afghan homes, destroying or modifying walls for defensive purposes before leaving.
Today, most installations are controlled by Afghan security forces; the few U.S. bases that remain are shuttering now as part of the U.S. deal with the Taliban.
In northern Balkh province, the U.S.-led coalition forces built a base next to the provincial capital's airport. Amanullah Balkhi, a local business owner, says the installation occupied about 20 acres of his land.
The defense ministry said it was government land, Balkhi was told, but if he proved he owned it, the coalition would compensate him and pay rent. He says he fought a six-year legal battle that cost him about $2 million, which he covered by selling two of his apartment buildings, renting out more land and taking on $500,000 of debt.
"I have the deed, and the government and the courts have attested that this is my land," he said. "But the Americans still have the land and they still deny me."
Balkhi has become deeply depressed, he said, adding, "I have ruined my life to get my right, but I have gotten nothing."
The story of a base in Panjwai, in southern Kandahar province, is almost identical - and speaks to the troubling legacy the United States has left behind.
About 10 years ago, dozens of coalition vehicles arrived at the small village and eyed about 10 acres of vineyard owned by half a dozen villagers. They even tasted the grapes before getting to work building a new base.
"They didn't carve a road where there was a trek, where we came and went - they carved a road for themselves through people's lands, people's gardens," said Fida Muhammad, a tribal elder from Panjwai and one of the vineyard's owners.
In the initial days, there was word that the coalition forces were offering compensation, but the area was so restive that approaching the base for money meant taking potentially lethal risks. Villagers feared the Americans would mistake them for the Taliban. And they knew that if they did manage to get their money, the Taliban, who were everywhere, would know and come after them for profiting from the occupiers.
The area was so lush that "you had to squint your eyes to find a dry patch," said Rashid Gul, a village resident. But these days it's desolate except for one small patch of vineyard.
"It ruined the irrigation system too - for five years, the irrigation canals were ruined, the land dried," Muhammad said of the coalition base. "Many families left the area. They went to the city for daily labor."
As one of the village elders, Muhammad took the lead in trying to get compensation and reclaim the land, to no avail. When the Americans ran the base, he said, the villagers' claim was simply lost in bureaucracy; come tomorrow, come the next day, he was told repeatedly.
"We have lost hope of finding someone who can get us our right," said Muhammad, who said he had made about 30 trips with petitions. "It's just tiring ourselves, losing more money, but we can't find a door to knock on for justice."
When a base was transferred to Afghan control, the forces stationed there were often too preoccupied with defending it against Taliban attacks to pay much attention to land claims. Many of the Afghan commanders who rotated through simply did not care about the local residents' grievances, which they saw as an issue between the farmers and the Americans.
Gul worried that even if one day the plot of land in Panjwai were returned, figuring out which piece belonged to whom could spark new disagreements.
Land disputes have been one of the main issues of conflict in the village, he said. Recently, Muhammad had to quell a feud because one farmer's tractor had crossed into another man's land.
"All this land is mixed up now," Gul said.
Resolving those conflicts would require digging through government archives, hoping to find old property demarcation records.
Asked how long that would take, he offered a tired smile.
"This is Afghanistan," he said.

Texto completo: "When you have seven days in isolation in an ICU, though, you have time to do a lot of thinking, follow CDC guidelines in public no matter where you are and wear a mask to protect yourself and others."
Chris Christie
Former NJ governor and adviser to President Trump
I still remember exactly where I was sitting decades ago, during the short film shown in class: For a few painful minutes, we watched a woman talking mechanically, raspily through a hole in her throat, pausing occasionally to gasp for air.
The public service message: This is what can happen if you smoke.
I had nightmares about that ad, which today would most likely be tagged with a trigger warning or deemed unsuitable for children. But it was supremely effective: I never started smoking and doubt that few if any of my horrified classmates did, either.
When the government required television and radio stations to give $75 million in free airtime for antismoking ads between 1967 and 1970 – many of them terrifyingly graphic – smoking rates plummeted. Since then, numerous smoking "scare" campaigns have proved successful. Some even featured celebrities, like Yul Brynner's posthumous offering with a warning after he died from lung cancer:
"Now that I'm gone, don't smoke, whatever you do, just don't smoke."
As the United States faces out-of-control spikes from COVID-19, with people refusing to take recommended, often even mandated, precautions, our public health announcements from governments, medical groups and health care companies feel lame compared with the urgency of the moment. A mix of clever catchphrases, scientific information and calls to civic duty, they are virtuous and profoundly dull.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urges people to wear masks in videos that feature scientists and doctors talking about wanting to send kids safely to school or protecting freedom.
Quest Diagnostics made a video featuring people washing their hands, talking on the phone, playing checkers. The message: "Come together by spending time apart."
As cases were mounting in September, the Michigan government produced videos with the exhortation, "Spread Hope, Not Covid," urging Michiganders to put on a mask "for your community and country."
Forget that. Mister Rogers nice isn't working. It's time to make people scared and uncomfortable. It's time for some sharp, focused, terrifying realism.
"Fear appeals can be very effective," said Jay Van Bavel, associate professor of psychology at New York University, who co-authored a paper in Nature about how social science could support COVID response efforts. (They may not be needed as much in places like New York, he noted, where people experienced the constant sirens and the makeshift hospitals.)
I'm not talking fear-mongering, but showing in a straightforward and graphic way what can happen with the virus.
From what I could find, the State of California came close to showing the urgency: a soft-focus video of a person on a ventilator, featuring the sound of a breathing machine, but not a face. It exhorted people to wear a mask for their friends, moms and grandpas.
But maybe we need a PSA featuring someone actually on a ventilator in the hospital. You might see that person "bucking the vent" – bodies naturally rebel against the machine forcing pressurized oxygen into the lungs, which is why patients are typically sedated.
(Because I had witnessed this suffering as a practicing doctor, I was always upfront about the trauma with loved ones of terminally ill patients when they were trying to decide whether to consent to a relative being put on a ventilator. It sounds as easy as hooking someone to an IV. It's not.)
Another message could feature a patient lying in an ICU bed, immobile, tubes in the groin, with a mask delivering 100% oxygen over the mouth and nose – eyes wide with fear, watching the saturation numbers rise and dip on the monitor over the bed.
Maybe some PSAs should feature a so-called COVID long hauler, the 5% to 10% of people for whom recovery takes months. Perhaps a professional athlete like the National Football League's Ryquell Armstead, 24, who has been in and out of the hospital with serious lung issues and missed the season.
These PSAs might sound harsh, but they might overcome our natural denial. "One consistent research finding is that even when people see and understand risks, they underestimate the risks to themselves," Van Bavel said.
Graphs, statistics and reasonable explanations don't do it.
They haven't done it.
Only after Chris Christie, an adviser to President Donald Trump, experienced COVID, did he start preaching about mask-wearing:
"When you have seven days in isolation in an ICU, though, you have time to do a lot of thinking," Christie said, suggesting that people, "follow CDC guidelines in public no matter where you are and wear a mask to protect yourself and others."
We hear from many who resist taking precautions. They say, "I know someone who had it and it's not so bad." Or, "It's just like the flu."
Sure, most longtime smokers don't end up with lung cancer – or tethered to an oxygen tank – either. (That, in fact, was the justification of smokers like my father, whose two-pack-a-day habit contributed to his death at 47 of a heart attack.)
These new ads will seem hard to watch. "We live in a Pixar era," Van Bavel reflected, with traditional fairy tales now stripped of their gore and violence.
But studies have shown that emotional ads featuring personal stories about the effects of smoking were the most effective at persuading folks to quit. And quitting smoking is much harder than maintaining physical distance and mask-wearing.
Once a vaccine has proved successful and enough people are vaccinated, the pandemic may well be in the rearview mirror. In the meantime, the creators of public health messaging should stop favoring the cute, warm and dull. And – at least sometimes – scare you.

Texto completo: At harvest time, as neighbors and relatives reap their crops, 80-year-old Jamal Khan can only look in despair on the plot of land that was the source of his family's livelihood - until the American forces arrived over a decade ago.
Just before sunset one day, armored vehicles drove into fields of knee-high corn stalks, claimed about 30 acres that were co-owned by about as many families and quickly cordoned off the area with barbed wire. This was now Combat Outpost Honaker-Miracle, one of the roughly 1,000 military installations the United States and its coalition partners would prop up across Afghanistan.
"In the whole vastness of the lord's world, I had this plot of land and this house that I am living in and nothing else," said Khan, who lives the Watapur District of Kunar province, in eastern Afghanistan. "We told them this is our private land, how do you suddenly put up here? They said nothing."
Khan is one of countless Afghans whose land became a casualty of the U.S.-led war and the sprawling military infrastructure born from it. They have been forced to navigate a maze of Afghan and American bureaucracy and indifference, stoking a growing bitterness toward coalition forces and the Afghan government alike.
Despite the drawdown of American forces in Afghanistan from more than 100,000 in 2011 to fewer than 5,000, some of the property they occupied has not been returned. Instead, the bases and the land have been transferred to Afghan security forces.
The Americans have left Watapur but Khan does not have his land back, and similar conflicts linger across the country. In at least half a dozen of Afghanistan's 34 provinces, The New York Times has found land disputes involving owners who said they had simply been shut out.
In a country where due process is nearly impossible in the face of corruption and state erosion, the U.S. presence has added to a long history of land disputes that have often served as an underlying cause of local conflicts.
The Taliban touts the swift resolution of disputes in its shadow courts as a strength, and the unresolved discord over land bolsters the insurgents' message that not only are Afghans deprived of justice under the American- backed government, but that the U.S. military presence has added to the injustice.
Khan still carries a pile of documents: petitions to the government, and even confirmation letters from the U.S. Army that say he is the rightful owner. On several occasions, he says, delegations from Kabul came to investigate - and they asked the villagers for money to cover their expenses during the stay.
But the most painful reminder of the trespass is his collection of small receipts. Although the Afghan army now occupies his land, Khan is still required to pay tax on the plot.
Over the years of fighting, the size of the U.S.-constructed installations varied greatly. Some bases were sprawling, even housing their own fast-food chain restaurants. In other cases, coalition forces would briefly occupy empty Afghan homes, destroying or modifying walls for defensive purposes before leaving.
Today, most installations are controlled by Afghan security forces; the few U.S. bases that remain are shuttering now as part of the U.S. deal with the Taliban.
In northern Balkh province, the U.S.-led coalition forces built a base next to the provincial capital's airport. Amanullah Balkhi, a local business owner, says the installation occupied about 20 acres of his land.
The defense ministry said it was government land, Balkhi was told, but if he proved he owned it, the coalition would compensate him and pay rent. He says he fought a six-year legal battle that cost him about $2 million, which he covered by selling two of his apartment buildings, renting out more land and taking on $500,000 of debt.
"I have the deed, and the government and the courts have attested that this is my land," he said. "But the Americans still have the land and they still deny me."

Texto completo: It's a little before 10 a.m. on a Monday, and Harry Bliss has just wrapped up a call at his Cornish, New Hampshire, retreat
"I was on the phone with Steve," he says. "We were talking about the next book we're doing."
Steve being Steve Martin. The actor, comedian, writer, producer and musician.
The next book being a follow-up to their first, the newly released New York Times and Amazon bestseller "A Wealth of Pigeons," a collection of more than 120 single-panel cartoons (and a dozen or so multi-panel works) written by Martin and drawn by Bliss, who gets top billing on the cover.
The retreat being J.D. Salinger's old place, where the reclusive novelist moved two years after publishing "The Catcher in the Rye." Bliss bought the rustic property four years ago and splits his time between it and a residence he shares with his wife in Burlington, Vermont.
Not bad for a kid from upstate New York, who was around 13 when he first became aware of Martin, then a wild and crazy guy who wore a fake arrow through his head and was having phenomenal success doing stand-up.
"I remember going into my sister's room and seeing "Let's Get Small" and listening to it, and I just laughed," Bliss says of Martin's 1977 platinum-selling, Grammy-winning comedy album. "I have been a fan since day one."
The idea that decades later, Martin would become a fan of Bliss, the two would work as collaborators and even be dubbed "2 wild and crazy guys" in a New York Times headline is something that not even Bliss, a wildly imaginative guy, could have envisioned.
"It's bizarre," he says.
From Nyack to 'The New Yorker'
In the late 1990s, as a single dad living in a basement apartment in Nyack, and trying to make ends meet as a waiter and book-cover artist, Bliss sent a handful of cartoons to The New Yorker. That led to him being invited to try illustrating a cover for the magazine and, based on that work, he was hired. His first cover – a drawing of man and a woman walking up a staircase, leaving behind a trail of New Year's Eve party debris – published on Jan. 5, 1998.
To date, Bliss has done 22 New Yorker covers and hundreds of New Yorker cartoons. He also has illustrated more than 20 books, including a children's book he also wrote, "Bailey, "about a dog that goes to school and charms his human classmates. His single-panel cartoon, Bliss, runs six days a week in more than 50 newspapers in the United States and Japan.
His initial professional breakthrough and the success that's followed hasn't solely resulted from talent, he says.
"I knew that my work was good enough," he says. "I didn't have any apprehension about that. But persistence is an integral piece of this. If you are not savvy about people and not good at being persistent in a non-annoying way, you're gonna have a hard time."
"A Wealth of Pigeons" has exposed him to an even larger, more mainstream audience – the kind delivered not only by a bestselling book, but by appearances on shows like CBS Sunday Morning, Good Morning America and The View.
Bliss doesn't mind doing publicity for the project, despite preferring the solitude of rural New Hampshire, where he notes his Zoom connection isn't all that strong. But it's the work itself that drives him. And it is informed, to a large extent, by those early experiences growing up in Henrietta, New York.
Meeting Martin
Bliss' drawing style may be whimsical and sweet, but the content of his work can tend toward the dark side. That's why it's been nice to team with Martin, he says. "He pulls me back from that a little bit."
The two were introduced by Francoise Mouly, art and cover editor for The New Yorker. A couple years ago over cocktails, Martin, having conquered every other form of entertainment, told her he had some ideas for single-panel cartoons and asked whether she could recommend an artist. Right away she suggested Bliss.
Martin's response was, "I love him."
Bliss had no idea that Martin – also a serious art collector – was aware of his work, much less an admirer, but "Francoise knows I like to collaborate. You have certain cartoonists who are purists and only want to do their own ideas," Bliss says. "I don't have that."
Once Martin and Bliss connected, they agreed they wouldn't want their project to be sardonic or cynical. "There's just way too much of that in the world right now," Bliss says.
Instead, the humor in "A Wealth of Pigeons" is sophisticated and sly but light and nonpolitical.
In one panel, Santa Claus sits atop a chimney, looks off into the distance and, with a cellphone to his ear, says, "I'm here. Flash your nose." Another panel shows a group of people introducing themselves above a caption that reads, "This is our son, Charley. He's a souvenir from Woodstock." In a third, a dog sleeping in its bed dreams of itself sleeping in its bed below the headline, "Never give up on your dreams."
Martin and Bliss did the majority of the work from a distance, via email or phone. In the book's introduction, Martin jokes that Bliss is the perfect creative partner because, "We rarely speak to each other, and we live in different states."
In reality, the process involved continual back and forth and give and take. "We'd workshop things," Bliss says. Sometimes Martin would send Bliss a concept or a caption in need of an illustration. Sometimes Bliss would send Martin "orphan cartoons" in search of punchlines.
Overall, Bliss deferred to Martin on the writing.
"Steve is an expert at humor and mirth and writing," Bliss says. "He's the consummate entertainer. To be on Johnny Carson 70 times – that's just unbelievable to me. ... But the thing I like about Steve is that recently he said, 'I'm the writer. But Harry is the director and the casting agent and the lighting guy. He's all these other things.' So Steve writes the gags and hands them off to me, and I still direct (the panel) and flesh it out. Super fun."
Up next
As for their forthcoming project, "The only thing I can say is that it will have more comic strips in it, more narrative in it – strips that are two and three pages long, and my dog's in a lot of them," Bliss says.
And once again, he and Martin will collaborate from across the miles, with Martin likely working from New York City and Bliss based in Cornish. He's good with that.
"There is an energy here that I can't explain to you," he says. One recent night around 11 o'clock, he finished a sketch and stepped outside. "The full moon above the house lit the entire landscape. It's like I was standing in a Maxfield Parrish painting. It was incredible. That sort of environment for me, it fuels my creativity and gives me hope. It's what I need. It's the thing that keeps me going."

Texto completo: It's a little before 10 a.m. on a Monday, and Harry Bliss has just wrapped up a call at his Cornish, New Hampshire, retreat.
"I was on the phone with Steve," he says. "We were talking about the next book we're doing."
Steve being Steve Martin. The actor, comedian, writer, producer and musician.
The next book being a follow-up to their first, the newly released New York Times and Amazon bestseller A Wealth of Pigeons, a collection of more than 120 single-panel cartoons (and a dozen or so multi-panel works) written by Martin and drawn by Bliss, who gets top billing on the cover.
The retreat being J.D. Salinger's old place, where the reclusive novelist moved two years after publishing The Catcher in the Rye. Bliss bought the rustic property four years ago and splits his time between it and a residence he shares with his wife in Burlington, Vermont.
Not bad for a kid from Henrietta, who was around 13 when he first became aware of Martin, then a wild and crazy guy who wore a fake arrow through his head and was having phenomenal success doing stand-up.
"I remember going into my sister's room and seeing Let's Get Small and listening to it, and I just laughed," Bliss says of Martin's 1977 platinum-selling, Grammy-winning comedy album. "I have been a fan since day one."
The idea that decades later, Martin would become a fan of Bliss, the two would work as collaborators and even be dubbed "2 wild and crazy guys" in a New York Times headline is something that not even Bliss, a wildly imaginative guy, could have envisioned.
"It's bizarre," he says.
Back in the day
The youngest of four children born to Jack and Roslyn Bliss, Harry Bliss graduated in 1982 from what was then called James E. Sperry High School (now Rush-Henrietta) after completing his freshman year at McQuaid Jesuit in Brighton.
He has mostly fond memories of his Sperry experience, where a couple of empathetic art teachers stood out and he spent time paging through art books in the library. However, "I wouldn't say I learned a heck of a lot," says the 56-year-old, who mostly relished the role of class clown and made regular appearances in the principal's office. "In public school in 1970s, you didn't learn or retain a lot, and I believe that's not such a bad thing. Our education was in some respects a life education — how to get out of situations that are possibly detrimental to your well-being or future, how to navigate the social landscape. That in itself is a very important education."
So was being brought up in an immediate and extended family of artists. Bliss' oldest brother, John, a longtime educator who has taught art and now works as a kindergarten teacher in the Rochester City School District, explains, "My cousins Jim and Phil were incredible (artists) for their age. My brother Charlie was remarkable, my sister, father, mother and uncles were all artists."
Because of that, and the fact that they're six years apart, John says Harry's artistic abilities were a little lost on him during their early years.
"His humor was not. He and Charlie have been funny since birth," John says.
He remembers Harry starring in a Bliss family movie production of Frankenstein. Their dad had Harry stand on a block to make him appear taller. At one point, he fell off the block and went from looking 6 feet tall to less than 5 feet tall. "It was hysterical because he just kept acting," John says.
Setting a course
But Harry was serious about being an artist, and following high school he studied painting at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts and illustration at University of the Arts, both in Philadelphia. He earned a bachelor of fine arts degree in 1990 after temporarily pausing his education. "I spent a few years discovering girls," he says. In 1994, he got a master of fine arts in illustration from Syracuse University.
In the late 1990s, as a single dad living in a basement apartment in Nyack, Rockland County, and trying to make ends meet as a waiter and book-cover artist, he sent a handful of cartoons to The New Yorker. That led to him being invited to try illustrating a cover for the magazine and, based on that work, he was hired. His first cover — a drawing of man and a woman walking up a staircase, leaving behind a trail of New Year's Eve party debris — published on Jan. 5, 1998.
To date, Bliss has done 22 New Yorker covers and hundreds of New Yorker cartoons. He also has illustrated more than 20 books, including a children's book he also wrote, Bailey, about a dog that goes to school and charms his human classmates. His single-panel cartoon, Bliss, runs six days a week in more than 50 newspapers in the United States and Japan.
His initial professional breakthrough and the success that's followed hasn't solely resulted from talent, he says.
"I knew that my work was good enough," he says. "I didn't have any apprehension about that. But persistence is an integral piece of this. If you are not savvy about people and not good at being persistent in a non-annoying way, you're gonna have a hard time."
Brother John agrees.
"Harry can obviously draw and paint," he says. "Lots of people can draw really well, and many of them may be smart, but they may not have the drive or personality to get through to people face to face. Harry sells because he broke through and created, like, a brand. That requires artistic talent but also interpersonal skills."
A Wealth of Pigeons has exposed him to an even larger, more mainstream audience — the kind delivered not only by a bestselling book, but by appearances on shows like CBS Sunday Morning, Good Morning America and The View.
Bliss doesn't mind doing publicity for the project, despite preferring the solitude of rural Cornish, where he notes his Zoom connection isn't all that strong. But it's the work itself that drives him. And it is informed, to a large extent, by those early experiences in Henrietta.
'You will use everything'
He relays a story that Martin told him about being on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson. During a commercial break, the legendary late-night talk-show host leaned over and told Martin that, as a comedian, "You will use everything you've ever known."
That has been true for Bliss, too.
"Any experience you have in your life," including, he says, "all the things I digested in Henrietta ... it's gonna find its way into your work, if you're open like that. That's really key, because there are people out there who for whatever reason don't have the capacity to open all those doors and let all that stuff in."
Bliss does, including stuff that a lot of people would just as soon keep packed away. Like the memory of a stammering schoolmate's struggle to speak in class or childhood friends grappling with their parents' messy divorces, or this: "I remember road trips," he says. "We used to go to Cape Cod. It was me and my siblings driving in the wagon with my mom and dad. And the Doors' 'Riders on the Storm' was on the radio all the time back then, and when that song would come on — I was 6 or 7 years old — it just scared the shit out of me, and I recently did a cartoon based on that."
Bliss' drawing style may be whimsical and sweet, but the content of his work can tend toward the dark side. That's why it's been nice to team with Martin, he says. "He pulls me back from that a little bit."
The two were introduced by Francoise Mouly, art and cover editor for The New Yorker. A couple years ago over cocktails, Martin, having conquered every other form of entertainment, told her he had some ideas for single-panel cartoons and asked whether she could recommend an artist to draw them. Right away she suggested Bliss.
Martin's response was, "I love him."
Bliss had no idea that Martin — also a serious art collector — was aware of his work, much less an admirer, but "Francoise knows I like to collaborate. You have certain cartoonists who are purists and only want to do their own ideas," Bliss says. "I don't have that."
Once Martin and Bliss connected, they agreed they wouldn't want their project to be sardonic or cynical. "There's just way too much of that in the world right now," Bliss says.
Instead, the humor in A Wealth of Pigeons is sophisticated and sly but light and nonpolitical.
In one panel, Santa Claus sits atop a chimney, looks off into the distance and, with a cellphone to his ear, says, "I'm here. Flash your nose." Another panel shows a group of people introducing themselves above a caption that reads, "This is our son, Charley. He's a souvenir from Woodstock." In a third, a dog sleeping in its bed dreams of itself sleeping in its bed below the headline, "Never give up on your dreams."
Martin and Bliss did the majority of the work from a distance, via email or phone. In the book's introduction, Martin jokes that Bliss is the perfect creative partner because, "We rarely speak to each other, and we live in different states."
In reality, the process involved continual back and forth and give and take. "We'd workshop things," Bliss says. Sometimes Martin would send Bliss a concept or a caption in need of an illustration. Sometimes Bliss would send Martin "orphan cartoons" in search of punchlines.
Overall, Bliss deferred to Martin on the writing.
"Steve is an expert at humor and mirth and writing," Bliss says. "He's the consummate entertainer. To be on Johnny Carson 70 times — that's just unbelievable to me. ... But the thing I like about Steve is that recently he said, 'I'm the writer. But Harry is the director and the casting agent and the lighting guy. He's all these other things.' So Steve writes the gags and hands them off to me, and I still direct (the panel) and flesh it out. Super fun."
Up next
As for their forthcoming project, "The only thing I can say is that it will have more comic strips in it, more narrative in it — strips that are two and three pages long, and my dog's in a lot of them," Bliss says.
And once again, he and Martin will collaborate from across the miles, with Martin likely working from New York City and Bliss based in Cornish. He's good with that.
"There is an energy here that I can't explain to you," he says. One recent night around 11 o'clock, he finished a sketch and stepped outside. "The full moon above the house lit the entire landscape. It's like I was standing in a Maxfield Parrish painting. It was incredible. That sort of environment for me, it fuels my creativity and gives me hope. It's what I need. It's the thing that keeps me going."

Texto completo: In a world where life changed seemingly overnight, photographers transformed how they worked, trading intimacy for distance. This is what they captured.
By Dean Baquet, executive editor
Certain years are so eventful they are regarded as pivotal in history, years when wars and slavery ended and deep generational fissures burst into the open -- 1865, 1945 and 1968 among them. The year 2020 will certainly join this list. It will long be remembered and studied as a time when more than 1.5 million people globally died during a pandemic, racial unrest gripped the world, and democracy itself faced extraordinary tests.
The photographs in this collection capture those historic 12 months. Jeffrey Henson Scales, who edited The Year in Pictures with David Furst, said he had never felt such sweep and emotion from a single year's images -- from the "joy and optimism" of a New Year's Eve kiss in Times Square, to angry crowds on the streets of Hong Kong and in American cities, to scenes of painful debates over race and policing, to the "seemingly countless graves and coffins across the globe."
The impeachment of an American president culminated in early 2020. But two pictures taken in late January in Wuhan, China, are hints of a larger cataclysm to come. In one aerial shot, construction workers are building a giant hospital virtually overnight to handle hundreds of patients stricken with the coronavirus. The other looks like a still from a sci-fi film: A man dressed in black, wearing a white mask, lies dead on a city street; two emergency workers have stepped away from him and gaze at the viewer -- all but their eyes hidden by face coverings and ghostly white protective suits.
Then the virus swept the world, recorded in indelible images. The scenes of people comforting beloved family members through glass and cellphones are heartbreaking. Some of the most haunting images are of emptiness. Still cities. Vacant streets of London and the Place de la Concorde. A desolate Munich subway station. Among the most disturbing is a photo of a refrigerated trailer set up as a makeshift morgue in Greenwich Village.
Punctuating these scenes are photographs of a tumultuous American election that even without the ravages of the virus would end up looming large in history books. As the year progresses, fueled by police shootings of young Black men, powerfully symbolic pictures of protests begin appearing. In May, a lone demonstrator carries an upside-down American flag past a burning liquor store in Minneapolis, in protest of the killing of George Floyd.
In 2020, a year when all aspects of life seemed transformed, so was the process of making these photographs. Journalists are observers, not participants, but the most striking sense to emerge from interviews with the photographers who took these pictures -- described by Mr. Henson Scales as the most diverse group in his more than a decade curating this annual compilation -- was how much they too lived what they witnessed. No one could escape the virus and vitalness of 2020. It gave photographers fresh perspective. And they gave us unforgettable images from a historic year in our lives.
Dean Baquet is the executive editor of The New York Times.

Texto completo: Bill Cunningham may have been best known for his fashion and society photos, but he had another passion: pets. "Bill absolutely loved animals. At one time, he had two French poodles," John Kurdewan wrote about his former colleague, the beloved photographer for The New York Times. "He would go to the farmers' market in Union Square to watch people come in with their pets and to see how they had dressed their dogs in elaborate costumes." Jessie Wender, a photo editor, combed through the archives of The New York Times for this selection from Cunningham's dog-on-the-street shots, from the mid-80s on.

Trump Turns on Barr Over His Failure to Violate Justice Dept. Policy

Texto completo: The critical tweets echoed the president's attacks on Jeff Sessions, his first attorney general.
President Trump on Saturday excoriated Attorney General William P. Barr, castigating him on Twitter for not violating Justice Department policy to publicly reveal an investigation into President-Elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s son.
The critical tweets about Mr. Barr, who has largely been a close confidant to the president since he was appointed two years ago, came a day after the Supreme Court rejected a lawsuit seeking to subvert the results of the election. With the Electoral College set to meet on Monday and Congress to formally tally the results in January, the prospects for Mr. Trump to change the outcome are all but gone.
The president's statements undermining faith in the electoral process -- and his assaults on institutions -- have escalated since the election on Nov. 3, as he enters the final weeks of his time in office. Privately, he has railed against Mr. Barr for not bolstering his false claims of widespread fraud in the election and instead affirming Mr. Biden's victory.
His messages on Saturday echoed his attacks on his first attorney general, Jeff Sessions, whom he blamed for recusing himself from overseeing the investigation into whether the Trump campaign had colluded with Russian officials in the 2016 election. For months, Mr. Trump publicly berated Mr. Sessions before firing him in November 2018, a day after the midterm races.
In three tweets, Mr. Trump called the attorney general a "big disappointment" and denounced him for not disclosing the existence of an investigation into Hunter Biden for possible tax evasion, which he said would have given Republicans an edge in the election. Doing so would have violated department guidelines about publicly discussing ongoing cases. Mr. Trump benefited from that policy himself in 2016, when officials kept quiet the inquiry into possible conspiracy between his campaign and Russian officials.
"Why didn't Bill Barr reveal the truth to the public, before the Election, about Hunter Biden," Mr. Trump wrote. "Joe was lying on the debate stage that nothing was wrong, or going on - Press confirmed. Big disadvantage for Republicans at the polls!"
The president has told aides he would like to see Mr. Barr appoint a special counsel to investigate the younger Mr. Biden, according to people briefed on the discussions. He has not expressed that desire directly to Mr. Barr, according to a person familiar with the conversations, but has instead let the issue become public in the hope of creating a pressure campaign.
Mr. Barr is so far unlikely to appoint such a special prosecutor, according to people familiar with the thinking. The question remains whether Mr. Trump will succeed in forcing him to resign or will fire him so he can appoint someone willing to do the president's personal bidding.
The president's interest in appointing a special counsel was earlier reported by The Wall Street Journal.
A spokeswoman for the Justice Department declined to comment on the president's tweets.
Mr. Trump did not answer questions from reporters as he left the White House around noon to travel to West Point for the annual Army-Navy football game on Saturday. He has mostly stayed out of sight since Election Day, taking few questions from journalists and attending only a handful of public events.
Last Sunday, The New York Times reported that Mr. Barr was considering resigning before the end of the term, a decision that he had been weighing for weeks. The attorney general was convinced Mr. Trump had lost the election, believed his work at the Justice Department was completed and wanted to avoid the controversy that often comes at the end of an administration.
In response to the reporting, some Republicans lobbied Mr. Barr to reconsider his plans, and the attorney general let the White House know that he intended to stay through the end of the term.
After Hunter Biden disclosed on Wednesday that the Justice Department was investigating his taxes, the president's anger toward his attorney general grew.
Mr. Barr has long been considered a close ally of the president. His public summary of the lengthy report by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel who was appointed to investigate Russian interference, cast the contents in a favorable light for Mr. Trump, drawing protests from Mr. Mueller himself.
Mr. Barr also worked with the White House counsel, Pat A. Cipollone, to publicly release the transcript of the call that Mr. Trump had with the president of Ukraine in July 2019. In that call, the president -- who was withholding congressionally approved military aid to Ukraine -- pushed for investigations into the Bidens.
But their relationship has come under strain this year, with the president and Mr. Barr speaking infrequently. In February, as Mr. Trump widened his attacks on law enforcement, Mr. Barr publicly rebuked the president, saying that Mr. Trump's tweets had made it "impossible" for him to do his job.
In the weeks after the election, Mr. Barr refused to refute Mr. Trump's specious claims of widespread voter fraud. But this month, after Mr. Trump raised the prospect that the Justice Department and F.B.I. may have been involved in tipping the election to Mr. Biden, Mr. Barr broke his silence. In an interview with The Associated Press, Mr. Barr said that he saw no examples of widespread voter fraud that could have meaningfully affected the election.
Those comments angered Mr. Trump, who has been searching for anyone to help push the notion that the election was stolen from him.
Days before the election, the Justice Department announced that Mr. Barr had appointed a top federal prosecutor as a special counsel to examine how the F.B.I. and intelligence agencies investigated the ties between Mr. Trump's campaign and Russia.
The announcement miffed Mr. Trump, who had wanted Mr. Barr to make public such a disclosure before the election, when Mr. Trump could have weaponized it on the campaign trail, as he did with the federal investigation into Hillary Clinton's email server and the release of stolen emails from her campaign chairman aired publicly through WikiLeaks.
Also in Washington on Saturday, a small group of the president's supporters joined a "Stop the Steal" march. Among those present was Enrique Tarrio, a leader of the far-right group the Proud Boys who also led a "Latinos for Trump" effort during the presidential campaign.
On the social media site Parler, Mr. Tarrio posted pictures of himself at the White House and said he had a "last-minute" invitation. Judd Deere, a spokesman for the White House, said Mr. Tarrio "was on a public White House Christmas tour" but did not meet with the president nor had the White House invited him.

Texto completo: A ruling against President Trump appears to leave no avenue forward for the president, forcing Republicans to "play the hand we're dealt."
A day after President Trump's stinging defeat in the Supreme Court, Republicans around the country seemed to be having trouble finding the right words.
The bellicose statements from some quarters that had characterized the postelection period -- claims of switched and missing votes, a "rigged" election and even threats of secession from Texas Republicans after the ruling on Friday -- had given way to something resembling muted resignation and an acceptance of the inevitable.
Many were completely silent, even in the face of a tweet from Mr. Trump himself in which he vowed, "WE HAVE JUST BEGUN TO FIGHT!!"
Of 17 Republican attorneys general who had endorsed the case, filed by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, none agreed to be interviewed by The New York Times. Mr. Paxton, who had issued a statement calling the decision "unfortunate," did not respond to a request for comment.
Other attorneys general who issued statements mostly seemed to acknowledge that all legal avenues had been exhausted in efforts to overturn the election results.
Mike Hunter, the Oklahoma attorney general, saw the end of the road.
"The Supreme Court has ruled. The Electoral College is going to meet Monday. We've got to accept the results," Mr. Hunter said in a Facebook interview in Oklahoma City. "We need to play the hand we're dealt."
A statement by Wayne Stenehjem, the North Dakota attorney general, echoed that. "It now appears that all reasonably arguable legal challenges have been exhausted, and the members of the Electoral College will meet across the country on Monday."
Derek Schmidt, the Kansas attorney general, summed it up with a statement saying, "It is time to put this election behind us."
Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson, a Republican who had disagreed with the decision by his state's attorney general to join the case, said there was no viable path forward for Mr. Trump.
"The electoral votes should be cast on Monday, and all indications are that Joe Biden will be the president-elect at that time," Mr. Hutchinson said in a telephone interview, urging the country to move on. "It's the tradition of our country and the history of our democracy that we do move on beyond that hard-fought election and we unite and we recognize the president-elect's leadership."
Mr. Hutchinson said he believed the effort led by Texas was based on a flawed legal theory, a view shared by Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, who had been among the first in her party to congratulate President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. on his victory. She called the court's ruling "an unsurprising affirmation of the principle that one state cannot tell another state how to run its elections."
On Capitol Hill, the response was particularly muted among the 126 House Republicans who signed onto an extraordinary amicus brief backing the suit. Aides to Representatives Kevin McCarthy of California and Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the party's top leaders in the House, had no comment. And questions and requests for comments sent to the office of more than two dozen top congressional Republicans on Saturday were either declined or ignored.
Representative Mike Johnson of Louisiana, who assembled the House's friend of the court brief, merely posted a quote on Twitter from John Quincy Adams, implying he had done what he could: "Duty is ours, results are God's."
Just one lawmaker who signed on, Representative Bruce Westerman of Arkansas, appeared newly ready to accept the president's road had run out.
In a statement, he called the Texas suit "the best and likely last opportunity" to get the Supreme Court to rule on the election, and said the court's decision "closed the books on the challenges to the 2020 election results."
"The casting of electoral votes will end a hotly contested election, and we should come together as Americans to work together for the future of our country," Mr. Westerman said, adding that Mr. Biden would be the president-elect by Monday.
Others, like Representatives Jodey Arrington of Texas and Ken Buck of Colorado, stressed that the court had not actually rejected the case based on its merits and insinuated, vaguely, that those claims could still have their day in court. But even as they pledged a continued fight, it was clear their options were dwindling.
Speaking on Fox News, Mr. Buck called for congressional hearings on election security and while discussing a pair of Senate runoffs in Georgia, indicated obliquely that he believed Mr. Biden would be president.
Another ally of the president, Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida, raised the prospect of using a normally perfunctory joint session of Congress on Jan. 6 to challenge the electoral results, though most lawmakers agree that path is very likely futile.
If anything, the brushback from the Supreme Court served to highlight the divisions running through the president's party more than a month after Election Day.
"At some point, we have to be that nation of laws," Senator Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana, said on Fox, as he sought to instill confidence among fellow Republicans that the election had been decided fairly, and in Mr. Biden's favor.
Representative Adam Kinzinger, Republican of Illinois, was harsher, warning his party on Twitter against excesses like the secession talk thrown around on Friday by Texas G.O.P. chairman Allen West or any further efforts by Republicans to stoke false hopes among their voters.
"I want to be clear: the Supreme Court is not the deep state," Mr. Kinzinger wrote in one tweet. "The case had no merit and was dispatched 9-0. There was no win here. Complaining and bellyaching is not a manly trait, it's actually sad. Real men accept a loss with grace."
Reporting was contributed by Reid J. Epstein, Trip Gabriel, Giovanni Russonello and Kathleen Gray.

Iowa Democrats Blame D.N.C. for Caucus-Night Fiasco

Texto completo: With the future of Iowa's first-in-the-nation Democratic caucuses in jeopardy, the state party sought to shift blame for a breakdown that delayed results for days after the Feb. 3 contest.
With Iowa's closely watched presidential caucuses more endangered than ever after a disastrous showing in February that delayed results for days, the Iowa Democratic Party on Saturday sought to shift blame for the meltdown onto the Democratic National Committee.
More than 10 months after the fiasco marred Iowa's first-in-the-nation nominating contest, the state party circulated a blistering internal report asserting that the national party had meddled in and delayed the development of an app for reporting results, implemented coding errors in its back-end result reporting system and required new data that further complicated the process.
The renewed sniping between Iowa Democrats and the national party comes at a critical time for the future of Iowa's standing at the beginning of the presidential nominating calendar. The caucuses are a cherished tradition for Iowans, but an increasing number of national Democrats say they are outdated and undemocratic.
The heart of the 26-page Iowa report blames the D.N.C. for the delay in results on caucus night. It states that the national party, weeks before the Feb. 3 caucuses, demanded a new tool to give it real-time results. This new tool, the report states, included coding errors that delivered inaccurate results, leading to a days-long delay before former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont finished in a virtual tie for first place.
"When the D.N.C.'s database conversion tool failed to work correctly, it caused the D.N.C. to wrongly stop the I.D.P. from reporting its results, and the I.D.P.'s entire planned reporting process was thrown into disarray," the report says. "If the D.N.C. had not interjected itself into the results reporting process based on its erroneous data conversion, caucus night could conceivably have proceeded according to the I.D.P.'s initial plan."
Iowa's first-in-the-nation status was in jeopardy even before the 2020 disaster.
Black and Hispanic Democrats argued that a state whose population is 90 percent white did not properly represent an increasingly diverse party. The caucuses themselves, which require people to attend in person, often for hours, and navigate labyrinthine rules, are less democratic than primaries, critics say. And the party's internal record-keeping from caucus sites has been proved shoddy for a second presidential election in a row.
"The caucus system itself is an anti-democratic relic that we must do away with," Julián Castro, the former U.S. housing secretary who as a 2020 presidential candidate was most vocal in attacking Iowa's early-state status, said Saturday. "But it also must be a priority for the next D.N.C. chair to reorder our primaries so that they reflect our party's diversity and values. Iowa and New Hampshire are wonderful places, but they should no longer go first."
Iowa Democrats no longer have an ally leading their party in Washington. While Barack Obama owed his presidency to a surprise victory in the 2008 Iowa caucuses, President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. never built the robust Iowa organization of his top 2020 caucus rivals and finished a distant fourth once the results were finally released.
Mr. Biden, as president, will select the next D.N.C. leader. He has yet to reveal his selection, but the party began a review over the summer of its presidential nominating procedures that it expects will "make improvements to the 2024 nominating process."
The D.N.C. declined to participate in the Iowa Democratic Party's report. David Bergstein, a committee spokesman, said the D.N.C.'s involvement in the caucus setup had been validated by a litany of errors in the result reporting process.
"Underlying technical problems were caused by errors from the I.D.P.'s vendor," he said, referring to a technology firm that built the smartphone caucus result reporting app.
The New York Times found that more than 100 Iowa caucus precincts had reported results that were internally inconsistent or missing data.
Iowa has long held its place at the beginning of the nominating calendar by working in a bloc with its fellow early states New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada, but for months there have been signs that those alliances have frayed.
Harry Reid, the former Senate majority leader who remains the functional head of the Nevada Democrats, in February called for all Democratic presidential caucuses to end. Jaime Harrison, the former South Carolina Democratic Party chairman who is a leading contender to lead the national party, declined on Saturday to say whether Iowa should retain its first-in-the-nation status.
There is no indication that Republicans will replace Iowa at the front of their 2024 presidential nominating calendar.
Of 10 key "takeaways" in a fact sheet distributed to Iowa Democratic Party members, six blame the D.N.C. for caucus-night problems.
The report, prepared by Bonnie Campbell, a former Iowa attorney general, and Nick Klinefeldt, a former top federal prosecutor in Iowa, also places blame on the Iowa Democratic Party for failing to anticipate problems in its caucus-night "boiler room," citing a lack of training and too few telephone lines to receive results. Just 439 of 1,765 precincts successfully submitted results through the party's smartphone app, and phone lines were jammed as precinct leaders tried calling instead.
Troy Price, who oversaw the bungled caucuses as chairman of the Iowa Democratic Party, resigned a week later.
The New York Times reported in February that the Iowa official in charge of the boiler room did not know how to use the Google spreadsheet application that Iowa Democrats used to enter data once the result reporting app failed.
The report also criticized news reporters for calling county officials and the party's caucus-night headquarters in search of information when no results were being made public.
"The media indirectly interfered with the results reporting process by reaching out to county chairs directly for information and calling the boiler room hotline, tying up the already busy phone bank," the report states.

WASHINGTON — Incensed by a Supreme Court ruling that further dashed President Donald Trump’s hopes of invalidating his November electoral defeat, thousands of his supporters marched in Washington and several state capitals Saturday to protest what they contended, against all evidence, was a stolen election.
In some places, angry confrontations between protesters and counterprotesters escalated into violence. There were a number of scuffles in the national capital, where at least four people were stabbed, and the police declared a riot in Olympia, Washington, where one person was shot.
In videos of a clash in Olympia that were posted on social media, a single gunshot can be heard as black-clad counterprotesters move toward members of the pro-Trump group, including one person waving a large Trump flag. After the gunshot, one of the counterprotesters is seen falling to the ground, and others call for help. In one video, a man with a gun can be seen running from the scene and putting on a red hat.
Chris Loftis, a spokesman for the Washington State Patrol, said that two people were in custody in connection with the episode but that specific details about the shooting were not yet clear, including the condition of the person who was shot.
State and federal courts have rejected dozens of lawsuits by Trump’s allies seeking to challenge the election results, but the pointed refusal by the Supreme Court on Friday to hear a case filed by the attorney general of Texas loomed the largest yet. By foreclosing one of the last legal avenues Trump had to potentially block Biden from succeeding him on Inauguration Day, it left many of his partisans casting angrily about for answers.
Trump flags dotted the air above Freedom Plaza in Washington, where demonstrators — including many members of the far-right Proud Boys group — chanted “four more years!” and vowed not to recognize Joe Biden as the president-elect.
Stephanie Lalich, 55, who traveled from Baltimore to join the protest in Washington, said voting machines had been used for widespread electoral fraud — a claim that has been proved false — and that judges had not sided with Trump because they did not want to take on the issue.
“They don’t want to deal with this,” Lalich said. “It’s going to have to go nuclear, using the Insurrection Act and bringing out the military.”
One of Trump’s former national security advisers, Michael Flynn, whom Trump pardoned in November, told Trump supporters near the Supreme Court building not to “get bent out of shape” by the latest setback, assuring them that there were still ways to fight back.
“We decide the election,” he said, greeted by cheers. “We’re waging a battle across America.”
Trump flew over the protesters in Marine One on his way to attend the Army-Navy football game at West Point. Protesters erupted in cheers as the helicopter and its escort passed overhead.
Enrique Tarrio, the leader of the Proud Boys, a right-wing group known for inciting violence at protests, caused a stir earlier in the day when he posted a photograph taken at the North Portico of the White House and said he had received a “last minute invite.” Judd Deere, a White House spokesperson, said Tarrio had been part of a public tour and that no one inside the building had invited him.
At Georgia’s Statehouse in downtown Atlanta, speakers used megaphones to cast doubt on the election as American flags and Make America Great Again hats bobbed in the crowd. Across the street, a few dozen anti-Trump activists — many dressed all in black — heckled the president’s supporters.
Chris Hill, the leader of a right-wing group called the Georgia Security Force III%, rallied many of the protesters to the Statehouse. Hill said the Supreme Court had “thumbed its nose at us.” But unlike many others in attendance, he said he accepted that Trump had lost the election.
“At this point, this thing is over,” he said, adding that he was turning his focus to the two runoff races in Georgia whose outcomes will determine which party controls the U.S. Senate.
Kim Carter, who said God had told her to drive to the Atlanta rally from Jacksonville, Florida, said she was sure that Trump would be reelected. She asked a member of Hill’s group whether it could send some armed members to Florida to protect her and her neighbors from Antifa activists after the election is finally overturned, as she believes will happen.
“Four more years, because God is the one who is in control of this,” Carter said.
Pro-Trump rallies were mounted in a number of other communities around the country. More than 100 people gathered at a rally in St. Paul, Minneapolis, to display Trump flags and call on the state’s Democratic governor to loosen coronavirus restrictions in the state. In Spanish Fort, Alabama, a suburb of Mobile, about 100 people demonstrated, according to footage posted by WKRG-TV. “We want to be part of the ‘Stop the Steal’ national movement,” one speaker there said. “That’s why we’re here.”
The gunfire in Olympia, Washington, came after supporters of Trump and counterprotesters gathered near the state Capitol on Saturday afternoon. The groups had clashed before the shooting, with some people throwing objects and punches. The air on the street was clouded by smoke grenades and mace, and police officers in riot gear later arrived on the scene.
Both sets of protesters dispersed later in the afternoon, and a large area at the edge of the Capitol campus was roped off with crime scene tape while a police officer and other officials assessed the situation. Several vehicles, including one with a Trump sticker, remained in a parking lot at the police scene, along with a scattering of rocks and broken glass.
The Olympia police said there were four arrests and that four officers had been injured, according to the CBS affiliate KIRO.
Clashes also broke out between opposing groups in Washington, D.C., where videos showed people clad in Proud Boys gear punching and kicking counterprotesters who were wearing helmets. The police stepped in and sprayed mace at some of the men involved in the fighting. Another video showed anti-police protesters scuffling with officers and tossing what appeared to be a wooden stick at them.
At night, four people were stabbed near 11th Street and F Street Northwest, according to Douglas Buchanan, a spokesman for the city’s fire department. The mayor’s office said that the four were in critical condition, adding that two police officers also were hurt and taken to hospitals. Authorities did not provide any other details, including which groups of protesters the injured belonged to.
Throughout the day, the police arrested at least 23 people, including six on charges of assaulting a police officer, the mayor’s office said.
Earlier in the day, the pro-Trump crowd in Washington had appeared jubilant at times, despite the setbacks in the courts and the dwindling time remaining before Jan. 20 when Biden is due to be sworn in. They rewrote the refrain of the Van Halen song “Jump” to say, “Might as well Trump!” Others sold Trump-themed T-shirts and other items advertising his false claims of electoral fraud.
Some demonstrators were more confident than others that Trump could secure a second term despite losing the election.
Phyllis Monson, 61, who drove for several days from Tonopah, Arizona, to attend the rally, said she was not sure what steps remained available to overturn the election, but that she was convinced it had been unfair.
“This election was such a fraud,” Monson said. “There needs to be a revote.”
Luther Anderson, 30, said he had voted for former President Barack Obama and for Trump, but could not envision Biden as president. Trump has released Black people from prison through a criminal justice overhaul, he noted, while Biden contributed to the 1994 crime bill that lengthened criminal sentences for many people, many of them Black and some of whom remain imprisoned.
“The media’s trying to make him this good guy and then make Trump the villain,” said Anderson, who lives in Washington. “It’s like the media, they’re trying to, like, brainwash.”

Texto completo: In December 2007, a 15-year-old Taliban suicide bomber assassinated former Pakistani prime minister Benazir Bhutto in Rawalpindi as she drove away from a campaign rally. Her murder and the ensuing political chaos sent shock waves through Washington corridors. It was a clear indication that nuclear-armed Pakistan was in free fall despite the U.S. alliance with President Pervez Musharraf.

That fall I had begun my journalism career as a reporting fellow at NPR's headquarters in D.C. On the day of Bhutto's assassination, as Pakistani cities exploded into chaos, I was asked to help work the phone lines to the country of my birth. A few days later, I was on a plane to Islamabad to contribute to aftermath coverage for a short stint. I may have known the language and culture as a Pakistani American, but for invaluable research on the current situation, I carried clippings from Irish journalist Declan Walsh, then writing for the Guardian as its regional correspondent.

It is strange to revisit that time now given that Pakistan, once at the center of the "war on terror," has largely receded from international headlines and certainly from my own journalism career. In his book "The Nine Lives of Pakistan: Dispatches From a Precarious State," Walsh returns the focus to the troubled Islamic republic and delves into his reporter's notebook to explore Pakistan in the years after 9/11. Walsh first covered the country for the Guardian and later for the New York Times, reporting on what he describes as its "multi-ringed circus of violence." He was there for every major story, including the raid on Osama bin Laden's compound and the endless wars along the country's frontiers. Now the Times' chief Africa correspondent, Walsh contributed dispatches that pulsated with urgency and empathy. In a few words, he could distill layers of history and culture into vivid brushstrokes of narrative. But as his writing became essential reading for both international and Pakistani readers, it earned the wrath of the country's security establishment, which revoked his credentials and expelled him in 2013. It is on the eve of that expulsion that "Nine Lives" begins, as Walsh reflects on a country he spent a decade trying to untangle.
The late British essayist Christopher Hitchens once described Pakistan as a "humorless, paranoid, insecure" nation. Salman Rushdie has called it "insufficiently imagined." But Walsh writes that once he settled in there, "a more complex and interesting country came into view, softer around the edges than its dour image suggested, where people love to let their hair down." Walsh is an engaging guide, reminding us that " Pak is Urdu for 'clean,' so Pakistan translates literally as 'Land of the Pure.' " But he discovers that life there is not always as pure as the phrase implies. He finds a country of contradictions, a deeply conservative society where foamy home-brew flows freely, as does Scotch at stylish soirees where cocaine-snorting "women in slinky dresses weaved between the tables as inebriated men traded sloppy punches on the dance floors." Doors open endlessly for Walsh, as Pakistan's drawing-room elite and its politically connected offer him meals accompanied with spicy analysis and powerful introductions. "The key to meeting the right people was sifarish , an intercession from a well-connected friend. Sifarish was a kind of magic carpet in Pakistan. With the right push, it could take you to just about anywhere - to distant tribal forts, to army bases in Waziristan and to hidden corners of the cities."
As a Pakistani reader, I found that some of the book's cultural generalizations and summations tended toward exotica cliche, but the country's contradictions have always ignited writers' imaginations, and Walsh has an impeccable eye for detail. In a section on visiting the war-torn frontier provinces, he writes: "My first glimpse of Waziristan came through the pothole-shaped window of a clattering Pakistan army helicopter. Below, a breathtaking vista stretched in every direction. Castellated houses clung to vertiginous slopes. A jeep scrambled, insectlike, across a desiccated riverbed. Giant shafts of sunlight pierced the clouds."
Walsh's expulsion by Pakistan's intelligence agencies illuminates what is arguably the most important fault line in Pakistan: the divide between its military establishment and fledgling civilian leadership, largely drawn from a dynastic feudal class. "If maps evoked Pakistan's external insecurities, its most sensitive borders lay inside the country, which was riven by ethnic, tribal and sectarian fault lines, a place of head-spinning contradictions." The political infighting has produced a violently divisive public sphere that persists to this day. "More concept than country, Pakistan strained under the centrifugal forces of history, identity and faith. Could it hold?" Walsh asks. Based on his own unceremonious exit, he arrives at the conclusion that regardless of democratic forces, "it seemed to boil down to one hard truth: the military always wins."
"Nine Lives" is an unquestionably illuminating and engaging book, but arriving in 2020, its insights feel dated, given the dramatic shifts in South Asia since Walsh reported from the region. While his 2013 expulsion may have affirmed the military establishment's paranoia, Pakistan has surged into a new semi-democratic era with the 2018 election of former cricketer Imran Khan and his populist promises of a "new Pakistan." The military's campaign to rout the Pakistani Taliban - a Frankenstein's monster of its own making - has succeeded in eliminating the attacks that had once turned the country's cities into killing fields. As Walsh acknowledges, "In 2013, Pakistan had forty-six suicide attacks and 2,400 deaths from militant attacks; in 2019, there were four suicide attacks and 350 deaths."
The Khan government is also orchestrating the current U.S.-facilitated peace talks to finally end the war in Afghanistan. And perhaps the most important development that only receives cursory attention is the unraveling relationship with neighboring India. While Walsh waxes philosophical about the ideological grounds for a separate homeland for India's Muslims that led to the creation of Pakistan in 1947, he departed the region before the rise of what is arguably the single greatest political force in South Asia today: the ardent Hindu nationalist government of Narendra Modi in India. The well-documented marginalization of India's Muslim community and its deep enmity with Pakistan have further emboldened the Islamic republic's military hard-liners.
In postcolonial societies like Pakistan, the credentialed Western foreign correspondent (typically White) cuts a powerful figure - that journalist is granted access to gatekeepers and the narrative privilege to be read as an impartial observer with a bird's-eye view. In that regard, "The Nine Lives of Pakistan" feels like a throwback to a waning era of the authoritative journalistic account of an exotic elsewhere. This is not only because of crumbling international norms of journalistic access, as Walsh experienced, or shrinking foreign bureaus, but also because of the decentralizing and anti-establishment mood of the socially networked age. In an increasingly globalized media landscape, American readers could benefit from supplementing Walsh's dispatches with local voices and more diverse sources. One of the blurbed reviewers on the book's cover describes it as the single book one needs to read to understand Pakistan. It certainly succeeds as an elegantly crafted memoir of a gifted journalist, but in a shift from my own younger admiration for the grizzled foreign correspondent, I'd hesitate to call it a definitive account of a country very much still in motion.

Texto completo: Trieste is a narrow Italian city on the coast of the Adriatic Sea, behind the top of the back of the country's boot. Slovenia is five miles east from the city center, and Slavs make day trips to shop. Illy, the coffee company, traces its roots here, and it's home to one of the largest synagogues in Europe. Its rich history revolves around its role as a bustling imperial port city. I visited Trieste three years ago, ate, drank, wandered and waded into the Adriatic Sea, glimpsing ancient limestone outcrops in the distance.
But I would not have understood Trieste without the help of Jan Morris, who made a living understanding everything. Her book, "Trieste and the Meaning of Nowhere" is 188 pages of geography, philosophy, Napoleonic history, Jewish history, maritime history, vintage gossip of the bourgeoisie, personal reminiscence and self-reflection. And despite - or perhaps because of - the multitudes Trieste contains, Morris declares it "a fulcrum of nothing but an extension of much more."
Morris, who died last month at 94 in her native Wales, published more than 40 books and countless articles. Some volumes are laser-focused on one place, some sprawling essay collections. She is often referred to as a travel writer, but to acknowledge her as such is like calling the Beatles a rock-and-roll band or van Gogh a landscape painter.
She wrote about architecture as prolifically and proficiently as Thoreau wrote about nature. She constantly and easily drew analogies to the works and exploits of novelists, poets, painters, dukes, kings, generals and ancient Greek philosophers. She never presented a narrative without first establishing a solid, intricately constructed foundation of historical truths. She might swerve into detailed exposition of past events, but she quickly slingshots back to her more whimsical, inspired musings.

And her food writing could make Anthony Bourdain blush. In a Singapore market "the shoppers spared me hardly a glance, for they were choosing their victuals with a scholarly concentration, calculating the density of turnips, contemplating the specific gravity of carp, comparing the metabolisms of goose liver and pickled crab before with decisive gestures they solved their several equations, and stuffing liver, noodles, pressed ducks and sharks' fins into their blue and yellow plastic shopping bags, hastened home to make the soup."
It would seem like she spent years poring over stacks of scholarly books and reams of microfiche, but to envision her cooped up in some ivory tower is to insult her very essence. She didn't travel for the sake of travel, she traveled to study. In 1987 she told the New York Times, "I don't really enjoy traveling if I'm not writing. E.M. Forster once said that the only way to look at Alexandria is to wander aimlessly. At times, I have drifted to the Lower East Side, to Chinatown and so forth, but I haven't wandered much."
I can't help wonder if that's because she was long accustomed to a life guided and shaped by missions. Earlier in her career, Morris, a transgender woman, was a military officer in one of Britain's most distinguished cavalry regiments and a World War II veteran and wrote under the name James Morris. In 1946 she was posted as an intelligence officer in Palestinian territories, which she arrived at via Venice and Trieste, both of which she wrote book-length tributes to.
She later became an international correspondent for the Times of London and remains most famous for her dispatch from Mount Everest, which she scaled partway with Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay in 1953, scrambling down to file her exclusive just in time to run on the eve of Queen Elizabeth II's coronation. Coverage of Nazi officer Adolf Eichmann's trial, Che Guevara and Fidel Castro's Cuba were among her other coups.
Like another matchless chronicler of geopolitics then culture, the New York Times's similarly prolific R.W. Apple, who covered wars and presidential races before recounting his international dining adventures, Morris is so immediate and engaging in her writing because she possesses that reporter-esque instinct for scrutiny and obsession with detail. If any of her work were turned into a screenplay, there would be no need to contrive sets or costumes. Dutifully and admiringly, she records what would easily go unnoticed - the stitching on a buttonhole, the irregularities of a shadow.

Though British - insistently and quintessentially so ("Oxford made me," she wrote in "Conundrum," a chronicle of her transition), she came up in the time of New Journalism. The practice, pioneered by Gay Talese and Truman Capote, relies on the specific techniques of fiction but sticks to the facts. Like those pioneers, she told probing and engaging stories that were also true. She just wove them through with a little more philosophy and introspection.
I discovered Morris 20 years ago while working at the Harvard Book Store in Cambridge. With a newly minted degree in literature, it was pretty much the only job I was qualified for. The used-book department in the basement had that musty scent of dust and other people's houses. After work one quiet Sunday night I spotted "The World" on the shelf in the "Essays" section, equidistant from volumes by James Baldwin and Virginia Woolf. Small images of global landmarks adorned the spine and caught my eye. The minimal title - solemn, seductive and assured - snapped me to attention. The essays - impressionistic but set in tangible and at times familiar places - were like nothing I'd read before.
That volume - coffee- and beer-stained, dog-eared and scribbled in over the years - was eventually lost somewhere in Amsterdam. Rather, not "lost," but returned to its natural habitat: the world. I only hope some curious passerby picked it up from whatever park bench or lobby sofa or cafe table I left it on, read it and set it back out into the wilds. I like to imagine all these years later it's still circulating, reaching all the places Morris mused about in its pages.

When taken as a whole, her essays read as fiction, a fitting bridge to journalism for a literature major who had just spent years absorbed in Hemingway, Mann, Joyce, Shakespeare, et al. Morris's ensemble is the city itself. The structures, buildings, waterways and open spaces, the cast of characters. She imbues inanimate structures with energy and personality. Skyscrapers in Singapore are "very rich, very arrogant, very vulgar" and they "humiliate" the old historic buildings. In Manhattan, the bases of buildings "suggest so many gigantic roots or trunks, and the life of the city seems to proceed as within a gargantuan forest." In Edinburgh, church spires and austere towers are "thinking awful Scottish thoughts, or plotting the downfall of reason." She's insistent that her appetite for cities is greater than that for the countryside that surrounds her when she's home in Wales, but we nevertheless catch her indulging in glimpses of nature being mischievous or gratified. The fjords of Norway, for instance "creep into the hills for shelter."
In a 1997 New York Times article, she remarked that stones have a warmth about them, be it mighty Karnak or the walls of her stone cottage. "Inanimate objects express the unexpressed animate emotions," she said. Those words are like a Rosetta stone to me, unlocking the Egyptology of the inner life that informs her perception.
Morris assumed she would be remembered as "that sex-changed travel writer" and indeed, throughout her life and now her passing, people suggest her perpetual travel was a metaphor for running away and trying to find herself. I think, however, that it was more a case of knowing and understanding herself so well that she could be contented anywhere.
When I saw her speak at the New York Public Library about 10 years ago, I remember her saying that when you travel, "you've got to be alone," even if people want you to have company. As someone who often travels on my own when I'm on assignment, I see the value in that directive. That way it's easier to talk to strangers who, in my experience, are far more valuable than any guidebook. Some have even become good friends. Moreover, if you want to get to know a city, you have to give it your undivided attention. And once you get to know the place, Morris showed us over and over, you'll never be lonely. There's too much to see.

Michelle Goldberg: COVID meds are scarce, but not for Trump cronies

Texto completo: According to a document from the Department of Health and Human Services, a total of 108 doses of Regeneron’s monoclonal antibody cocktail have been allocated to Washington, which had 265 new coronavirus cases on Wednesday alone. Somehow Rudy Giuliani, Donald Trump’s lawyer, got one of those doses. In an interview with a New York radio station on Tuesday, Giuliani did us all the favor of explaining why he qualified for privileged treatment.
“I had very mild symptoms,” he told the radio station, WABC. “I think if it wasn’t me, I wouldn’t have been put in the hospital. Sometimes when you’re a celebrity, they’re worried if something happens to you; they’re going to examine it more carefully and do everything right.” He said on another show on the same station that the president’s physician was involved in his care.
Giuliani, of course, is not the only presidential crony to get access to highly rationed experimental therapies. Trump himself was among the very first people to get the Regeneron treatment outside of a clinical trial, before it received an emergency use authorization from the FDA on Nov. 21.
In October, Chris Christie, the former New Jersey governor and an informal adviser to the president, got a different monoclonal antibody treatment, one produced by Eli Lilly. Housing Secretary Ben Carson wrote on Facebook that Trump “cleared” him to receive monoclonal antibody therapy when he was hospitalized with COVID-19 last month.
Some of these men received their treatments before they were available to the public. Giuliani may have got his instead of a member of the public. His case sheds light on two kinds of corruption. There’s the corruption of an administration that appears to be using government power to procure potentially lifesaving favors for the president’s friends. And there’s the corruption of a for-profit medical system in which VIP patients can receive extraordinary levels of care, sometimes at the expense of the less connected.
Both the Regeneron and Eli Lilly therapies are meant for people who are at risk of getting sick enough with COVID to be hospitalized, not those who are hospitalized already. The emergency use authorization for the Regeneron treatment specifically says that it is “not authorized” for “adults or pediatric patients who are hospitalized due to Covid-19.”
A physician with experience administering the new monoclonal antibodies, who didn’t want to use his name because he’s not authorized by his hospital to speak publicly, said giving them to Giuliani “appears to be an inappropriate use outside the guidelines of the EUA for a very scarce resource.” Very scarce indeed: According to the Department of Health and Human Services, as of Wednesday the entire country had about 77,000 total doses of the Regeneron cocktail and almost 260,000 doses of Eli Lilly’s monoclonal antibody treatment. That’s less than you’d need to treat everyone who’d tested positive in just the previous two days.
Right now, the criteria for distributing these drugs can be murky. Robert Klitzman, co-founder of the Center for Bioethics at Columbia, said that the federal government allocates doses to states, states allocate them to hospitals and hospitals then decide which patients among those most at risk will get treated. Some states have developed guidelines for monoclonal antibody treatment, “but my understanding is that most states have not yet done that,” Klitzman said.
Hospitals try to come up with ethical triage frameworks, but Klitzman told me there are often workaround for VIPs. He said it helps to know someone on the hospital’s board, bodies that typically include wealthy philanthropists. Often, he said, when these millionaires and billionaires ask hospital administrators for special treatment for a friend, “hospitals do it.”
Why? “Hospitals have huge financial problems, especially at the moment with COVID,” he said. They’ve had to shut down profitable elective surgeries and treat many people without insurance. More than ever, he said, they “need money that is given philanthropically from potential donors.”
In other words, Giuliani was right: Celebrities have access to better care than ordinary people. “When someone is in the public eye, or if someone is a potential donor, or has already been a donor to a hospital, then there’s folks in the hospital hierarchy, in the administration, who are keenly aware if they’re coming in, if they’re present, if they need something,” said Shoa Clarke, a cardiologist and professor at Stanford University School of Medicine. COVID, which is leading to rationing of medical resources, only magnifies this long-standing inequality.
But like so many in Trump’s orbit, Giuliani combines unusual candor with unusual deceptiveness. He’s honest about trading on his fame, but uses his ultra-elite experience to play down the dangers of COVID for everyone. “If you get early treatment nothing’s going to happen to you,” he said on WABC, adding, “You totally eliminate the chance of dying.”
This is wildly untrue. Even if monoclonal antibody therapies were a foolproof cure — and there’s no evidence they are — most people who listen to Giuliani won’t have access to them. They might not learn that until it’s too late.
“This message that’s been delivered, that maybe we don’t need to be so worried about COVID, that has been a deadly message, and it’s part of a bigger package of misinformation that’s been spread across our country, and it’s why we’re in the position we’re in right now,” said Clarke.
When I spoke to him on Wednesday, he’d just learned that one of the hospitals in his area had reached capacity. “We’re expecting the others to follow suit in the next few weeks, to the point where we don’t have ICU beds available anymore,” he said.
But don’t worry. If friends of Trump need one, they’ll surely find a way.

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
WASHINGTON — Since President Donald Trump took office, the Justice Department has been under sustained attack as he questioned whether the lawyers and investigators who serve the country were loyalists who supported his personal agenda or traitors who should be rooted out and fired.
But under President-elect Joe Biden, the department’s former and current employees hope that his pick for attorney general will shield the agency from partisan battles and political concerns.
More than 40 current and former department employees shared with The New York Times who they thought should run the Justice Department. They all wanted someone who would stand up for the employees and protect them from undue political influence, something that they say Trump’s attorneys general have largely been unable or unwilling to do.
They said that restoring the department’s independence from the White House, repairing morale and engaging both racial justice advocates and law enforcement officials on matters of race and criminal justice were the biggest issues facing the incoming leader.
More than a dozen people said that they hoped Biden would nominate Sally Q. Yates, the former deputy attorney general in the Obama administration who was fired by Trump for refusing to defend his executive order banning entry to the United States for those from Muslim-majority countries.
Because she had so recently served as a top official in the department, the current and former department employees said they believed Yates would be ready from the get-go to tackle the big national security threats facing the country. As a strong civil rights advocate under President Barack Obama, she would be able to revitalize racial justice work that had languished during the Trump administration, they said.
They bristled at widespread reports that Biden would disqualify her because he feared the prospect of a difficult confirmation hearing. Focusing on a two-day grilling before Congress, they said, would give short shrift to the seriousness of the work to be done.
Two people made cases for Doug Jones, the departing Alabama senator who, as a U.S. attorney under the Clinton administration, prosecuted members of the Ku Klux Klan who had bombed the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham in 1963, killing four Black girls. Jones shares the quality that seems, more than any other, essential to securing a nomination from Biden — he is a close friend of the incoming president.
One person said that he believed Judge Merrick Garland of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, whose Supreme Court nomination Republicans blocked in 2016, would be ideal, citing his reputation for fairness.
Biden’s choice of attorney general has been complicated by the fact that his son, Hunter Biden, is under federal investigation for possible tax crimes, shifting some of the calculus over the pick. Among the questions the selection now raises is whether it is an asset or a liability for the attorney general to be known as a close friend when that person will need to handle such a sensitive matter.
The choice gained some urgency Saturday after Trump again attacked Attorney General William Barr, this time for not publicly disclosing the inquiry. Doing so, he contended, could have helped sway the election in his favor, and the public excoriation set off a fresh wave of speculation that he would fire Barr and replace him with a loyalist who department employees feared could inflict untold damage on the institution.
“Why didn’t Bill Barr reveal the truth to the public, before the Election, about Hunter Biden,” Trump said on Twitter, referring to the federal inquiry. Justice Department policies prohibit public discussion about cases that could influence the outcome of the election.
Some of the people interviewed for this article said that the incoming attorney general should have deep national security experience and expertise in both domestic terrorism issues and challenges from foreign adversaries like China and Iran.
While Democratic administrations often prioritize the work of the civil rights division, the protests prompted by the death of George Floyd this spring have made such work an urgent priority, regardless of which party is in office, most interviewees said. To that end, they hoped for an attorney general who had the strong support of civil rights groups. But many acknowledged that for that to be consequential, on issues including complicated ones like policing, that person should be able to work with groups like the Fraternal Order of Police.
People were deeply divided over how the department should handle the prospect of investigating Trump or his inner circle. Some argued that Biden himself had no appetite for investigating and prosecuting the past and that the attorney general should take a similar approach. Others, mostly prosecutors, said the department must pursue criminal cases without fear or favor.
But those interviewed agreed on one thing: The merits of a case should determine whether the department chose to seek an indictment, and only someone who was seen as nonpartisan could credibly make and explain that sort of sensitive determination.
Nearly everyone said that the incoming attorney general would need to reestablish the idea that prosecutions would be free of political pressure from the president.
“Great damage has been done to the reputation and credibility of the department by the way it has been used for political purposes,” said Jonathan M. Smith, a former prosecutor in the civil rights division who now serves as executive director of the Washington Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs.
He said that Barr had contributed greatly to that process by intervening in high-profile cases involving the president’s allies, such as having the department withdraw its prosecution of the president’s first national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, and presenting the special counsel’s report on Russian interference in the 2016 election as less damning to the president than it really was. But he said the problem of politicization had seeped throughout the agency, preventing career prosecutors from effectively investigating police misconduct.
Some current and former employees argued that the leadership’s decision to largely cut career people out of the decision-making process had contributed to politicization. Others argued that it was not entirely unusual and had been done because of the great amount of information that had found its way into the hands of reporters in the Trump era. Regardless, everyone agreed that it had hurt morale.
The incoming attorney general should solicit opinions from career officials before deciding on significant matters, one former longtime employee of the department said. Moreover, that leader, the former employee said, should trust deputies to bring issues of importance to top leaders when necessary.
An attorney general who adopted “a more inclusive, trust-driven and less hierarchical approach to management” could help repair the department’s culture, said Julie Saltman, a former lawyer in the civil division. “I’d like to see a genuinely good manager.”
Many employees said that they wanted an attorney general who would support their desire for accountability in the wake of the Trump era, even if no one from the current administration was prosecuted.
In a survey of more than 600 Justice Department alumni conducted by the legal group Protect Democracy, 77% said that the attorney general should work to identify all the ways that the departing administration had eroded the department’s norms and policies and build new procedures to restore its integrity. Only 5% said that a change in administration alone would rebuild credibility and restore morale.
“For the government to rebuild norms around Justice Department independence, there needs to be an accounting of what happened and who as involved,” said Rachel Homer, a former lawyer in the civil division.

Texto completo: Asaltos, robos de mercancía y hasta ATM’s completos, balaceras, golpes y apuñalamientos: las bodegas de Nueva York se han convertido en un escenario más de la violencia callejera.
Estos negocios, tradicionalmente considerados partes de la comunidad, han experimentado un aumento del 63% en los tiroteos y las cifras de robos se han triplicado en 2020. Además, seis personas han muerto dentro o frente a estos pequeños locales.
Uno de ellos fue el joven Mohmediyan Tarwala, de 26 años, quien recibió un disparo durante un robo el 26 de octubre en la bodega “Crossbay Express”, donde trabajaba en Queens.
“Últimamente, después de la pandemia, no sé por qué, pero hubo gente que vino y nos amenazó”, dijo el gerente Hardik Parekh, de pie cerca del lugar donde su amigo colapsó. “Nunca pensé que terminaría en asesinato”.
Jason Maharaj, un oficial de policía fuera de servicio, estaba junto a la caja registradora cuando sucedió la tregedia. El agente NYPD se abalanzó sobre el pistolero, un hombre mayor sin hogar, y lo desarmó rápidamente. Posteriormente fue identificado como Steven Cohen (63) y acusado de asesinato.
En la primavera, cuando Nueva York se cerró y los artículos esenciales volaron de los estantes de los supermercados, las bodegas se convirtieron en un salvavidas para los ciudadanos que buscaban productos básicos difíciles de encontrar, mayormente cerca de sus casas.
También se convirtieron en paraísos durante el cierre pandémico, aún abiertas las 24 horas para comprar productos básicos, un billete de lotería o, en algunos casos, simplemente sentir un sentido de comunidad.
Pero a medida que la pandemia se ha extendido y un número cada vez mayor de personas han perdido sus trabajos o atravesado tiempos difíciles, las bodegas han pasado a ser los principales objetivos de una creciente ola de delincuencia, poniendo en peligro a los operadores, la gran mayoría inmigrantes.
La semana pasada, una niña fue captada por cámaras de seguridad huyendo mientras ladrones armados robaban la bodega donde trabaja su madre en El Bronx (NYC).
Durante los primeros ocho meses de la pandemia, hubo un aumento del 63% en los incidentes con disparos dentro o frente a las bodegas y tiendas, y una subida del 222% en los robos, según datos del Departamento de Policía obtenidos por The New York Times.
El aumento se produce cuando una segunda ola del virus golpea la ciudad y un fuerte aumento de la violencia armada ha afectado a los neoyorquinos desde el verano. En general, los tiroteos se han duplicado este año con respecto a 2019, y los homicidios han aumentado casi 40%.
Fernando Mateo, uno de los fundadores de “United Bodegas of America” , una organización que representa a unos 20 mil negocios de ese tipo en Nueva York, destacó que la pandemia había dado pie a un pequeño número de delincuentes para atacar las tiendas en los vecindarios, la mayoría de clase trabajadora que paga con dinero en efectivo.
“Algunos se están aprovechando de que todos usan máscaras para cometer delitos”, destacó Mateo. Y agregó que las bodegas están luchando por mantenerse a flote vendiendo artículos económicos como papas fritas, cerveza y leche, con pequeños márgenes de ganancia que a veces se miden en centavos. “Cuando les roban, les roban dólares reales”, dijo.
Debido a sus largas jornadas de trabajo, las bodegas siempre han sido blanco de delitos, pero también se las consideraba refugios seguros frente a la violencia callejera. Ese papel se puso de relieve en el verano de 2018, cuando el quinceañero Lesandro “Junior” Guzmán Feliz entró a una bodega del Bronx en un intento desesperado por escapar de los “Trinitarios”. Las cámaras de seguridad capturaron la espantosa escena cuando los pandilleros lo apuñalaron hasta matarlo.
Desde entonces, un puñado de propietarios de bodegas ha agregado medidas de seguridad, como botones de pánico, luces más brillantes y cerraduras especiales. Pero Mateo dijo que la mayoría de los operadores no pueden permitirse la seguridad adicional, que puede costar miles de dólares.
Policías como Nicole Spinelli y Corey Simpson, dos oficiales NYPD en el sur del Bronx, han estado advirtiendo a los operadores de las tiendas que enfrentarse a los ladrones puede ser peligroso. “Les decimos que no vale la pena lastimarse o incluso morir por un galón de leche de $3” dólares, dijo la agente Spinelli. La violencia “Puede escalar rápidamente. Nuestro consejo es llamar al 911″.
En septiembre, propietarios de bodegas de la ciudad se reunieron con el comisionado policial Dermot Sheaen medio de la ola de robos y violencia con armas de fuego y puñales en sus negocios., incluyendo robos completos de cajeros automáticos ATM. Pero desde entonces la situación no ha mejorado.


New York's bodegas, a lifeline for many city residents, have become prime targets for crime in the pandemic. But many of the often immigrant-owned stores, facing a sharp rise in burglaries and shootings, can't afford new safety measures. https://t.co/sTQTkrkqED

Ski Champion Comes Out as Gay: ‘I’m Ready to Be Happy’

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
As he prepared to barrel down the slopes in northern Vermont at an event in March 2019, Hig Roberts decided this would be his last race as a professional Alpine skier. It was the day before his 28th birthday, he was skiing in the Nor-Am Cup at the high school where he once trained, and it just felt right.
The only thing that had felt right in a while.
Roberts had made a name for himself among the elite of Alpine skiing — a sport in which speed, strength and focus are the currency. Though he missed a spot on the U.S. team for the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics, he had made 31 World Cup starts, competed for the U.S. Ski team and won two national titles.
Despite such success, whenever he was preparing to fly down a mountain at 80 to 90 mph, where the slightest mistake could result in death, his mind would drift far from the competition.
“Not being able to be who I am and not be able to be openly gay as a professional athlete was truly hindering my performance,” Roberts said in an interview this month with The New York Times in which he came out publicly.
He is the first current or former male Alpine skier of his caliber to come out publicly as gay in a sport seen as closed and clubby.
Roberts, who recently returned to the United States after stepping away from the sport to work in finance in Norway, decided to come out in part to inspire young skiers with the message that they can compete at the highest levels no matter their sexuality.
“I just woke up one morning and I said, ‘Enough is enough,’” Roberts said. “I love this sport more than anything — I’m so lucky and privileged to be doing this — but I can’t go on another day not trying to achieve the person that I am meant to be. Which I think for each and every one of us, one of those main goals needs to be happiness and authenticity.”
He joins only a few LGBTQ athletes in elite skiing who are out. Anja Pärson, a former Alpine skier from Sweden, came out as lesbian in 2012. Erik Schinegger wrote a book in 1988 about his experience as a transgender and intersex skier after coming out in 1968. And Gus Kenworthy, a former U.S. freestyle skier who now competes for Britain, came out as gay on ESPN in 2015.
There are few openly gay athletes across men’s sports. In the four North American major leagues — the NFL, the NBA, the NHL and MLB — no active players publicly identify as LGBTQ, though a handful of former athletes have come out in recent years. If a team signs Ryan Russell, a free agent who came out as bisexual in 2019, he would be the second active, openly gay or bisexual NFL player ever.
In women’s sports, there are many prominent gay players, including soccer star and World Cup champion Megan Rapinoe and her fiancée, WNBA all-star Sue Bird.
Roberts said a hypermasculine vibe permeated Alpine skiing and put pressure on him to conform, especially when competing in Europe, where Alpine skiers are big celebrities.
While on the World Cup ski circuit from 2015-19, Roberts said he found himself in an atmosphere that almost encouraged womanizing. Instead, he opted for his hotel room, alone.
“There’s this idea that being a professional skier in Europe, you’re garnering the attention of women and you’re almost a little bit larger than life,” he said.
He and others also said an insular nature in the sport may discourage people from coming out.
“I think it’s vital to understand the broader atmosphere around Alpine skiing — it’s got its own unique ecosystem,” said Chris French, founder of Ski Bums, the world’s largest LGBTQ skiing and snowboarding club. “It’s rural, it’s remote and it’s overwhelmingly white and wealthy. It’s got its own tourism, real estate, products and services — even media.”
Raised in the skiing hotbed of Steamboat Springs, Colorado, Roberts does not remember strapping on his first pair of skis. He was barely 2.
At age 9, before his first big competition, he shattered his femur in an accident that he, his parents and his doctors thought would preemptively end his career. But he had a feel for and a draw toward the slopes. So Roberts, who was also small for his age, came back from a risky surgery and trained harder and longer to prove to himself and others that he belonged.
When he was about 12, he started to question whether he might be gay but dismissed the notion. Based on what he had seen at the elite level and in his small mountain town, being gay did not fit his perception of the Alpine skier, an image he was already struggling to emulate.
Roberts eventually made it to the World Cup circuit, and his path was unusual. He was recruited to U.S. Ski Team B after graduating in 2014 from Middlebury College in Vermont. Few college skiers join the national team, but Roberts set himself apart at the World University Games in Trentino, Italy, in December 2013, placing seventh overall in the giant slalom.
According to his ranking going in, he should have been closer to 40th.
As he ascended in the sport and struggled again with his sexual identity, the slopes became a safe haven — the only place he could freely fly down a mountain.
Until his world came crashing down.
In August 2016 his younger brother, Murphy, died after he had a diabetic seizure while on a hike, fell and sustained a head injury. Murphy was 22.
The sudden loss of his brother was a blow that almost ended Roberts’ career; he recalled Murphy as the “most special person” in his life. Murphy, who grew up with Type 1 diabetes, taught Roberts one of his most valuable lessons: Live every day authentically yourself.
After a brief break, Roberts returned to skiing with a helmet bearing the slogan “Send it for Murph,” even as the loss of his brother and the burden of hiding his sexuality ate away at his mental health.
“I began to thrive in the environments when things were the worst,” he said.
That’s why on a foggy, rainy day in 2017 — under conditions that no one would want to ski in — Roberts knew he would win his first national title for the giant slalom in Sugarloaf, Maine, edging out Tim Jitloff, a seven-time national champion.
But Roberts did not feel like a national champion, nor did he when he won the national title for slalom in 2018. He had developed late, lost a brother, knew he was gay and did not love what he was doing. Seeing no one else like him, he wondered if he really belonged at all.
The response when Kenworthy came out in 2015 was welcoming overall, but skiers of all levels and sports media debated whether the space was actually inclusive.
U.S. Ski and Snowboard has had an inclusion statement incorporating sexual orientation since 2018, but little had been done to enforce its goals, said Ellen Adams, who oversees diversity, equity and inclusion for the sport’s national governing body. This year, amid the nation’s broader examination of racial inequity, the organization is undergoing an audit to identify more concrete initiatives, like putting more pictures of women and skiers of color in their media materials and allowing a “nonbinary” option for membership registration.
“If you can’t see yourself on our website, in public-facing content, how do you know that you can do that?” Adams said.
Roberts continues to ski recreationally, although he does not expect to compete the way he used to. He still participates in an annual hometown race dedicated to Murphy. And he looks forward to living freely, the way his brother taught him to.
“I am gay,” Roberts said. “It’s part of me and I’m proud of it, and I’m ready to be happy.”

2020 Was Especially Deadly. COVID Wasn’t the Only Culprit.

The year 2020 has been abnormal for mortalities. At least 356,000 more people in the United States have died than usual since the coronavirus pandemic took hold in the country in the spring. But not all of these deaths have been directly linked to COVID-19.
More than a quarter of deaths above normal have been from other causes, including diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, high blood pressure and pneumonia, according to a New York Times analysis of estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Some of these additional deaths may actually have been due to COVID-19, but they could have been undiagnosed or misattributed to other causes.
Many of them are most likely indirectly related to the virus and caused by disruptions from the pandemic, including strains on health care systems, inadequate access to supplies like ventilators or people avoiding hospitals for fear of exposure to the coronavirus.
Research has shown that people with underlying health conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease are particularly vulnerable to severe illness and death if they contract COVID-19.
In several states, deaths attributed to diabetes are at least 20% above normal this year.
Prolonged economic stress on families during the pandemic could also be contributing to increased deaths among those with chronic illnesses.
“You end up having to choose between your prescription medications or buying groceries or keeping a roof over your head,” said Steven Woolf, director emeritus of the Center on Society and Health at Virginia Commonwealth University, whose research has also shown deaths from other causes to be higher than normal.
At least 10 states have seen deaths from high blood pressure — a common comorbidity like diabetes — rise even higher than the national percentage. These may include deaths from heart failure, kidney failure or stroke.
Many people who die from high blood pressure are also at high risk for severe COVID-19, so some of these deaths could be COVID-19 deaths that are missed, according to Robert Anderson, chief of the mortality statistics branch at the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics.
Nationwide, deaths from Alzheimer’s disease, which usually affects older adults, are 12% above normal this year, with several Southern states seeing larger increases. This could be related to challenges in providing adequate care in nursing homes during the pandemic — deaths in nursing homes account for more than one-third of the nation’s total coronavirus toll. The virus may have also aggravated some of these patients’ existing health conditions.
Other factors related to the pandemic like social isolation and challenges in getting emergency services could also have contributed to deaths, Woolf said.
Many of the higher than normal deaths from pneumonia are most likely COVID-19 deaths that were not identified as such, especially earlier in the pandemic when coronavirus tests were scarce. Chest X-rays from the virus and pneumonia also look especially similar, experts said.
New York City, an early epicenter of the pandemic, has seen pneumonia deaths reach about 50% above normal, more than double the percentage in the states with the highest rates.
As the pandemic has progressed, coroners and medical examiners have become better at recognizing the deaths caused by the virus.
Counting deaths takes time, and many states are weeks or months behind in their reporting. The estimates from the CDC are adjusted based on how mortality data has lagged in previous years.
Woolf also warned that many people who are not captured in mortality statistics may still have adverse health outcomes.
“A person who survived the pandemic may end up deteriorating over the next few years because of problems that happened during the pandemic,” he said. This could include those who have missed routine checkups or have had delays in receiving proper treatment for an ailment.
—
METHODOLOGY
Total death numbers are estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which are based on death certificates counted by the centers and adjusted to account for typical lags in the reporting of deaths.
Only weeks in which the CDC estimates the data to be at least 90% complete or in which estimated deaths are above expected death numbers are included. Because states vary somewhat in their speed in reporting deaths to the federal government, the data show death trends for slightly different time periods. Weeks in which reported deaths were less than 50% of the CDC estimate were not included. Only jurisdictions with sufficient data were included for analysis of deaths by specific causes.
Expected deaths were calculated with a simple model based on the weekly number of deaths from previous years released by the CDC, adjusted to account for trends, like population changes, over time. Excess death numbers are rounded.

A day after President Donald Trump’s stinging defeat in the Supreme Court, Republicans around the country seemed to be having trouble finding the right words.
The bellicose statements from some quarters that had characterized the postelection period — claims of switched and missing votes, a “rigged” election and even threats of secession from Texas Republicans after the ruling on Friday — had given way to something resembling muted resignation and an acceptance of the inevitable.
Many were completely silent, even in the face of a tweet from Trump himself in which he vowed, “WE HAVE JUST BEGUN TO FIGHT!!”
Of 17 Republican attorneys general who had endorsed the case, filed by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, none agreed to be interviewed by The New York Times. Paxton, who had issued a statement calling the decision “unfortunate,” did not respond to a request for comment.
Other attorneys general who issued statements mostly seemed to acknowledge that all legal avenues had been exhausted in efforts to overturn the election results.
Mike Hunter, the Oklahoma attorney general, saw the end of the road. “The Supreme Court has ruled. The Electoral College is going to meet Monday. We’ve got to accept the results,” Hunter said in a Facebook interview in Oklahoma City. “We need to play the hand we’re dealt.”
A statement by Wayne Stenehjem, the North Dakota attorney general, echoed that. “It now appears that all reasonably arguable legal challenges have been exhausted, and the members of the Electoral College will meet across the country on Monday.”
Derek Schmidt, the Kansas attorney general, summed it up with a statement saying, “It is time to put this election behind us.”
Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, a Republican who had disagreed with the decision by his state’s attorney general to join the case, said there was no viable path forward for Trump.
“The electoral votes should be cast on Monday, and all indications are that Joe Biden will be the president-elect at that time,” Hutchinson said in a telephone interview, urging the country to move on. “It’s the tradition of our country and the history of our democracy that we do move on beyond that hard-fought election and we unite and we recognize the president-elect’s leadership.”
Hutchinson said he believed the effort led by Texas was based on a flawed legal theory, a view shared by Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, who had been among the first in her party to congratulate the president-elect on his victory. She called the court’s ruling “an unsurprising affirmation of the principle that one state cannot tell another state how to run its elections.”
On Capitol Hill, the response was particularly muted among the 126 House Republicans who signed onto an extraordinary amicus brief backing the suit. Aides to Reps. Kevin McCarthy of California and Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the party’s top leaders in the House, had no comment. And questions and requests for comments sent to the office of more than two dozen top congressional Republicans on Saturday were either declined or ignored.
Rep. Mike Johnson of Louisiana, who assembled the House’s friend of the court brief, merely posted a quote on Twitter from John Quincy Adams, implying he had done what he could: “Duty is ours, results are God’s.”
Just one lawmaker who signed on, Rep. Bruce Westerman of Arkansas, appeared newly ready to accept the president’s road had run out.
In a statement, he called the Texas suit “the best and likely last opportunity” to get the Supreme Court to rule on the election, and said the court’s decision “closed the books on the challenges to the 2020 election results.”
“The casting of electoral votes will end a hotly contested election, and we should come together as Americans to work together for the future of our country,” Westerman said, adding that Biden would be the president-elect by Monday.
Others, like Reps. Jodey Arrington of Texas and Ken Buck of Colorado, stressed that the court had not actually rejected the case based on its merits and insinuated, vaguely, that those claims could still have their day in court. But even as they pledged a continued fight, it was clear their options were dwindling.
Speaking on Fox News, Buck called for congressional hearings on election security and while discussing a pair of Senate runoffs in Georgia, indicated obliquely that he believed Biden would be president.
Another ally of the president, Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, raised the prospect of using a normally perfunctory joint session of Congress on Jan. 6 to challenge the electoral results, though most lawmakers agree that path is very likely futile.
If anything, the brushback from the Supreme Court served to highlight the divisions running through the president’s party more than a month after Election Day.
“At some point, we have to be that nation of laws,” Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., said on Fox, as he sought to instill confidence among fellow Republicans that the election had been decided fairly, and in Biden’s favor.
Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., was harsher, warning his party on Twitter against excesses like the secession talk thrown around on Friday by Texas GOP chairman Allen West or any further efforts by Republicans to stoke false hopes among their voters.
“I want to be clear: the Supreme Court is not the deep state,” Kinzinger wrote in one tweet. “The case had no merit and was dispatched 9-0. There was no win here. Complaining and bellyaching is not a manly trait, it’s actually sad. Real men accept a loss with grace.”

WASHINGTON — Incensed by a Supreme Court ruling that further dashed President Donald Trump’s hopes of invalidating his November electoral defeat, thousands of his supporters marched in Washington and several state capitals Saturday to protest what they contended, against all evidence, was a stolen election.
In some places, angry confrontations between protesters and counterprotesters escalated into violence. There were a number of scuffles in the national capital, where at least four people were stabbed, and the police declared a riot in Olympia, Washington, where one person was shot.
In videos of a clash in Olympia that were posted on social media, a single gunshot can be heard as black-clad counterprotesters move toward members of the pro-Trump group, including one person waving a large Trump flag. After the gunshot, one of the counterprotesters is seen falling to the ground, and others call for help. In one video, a man with a gun can be seen running from the scene and putting on a red hat.
Chris Loftis, a spokesman for the Washington State Patrol, said that one person was in custody in connection with the episode but that specific details about the shooting were not yet clear, including the condition of the person who was shot.
State and federal courts have rejected dozens of lawsuits by Trump’s allies seeking to challenge the election results, but the pointed refusal by the Supreme Court on Friday to hear a case filed by the attorney general of Texas loomed the largest yet. By foreclosing one of the last legal avenues Trump had to potentially block Biden from succeeding him on Inauguration Day, it left many of his partisans casting angrily about for answers.
Trump flags dotted the air above Freedom Plaza in Washington, where demonstrators — including many members of the far-right Proud Boys group — chanted “four more years!” and vowed not to recognize Joe Biden as the president-elect.
Stephanie Lalich, 55, who traveled from Baltimore to join the protest in Washington, said voting machines had been used for widespread electoral fraud — a claim that has been proved false — and that judges had not sided with Trump because they did not want to take on the issue.
“They don’t want to deal with this,” Lalich said. “It’s going to have to go nuclear, using the Insurrection Act and bringing out the military.”
One of Trump’s former national security advisers, Michael Flynn, whom Trump pardoned in November, told Trump supporters near the Supreme Court building not to “get bent out of shape” by the latest setback, assuring them that there were still ways to fight back.
“We decide the election,” he said, greeted by cheers. “We’re waging a battle across America.”
Trump flew over the protesters in Marine One on his way to attend the Army-Navy football game at West Point. Protesters erupted in cheers as the helicopter and its escort passed overhead.
Enrique Tarrio, the leader of the Proud Boys, a right-wing group known for inciting violence at protests, caused a stir earlier in the day when he posted a photograph taken at the North Portico of the White House and said he had received a “last minute invite.” Judd Deere, a White House spokesperson, said Tarrio had been part of a public tour and that no one inside the building had invited him.
At Georgia’s Statehouse in downtown Atlanta, speakers used megaphones to cast doubt on the election as American flags and Make America Great Again hats bobbed in the crowd. Across the street, a few dozen anti-Trump activists — many dressed all in black — heckled the president’s supporters.
Chris Hill, the leader of a right-wing group called the Georgia Security Force III%, rallied many of the protesters to the Statehouse. Hill said the Supreme Court had “thumbed its nose at us.” But unlike many others in attendance, he said he accepted that Trump had lost the election.
“At this point, this thing is over,” he said, adding that he was turning his focus to the two runoff races in Georgia whose outcomes will determine which party controls the U.S. Senate.
Kim Carter, who said God had told her to drive to the Atlanta rally from Jacksonville, Florida, said she was sure that Trump would be reelected. She asked a member of Hill’s group whether it could send some armed members to Florida to protect her and her neighbors from Antifa activists after the election is finally overturned, as she believes will happen.
“Four more years, because God is the one who is in control of this,” Carter said.
Pro-Trump rallies were mounted in a number of other communities around the country. More than 100 people gathered at a rally in St. Paul, Minneapolis, to display Trump flags and call on the state’s Democratic governor to loosen coronavirus restrictions in the state. In Spanish Fort, Alabama, a suburb of Mobile, about 100 people demonstrated, according to footage posted by WKRG-TV. “We want to be part of the ‘Stop the Steal’ national movement,” one speaker there said. “That’s why we’re here.”
The gunfire in Olympia, Washington, came after supporters of Trump and counterprotesters gathered near the state Capitol on Saturday afternoon. The groups had clashed before the shooting, with some people throwing objects and punches. The air on the street was clouded by smoke grenades and mace, and police in riot gear later arrived on the scene.
Both sets of protesters dispersed later in the afternoon, and a large area at the edge of the Capitol campus was roped off with crime scene tape while a police officer and other officials assessed the situation. Several vehicles, including one with a Trump sticker, remained in a parking lot at the police scene, along with a scattering of rocks and broken glass.
Clashes also broke out between opposing groups in Washington, D.C., where videos showed people clad in Proud Boys gear punching and kicking counterprotesters who were wearing helmets. The police stepped in and sprayed mace at some of the men involved in the fighting. Another video showed anti-police protesters scuffling with officers and tossing what appeared to be a wooden stick at them.
At night, at least four people were stabbed near 11th Street and F Street Northwest, according to Douglas Buchanan, a spokesman for the city’s fire department. Buchanan said they were all taken to hospitals as “priority one,” or critically injured, patients. Authorities did not provide any other details, including which groups of protesters the injured belonged to.
According to the District of Columbia mayor’s office, police arrested at least 23 people on Saturday in connection with the protests. Six were charged with assaulting police officers, 10 were charged with simple assaults, and four were charged with riotous acts, the office said in a statement late in the evening. Two police officers were injured, the mayor’s office said.
Earlier in the day, the pro-Trump crowd in Washington had appeared jubilant at times, despite the setbacks in the courts and the dwindling time remaining before Jan. 20 when Biden is due to be sworn in. They rewrote the refrain of the Van Halen song “Jump” to say, “Might as well Trump!” Others sold Trump-themed T-shirts and other items advertising his false claims of electoral fraud.
Some demonstrators were more confident than others that Trump could secure a second term despite losing the election.
Phyllis Monson, 61, who drove for several days from Tonopah, Arizona, to attend the rally, said she was not sure what steps remained available to overturn the election, but that she was convinced it had been unfair.
“This election was such a fraud,” Monson said. “There needs to be a revote.”
Luther Anderson, 30, said he had voted for former President Barack Obama and for Trump, but could not envision Biden as president. Trump has released Black people from prison through a criminal justice overhaul, he noted, while Biden contributed to the 1994 crime bill that lengthened criminal sentences for many people, many of them Black and some of whom remain imprisoned.
“The media’s trying to make him this good guy and then make Trump the villain,” said Anderson, who lives in Washington. “It’s like the media, they’re trying to, like, brainwash.”

In August 1978, shortly before the opening of negotiations between Prime Minister Menachem Begin of Israel and President Anwar Sadat of Egypt at Camp David, President Jimmy Carter paid a visit to CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia.
Halfway through a briefing on the two men, Carter interrupted. He wanted more than just their political histories. He needed, he said, to be “steeped in the personalities of Begin and Sadat.”
Stansfield Turner, the agency’s director, had just the answer: Dr. Jerrold M. Post, a CIA analyst and the founder of its Center for the Analysis of Personality and Political Behavior.
Post quickly turned around a pair of detailed “psychobiographies,” along with a report predicting how these two strong personalities would interact. The key to Begin, he concluded, was his obsession with preventing another Holocaust; Sadat, he said, wanted to outdo his predecessor, Gamal Abdel Nasser.
The summit at Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland, was a success, leading to peace between Israel and Egypt and Nobel Peace Prizes for the two leaders — an achievement that Carter later credited, in large part, to Post’s picture-perfect analysis.
“After spending 13 days with the two principals,” Carter said, “I wouldn’t change a word.”
Post died on Nov. 22 at a hospice in Washington at 83. His wife, Carolyn Post, said the cause was COVID-19.
Over 21 years at the CIA, Jerrold Post invented and then guided the field of political psychology, profiling everyone from Saddam Hussein and Ayatollah Khomeini to captured Palestinian suicide bombers, whom his associates in Israeli intelligence had allowed him to interview. Later, as an academic, he analyzed a long list of world figures, including Bill Clinton, Tony Blair, Osama bin Laden and, in his last book, President Donald Trump.
Among his many insights was that men like Saddam and Khomeini had to be understood within their cultural and historical contexts, a view that is widely accepted today but was unheard-of in the 1960s and ’70s, when Post was beginning his work.
“His argument was that just because someone is an enemy and very different from us, that doesn’t mean they are clinically insane or a madman,” said Bruce Riedel, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who worked with Post at the CIA.
Post left the agency in 1986 to establish a program in political psychology at George Washington University, where he taught until 2015. He maintained a private psychiatric practice out of his home in Bethesda, Maryland, and continued to do work for the government.
Largely unknown outside intelligence circles until the early 1990s, he saw his profile grow after his assessment of Saddam, the Iraqi leader, commissioned after he invaded Kuwait in 1990, was reported in the media. Over the next decade he appeared on television hundreds of times, discussing confounding characters foreign and domestic, including President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia and the Unabomber.
It was an experience Post seemed to relish, seeing a bit of himself in his subjects, said Eric Shaw, a clinical psychologist who was a friend of his. “He said, ‘It’s no coincidence that I study narcissistic leaders, because it takes one to know one,’” Shaw said.
Jerrold Morton Post was born on Feb. 8, 1934, in New Haven, Connecticut. His father, Jacob, sold movie reels to local theaters; his mother, Lillian (Chaikind) Post, kept the books for a shoe store.
Post put himself through Yale, graduating in 1956, and the Yale School of Medicine, graduating four years later. He completed his residency at Harvard Medical School and a two-year fellowship at St. Elizabeth’s, a psychiatric hospital in Washington.
His first wife, Sharon (Ruttenberg) Post, died in 1975. He married Carolyn Ashland in 1978.
In addition to his wife, he is survived by two daughters from his first marriage, Cynthia Post, a psychologist, and Meredith Gramlich, a disability specialist; his sister, Judith Tischler; and a stepdaughter, Kirsten Davidson.
Post was preparing for his next job, at Harvard’s McLean Hospital, when he was approached by a former medical school classmate. After a quiet lunch in Georgetown, they drove in separate cars to a rest stop on the George Washington Memorial Parkway, overlooking the Potomac River.
After having Post sign a confidentiality agreement, his friend told him that with the hair-trigger risk of nuclear war, the CIA needed better insights into the minds of leaders like the Soviet premier, Nikita Khrushchev — what the agency called “actor-specific behavioral models.”
Post dived into his assignment. He assembled a team of anthropologists, sociologists and political scientists, along with psychologists and psychiatrists, to develop profiles that, he later wrote, focused on “accurately locating the leader under study in his political, historical and cultural context.”
Their products were eagerly consumed by congressional and White House leaders, including Carter. But despite, or perhaps because of, Post’s success, he often faced opposition within the CIA from analysts who insisted that psychology offered limited insight — especially when, as was almost always the case, Post was unable to interview the subjects in person.
He also came under criticism within the psychiatric community. The American Psychiatric Association, of which he was a lifetime fellow, accused him of violating the so-called Goldwater Rule, which bars a member from publicly offering a professional opinion about someone without interviewing the person or getting that person’s consent.
To Post, such criticism was ridiculous, if not irresponsible. He believed that it was his ethical obligation to offer his insights on political figures, especially if they presented a threat to the country. Besides, he would add, he wasn’t offering Saddam medical advice.
“We have satellite photography that can zero in on the dimples on a golf ball,” he told The New Yorker, “but we can’t peer into the minds of our adversaries.”
In recent years, Post lived with renal failure and had to make weekly trips to a dialysis center. After a stroke in July left him unable to drive himself to his appointments, he took a medical taxi, which is how his daughter Cynthia believes he was infected with the coronavirus. He tested positive for COVID-19 on Nov. 15 and died in hospice care a week later.
Post, an accomplished jazz pianist and tournament bridge player, was the author of scores of medical articles and 14 books. His last book, “Dangerous Charisma: The Political Psychology of Donald Trump and His Followers,” written with Stephanie R. Doucette and published almost exactly a year before last month’s election, used the same tools he had applied to Saddam and Khomeini to analyze Trump.
Once again, Post came under fire for violating the Goldwater Rule. But he had the consolation of being right: A year before the election, he had predicted that Trump would refuse to accept defeat, and that his followers would as well.
“If Trump loses in 2020, and he chooses to call foul or tout conspiracy theories,” he wrote, “it is unclear just how extreme the reaction of some of his supporters may be.”

ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia — On a bright day in mid-November, about a dozen police officers with machine guns barged into the home of Lisanewerk Desta, a theologian who is head of the library and museum department at the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, and got to work.
The men, who had no warrant, Lisanewerk said, poured dried goods from his kitchen onto the floor, emptied his clothes drawers and even looked inside his clay coffee pot, seemingly searching for something to incriminate him. They confiscated only one item, he said: his Ethiopian identification card, which shows that he is from the Tigray ethnic group.
“I’m a scholar of the church, I’ve got nothing to be afraid of,” said Lisanewerk, who in an interview at his home shared photos and videos that his daughter had surreptitiously recorded of the raid. “But now I am under suspicion.”
Tigrayans belong to one of about eight major ethnic groups in Ethiopia, and for nearly three decades, they were the dominant force in the country’s politics. But life for many Tigrayans began to change in early November after Ethiopia’s prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, launched a military operation in the northern region of Tigray, whose leaders have resisted Abiy’s drive to centralize power in the federal government.
Nearly 50,000 Tigrayans have fled the country, in what the United Nations has called the worst exodus of refugees Ethiopia has seen in more than two decades.
Since then, many ethnic Tigrayans who live in the capital and other parts of Ethiopia say they have been treated like criminal suspects and subjected to various forms of discrimination, harassment and abuse by government officials.
They report being detained without charges, put under house arrest, and barred from traveling outside the country. Tigrayans say they have had their businesses shut down, homes ransacked and money extorted by security officials.
Several Tigrayans who live outside Ethiopia said they hadn’t heard for weeks from family members who were taken away suddenly to police stations and prisons. Some Tigrayan members of the Ethiopian military forces are being held in detention centers around the country, their families said.
The reports of ethnic profiling of Tigrayans, who represent about 6% of Ethiopia’s population of 110 million, are alarming to the delicate mix of people and power that makes up Ethiopia. The country is an uneasy confederation of 10 ethnically identified states, including Tigray, where fighting continues even though the national government has declared victory.
The moves have drawn concern from the U.N. office on genocide prevention, which said that cases of ethnic profiling constituted “a dangerous trajectory that heightens the risk of genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity.”
Ethiopia’s attorney general, Gedion Timothewos, acknowledged last month that there had been “isolated incidents” in which law enforcement agencies “acted out of line.” But he said that the government takes the issue of ethnic profiling very seriously, and that it would establish a dedicated hotline for the public to report their complaints.
“We are doing everything within our power to make sure there will not be arbitrary or discriminatory measures,” he said, adding, “This is something that the government denounced.”
While the fighting has so far been confined to the Tigray region in the north, Tigrayan civilians in other parts of the country say they are feeling the spillover effects.
The 35-year-old manager of an accounting firm — who for fear of retribution from the government asked to be identified only by his given name, Sharon, which like many Ethiopians he also uses as his surname — said that last month his house in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, was raided by security officers in plain clothes who tore open his mattress and couch and smashed his washing machine.
“The problem here now is if you have any blood from Tigray, you are being discriminated” against, Sharon, who is of mixed ethnic Tigray and Amhara heritage, said. “This kind of fight, it won’t end.”
Sharon tried to help his sister when her house, too, was raided. A few days later, he went missing, and has not been heard from since, according to his family and close friends.
For almost three decades, the Tigrayans were at the center of power in Ethiopia after they led the guerrilla war that toppled the Marxist regime that had ruled the country from the mid-1970s until 1991.
But after anti-government protests swept Abiy to power in 2018, leaders of the Tigrayan ethnic group were arrested and expelled from key positions — opening a wide gulf between the national government and the Tigray region, which is governed by the Tigray People’s Liberation Front, the party that used to exert national power.
While the government is suspicious that ethnic Tigrayans throughout Ethiopia are supporting the liberation front, many of those interviewed said they had no affiliation with the party. Others said they were former or current members, but even so, it did not make them anti-government subversives.
“I was a member for 10 years but am no longer directly involved,” said Lisanewerk.
The latest conflict has aggravated the growing political divide in Africa’s second-most-populous nation, between pro-centralization Ethiopians like Abiy and those supporting ethnic self-rule, said Yohannes Gedamu, an Ethiopian lecturer of political science at Georgia Gwinnett College, in Lawrenceville, Georgia.
The ethnocentric nature of Ethiopian politics makes “law enforcement and any criminal investigations difficult to conduct without looking at the ethnic element,” he said. “It’s saddening.”
In Addis Ababa, a state-backed condominium project sent a letter, which was seen by The New York Times, that suspended 10 Tigrayans, including drivers and site surveyors.
Security firms owned by Tigrayans have been suspended in the capital, with diplomats in three embassies confirming that, as a result, they have had to search for new security companies.
The purge is also taking place in state-owned companies like Ethio Telecom, the country’s major internet and telephone provider. In the days after the conflict began in November, officers arrived at a branch of Ethio Telecom in Addis Ababa and detained a maintenance manager and a senior director, both of Tigrayan descent, according to an employee who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.
The company’s CEO did not respond to requests for comment.
Authorities have also targeted journalists. Since the conflict began, Bekalu Alamrew, a reporter with the Awlo Media Center, an outlet owned by Tigrayans, was detained for over two weeks without being formally charged.
One accusation police leveled against him was that he was in contact with the liberation front, according to Muthoki Mumo, the sub-Saharan Africa representative for the Committee to Protect Journalists. This is “a strange allegation,” Mumo said, “given that journalists have to communicate with different political actors in order to do their jobs.” (Bekalu has since been released.)
Authorities have also recently arrested other journalists (mostly Tigrayan, but also one who was not but who reported on Tigrayan issues). And they expelled a senior analyst with International Crisis Group, a policy organization with headquarters in Brussels.
The mistreatment of Tigrayans in Ethiopia is now worrying their families who live abroad.
Mahlet Gebremedhin, 26, who lives in Baltimore, said that a cousin who owns a mattress company in Addis Ababa was arrested Nov. 19 and has not been heard from since. Authorities told another family member that his company accounts are being investigated to see whether he is aiding the Tigray People’s Liberation Front.
The conflict is also affecting ethnic Tigrayans who want to leave Ethiopia. Civil aviation authorities have started asking Ethiopian passengers leaving the country to show not just their passports, but their identity cards, which state their ethnic affiliation — according to a letter from the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission seen by the Times.
Daniel Bekele, who leads the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission, said in an interview that the commission was “alarmed by the rising number of complaints from people who have been stopped from traveling, including on work missions, for medical treatment or studies.”
After raising the issue with the government, Bekele said authorities had stopped checking travelers’ ethnic identities — even as other Tigrayans have continued to report otherwise.
Even the CEO of the national carrier, Ethiopian Airlines, who is an ethnic Tigrayan, was barred from leaving the country earlier this month, according to a pilot at the airline and a foreign diplomat who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter. The pilot said that the CEO, Tewolde Gebremariam, was prevented from boarding a flight to Paris on Nov. 8 because of his strong links to senior members of the TPLF. Tewolde could not be reached for comment.
Henok Sirak, a spokesperson for the airline, declined to comment.
There are also reports that Tigrayans are being purged from Ethiopia’s armed forces.
Yared, who also gave only his first name for fear of reprisals, said his father, a communications operator in the federal army, had traveled north to the border with Tigray with his unit on Nov. 2. But on Nov. 9, he texted that his phone was being confiscated and that he was being imprisoned. He has not heard from his father since.
Lisanewerk, the theologian, said his recent experience had dampened his faith in his own country. He said that his father had fought for his country against the military regime that was toppled in 1991, but that today, his own countrymen are treating his people as a foreign entity.
“To tell the truth, I’m not Ethiopian,” he said. “I’m Tigrayan now.”

President Donald Trump on Saturday excoriated Attorney General William Barr, castigating him on Twitter for not violating Justice Department policy to publicly reveal an investigation into President-elect Joe Biden’s son.
The critical tweets about Barr, who has largely been a close confidant to the president since he was appointed two years ago, came a day after the Supreme Court rejected a lawsuit seeking to subvert the results of the election. With the Electoral College set to meet Monday and Congress to formally tally the results in January, the prospects for Trump to change the outcome are all but gone.
The president’s statements undermining faith in the electoral process — and his assaults on institutions — have escalated since the election Nov. 3, as he enters the final weeks of his time in office. Privately, he has railed against Barr for not bolstering his false claims of widespread fraud in the election and instead affirming Biden’s victory.
His messages Saturday echoed his attacks on his first attorney general, Jeff Sessions, whom he blamed for recusing himself from overseeing the investigation into whether the Trump campaign had colluded with Russian officials in the 2016 election. For months, Trump publicly berated Sessions before firing him in November 2018, a day after the midterms.
In three tweets, Trump called the attorney general a “big disappointment” and denounced him for not disclosing the existence of an investigation into Hunter Biden for possible tax evasion, which he said would have given Republicans an edge in the election. Doing so would have violated department guidelines about publicly discussing ongoing cases. Trump benefited from that policy himself in 2016, when officials kept quiet the inquiry into possible conspiracy between his campaign and Russian officials.
“Why didn’t Bill Barr reveal the truth to the public, before the Election, about Hunter Biden. Joe was lying on the debate stage that nothing was wrong, or going on - Press confirmed. Big disadvantage for Republicans at the polls!” Trump wrote.
The president has told aides he would like to see Barr appoint a special counsel to investigate the younger Biden, according to people briefed on the discussions. He has not expressed that desire directly to Barr, according to a person familiar with the conversations, but has instead let the issue become public in the hope of creating a pressure campaign.
Barr is so far unlikely to appoint such a special prosecutor, according to people familiar with the thinking. The question remains whether Trump will succeed in forcing him to resign or will fire him so he can appoint someone willing to do the president’s personal bidding.
The president’s interest in appointing a special counsel was earlier reported by The Wall Street Journal.
A spokeswoman for the Justice Department declined to comment on the president’s tweets.
Trump did not answer questions from reporters as he left the White House around noon to travel to West Point for the annual Army-Navy football game Saturday. He has mostly stayed out of sight since Election Day, taking few questions from journalists and attending only a handful of public events.
Last Sunday, The New York Times reported that Barr was considering resigning before the end of the term, a decision that he had been weighing for weeks. The attorney general was convinced that Trump had lost the election, believed his work at the Justice Department was completed and wanted to avoid the controversy that often comes at the end of an administration.
In response to the reporting, some Republicans lobbied Barr to reconsider his plans, and the attorney general let the White House know that he intended to stay through the end of the term.
After Hunter Biden disclosed Wednesday that the Justice Department was investigating his taxes, the president’s anger toward his attorney general grew.
Barr has long been considered a close ally of the president. His public summary of the lengthy report by Robert Mueller, the special counsel who was appointed to investigate Russian interference, cast the contents in a favorable light for Trump, drawing protests from Mueller himself.
Barr also worked with the White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, to publicly release the transcript of the call that Trump had with the president of Ukraine in July 2019. In that call, the president — who was withholding congressionally approved military aid to Ukraine — pushed for investigations into the Bidens.
But their relationship has come under strain this year, with the president and Barr speaking infrequently. In February, as Trump widened his attacks on law enforcement, Barr publicly rebuked the president, saying that Trump’s tweets had made it “impossible” for him to do his job.
In the weeks after the election, Barr refused to refute Trump’s specious claims of widespread voter fraud. But this month, after Trump raised the prospect that the Justice Department and FBI may have been involved in tipping the election to Biden, Barr broke his silence. In an interview with The Associated Press, Barr said that he saw no examples of widespread voter fraud that could have meaningfully affected the election.
Those comments angered Trump, who has been searching for anyone to help push the notion that the election was stolen from him.
Days before the election, the Justice Department announced that Barr had appointed a top federal prosecutor as a special counsel to examine how the FBI and intelligence agencies investigated the ties between Trump’s campaign and Russia.
The announcement miffed Trump, who had wanted Barr to make public such a disclosure before the election, when Trump could have weaponized it on the campaign trail, as he did with the federal investigation into Hillary Clinton’s email server and the release of stolen emails from her campaign chairman aired publicly through WikiLeaks.
Also in Washington on Saturday, a small group of the president’s supporters joined a “Stop the Steal” march. Among those present was Enrique Tarrio, a leader of the far-right group the Proud Boys who also led a “Latinos for Trump” effort during the presidential campaign.
On the social media site Parler, Tarrio posted pictures of himself at the White House and said he had a “last-minute” invitation. Judd Deere, a spokesman for the White House, said Tarrio “was on a public White House Christmas tour” but did not meet with the president, nor had the White House invited him.

An Epic Israeli TV Drama Exposes War Wounds Old and New

JERUSALEM — A new Israeli television series based on true events from the 1973 war, when the country was caught off guard on the holiest day of the Jewish calendar and feared total destruction, has prompted an intense public reckoning with the scope of war trauma and the treatment of survivors.
The high-impact series pried open a collective national wound and led to a cathartic outpouring of emotion. It also exposed a younger generation to the battlefield sacrifices and the shocking failures of leadership that led to the surprise concerted Arab attack on Yom Kippur, led by the Egyptian and Syrian armies. The period is so painful that Israeli culture has rarely dared to grapple with it.
“This was our worst trauma and our worst disaster as a country,” said Ron Leshem, who co-created the series together with Amit Cohen, both veterans of the Israeli military’s elite 8200 intelligence unit. “For 47 years, people had the feeling this was a forgotten war and that they would end their lives without anyone knowing their stories,” Leshem added. “We knew we had an awful responsibility.”
The series, aired by the Israeli public broadcaster Kan, was 10 years in the making with a multimillion-dollar budget far exceeding those of typical Israeli productions. It featured heart-stopping recreations of epic tank battles in their original locations in the Golan Heights, which Israel had seized from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war. In 1973, the Syrians attacked from the north and the Egyptians from the south.
“Valley of Tears” harks back to a nostalgic moment when crisis forged a sense of social solidarity, a theme that seemed to resonate all the more amid the current leadership in crisis in Israel and the ever-present fear of a confrontation with Iran or its proxies in the region. Filming for the series had to stop for a few weeks because of rocket fire from across the Syrian frontier.
For Imri Biton, 35, an actor and himself a former combat soldier, the fictional drama mirrored his own reality. During his conversations with Israeli veterans of the 1973 war as he prepared for his role in “Valley of Tears,” the veterans spoke of flashbacks, nightmares, depression and anxiety attacks. It dawned on him that he, too, was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.
“Suddenly I understood I had become a more closed person,” he said, recalling his own experiences in the 2006 war in Lebanon. “I had outbursts. I couldn’t control my anger.”
His delayed reaction and personal awakening have been playing out on a national scale in the conversation surrounding the series.
Nearly 2,700 Israeli soldiers died in the 19-day war and thousands were injured out of a population of about 3 million at the time.
The series was titled “Sha’at Neilah” in Hebrew, or closing hour, a reference to the final prayer of the Yom Kippur fast, when Jewish tradition holds that people’s fates for the coming year are sealed as the gates of heaven close. As the series drew to a close this week, Kan reported that it had gotten more than 7.5 million views on its television channel and digital platform.
Tapping into the universal themes of war, the series is also streaming internationally on HBO Max.
Along with the praise, the series generated criticism from some veterans who took issue with historical inaccuracies — artistic license, according to the creators. Others found it too hard to watch. And some complained that it showed Israel at its weakest, though the country was ultimately victorious.
The director, Yaron Zilberman, prepared for the expected impact by suggesting that the production team work closely with Natal, a leading Israeli organization treating victims of trauma from wars and terrorist attacks, which saw a steep rise in calls to its help lines.
Each episode was followed by a gentle panel discussion where real-life combatants and their families related their experiences, ending with a calming song from the period.
Still, the public reaction was far beyond what anybody had anticipated.
“The more the series advanced, the more jolting and rousing it became,” said Hanna Himmi, the director of the clinical unit at Natal and a lecturer at the Beit Berl College in central Israel. She described it as a “complicated gift” because it both reopened painful wounds and raised awareness and empathy.
Israelis of all ages shared personal or family anecdotes via a dedicated Facebook page with more than 40,000 members. Leshem wrote that it would live on after the series as a “breathing digital archive.”
Families took trips to the battle sites. Teenagers began researching the 1973 war online. Grandparents told their stories for the first time.
If there was an element of shame attached to acknowledging war trauma in the macho era of the 1970s, that became less the case in subsequent wars. Israel has been the stronger side in its wars in Lebanon and Gaza, where the extent of death, destruction and the accompanying trauma has been broader.
But experts say the Ministry of Defense officially recognizes 10 to 15% of Israel’s soldiers returning from the wars as post traumatic, while many more are less severely affected or undiagnosed.
Biton, the actor, plays Alush, an aspiring officer who gets captured by the Syrians. But his own realization came more than a decade after he had helped evacuate dead comrades under fire in southern Lebanon — a personal experience he shared at a parliamentary hearing on war trauma.
“It all came flooding up,” he said. “The series awakened the demons.”
Lawmakers are proposing legislation to cut the time it takes for the Ministry of Defense to process trauma victims and offer treatment.
“It can take five, seven or even 10 years,” said Roni Sassover, who runs one of about a dozen Israeli nongovernmental organizations helping with those suffering from war trauma. “These are fighters, mega patriots who gave their all for the state.”
The awakening also comes as many such organizations are seeing drops in funding and donations because of the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. One program, Soul Key, treats dozens of post-traumatic military veterans through music in conjunction with the Israeli Conservatory for Music in Tel Aviv.
“Music is a therapy that exists in nature,” said Ifat Grinwald-Cohen, a clinical psychologist who founded the program and was herself injured in an army training accident in 1992. “It’s nonjudgmental, it’s kind to people,” she added.
For many, the post-traumatic journey is long.
Mishael Behrend, 67, a member of the Soul Key program, vividly recalled the horrors of fighting in the Sinai Desert in the 1973 war, where he lost a leg. His trauma suddenly emerged about 15 years ago, after his children had grown and left the house.
“Perhaps once the responsibility was lifted, the defenses I’d built fell,” he said. He said he suffered from anxiety attacks, depression and pain. “I couldn’t go into a wedding hall,” he said. “I would arrive, leave a gift and go home. Or a shopping mall. I’d hear noise and I’d flee.”
Another member of the program, Avihai Hollender, 28, fought with an elite commando unit in one of the fiercest and deadliest battles of the 2014 Gaza war. About two years ago, after his son, Ari, was born, he said, the realization that he could be hurting those around him with his anger led him to seek help.
To kick off a fundraising campaign for Soul Key, he wrote a song about living with post trauma called “Father Can’t Find Peace.” Though he had avoided watching “Valley of Tears,” he was chosen to perform his song on television at the end of the wrenching, final episode.
“The shrapnel did not pierce my body,” he sang, “only my soul.”

Texto completo: If one of the biggest names in cybersecurity can be breached, what chance does an average person stand against hackers?
That's a likely question after high-profile cybersecurity firm FireEye earlier this week said hackers breached its network and stole the toolkit it uses to probe customers' systems to find weaknesses.
The hack was conducted "by a nation with top-tier offensive capabilities," FireEye CEO Kevin Mandia said Tuesday in a blog post. The company is investigating the incident, as is the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and companies such as Microsoft.
Mandia said there is no sign that the hackers have used the stolen tools, nor is there evidence that customer information was stolen, Mandia said. FireEye has developed more than 300 countermeasures against the tools for use by customers and the cybersecurity community.
Google: Ouster of of top AI researcher draws sharp new scrutiny of how it treats Black employees
Disney+: Streaming service has a $1 price increase to $7.99 coming in March
The hackers “primarily sought information related to certain government customers,” Mandia said in the statement, without naming them.
Milpitas, California-based FireEye, which is publicly traded, has more than 9,600 customers globally including more than 1,000 government and law enforcement agencies.
A major global cybersecurity player, the firm in the past responded to breaches at Sony and Equifax and helped Saudi Arabia thwart an oil industry cyberattack.
Russian spies likely culprit in breach
The cybersecurity company did not identify a culprit, but the Russian SVR intelligence service is thought to have committed the breach, The Washington Post reported. This is the same Russian spy agency who in 2015 hacked the Democratic National Committee and have been accused of attempting to steal COVID-19 vaccine research data, The Post reported.
“Preliminary indications show an actor with a high level of sophistication consistent with a nation-state,” said Matt Gorham, assistant director of the FBI’s cyber division told The Post.
The hack was the biggest blow to the U.S. cybersecurity community since a mysterious group known as the “Shadow Brokers” in 2016 released a trove of high-level hacking tools stolen from the National Security Agency.
How did this happen?
Hacks will happen, especially with increased activity by bad actors' during the coronavirus pandemic.
FireEye's Mandia said that this attack is different in that "the attackers tailored their world-class capabilities specifically to target and attack FireEye. ... They operated clandestinely, using methods that counter security tools and forensic examination. They used a novel combination of techniques not witnessed by us or our partners in the past."
Among the tools the hackers got were techniques known as "domain fronting," the common use of popular brands' domains including, in this case, Microsoft, The New York Times and USA TODAY.
The strategy here is that hackers assume that networks won't deny access to heavily trafficked sites. So, for instance, an email addressed from usatoday.com or nytimes.com and carrying malware could infiltrate and infect a network.
FireEye's exercises, conducted by its "Red Team," would send internet traffic to disguised as coming from The New York Times or USA TODAY but never "actually went through the domains of either of those companies," the company said in a statement to USA TODAY.
"We did not seek permission from the news outlets beforehand, nor would we normally seek permission for this kind of use, because we're not using or sending traffic to their actual infrastructure or using their brands in commerce. It's only the narrow targeting of specific users at our customer for the purpose of security assessment," FireEye said. "We have been in communication with both the New York Times and USA Today following Tuesday’s announcement, and advised them of our use of this specific tool.
Other recent spoofed brands used in ransomware attacks include Amazon, Apple, UPS and Zoom.
How big a deal is it?
This is not the first time a cybersecurity firm has been targeted and the results "can have a long-term effect on organizations worldwide," said Ilia Sotnikov, vice president of product management at cybersecurity software provider Netwrix. "This attack can also make advanced attacking tools and techniques available to wider population of less sophisticated cybercriminals."
Companies' cybersecurity teams should "immediately take advantage of countermeasures offered by FireEye" and be on the alert for additional security updates, he said. "This attack is another evidence that a motivated hacker will be able to compromise any organization, no matter how well it is protected. Our new normal right now is to be open about a data breach and own the message as FireEye did."
FireEye's "actions have been commendable," tweeted Grady Summers, executive vice president for products for identity security software provider SailPoint. Summers, who previously worked at FireEye, responded to online criticism directed at FireEye in a thread of tweets.
"I think it would be justifiable to say that this breach – if never made public – would not have met the threshold for reporting due to adverse financial impact," Summers said. "I believe that FireEye did this because their leadership team, starting with Kevin, is ethical in their DNA – and they care more about customers and the community more than they care about short-term impact to the stock price."
And the breach won't likely hurt FireEye's competitiveness, he said. "They will rebuild their toolset and not miss a beat."
What are average folks to do?
The good news for the average person is that any threat to them is low – be happy you are a small fish in a big cyber sea – but the threat to companies or government entities where they work is higher.
Since more Americans began working at home during the coronavirus pandemic, the likelihood of internal actions – including accidental lapses – has lead to an increase in cyber security incidents, Netwrix found.
While working, employees should remember to follow corporate cybersecurity advisories. "These tools primarily exploit corporate systems, but it is a good reminder for everyone to make sure they are keeping their personal devices, apps, and software up to date," said Jerry Gamblin, director of security research at Kenna Security, which helps companies monitor and manage cyber risks.
"This would include downloading and installing updates for the phones, tablets, and computers that every member of your family uses," Gamblin said.
People should focus on cybersecurity, especially in making strong passwords and not using them across different services, Microsoft said in a September report citing more sophisticated phishing campaigns.
"If you have a device with a password, then you must assume it has – or will be – compromised at some point," said Nate Fick, general manager for data security firm Elastic .
Users should change passwords regularly – do not use the same one for multiple accounts – and opt-in on multi-factor authentication, which usually sends you a text or email to log in, he said.
"Every consumer should be concerned when they read about a widespread security breach, especially one where the perpetrator is identified as a nation-state and where the target has sophisticated defenses, as in this case," Fick said. "A common philosophy among security professionals is to assume a state of compromise, and then act accordingly."

Resumen: The viral list of America's eight deadliest days, purporting the first four days of December made up half the list, is partly false.

Texto completo: Claim: First 4 days of December were among the 8 deadliest days in American history due to COVID-19 deaths
An infographic that's gone viral suggests the first four days of December comprise half of the eight deadliest days in American history. But while the events listed did indeed take a terrible toll, other more deadly events were omitted.
According to the infographic, the number of coronavirus deaths on Dec. 1-4 fall only behind the Galveston Hurricane in 1900; the Battle of Antietam in 1862; and Sept. 11, 2001.
The figures appear to have first been compiled by Twitter user @Sundae_Gurl on Dec. 8 and later amplified by long-standing politics blog Political Wire on Dec. 9.
The Oklahoma Source also posted the graph, which has over 500 shares, to Facebook on Dec. 8. USA TODAY reached out to the page for comment.
.
America's deadliest days
Given that the infographic lists events and not dates, it's reasonable to assume it's attempting to rank the highest death tolls caused by a specific event or cause that took place on a single day. The events on the infographic are certainly among America's deadliest, but the list omits several one-day events and causes that saw higher death counts than those of Dec. 1-4.
Here's the ranking, based on USA TODAY's findings, as of Dec. 8, the date the list appears to have first been shared.
1. Galveston Hurricane – 8,000 deaths
A Category 4 storm swept through the Caribbean and Florida in 1900, making landfall on Sept. 8 in Galveston, Texas, according to a U.S. Census Bureau report. The deadly combination of the hurricane's surge and winds up to 145 mph killed an estimated 8,000 people — about 20% of the city's population.
2. Battle of Antietam – 3,650 deaths
In the bloodiest one-day battle of the Civil War, the Union army lost approximately 2,100 soldiers and the Confederate army lost about 1,550, totaling about 3,650 deaths, according to the National Park Service. An estimated 19,070 more soldiers combined were wounded, missing or captured. The NPS noted that the "catastrophic nature" of the Battle of Antietam makes it "virtually impossible" to compile the exact number of casualties; its data is from the Official Records of the War of the Rebellion and the Antietam Battlefield Board.
3. San Francisco earthquake – 3,000 deaths
On the morning of April 18, 1906, an earthquake that lasted less than a minute devastated San Francisco, according to the National Archives. An estimated 3,000 people were killed and nearly half the city's population was left homeless.
4. Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks – 2,977 deaths
A series of terrorist attacks orchestrated by al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden killed a total of 2,977 people on Sept. 11, 2001. When the World Trade Center collapsed after hijacked planes crashed into the twin towers, 2,753 people were killed, according to the New York City Office of Chief Medical Examiner. Following the initial attack, 343 New York City firefighters, 23 New York City police officers and 37 Port Authority officers perished, CNN reported. At the Pentagon in Washington, 183 people were killed after another hijacked plane flew into that building. And 40 passengers and crew members aboard another hijacked plane died after it crashed into a field in Pennsylvania, the theory being that those individuals attempted to retake control of the flight so that it would not reach its intended target.
5. Dec. 3, COVID-19 – 2,879 deaths
6. Dec. 2, COVID-19 – 2,804 deaths
7. Dec. 4, COVID-19 – 2,607 deaths
8. April 15, COVID-19 – 2,603 deaths
According to data from Johns Hopkins University, the above figures represent the number of individuals who died from COVID-19 on those dates, three of which occurred during the first four days of December.
It's important to note that COVID-19 data varies on different sites. According to the New York Times death tally, the deadliest days due to COVID-19 at the time the list was made were April 15 (2,752), May 6 (2,708) and April 14 (2,705).
Other possible contenders
Taegan Goddard, founder of Political Wire, told USA TODAY that the list is not intended to be complete.
"Instead, it should be used to compare the daily deaths from the pandemic to some of the more tragic days in our country’s history," Goddard said.
There are a number of other events with lower death counts that might bump Dec. 2-4 off the list of America's deadliest days with more information.
On Sept. 16, 1928, a hurricane hit Lake Okeechobee in Florida, filling it to the brim and crumbling its dikes. The farmlands around it flooded, leading to the deaths of an estimated 2,500 people, according to a report by the National Weather Service and the National Hurricane Center. But the report notes that the death toll could be as high as 3,000 people.
The 1918 flu pandemic is also worth noting. There is no data available of daily death counts, but the U.S. Census Bureau kept records of how many deaths occurred in the year 1918; 79.8% of the deaths occurred in "the last four months of the year," according to its records. With 477,467 total deaths that year, that's 381,019 deaths in the last four months – an average of 3,123 per day.
The San Ciriaco Hurricane barreled across the island of Puerto Rico in 1899, killing an estimated 3,300 people in six to nine hours, according to New York City archives. Whether this event counts as a U.S. tragedy depends on the perception of when the island became a U.S. possession. Spain ceded Puerto Rico to the U.S. in 1898 under the Treaty of Paris – a year before the hurricane – but it was not officially made a U.S. territory until 1917, when its people became U.S. citizens, according to the Library of Congress.
And, there were a number of battles on U.S. soil that could have surpassed the list's tally if deaths per day were recorded. The 1863 Battle of Gettysburg, for example, lasted three days and resulted in 7,058 deaths of Union and Confederate soldiers combined.That averages about 2,352 deaths per day, but it's unlikely an equal amount of soldiers died each day.
COVID-19 deaths may soon surpass several deadliest days
It's also important to note that because the list seemingly began circulating on Dec. 8, the list of deadliest days does not include more recent dates. But as the daily COVID-19 death toll continues to rise, it's possible that future dates will override this list.
For example, the U.S. recorded 3,124 COVID-19 deaths on Dec. 9, according to Johns Hopkins. That figure bumps Wednesday to the third single deadliest day on the list.
Our rating: Partly false
We rate the claim that this list shows Dec. 1-4 as half of the eight deadliest days in U.S. history as PARTLY FALSE because some of it was not supported by our research. The events on the infographic are certainly among America's deadliest, but the list omits several key one-day events that saw higher death counts than those of Dec. 1-4.

Prosecutors interview Trump's bank, insurer as NY probe ramps up

Texto completo: State prosecutors in Manhattan have interviewed several employees of President Donald Trump's bank and insurance broker in recent weeks, according to people with knowledge of the matter, escalating an investigation into the president that he is powerless to stop.
The interviews with people who work for the lender, Deutsche Bank, and the insurance brokerage, Aon, are the latest indication that once Trump leaves office, he faces the potential threat of criminal charges that would be beyond the reach of federal pardons.
It remains unclear whether the office of the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus Vance Jr., will ultimately bring charges. The prosecutors have been fighting in court for more than a year to obtain Trump's personal and corporate tax returns, which they have called central to their investigation. The issue now rests with the Supreme Court.
But lately, Vance's office has stepped up its efforts, issuing new subpoenas and questioning witnesses, including some before a grand jury, according to the people with knowledge of the matter, who requested anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the investigation.
The grand jury appears to be serving an investigative function, allowing prosecutors to authenticate documents and pursue other leads, rather than considering any charges.
When Trump returns to private life in January, he will lose the protection from criminal prosecution that his office has afforded him. While The New York Times has reported that he discussed granting preemptive pardons to his eldest children before leaving office -- and has claimed he has the power to pardon himself -- that authority applies only to federal crimes, and not to state or local investigations like the one being conducted by Vance's office.
The investigation by Vance, a Democrat, has focused on Trump's conduct as a private business owner and whether he or employees at his family business, the Trump Organization, committed financial crimes.

Person of the Year: Time magazine has named President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris its "Person of the Year."
Time's Editor-in-Chief Edward Felsenthal says Biden and Harris won the honor for "changing the American story, for showing that the forces of empathy are greater than the furies of division, for sharing a vision of healing in a grieving world."
Felsenthal notes, "Every elected President since FDR has at some point during his term been a Person of the Year, nearly a dozen of those in a presidential election year. This is the first time we have included a Vice President."

Museums blocked: A lone senator from Utah has singlehandedly blocked the bipartisan approval of two new national museums to honor American Latinos and women, arguing that "last thing we need is to further divide an already divided nation."
Republican Sen. Mike Lee objected Thursday to the creation of the two proposed Smithsonian museums, stalling two projects that have been in the making for decades and enjoy broad bipartisan support. Senate approval would have sent the legislation approving the Latino museum to President Donald Trump for his signature. The Senate was attempting to pass the measures by voice vote, which requires every senator's consent.
The dispute on the Senate floor came amid the impasse over a new coronavirus relief bill and highlighted the difficulty of achieving even widely supported goals in the polarized Congress. Lawmakers could still find a way to move forward on the creation of the museums, including by adding the bills to a must-pass spending package, but doing so could further complicate passage of that legislation.

Argentina abortion bill passes: Lawmakers in Argentina's lower house passed a bill Friday that would legalize abortion in most cases, a proposal from President Alberto Fernandez in response to long-sought demands from women's rights activists.
The bill, which needs approval from the country's Senate in a debate expected before the end of the year, allows for voluntary abortions to be carried out up to the 14th week of pregnancy.
The proposed law was approved in a 131-117 vote with six abstentions after a marathon debate that extended from Thursday into the early hours of Friday.
Demonstrators in favor of decriminalizing abortion, who had spent the night outside the congress building in Buenos Aires, erupted with joy and embraced each other as they listened to the parliamentary speaker reading the vote's results on screens.
Hundreds of yards away, not far from the parliament building, hundreds of opponents dressed in light blue and carrying the national flag deplored the result, with some shedding tears.

Media tycoon charged: Hong Kong pro-democracy activist and media tycoon Jimmy Lai has been charged under the city's national security law, amid a widening crackdown on dissent, according to local media reports.
Lai, who founded the Apple Daily tabloid, was charged on suspicion of colluding with foreign forces and endangering national security, local broadcaster TVB reported Friday.
He is the most high-profile person out of more than two dozen charged under the law since it was implemented in June.
Lai is scheduled to appear in court Saturday and could face a maximum punishment of life imprisonment.

Actions against porn site: Mastercard and Visa said Thursday they would block their customers from using the credit cards to make purchases on Pornhub following accusations the pornographic website showed videos of rape and underage sex.
They reacted following an investigation by opinion columnist Nicholas Kristof of The New York Times that also alleged the site depicts revenge pornography and video taken without the consent of participants.
Mastercard said it is terminating use of its cards on Pornhub after its own investigation confirmed violations of standards prohibiting unlawful conduct on the site. Mastercard said it also investigating other websites for potential illegal content.
Pornhub, in a statement, called the actions "exceptionally disappointing." Earlier this week, the company announced steps to protect against images of abuse, nonconsensual activity and underage models on the site, including a ban on unverified users uploading material.
"This news is crushing for the hundreds of thousands of models who rely on our platform for their livelihoods," Pornhub said.

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
NEW YORK — About a half-dozen people stand in a Manhattan street around a black BMW sedan. At least one slaps a hand onto one of the car’s windows as the vehicle edges through the group.
Suddenly, the driver hits the accelerator, and the car surges forward, knocking pedestrians to the pavement as it speeds through the next intersection. It hits more people, some of them on bicycles, with a loud crunch before racing off into the distance.
“Did someone get the license plate?” a woman yells as other people rush to attend to those on the ground.
The scene, shown in video snippets posted on Twitter, unfolded around 4 p.m. Friday when a crowd marching to support Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainees who are on a hunger strike encountered the car on Third Avenue.
The collisions left six people injured, and the 52-year-old woman who was driving the car was in custody being questioned late Friday, police said. Neither she nor a female passenger, 29, were identified, and it was unclear whether the driver would be charged, police said.
The episode was the latest in a series of such altercations between drivers and protesters in New York City and elsewhere in America this year, as some motorists respond to street-blocking demonstrators by plowing through them, not always with legal consequences.
Sofia Vickerman, a first-year student at New York University, said she had been in a larger pack of protesters near the intersection of Third Avenue and 39th Street when she heard organizers scream a warning.
“Bodies were in the air, and bikes were flying,” Vickerman, 18, said.
Christian Resseguie said he had been in the crowd chanting, “Free them all, free them now” just before he heard a car speeding up behind him. The next thing he knew, he said, protesters were strewn all around the intersection.
“I saw lacerations, broken bones,” Resseguie, a civil rights lawyer, said. Those who bore the brunt of the crash were bicyclists who were handling traffic control at the march, he said.
The six people who were struck were being treated at nearby hospitals, police said; none had life-threatening injuries. The driver and her passenger were at a local precinct house, police said.
A second video posted online, shot from a different angle near the intersection, shows the car careening through protesters on bicycles and knocking several to the ground.
A third video posted online by a bystander showed a red-haired woman being taken into custody at the scene by police as demonstrators shouted at her from the sidewalk.
One protester, a woman, was also taken into custody for interfering with emergency medical workers as they tried to help one of the victims, police said. She faced a charge of obstructing governmental administration, police said.
The march Friday was one of a number of local protests meant to call attention to the detainees, who are being held in New Jersey by Immigration and Custom Enforcement, or ICE, and who have been on a hunger strike for nearly a month, Patch reported.
ICE officials did not respond to a request for comment.
The Manhattan protest started in Times Square before making its way downtown with police officers on bicycles trailing behind, Vickerman said. She added that she had not seen or heard the driver who hit the protesters show signs of aggression before plowing into them.
The episode resembled several previous confrontations that have flared up in the city’s streets since the killing of George Floyd in May unleashed a wave of protests against police brutality and systemic racism.
In September, a counterprotester drove a Ford Taurus into a dense Black Lives Matter protest in Times Square. The driver was not charged, The Daily News reported. In July, a driver in an SUV struck bicycle-mounted protesters on 42nd Street. He, too, was not charged, according to Gothamist. In June, police arrested a man in Brooklyn after he drove over at least one person when protesters on bicycles encircled his car.
In addition, during the early days of the protests in May, two police vehicles drove into a crowd of protesters in Brooklyn, sending people sprawling across the street. Mayor Bill de Blasio and Dermot F. Shea, the police commissioner, expressed concerns about the incident but also defended it as an appropriate use of force under the circumstances.
Resseguie, who described himself as a veteran activist, said he was not surprised by the incident considering recent history. But he added that it would not have a chilling effect.
“This isn’t going to dissuade me from continuing to demonstrate and to show up for my community,” he said.

Bad math puts spotlight on Fort Thomas hospital

Texto completo: Jaws dropped Thursday at St. Elizabeth Healthcare when leaders saw the Fort Thomas hospital listed in the New York Times as one of the busiest COVID-19 care centers in the nation.
St. Elizabeth's main COVID-19 facility, its Fort Thomas hospital, has been busy, the leaders said, but not as busy as that, and they went on the hunt for the mistake.
"When we're living and breathing these numbers by the hour, you know that there was an error there," said Vera Hall, St. Elizabeth's chief nursing executive. "When you hit the New York Times, you stop and drop everything."
Hall and other St. Elizabeth officials pinned the problem on the Kentucky Hospital Association, but a KHA official said the culprit was a coding bug in the computers of the Kentucky Department of Public Health. That agency is compiling bed capacity data across the commonwealth and reporting it to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
Hall said the mistake was not St. Elizabeth's but "a double counting" at the KHA that added the total number of COVID-19 patients at Fort Thomas than the average for the week of Nov. 27 – 145 – and the number of the facility's negative-pressure rooms, which was 100, and came up with 224.
That's the number released Monday when the federal government initially made its bed capacity data public. The Times then analyzed the data to create lists of the nation's most overtaxed intensive-care units that were published Thursday. Fort Thomas came in fourth among larger-population centers, which came as a surprise to Hall and other Fort Thomas officials.
"I know that data is kind of a hot spot, how accurate is the data?" Hall said. "We don't want to further continue the suspicion that the numbers are inflated. But even so, 145 patients – that's a lot of patients."
At the KHA, Melanie Moch, vice president of of data and health information services, said the source of the problem was not at the KHA, although she understood how the St. Elizabeth officials would think so. The trade association has been working with the state health department to push hospitals to report their bed capacity daily.
"I'm on all the Zoom calls with them, so I can see how they would think it's us," Moch said, but the KHA is not handling the data. The association discovered that earlier this week, St. Elizabeth updated their number, which triggered a coding bug to double-count the Fort Thomas census.
Moch said the health department and the Kentucky Department of Emergency Management went through the coding Thursday and the problem shouldn't happen again.
In August, the Trump administration directed hospitals to stop sending the information to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and instead send it to HHS.
Dr. James Horn, St. Elizabeth's chief quality officer and an emergency doctors, said more patients are seeking care now than on Nov. 27. As of Thursday, the system had 170 patients with COVID-19, and some are getting treated at St. Elizabeth Florence.

Prosecutors interview Trump's bank, insurer as NY probe ramps up NEWS BRIEFING

Texto completo: State prosecutors in Manhattan have interviewed several employees of President Donald Trump's bank and insurance broker in recent weeks, according to people with knowledge of the matter, escalating an investigation into the president that he is powerless to stop.
The interviews with people who work for the lender, Deutsche Bank, and the insurance brokerage, Aon, are the latest indication that once Trump leaves office, he faces the potential threat of criminal charges that would be beyond the reach of federal pardons.
It remains unclear whether the office of the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus Vance Jr., will ultimately bring charges. The prosecutors have been fighting in court for more than a year to obtain Trump's personal and corporate tax returns, which they have called central to their investigation. The issue now rests with the Supreme Court.
But lately, Vance's office has stepped up its efforts, issuing new subpoenas and questioning witnesses, including some before a grand jury, according to the people with knowledge of the matter, who requested anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the investigation.
The grand jury appears to be serving an investigative function, allowing prosecutors to authenticate documents and pursue other leads, rather than considering any charges.
When Trump returns to private life in January, he will lose the protection from criminal prosecution that his office has afforded him. While The New York Times has reported that he discussed granting preemptive pardons to his eldest children before leaving office - and has claimed he has the power to pardon himself - that authority applies only to federal crimes, and not to state or local investigations like the one being conducted by Vance's office.
The investigation by Vance, a Democrat, has focused on Trump's conduct as a private business owner and whether he or employees at his family business, the Trump Organization, committed financial crimes.
Person of the Year: Time magazine has named President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris its "Person of the Year."
Time's Editor-in-Chief Edward Felsenthal says Biden and Harris won the honor for "changing the American story, for showing that the forces of empathy are greater than the furies of division, for sharing a vision of healing in a grieving world."
Felsenthal notes, "Every elected President since FDR has at some point during his term been a Person of the Year, nearly a dozen of those in a presidential election year. This is the first time we have included a Vice President."
Museums blocked: A lone senator from Utah has singlehandedly blocked the bipartisan approval of two new national museums to honor American Latinos and women, arguing that "last thing we need is to further divide an already divided nation."
Republican Sen. Mike Lee objected Thursday to the creation of the two proposed Smithsonian museums, stalling two projects that have been in the making for decades and enjoy broad bipartisan support. Senate approval would have sent the legislation approving the Latino museum to President Donald Trump for his signature. The Senate was attempting to pass the measures by voice vote, which requires every senator's consent. The dispute on the Senate floor came amid the impasse over a new coronavirus relief bill and highlighted the difficulty of achieving even widely supported goals in the polarized Congress. Lawmakers could still find a way to move forward on the creation of the museums, including by adding the bills to a must-pass spending package, but doing so could further complicate passage of that legislation.
Argentina abortion bill passes: Lawmakers in Argentina's lower house passed a bill Friday that would legalize abortion in most cases, a proposal from President Alberto Fernandez in response to long-sought demands from women's rights activists.
The bill, which needs approval from the country's Senate in a debate expected before the end of the year, allows for voluntary abortions to be carried out up to the 14th week of pregnancy.
The proposed law was approved in a 131-117 vote with six abstentions after a marathon debate that extended from Thursday into the early hours of Friday. Demonstrators in favor of decriminalizing abortion, who had spent the night outside the congress building in Buenos Aires, erupted with joy and embraced each other as they listened to the parliamentary speaker reading the vote's results on screens.
Hundreds of yards away, not far from the parliament building, hundreds of opponents dressed in light blue and carrying the national flag deplored the result, with some shedding tears.
Media tycoon charged: Hong Kong pro-democracy activist and media tycoon Jimmy Lai has been charged under the city's national security law, amid a widening crackdown on dissent, according to local media reports.
Lai, who founded the Apple Daily tabloid, was charged on suspicion of colluding with foreign forces and endangering national security, local broadcaster TVB reported Friday. He is the most high-profile person out of more than two dozen charged under the law since it was implemented in June.
Lai is scheduled to appear in court Saturday and could face a maximum punishment of life imprisonment.

Texto completo: State prosecutors in Manhattan have interviewed several employees of President Donald Trump's bank and insurance broker in recent weeks, according to people with knowledge of the matter, escalating an investigation into the president that he is powerless to stop.
The interviews with people who work for the lender, Deutsche Bank, and the insurance brokerage, Aon, are the latest indication that once Trump leaves office, he faces the potential threat of criminal charges that would be beyond the reach of federal pardons.
It remains unclear whether the office of the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus Vance Jr., will ultimately bring charges. The prosecutors have been fighting in court for more than a year to obtain Trump's personal and corporate tax returns, which they have called central to their investigation. The issue now rests with the Supreme Court.
But lately, Vance's office has stepped up its efforts, issuing new subpoenas and questioning witnesses, including some before a grand jury, according to the people with knowledge of the matter, who requested anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the investigation.
The grand jury appears to be serving an investigative function, allowing prosecutors to authenticate documents and pursue other leads, rather than considering any charges.
When Trump returns to private life in January, he will lose the protection from criminal prosecution that his office has afforded him. While The New York Times has reported that he discussed granting preemptive pardons to his eldest children before leaving office - and has claimed he has the power to pardon himself - that authority applies only to federal crimes, and not to state or local investigations like the one being conducted by Vance's office.
The investigation by Vance, a Democrat, has focused on Trump's conduct as a private business owner and whether he or employees at his family business, the Trump Organization, committed financial crimes.
Person of the Year: Time magazine has named President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris its "Person of the Year."
Time's Editor-in-Chief Edward Felsenthal says Biden and Harris won the honor for "changing the American story, for showing that the forces of empathy are greater than the furies of division, for sharing a vision of healing in a grieving world."
Felsenthal notes, "Every elected President since FDR has at some point during his term been a Person of the Year, nearly a dozen of those in a presidential election year. This is the first time we have included a Vice President."
Museums blocked: A lone senator from Utah has singlehandedly blocked the bipartisan approval of two new national museums to honor American Latinos and women, arguing that "last thing we need is to further divide an already divided nation."
Republican Sen. Mike Lee objected Thursday to the creation of the two proposed Smithsonian museums, stalling two projects that have been in the making for decades and enjoy broad bipartisan support. Senate approval would have sent the legislation approving the Latino museum to President Donald Trump for his signature. The Senate was attempting to pass the measures by voice vote, which requires every senator's consent.
The dispute on the Senate floor came amid the impasse over a new coronavirus relief bill and highlighted the difficulty of achieving even widely supported goals in the polarized Congress. Lawmakers could still find a way to move forward on the creation of the museums, including by adding the bills to a must-pass spending package, but doing so could further complicate passage of that legislation.
Argentina abortion bill passes: Lawmakers in Argentina's lower house passed a bill Friday that would legalize abortion in most cases, a proposal from President Alberto Fernandez in response to long-sought demands from women's rights activists.
The bill, which needs approval from the country's Senate in a debate expected before the end of the year, allows for voluntary abortions to be carried out up to the 14th week of pregnancy.
The proposed law was approved in a 131-117 vote with six abstentions after a marathon debate that extended from Thursday into the early hours of Friday.
Demonstrators in favor of decriminalizing abortion, who had spent the night outside the congress building in Buenos Aires, erupted with joy and embraced each other as they listened to the parliamentary speaker reading the vote's results on screens.
Hundreds of yards away, not far from the parliament building, hundreds of opponents dressed in light blue and carrying the national flag deplored the result, with some shedding tears.
Media tycoon charged: Hong Kong pro-democracy activist and media tycoon Jimmy Lai has been charged under the city's national security law, amid a widening crackdown on dissent, according to local media reports.
Lai, who founded the Apple Daily tabloid, was charged on suspicion of colluding with foreign forces and endangering national security, local broadcaster TVB reported Friday.
He is the most high-profile person out of more than two dozen charged under the law since it was implemented in June.
Lai is scheduled to appear in court Saturday and could face a maximum punishment of life imprisonment.
Actions against porn site: Mastercard and Visa said Thursday they would block their customers from using the credit cards to make purchases on Pornhub following accusations the pornographic website showed videos of rape and underage sex.
They reacted following an investigation by opinion columnist Nicholas Kristof of The New York Times that also alleged the site depicts revenge pornography and video taken without the consent of participants.
Mastercard said it is terminating use of its cards on Pornhub after its own investigation confirmed violations of standards prohibiting unlawful conduct on the site. Mastercard said it also investigating other websites for potential illegal content.
Pornhub, in a statement, called the actions "exceptionally disappointing." Earlier this week, the company announced steps to protect against images of abuse, nonconsensual activity and underage models on the site, including a ban on unverified users uploading material.
"This news is crushing for the hundreds of thousands of models who rely on our platform for their livelihoods," Pornhub said.

Texto completo: Plus: Is Hollywood dodging California's COVID-19 restrictions? And a killer's coded message is cracked after many decades.
I'm Winston Gieseke, philanthropy and special sections editor for The Desert Sun in Palm Springs, bringing you some of the latest headlines in this great state of ours.
In California brings you top Golden State stories and commentary from across the USA TODAY Network and beyond. Get it free, straight to your inbox.
Bank of America admits paying millions to EDD bilkers
Earlier in the week, we reported that the amount of unemployment fraud in California may total $2 billion. Now, Bank of America has revealed that it has paid out hundreds of millions of dollars to people suspected of committing debit card fraud — and it's trying to get that money back.
The red flag was raised when state lawmakers inquired about the bank draining EDD accounts, according to a report from abc7news.com. The bank responded that it was reversing credits on some accounts to combat fraud.
But it's not so simple. One California resident, Ann-Marie Garvey, discovered that thieves had run up $14,000 in charges on her EDD debit card before she had even received it in the mail. Bank of America credited the entire amount back to the card but evidently had a change of heart two months later when it took all $14,000 back out, leaving Garvey with no money to live on.
In response to this and other stories, 59 state lawmakers wrote Bank of America's CEO asking why the bank was taking money from legitimate accounts. Lawmakers said the response from the bank was vague: "Identifying legitimate claimants from among the fraudulent claimants is time-consuming and challenging."
The report noted that Garvey, no longer trusting the bank, is now getting her benefits by check. Meanwhile, lawmakers are still trying to get to the bottom of this.
Is Hollywood dodging California's COVID-19 restrictions?
A restaurant owner in Southern California went viral last week after posting a video of an outdoor dining area for crews working on a TV show that was only 50 feet away from her own outdoor dining space, which has been shut down by state and city officials in an attempt to stop the spread of coronavirus.
Why is one outdoor dining space acceptable while another is prohibited? A report from The Intercept's Lee Fang suggests that the big guns in Hollywood have deployed lobbyists to win exemptions to California's strict lockdown.
The report states that some of the state's biggest studios have spent thousands of dollars on lobbying efforts in attempts to receive more lax guidelines from the state, including Warner Bros., which reportedly spent $22,500 on lobbyists contacting Gov. Gavin Newsom's office for “COVID/outreach, TV/Film Production," and Netflix, which purportedly doled out $70,725 per quarter on its lobbying efforts.
SFGate reports that the efforts have apparently paid off, "as entertainment workers were curiously listed as 'essential workers' in April and were notably exempted from the state's new curfew order that was issued in November."
California wants to join federal antitrust case against Google
California wants to join the Justice Department in its antitrust lawsuit against Google parent Alphabet Inc., one of the state’s largest businesses.
State Attorney General Xavier Becerra filed the motion Friday in federal court. “Google’s anticompetitive behavior has unlawfully maintained the company’s monopoly on internet search and search-based advertising at the expense of consumers,” he said.
The Justice Department sued Google in October. The case alleges that Google uses billions of dollars collected from advertisers to pay phone manufacturers to ensure Google is the default search engine on browsers. This, the lawsuit claims, harms consumers and stifles smaller rivals.
At the time, 11 states, all with Republican attorneys general, joined the federal government in the lawsuit. California is the first Democratic-led state to announce its intent to join the case. Google, which is based in Mountain View, has until next Friday to respond to the state’s motion.
Some clarification on California's travel restrictions
If you've made plans to travel to or from the Golden State this holiday season, you might want to read this piece in The New York Times that's boiled down the state's complicated and ever-evolving restrictions into an easily digestible FAQ.
Here's something I didn't know: California hotels and lodgings (Airbnbs included) in areas under the stay-at-home orders are currently prohibited from honoring out-of-state reservations for nonessential travel unless the reservation is made for the required minimum quarantine time (14 days) and the guest plans to remain for the entire quarantine.
The article's main takeaway is, of course: If you're planning to travel to or from California this holiday season, the state asks that you reconsider.
California bill would require police officers be 25 or have bachelor’s degree
A California legislator is proposing the state require people to get a bachelor's degree or turn 25 before they can become eligible to be a police officer.
The bill, introduced Monday to the state legislature by Assemblyman Reggie Jones-Sawyer, D-Los Angeles, is aimed at minimizing police use of deadly force. Supporters of the bill believe officers that are more mature and more educated are likely to exhibit greater self-control and less likely to use deadly force. Opponents expressed concern that the law could unfairly limit people who do not have access to higher education.
"This data-driven bill relies on years of study and new understandings of brain development to ensure that only those officers capable of high level decision-making and judgment in tense situations are entrusted with working in our communities and correctional facilities" Jones-Sawyer said via statement.
According to Department of Justice data, California law enforcement agencies seriously injured or killed civilians 703 times in 2019. Currently, police officers in California must be 18 years old and have a high school diploma or the equivalent.
It took 51 years to decode this message from the Zodiac Killer
A coded message from the Zodiac Killer, who killed at least five people in Northern California in 1968 and 1969, has been decoded after 51 years. The San Francisco Chronicle — the same newspaper the killer sent the message to in November 1969 — reports that it took a team of experts from three countries to crack the cipher, which says: “I hope you are having lots of fun in trying to catch me. I am not afraid of the gas chamber because it will send me to paradise all the sooner because I now have enough slaves to work for me.”
The unsolved Zodiac Killer case remains an ongoing investigation in San Francisco.
On that note, I think it's time to start the weekend. I hope you have a very safe and informed one. We'll be back in your inbox on Monday with more Golden State news.

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
Name: Dorian Electra
Age: 28
Hometown: Houston
Now Lives: In a spacious Victorian-style house in the Echo Park section of Los Angeles, with nine roommates.
Claim to Fame: Electra is a singer and producer known for genre-contorting pop songs and elaborate music videos. Electra’s 2019 debut album, “Flamboyant,” is a glittery confection of convulsive hyperpop. The video for the title track featured the performer, who is gender-fluid, with neon green hair and a penciled-on mustache, twirling around a candlelit manor.
Big Break: In 2017, Electra met A.G. Cook, a record producer, through mutual friends at a DJ set at Sunnyvale, a nightclub in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn. Cook, who founded the electro-pop record label PC Music, was the executive producer behind Charli XCX’s breakout mixtape, “Pop 2, ”and suggested that Electra appear on the track “Femmebot.” “I was like, I’m working with my favorite artists, how is this even real?” Electra said.
Latest Project : In October, Electra released a frenetic, experimental full-length album, “My Agenda.” The songs expand on the ideas that animated their first album, with some written from the perspective of incels — so-called involuntary celibates who blame women for their lack of sexual activity — to examine how internet culture fosters toxicity online. “My Agenda” tangles together metal, dubstep and hard-core punk, “all these hypermasculine, testosterone-filled genres,” Electra said.
Next Thing: Electra plans to release a remixed version of “My Agenda,” inspired by the styles of artists featured on the project, and will work on new music next year. The singer has been livestreaming performances of the record on Twitch and posting them on YouTube. Electra is also supporting Planned Parenthood in a new campaign, as one of 200 artists pledging solidarity with the organization.
Catwalk: Fashion plays a key role in how Electra conceptualizes songwriting; the singer will plot out what colors to wear in a music video before even finishing a track. Electra walked in a runway show in London Fashion Week in February for DB Berdan, a Turkish brand, and is eager to do more modeling. “For me, fashion has been a way to be like, this is the body I was born with,” Electra said. “But what can I do with it? Who can I be?”

What Happens When a Superspreader Event Keeps Spreading

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
WASHINGTON — When it was disclosed last spring that the coronavirus had stealthily infected 99 people after the Cambridge, Massachusetts, pharmaceutical company Biogen held a two-day conference in February, it helped add the term “superspreader” to the pandemic lexicon.
Little did anyone know how super the spread would actually become.
A new analysis of the Biogen event at a Boston hotel has concluded that the coronavirus strains loosed at the meeting have since migrated worldwide, infecting about 245,000 Americans — and potentially as many as 300,000 — by the end of October.
The virus strains spread to at least 29 states. They were found in Australia, Sweden and Slovakia. They wended their way from a room packed with biotechnology executives to Boston homeless shelters, where they also spread widely among occupants.
Those are just the infections. How many people were killed by the virus strains cannot be reliably estimated. Nor do the figures include infections among the 6 million Americans who have tested positive for the coronavirus since October, as infections have spiked.
“It’s a cautionary tale,” said Bronwyn MacInnis, a genomic epidemiologist at the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT. “When we hear these stories of clusters where 20 or 50 or 100 were affected, that does not account for what happens after.”
A spokesman for Biogen did not respond to requests for comment on the report.
The analysis, by more than 50 health care experts and researchers based primarily in the Boston area, was published Thursday in Science, the journal of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. It is based on genetic analyses of the coronavirus taken from 28 people who attended the Biogen annual leadership conference, at a Marriott hotel on the Boston waterfront, on Feb. 26-27.
At the time, only 30 coronavirus infections had been confirmed in the United States, according to data compiled by The New York Times. More than a month earlier, Chinese authorities had quarantined the 11 million residents of Wuhan, where COVID-19 was first detected. But the epidemics that would ravage Europe were still on the horizon; Italy had recorded its first death only days earlier.
Some other companies had canceled international meetings out of caution, but Biogen forged ahead, bringing in 175 executives, including officials from Italy, Switzerland and Germany, for its leadership meeting. Within days, some were falling ill.
The analysis of 28 cases determined that each person had been infected with a strain of the coronavirus, named C2416T, that had not previously been seen in the United States. The only known instances of the strain that preceded the Biogen conference involved two French patients, ages 87 and 88.
“We think the mutation arose in early or mid-February,” Dr. Jacob E. Lemieux, an infectious-disease specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital and a researcher at the Broad Institute, said in an interview. “We think there was a single importation into Boston, and that single importation was tightly linked to the spread that occurred at the conference.”
That finding and a second marker — a mutation of C2416T that appears linked solely to some infections at the conference — enabled researchers to track the Cambridge strain across the nation and even the world, and make broad estimates that excluded cases unconnected to the meeting.
By May, it was estimated that between 44,000 and 56,000 known coronavirus cases were directly tied to the Biogen conference. About 40% were in Boston, but the C2416T strain was carried across the country, to Indiana, Florida, North Carolina and perhaps elsewhere by people who had been at the meeting.
Fresh data included in the current analysis raised the estimate to about 245,000 cases — as low as 205,000 and as high as 300,000 — in 29 states. The researchers estimated that the Cambridge strain of the virus was responsible for 1.9% of all known coronavirus cases in the United States through October.
Massachusetts was no longer a center of the outbreaks, although the virus strain remained widespread there. Instead, the researchers estimated that about 29% of all cases related to the Boston meeting occurred in Florida. Lemieux said scientists have no explanation for why the Cambridge strain of the virus grew so robustly there.
One of the study’s more arresting findings was that within a month of the Biogen conference, the virus strain introduced there had made its way to Boston-area homeless shelters. Tests at the shelters, affiliated with the Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program, found 14 strains of the coronavirus, four of which appeared to have become superspreaders. The researchers found that two clusters of cases that resembled superspreader events were associated with the virus from the conference.
Lemieux said that offered a lesson for those who take a casual attitude toward the coronavirus. “That’s just the interconnectivity of society,” he said. “Our intuition about how disconnected we can be is not reliable. We are so connected that we don’t appreciate the linkages and interactions we have.”
He said it was impossible to say how the coronavirus was brought into the leadership meeting.
“We don’t know whether it entered with somebody who was there for the conference, or it entered before the conference and was amplified by it,” Lemieux said. “All we know is that we’re not able to detect any spread with cases before the conference.”
But in the months since the Biogen outbreak, the company has come under fire for staging an international conference at a time when the likelihood of a pandemic was becoming clearer.
The company said previously that it decided to hold the conference using the best information it had at the time. But the study released this week only underscored concerns about that judgment, said John Carroll, the editor of Endpoints News, which covers the biotech industry.
“The irony, of course, is that a large drug company was responsible for triggering the mother of all superspreader events that played a major role in making the virus endemic in the U.S., killing more than 3,000 Americans a day,” he said. “Top Biogen execs accidentally triggered a massive health care train wreck, and watched it play out from the sidelines.”

Texto completo: During his decades on the congressional beat, John Bresnahan has spent countless hours listening to the private concerns of his congressional sources.
Democrats expressed private concerns about Bill Clinton's indiscretions with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Republicans confessed private concerns about George W. Bush's handling of the Iraq War. Democrats shared private concerns about Barack Obama's aloofness to the backroom negotiations where Congress gets its real work done.
But then came Donald Trump. And, boy, did his party's lawmakers ever have concerns. And those concerns? The most private ever .
Bresnahan, the senior political congressional reporter for Politico, had no trouble getting Republicans to open their hearts to him about Trump leaning on the Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden, or his "both sides" equivocating about the white nationalist march in Charlottesville, or some of the troubling findings in the Mueller report and revelations in John Bolton's book - but almost always on an off-the-record, no-name, no-fingerprints basis.
"Every Hill reporter has spent the entire Trump presidency trying to get people on the record about Trump," Bresnahan said. "I've spent the past five years trying to get people to put their names to their sentiments."
It's a culture of anonymity, shot through by fear, that has posed a quandary for political journalists of this era - especially in these particularly fraught closing hours of the Trump administration, when the president has lobbed baseless allegations of election fraud and pursued extralegal means in an unprecedented attempt to overturn the voting results and seize another term in office.
Few Republicans have stood up to defend the process under which Joe Biden was elected - except, of course, privately .
But should journalists even be dignifying these off-the-record sentiments - some condemning Trump's actions, others promising it will all blow over - by putting them in print? Bresnahan says he has a rule not to quote someone anonymously and on the record in the same piece. And he has avoided whenever possible allowing unnamed lawmakers into his stories.
"If a Republican official isn't willing to say openly that Trump's legal battles are as destructive as they are hopeless, it's hard to discern the news value in quoting them anonymously," said Bill Grueskin, a professor at Columbia University School of Journalism.
Bresnahan soon became accustomed to the dance he and other reporters would have to do in trying to get a comment from lawmakers about the latest Trump stunt. It usually kicked off with an elected official pleading ignorance.
"We'd go up to everyone asking about something he just said, and they'd say they didn't see it," he recalled. "So we'd print out the tweets. We'd read them the tweets."
Often, lawmakers would simply shrug. But sometimes they'd express privately what they really thought.
Bresnahan understands why they didn't go public. There's never been a president who has been willing to publicly go after his enemies the way Trump has, he said.
"Look at the people who have stood up to Trump - they've gotten hammered down. And Trump knows that."
Which has led to a certain genre of Washington political story, built upon a chorus of ghostly voices. Google "privately concerned" and "Trump," and you'll see.
In June 2017, the Associated Press noted that some Republicans on Capitol Hill were "privately concerned" about their new president's firing of FBI Director James B. Comey and other mounting scandals while publicly sticking with him. In July 2019, unnamed GOP senators privately expressed doubts to the New York Times about Trump's pick for director of national intelligence, Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-Tex.). In the fall of 2019, lawmakers weren't just privately concerned that Trump had pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to announce an investigation into Biden, some were also "privately stunned" that the White House had shown such poor strategic judgment in releasing a transcript of the phone call that made clear that he had done so, The Washington Post reported.
Over the past month, these kinds of conversations - and stories - have become more challenging, as lawmakers seem eager to signal to journalists that they don't support anything like a coup, yet remain fearful of publicly puncturing Trump's fantasy of reclaiming the White House or alienating his most rabid fans. A recent survey by The Washington Post of every Republican member of Congress found only 27 would affirmatively acknowledge Biden as the president-elect.
And yet . . . on Nov. 8, a day after all mainstream media outlets called the election for Biden and Trump still failed to concede, the New York Times reported that "privately, the president's advisers, several of whom have quietly been candid with Mr. Trump that the chances of success in any challenge to the election outcome were not high, had concluded they had little option other than to allow the president to keep fighting until he was ready to bow to the reality of his loss."
That same day, The Post reported that some of the president's advisers, including Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel, "are publicly fighting on behalf of the president but have acknowledged to others privately that the battle cannot go on for too long."
The following day, The Washington Post reported on Republican lawmakers' public support for Trump's election challenges, but quoted a senior Republican official anonymously who admitted that no one believed it would work: "What is the downside for humoring him for this little bit of time? No one seriously thinks the results will change."
Politico reported that "most Senate Republicans have refused to publicly acknowledge that Biden will become the next president, even though they admit that's going to happen in private."
Journalists defend transmitting these anonymous sentiments because they provide a deeper insight into the minds of lawmakers than their terse, scripted statements. Lawmakers, meanwhile, might see these statements as a way to both reassure the public and impress their sensible levelheadedness upon the press corps.
But many media and political scholars see harm in the practice - particularly now.
Anonymous sourcing is a standard that has been allowed to flourish in Beltway journalism circles that most local journalists would never be allowed to get away with, said David Boardman, the former executive editor of the Seattle Times.
"The result of that has been a whisper culture in which politicians and bureaucrats have been allowed to publicly cover their own rear ends while privately stabbing others in the back," said Boardman, now the dean of the Klein College of Media and Communication at Temple University. "Now, we are reaping the rotten fruit of that practice."
Even non-journalists from the opposing party seem willing to grant anonymity privileges: "For the stay-in-office-at-all-cost representatives and senators, fear is the motivator," wrote Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) in a February op-ed in the New York Times explaining his Republican colleagues' silence on Trump's impeachable behavior.
How did he know? "In private, many of my colleagues agree that the president is reckless and unfit. They admit his lies. And they acknowledge what he did was wrong."
Ron Klain, whom Biden has tapped as his White House chief of staff, told MSNBC's Lawrence O'Donnell last month that some Republican senators had privately been in contact with Biden. But "I'm not naming names because we read out calls when we read out the calls, when both sides agree to read out the calls," Klain said.
And so the Washington split screen continues - lawmakers publicly fulminating against so-called election fraud and privately anticipating the dawning Biden era.
"It is not new for politicians to represent a different off-the-record view of their opinions toward the president than the one they profess publicly," said Brendan Nyhan, a political scientist at Dartmouth. "But it matters more when elites are failing to speak out about violations to the norms of our democratic system."

Mark Becker is not a journalist. He's an auto-industry finance manager in Green Bay, Wis., and the former chair of the Brown County GOP who made a name for himself locally as a devout anti-Trump Republican. He recently wrote a blistering story for the Bulwark about a conversation he had a week after the election was called for Biden with Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), a high-profile Trump supporter, during which Becker came to realize that "Senator Johnson knows that Joe Biden won a free and fair election."
Becker wrote that Johnson explained to him that he publicly echoed Trump's election-fraud claims not because he believed them but because Trump motivated voter turnout in Wisconsin.
"It did not seem to occur to Senator Johnson," Becker wrote in a parenthetical, "that President Trump motivated massive, greater turnout in opposition to him than he did in support."
The most interesting thing to Becker about the response he received to the article? All the elected Republican officials who reached out to him privately to say "thank you for doing that," he told The Post. Becker has reached back out to them to ask where they land on speaking out. He's gotten mostly radio silence.

On the Sunday before Thanksgiving, Washington's fortress of anonymity imploded - at least temporarily.
Veteran investigative journalist Carl Bernstein tweeted a list of 21 Republican senators who he said have "repeatedly expressed extreme contempt for Trump and his fitness to be POTUS."
Some of the names were predictable, such as Mitt Romney, a frequent critic of Trump. But others, such as Charles E. Grassley, Rob Portman and Rick Scott, who have publicly supported Trump, rushed to distance themselves from Bernstein's allegation, though none explicitly denied it.
How did Bernstein know what these senators have said about Trump? He insisted that he was not "violating any pledges of journalistic confidentiality in this reporting," and that he had learned of these names because these senators had expressed these sentiments "in convos w/ colleagues, staff members, lobbyists, W. House aides."
Bernstein repeated the names in a CNN appearance but has otherwise declined to elaborate on his reporting or the significance of it.
"What was said on the air and in the tweet speaks for itself," he told The Post. "And I say that with confidence."
In many ways, it was a major scoop - but one that many viewers were unwilling to applaud. Perhaps these were truly the high-powered names behind all those "private concerns" stories. But they would rather hear it from the senators themselves.
"The appearance of impropriety that is happening in the Republican Party is disgraceful. And Carl Bernstein saying 21 people are speaking [about Trump] privately?" noted Sunny Hostin, a host of ABC's "The View," where the revelation was hotly debated. " 'Privately' means nothing."

Jamelle Bouie: The ‘Trump won’ farce isn’t funny anymore

Texto completo: To tell a joke to a crowd is to learn a little something about the people who laugh.
For our purposes, the “joke” is President Donald Trump’s ongoing fight to overturn the election results and hold on to power against the wishes of most Americans, including those in enough states to equal far more than the 270 electoral votes required to win the White House.
“#OVERTURN,” he said on Twitter this week, adding in a separate post that “If somebody cheated in the Election, which the Democrats did, why wouldn’t the Election be immediately overturned? How can a Country be run like this?”
Unfortunately for Trump, and fortunately for the country, he has not been able to bend reality to his desires. Key election officials and federal judges have refused his call to throw out votes, create chaos and clear a path for the autogolpe he hopes to accomplish. The military has also made clear where it stands. “We do not take an oath to a king or a queen, a tyrant or a dictator. We do not take an oath to an individual,” Gen. Mark A. Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in a speech not long after the election.
But there are others who — out of partisanship, opportunism or a simple taste for mayhem — have chosen to support the president’s attack on American democracy. They refuse to acknowledge the president’s defeat, back lawsuits to throw out the results, and spread lies about voter fraud and election malfeasance to Republican voters. They are laughing at Trump’s joke, not realizing (or not caring) that their laughter is infectious.
What was a legal effort by the Trump campaign next became one by Texas, which had petitioned the Supreme Court to scrap election results in Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, depriving Joe Biden of his victory. On Friday, the court dismissed the case, saying Texas lacked the standing to pursue its effort.
Filed by Ken Paxton, Texas’ attorney general, the suit said it would be a violation of due process to accept the outcome in those states, on account of “election irregularities” and “interstate differences in the treatment of voters” that disadvantage Republican voters in areas with stricter voting rules.
This lawsuit rested on the novel argument that the Constitution gives exclusive and unquestioned authority to state legislatures to appoint presidential electors as they see fit and renders any action to expand voting without direct legislative consent unconstitutional. The Supreme Court had already rejected that argument once this week when it turned away a similar lawsuit by the Trump campaign to overturn the results in Pennsylvania.
Regardless, on Wednesday, 17 Republican attorneys general filed a brief in support of Texas, urging the court, in essence, to cancel the election and hand power back to Trump. The next day, more than 100 Republican members of Congress filed a brief in support of this lawsuit, in effect declaring allegiance to Trump over the Constitution and urging the court to end self-government in the name of “the framers.”
There’s a paradox here. This sloppy, harebrained lawsuit had no serious chance of success. Granting Texas (and, by extension Trump, who joined the lawsuit) its relief would have plunged the country into abject chaos, with violence sure to follow. That this quest was quixotic was, in all likelihood, one reason it had so much support.
It is only with the knowledge of certain defeat that Republican officeholders felt comfortable plowing forward with an effort that would have torn the United States apart if it had succeeded. They could play politics with constitutional government (Paxton, for instance, hopes to succeed Greg Abbott as governor of Texas) knowing that the Supreme Court was not going to risk it all for Trump.
Then again, it was only two weeks before Election Day that four of the court’s conservatives announced their potential willingness to throw out votes on the basis of this theory of state legislative supremacy over electoral votes. It is very easy to imagine a world in which the election was a little closer, where the outcome came down to one state instead of three or four, and the court’s conservatives could have used the conflict over a narrow margin to hand the president a second term.
With no evidence that Republicans have really thought about the implications of a victory in the courts, I think we can say that these briefs and lawsuits were part of a performance.
The Republican Party, or much of it, has abandoned whatever commitment to electoral democracy it had to start. It views defeat on its face as illegitimate, a product of fraud concocted by opponents who don’t deserve to hold power. That it is fully the party of minority rule, committed to the idea that a vote doesn’t count if it isn’t for its candidates, and that if democracy won’t serve its partisan and ideological interests, then so much for democracy.
None of this is new — there is a whole tradition of reactionary, counter-majoritarian thought in American politics to which the conservative movement is heir — but it is the first time since the 1850s that these ideas have nearly captured an entire political party. And while the future is unwritten, the events of the past month make me worry that we’re following a script the climax of which requires a disaster.

Paul Krugman: Trump tries to kill COVID relief

Texto completo: The next few months will be terrible. Several thousand Americans are now dying from COVID-19 every day; given the lag between cases and deaths, the daily toll will almost certainly rise through the end of this year, and if people are careless over Christmas it could surge even higher in the new year. Economic recovery has stalled, with employment still down almost 10 million from pre-pandemic levels.
The most we can hope for at this point are policies that mitigate the suffering, getting us through the horror while we wait for widespread vaccination. And a few days ago it seemed possible that we would in fact get some good news on the economic front. A bipartisan group of senators seemed close to agreement on a COVID relief bill that would fall far short of what we should be doing, but would be much better than nothing.
Then the lame-duck Trump administration intervened — destructively.
Before I get to what’s wrong with the administration’s proposal and why it may do a great deal of harm, let’s talk about what the goal of economic policy ought to be right now.
I still keep seeing news reports that frame congressional arguments about relief bills as a debate about “stimulus.” But stimulus is what you do when unemployment is high because people aren’t spending enough. And that’s not the problem we face.
Think about it. Why are there still 2 million fewer workers in “food services and drinking places” than there were before the coronavirus struck? It’s not because people can’t afford to eat out or go to bars. It’s because eating out and gathering in bars are dangerous activities. In many parts of the country these activities are, rightly, either banned or sharply restricted; even where they’re allowed, many people, understanding the risks, choose to stay home.
The role of economic policy in this situation isn’t to bring those jobs back while the pandemic is still raging — we actually don’t want a resurgence of employment in high-risk sectors until vaccines are widely available. What we should be doing, instead, is minimizing the suffering while we wait. That is, the issue isn’t stimulus, it’s disaster relief.
What should this relief involve? It should provide support for the unavoidably unemployed, sustain businesses through the dark months ahead and aid state and local governments that are suffering severe declines in revenues and that will otherwise be forced to make drastic cuts in essential services.
And no, this last problem isn’t restricted to blue states. In fact, six of the seven states expected to face the biggest revenue declines have Republican governors.
House Democrats have always been willing to pass a relief bill along the lines I’ve described. And as I said, until a few days ago the Senate appeared to be moving toward a bill that, while much smaller than Democrats wanted, would be better than nothing. The main obstacle seemed to be the determination of Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, to include a poison pill — a blanket exemption of businesses from any liabilities related to exposing their workers to COVID-19 risks. But observers were hopeful that an agreement could still be reached.
Then came the Trump administration intervention — a proposal from Steven Mnuchin, the treasury secretary, that McConnell quickly endorsed even though it was disastrously wrongheaded.
I’m not sure whether the coverage of this discussion has fully explained just how bad Mnuchin’s proposal is. Many headlines emphasized the cost, a bit over $900 billion, which was similar to that of the emerging bipartisan bill, suggesting that the administration was weighing in with something positive.
In fact, however, the administration proposal completely eliminated the most important piece of any relief deal — expanded benefits for the unemployed — replacing it with one-time $600 checks that would be sent to everyone.
Again, think about it. For Americans who won’t be able to return to work while the pandemic is still raging, a one-time payment of $600 is grossly inadequate, while for those who haven’t lost their jobs it’s unnecessary. It’s true that people might spend some of the grant, boosting overall demand — but overall lack of demand isn’t the main problem right now.
So what is Mnuchin thinking? We can’t rule out sheer ignorance. It is, sad to say, entirely possible that, nine months into the pandemic slump, administration officials still don’t understand the basic logic of relief. Or they may be in thrall to the thoroughly debunked myth that unemployment benefits actually cause high unemployment.
Or maybe this proposal reflects the expiring administration’s special combination of delusion and cynicism. President Donald Trump is still trying, in ever more desperate and destructive ways, to overturn the results of the election. And in his madness he may imagine that he will gain more politically from sending everyone another check with his name on it than from helping those truly in need.
Whatever the motivation, Mnuchin’s proposal couldn’t have come at a worse time. It may well undermine the economic relief millions of Americans need.

Peterson Celebrating PBS and Ken Burns’ ‘Baseball’

Información de publicación: Daily Herald ; Arlington Heights, Ill. [Arlington Heights, Ill]. 11 Dec 2020: 8.

Resumen: While watching the Ken Burns PBS documentary is a joy for baseball fans and essential for an understanding of the intimate relationship between America’s game and American history, Ken Burns added to his accomplishment when he co-authored, with renowned historian Geoffrey Ward, "Baseball: An Illustrated History" as a companion for his documentary. The narrative of the book, supplemented by a wealth of photographs from baseball’s past, follows the same nine inning format as the documentary, but it also includes an introduction by Hall of Fame writer Roger Angell and essays from baseball’s most distinguished historians for each chapter. At a time when a tragic pandemic and a bitter political divide have disrupted our lives and challenged our confidence in the future, Ken Burns and Geoffrey Ward, through their illustrated history of baseball, remind us of our capacity to overcome the challenges of history, including world wars and epidemics, and restore our faith in the value and continuity of our lives.

The "Second Inning," called "Something Like a War: 1900-1910," begins a decade-by-decade chronology of baseball that concludes with its "Eighth Inning: A Whole New Ball Game: 1960-1970."
While watching the Ken Burns PBS documentary is a joy for baseball fans and essential for an understanding of the intimate relationship between America’s game and American history, Ken Burns added to his accomplishment when he co-authored, with renowned historian Geoffrey Ward, "Baseball: An Illustrated History" as a companion for his documentary.
The narrative of the book, supplemented by a wealth of photographs from baseball’s past, follows the same nine inning format as the documentary, but it also includes an introduction by Hall of Fame writer Roger Angell and essays from baseball’s most distinguished historians for each chapter. The chapter on the 1940s, for example, was written by Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, while the chapter on the 1950s was written by Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist George Will.
"Baseball: An Illustrated History" would make a wonderful Christmas gift for the baseball fan in your life. At a time when a tragic pandemic and a bitter political divide have disrupted our lives and challenged our confidence in the future, Ken Burns and Geoffrey Ward, through their illustrated history of baseball, remind us of our capacity to overcome the challenges of history, including world wars and epidemics, and restore our faith in the value and continuity of our lives.
I already have a copy of the Burns/Ward history, so my kids will have to look elsewhere this Christmas for their father. My wife Anita has already fielded some inquiries about a Pirates calendar, but I’m afraid that the Pirates were so awful last season that there aren’t 12 Pirates good enough to grace a calendar.
What I’d really like this Christmas is a rain check for a game that hasn’t been played yet. Next summer, I want to be sitting in the stands at PNC Park in Pittsburgh with my family at a Pirates and Cardinals game. I can’t think of a better gift this Christmas than the promise that our lives will return to normal by then and the only ones wearing masks at ball parks next season will be catchers and home-plate umpires.
* Reading Baseball is a series of stories and commentaries by Richard "Pete" Peterson, author of "Growing Up With Clemente" and co-author with his son, Stephen, of the forthcoming "The Turnpike Rivalry: The Pittsburgh Steelers and the Cleveland Browns."
In recognition of the birth of PBS 50 years ago, the writers and editors of the New York Times put together a list of the 50 greatest PBS programs.
It should come as no surprise that "Mister Rogers‘ Neighborhood," described as "empathy and honesty wrapped in a cardigan," topped the New York Times list. No PBS program better expressed the mandate set down by Congress for public television: that it should address "the needs of unserved and underserved audiences, particularly children and minorities."
The goals set for public television by Congress also included giving viewers a better knowledge and understanding of American history and culture. High on the New York Times list in achieving that goal was the Ken Burns 11-hour documentary series on the Civil War. The Times wrote, "It stands as a monument to a cultural moment" when millions of Americans were "willing to sit down in shared contemplation of our history rather than just fighting about it."
After the success of his Civil War documentary, Ken Burns decided that his next project should be a history of baseball. In a "60 Minutes" interview, he claimed that "the first real progress in civil rights after the Civil War takes place when Jackie Roosevelt Robinson, the grandson of a slave, makes his way to first base at Ebbets Field on April 15, 1947." He added, "There’s no question that the story of baseball is just going to take off from the assassination of Abraham Lincoln and the failure of Reconstruction to that moment."

Texto completo: A Manhattan judge agreed to release early a terrorist and former minion of Osama bin Laden convicted in two bombings on United States embassies because his weight puts him at risk of contracting the coronavirus.
Adel Abdel Bary, a 230-pound 60-year-old, spent over 20 years behind bars for conspiring to bomb two U.S. embassies located in Africa in 1998 that killed 224 people, including 12 Americans. But he's walking the streets of the United Kingdom as a free man because he was at risk of becoming ill with COVID-19.
"Defendant’s obesity and somewhat advanced age make COVID-19 significantly more risky to him than to the average person," wrote U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan in October in granting the early release. "And his continued incarceration increases his risk of catching the virus. In these circumstances, the benefit to society of requiring defendant to serve the final few weeks of his sentence does not outweigh the serious health risks he faces."
The convicted terrorist was set to be released on Oct. 28 after serving his sentence fully, but his lawyers argued for an early release amid the pandemic, arguing that his weight, age, and asthma "could wreak disastrous health outcomes." He was released from prison on Oct. 9.
In justifying the early release, Kaplan cited English playwright William Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice.
"This is a case in which the earthly power of the United States should allow mercy to season justice," he wrote.
Prosecutors also agreed that the "defendant’s obesity is an extraordinary and compelling reason that could justify a reduction of his sentence in light of the current pandemic."
Bary was then released from Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility this week, where he was subsequently handed over to U.K. officials. U.K. officials did not send him back to his native country of Egypt, where he was a lawyer, because he would be put at serious risk of torture or death. Bary was granted asylum by the U.K. in 1997, according to the Sun.
R. Andrew Painter, Bary's immigration lawyer, told the New York Times in November, "After all this time, all Mr. Bary wants is to enjoy a quiet life with his family.”
Edith Bartley, whose younger brother and father were among those killed in the attacks on the 1998 bombings, told the New York Times that she is concerned about what might happen after his release.
“Just serving a sentence doesn’t mean that a person has been rehabilitated, doesn’t mean that their core thinking has changed. This is a person who can still do harm in the world," she said.

Texto completo: No search results appeared on the New York Times website when users searched “Eric Swalwell” or “Christine Fang” several days after the congressman's connection to the suspected Chinese spy was reported.
Axios reported on Tuesday that Rep. Swalwell, a Democrat, was linked to suspected Chinese spy Fang. However, on Friday afternoon, the New York Times website search function yielded no results for news coverage of the controversy.
The omission was noticed by some on social media, who slammed the publisher for not informing readers of the alleged connection between a member of Congress and the Chinese government.
“The New York Times has yet to inform its readers that Congressman Eric Swalwell, who sits on the Intelligence Committee, had a relationship with a Chinese spy,” former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer tweeted along with a screenshot showing no results for a search of “Eric Swalwell” on the outlet's website. “Journalism is broken.”Tweet
The story was skipped by several other prominent news outlets, and it was reported that broadcast networks ABC, NBC, and CBS all declined to cover the controversy on their morning and evening shows after the story broke.
The New York Times did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Washington Examiner.
Swalwell, who was described in the report as one of Fang’s “most significant targets,” downplayed the controversy and suggested it was a politically motivated attack on his credibility.

Democrats, and Even Some Republicans, Cheer as Justices Spurn Trump

The rejection came swiftly. The celebrations came just as fast.
The Supreme Court’s unsigned order Friday rejecting Texas’ bid to toss the results of the presidential election in four states won by Joe Biden unceremoniously ended a case that President Donald Trump had teased only hours earlier as “perhaps the most important case in history.”
Democrats cheered the ruling as a symbolic final blow to more than a month of failed legal challenges by Trump and his allies and a victory for the will of voters who delivered Biden 306 Electoral College votes and a margin of more than 7 million in the popular vote.
“The will of the people will be heard,” New York Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat, said on Twitter. Josh Shapiro, the attorney general of Pennsylvania and a Democrat, said that the Supreme Court had recognized the lawsuit as a “seditious abuse of the judicial process.”
Though legal experts never gave the case much of a chance, it drew support from more than 120 Republican members of Congress and 17 Republican attorneys general. On Friday night, Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska was the highest-level Republican to break with Trump and much of his own party in applauding the ruling.
“Since election night, a lot of people have been confusing voters by spinning Kenyan Birther-type, ‘Chavez rigged the election from the grave’ conspiracy theories,” Sasse said in a statement, “But every American who cares about the rule of law should take comfort that the Supreme Court — including all three of President Trump’s picks — closed the book on this nonsense.”
Among those who had signed on in support of the lawsuit on Friday was Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California, the top House Republican. When the case was dismissed, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the lawmakers who signed onto the lawsuit “brought dishonor to the House” and chastised them for choosing “to subvert the Constitution and undermine public trust in our sacred democratic institutions.”
The Supreme Court’s ruling effectively ended the president’s attempts to use the legal system to get a result the voters denied him, leaving him to press his case in the court of public opinion, where his baseless arguments about fraudulent voting have found far more fertile ground than in state and federal courts. A poll released this week by Quinnipiac University found that more than three-quarters of Republicans believe there was widespread fraud in the election.
Rick Hasen, a professor of law at the University of California at Irvine, said the ruling, while unsurprising, was significant for the country.
“The good news is that our institutions held,” Hasen said. “While many Republican legislators and attorneys general signed onto Texas’ anti-democratic effort, Republican election officials who count the votes and Republican judges did not.”
Yet even among those who celebrated the outcome of the case, many feared the longer-term impact of Trump’s rhetoric on public trust in democracy and the mechanics of elections.
“Pleased with the SCOTUS ruling, but also immediately slightly terrified of where this crazy train goes next,” Brendan Buck, an adviser to the last two Republican speakers, Paul Ryan and John Boehner, wrote on Twitter. He later added, “We should know by now there’s a bottomless supply of crazy.”
Not long after, Allen West, a former congressman and chair of the Texas Republican Party, slashed at the Supreme Court and said in a statement that hinted at secession that “perhaps law-abiding states should bond together and form a union of states that will abide by the Constitution.”
Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., called on the Texas GOP to retract the statement and fire West. “My guy Abraham Lincoln and the Union soldiers already told you no,” Kinzinger wrote on Twitter.
In recent weeks, Trump has trained his anger at Fox News, the often sympathetic cable network, for accepting the election results, and directed his supporters to Newsmax, which has seen a surge in pro-Trump viewers since Election Day. On Friday, Newsmax anchor Greg Kelly opened his 7 p.m. program by reassuring his audience, “It’s not over.”
When a guest, lawyer Alan Dershowitz, depicted Friday’s court order as a game-over moment for the president — saying there was now a “close to zero” chance that the Supreme Court might reverse the election results — Kelly objected.
“I’ve seen stranger things happen in a courtroom,” Kelly said, before invoking one of Dershowitz’s most famous legal cases: “I’ve seen O.J. Simpson walk!”
With loss after loss in the courts and multiple recounts showing Biden ahead in the decisive states, Trump’s November defeat has been repeated, certified and confirmed enough to keep many Democrats pleased.
“With each loss we get to celebrate the Biden/Harris victory all over again,” Ken Martin, a vice-chair of the Democratic National Committee and the state party chair in Minnesota, said. “It’s like the gift that keeps on giving.”

Saunas Are Hot

In June, Lauren Warren bought a sauna after monitoring a sale on Wayfair.com and installed it in her living room. “With the winter coming — I really loathe winter — especially with the pandemic, I knew I wasn’t going to be able to get away to get warm,” she said.
Warren, 54, an exercise therapist who lives in Tillson, New York, has competed in Ironman triathlons. She eats organic raw food, intermittently fasts and leads a “holistic lifestyle all the way — that’s the sauna!” she said.
Spending a lot of money in an uncertain economy concerned her, but the price kept dropping, from $5,100 to $1,500. When only two of her preferred four-person, infrared models remained, she pounced.
“Next thing I know, I’m typing in my info and here goes! I hit the button. I was jumping all over, excited,” she said.
Infrared units bear little similarity to the traditional Finnish-style sauna. They heat up to around 150 degrees Fahrenheit, instead of over 200. Light wavelengths warm the body. There is no blast of hot air, no pouring water on heated rocks for steam, and users can sit safely for extended periods of time.
The myriad benefits of saunas have been documented in numerous studies. Sitting in one is said to, among other things, improve insomnia, inflammation, pain, blood pressure and brain function. Infrared has been touted to help heal skin ailments from acne to psoriasis to surgical scars, and is used, particularly in Japan, as therapy for heart patients.
Heat increases blood circulation. “I’m a pasty white Dutch guy,” said Rick Mouw, 59, president of Almost Heaven in Holland, Michigan, which mainly sells traditional saunas — including trendy barrel-shaped ones — electric, wood-burning and steam. “People ask if I’m tanning! You get a healthy glow.”
Some liken sweating in a sauna to passive cardiovascular conditioning, which may interest anyone who has packed on pounds in quarantine.
But maybe the best way to approach the overwhelming barrage of health claims lobbed at sauna shoppers trying to justify a four-figure purchase to get through winter is a study out of the University of Eastern Finland, which suggests frequent sauna use reduced risks of “all-cause mortality.”
There is also the simple sensual aspect. “As an athlete, I saw in quite a few journals that it can build blood volume, almost like training at altitude,” said Warren, who said she uses her sauna almost daily. “I do a lot of research, then I use myself as a guinea pig. You do feel it the next day — wow, that was good!”
And therein lies the sauna’s current appeal, up there with Peloton bikes, fire pits and outdoor heat lamps. Here we all are, facing climbing coronavirus rates and, in many parts of the country, declining temperatures. All we want is to feel good.
“More people are at home; they aren’t spending money like they used to — going to shows or on vacation or at movies,” said Corey Smee, 30, manager at Health Mate Sauna. “They are cooking more home meals. They can’t go to the gym and sweat. So people are investing in health more than ever.”
Amortizing the cost helped Warren make her investment. She used to go frequently to a sauna spa; those charge about $40 for 30 minutes. Like gyms, such studios — Perspire, HigherDose, SaunaBar, Glow — have had to restrict customers, or close altogether, during the pandemic.
Sunlighten sells a portable “Solo” sauna for half that amount, which looks a little like a fancy human pet bed. Sales of this unit are currently up 140%, according to Connie Zack, a founder of the company, adding that overall sales rose significantly in July compared with last year, mostly thanks to buyers in California, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas and Florida. Zack calls infrared sauna “part of my lifestyle; it’s what I do to keep myself healthy.”
Sunlighten has been able to meet increased demand at its factory in Vietnam. So has Health Mate at its Canadian facility. But other companies have sold out of certain models.
“We are back-ordered two to four months depending on the sauna right now,” said Andy Kaps, 58, president of Clearlight Infrared. (Gwyneth Paltrow has posted its “Sanctuary” unit, with a half glass roof and a glass front, on social media. Yes, #saunaselfie is now a hashtag. Instagrammers including Paltrow and Lady Gaga, who uses hers for chronic pain relief, have posed in the structures.)
Clearlight’s Chinese manufacturing facility closed for six weeks early on. “People are looking for things to enhance house and health — so wellness exploded,” Kaps said.
Almost Heaven is also experiencing “extended lead times in many cases,” said Mouw, who said the company has expanded production at its factory in West Virginia. “With COVID, it’s a busy market on steroids. No one can say sauna helps with COVID, but it does provide people who want to live a healthier lifestyle overall with another activity you can experience at home at the moment.”
(Almost Heaven was acquired in 2018 by Finnish company Harvia, a maker of sauna stoves, among other related items. Mouw said affably that he was hazed by new colleagues in Lapland, 50 miles north of the Arctic Circle.)
Can’t afford one? Rental is an option. Henning Grentz, 47, runs Spa Fleet, a mobile sauna rental based in High Falls, New York. Over the summer, he had several long-term bookings, a warm-weather rarity. “The first, for six weeks, was a family that fled New York City,” he said. “They had a beautiful piece of property in Saugerties with a creek.”
Grentz built his dry Finnish sauna, the type he grew up using in the north of Germany, from scratch. “It was a happy time — a hobby with the intention of bringing the goodness out there,” he said. He even named it after Scandinavian fruit: Cloudberry. Renting Cloudberry, a large barrel sauna designed for off-grid use, with a changing room, a wood stove and sauna rocks, costs $650 for one or two nights, and there are weekly prices, too.
A group of young Finns booked it for their yearly crawfish event and for Thanksgiving, and there are winter dates available. Grentz delivers Cloudberry and enough firewood for at least 15 hours burning time on a 14-foot trailer anywhere within a two-hour radius.
Those outside this range can seek rentals on SaunaShare.com or rationalize the splurge as one might a car. Kaps of Clearlight, whose saunas cost $5,500 on average, swears his product is worth it: “It’s not like that piece of equipment you buy and don’t use; if you sit in it, it’s going to make you feel great.”
Maybe too great. Ksenia Avdulova, 32, who installed a sauna at her tiny cabin near Callicoon, New York, has a 30-foot walk from her sauna to her tiny cabin, which she considers her “cold therapy” post-heat. She stargazes, recently saw a 22-degree halo on an almost full moon, has heard coyotes and once even found the remains of their prey, a baby deer.
“Sometimes I think, what if a wolf approaches me on my way back from the sauna and kills me?” she said. “It wouldn’t be a bad way to die — I feel so amazing.”

NEW YORK — A woman drove her car into a crowd of protesters on 39th Street and Third Avenue in Manhattan just after 4 p.m. Friday, injuring at least six people, police said.
A video posted on Twitter shortly after the incident showed protesters standing close to a black BMW sedan on Third Avenue, with at least one of them slapping its windows.
The car surged forward, flinging protesters to the ground, then sped through an intersection, striking more pedestrians — some on bicycles — with a sickening crunch, the video shows.
Sofia Vickerman, 18, a freshman at New York University, said she was in the middle of the pack of protesters when she heard screams coming from the front of the march. “Bodies were in the air and bikes were flying,” she said.
Christian Resseguie was chanting “free them all, free them now” moments before he heard a car accelerating behind him. The next thing he saw was protesters strewn around the intersection.
“I saw lacerations, broken bones,” said Resseguie, a civil rights lawyer from the Lower East Side. He said the protesters who bore the brunt of the crash were bicyclists who had taken on the responsibility of controlling traffic for the day’s march.
A security camera from a shop near the intersection recorded the car as it careened through several protesters on bicycles, knocking several of them to the pavement, according to a second video posted online.
Police said that the people hit by the car were being treated at nearby hospitals and that none of them had life-threatening injuries. They said that the driver, who was not immediately identified, was being questioned at a local precinct, but her intentions were not clear and it was not known whether she would face charges.
Another video posted online by a bystander showed a redheaded woman believed to be the driver being taken into custody by police as demonstrators shouted at her from the sidewalk.
One protester was also taken into custody for interfering with emergency medical services as they tried to help one of the victims, police said. It was not clear whether the protester would be charged with a crime.
The protesters were marching in support of Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainees on a hunger strike, according to people at the march. Patch reported Thursday that several detainees in a New Jersey jail had been on a hunger strike for nearly a month, prompting protests in New Jersey and New York. ICE officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Vickerman said the protest had started in Times Square and had made its way downtown, with police trailing on bicycles. She then saw the car driving through the crowd of protesters. She said she did not hear or see the motorist show any signs of aggression before hitting people.
Resseguie, a veteran activist, said that he wasn’t surprised by the incident considering similar altercations between motorists and demonstrators, including a car that drove into a group of protesters in Brooklyn in June and one that accelerated into a dense Black Lives Matter protest in Times Square in September.
“This isn’t going to dissuade me from continuing to demonstrate and to show up for my community,” he said.

The media said we should look to South Korea. Now coronavirus cases are surging there, too

Texto completo: Arrogant liberals in the media have enjoyed pointing to other countries with low coronavirus infection numbers. Their point was something along the lines of, "See? They got it under control, and we haven't, and it's all because of Trump!"
The funny thing is, it often happens that a few days later, the country they are extolling sees a surge in case numbers.
If we weren't talking about a virus that has killed more than 1.5 million people worldwide, it would be funny.
South Korea is the latest in that pattern.
The New York Times on Thursday reported that South Korea has seen an explosion of coronavirus cases across the country in recent days, which authorities are not sure they can keep from spreading until a vaccine becomes available for the population. That's not expected until March.
"Previous waves [of infections] included mass clusters that health officials were able to target and trace," the New York Times reported. "The current wave spread through numerous small clusters that erupted in nursing homes, hospitals, saunas, bars, restaurants, music halls and factories, most of them in the Seoul metropolitan area, but also in towns farther away."
Na Seong-woong, a deputy commissioner of the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency, told the paper that "the current wave is neither temporary nor regional, but steady and nationwide. and that there isn't “one central cluster that we can shut down with a focused testing and isolating campaign."
That's a lot like what pretty much the rest of the world has seen, even if at one point we were told that South Korea was doing everything right and we dummies in the United States, led by President Trump, were doing everything wrong.
The New York Times could hardly contain itself back in March, heralding South Korea as a model of the appropriate government response to a pandemic.
"As global deaths from the virus surge past 15,000, officials and experts worldwide are scrutinizing South Korea for lessons," the paper said at the time. "And those lessons, while hardly easy, appear relatively straightforward and affordable: swift action, widespread testing and contact tracing, and critical support from citizens." For emphasis, the New York Times noted that, "For all the attention to South Korea’s successes, its methods and containment tools are not prohibitively complex or expensive." That glowing tribute came under the blaring headline, "How South Korea Flattened the Curve."
Why can't we do it like the Koreans?!
It turns out that, just as we knew all along, unless a country's government is willing to wipe out its economy completely, throw tens of millions of people into poverty, and prepare for years of high unemployment numbers, a highly contagious, airborne virus will do what it's programmed to do — spread.
This is not unlike what has happened in Europe. Germany was supposedly doing all the right things to shut down the virus while Trump and Republican governors were doing moronic, ignorant things, such as moving workers back to their jobs and businesses.
The New York Times, back in April, showered praise on Germany because of the government's "level of engagement and a commitment of public resources in fighting the epidemic." Then October came around, and positive cases skyrocketed. On April 4, when that New York Times story was published, Germany was averaging a little over 5,000 new cases per day. As of Thursday, it's averaging more than 20,000 per day.
It's no one's fault. Viruses spread, and humanity is limited in what it can do to stop them. If the media hadn't been so deeply invested in making the pandemic political and turning it into Trump's fault, they would have been telling you this truth all along.

Congress, Paralyzed on a Stimulus Deal, Gives Itself Another Week to Strike One

WASHINGTON — After months of fruitless haggling and a frenzied few days of revived talks, Congress missed yet another deadline Friday to deliver an economic stimulus package to help struggling Americans weather the pandemic, instead agreeing to extend government funding for an additional week as leaders continued to search for a deal.
The Senate approved a one-week stopgap bill to keep federal spending flowing until next Friday, securing additional time for negotiators to hammer out both a catchall spending package and an elusive coronavirus aid compromise that has divided them since summertime. Leaders have said they planned to merge the two packages should agreement be reached.
While President Donald Trump signed the temporary funding bill and kept the government from shutting down, it remained unclear whether seven days would be enough for lawmakers to complete the dozen must-pass annual spending bills and break through their impasse over providing relief to millions of Americans, small businesses and schools and funding efforts to distribute a vaccine.
Time is waning for lawmakers to resolve policy divisions, with a number of government programs and policies that are helping insulate millions of Americans from the economic consequences of the pandemic set to expire in the coming weeks. An estimated 12 million workers could lose jobless benefits when two federal programs that expand and extend the unemployment insurance system expire this month, and a federal moratorium on evictions lapses Dec. 31 without administrative action.
Support for the stopgap measure, which overwhelmingly passed the House on Wednesday, was widespread enough in the Senate that it ultimately passed by voice vote. But the private wrangling before the vote Friday forecast how difficult it will be for lawmakers to strike an agreement on the first infusion of pandemic relief since April and the broader funding package.
An unlikely bipartisan pair, Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Josh Hawley, R-Mo., warned that they planned to try to force a vote on legislation that would send another round of $1,200 checks to Americans if that provision was left out of a deal, with Hawley promising “an interesting week” ahead in the Senate.
“If I have anything to say about it — and I guess I do — we’re not going to go home for the Christmas holidays unless we make sure that we provide for the millions of families in this country who are suffering,” Sanders said on the Senate floor.
Sen. Mike Braun, R-Ind., had also resisted voting on the stopgap bill without the promise of a vote on a measure to end the threat of government shutdowns, and it was unclear if he and other conservative allies would try another blockade.
Lawmakers and aides planned to work through the weekend to haggle over a stimulus plan and the broader spending package. Signaling that the negotiations could bleed into the holidays, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California noted Thursday that Congress had previously worked through Christmas in the absence of an agreement.
An omnibus package may include legislation that would end the practice of “surprise medical billing,” which is when a patient is unexpectedly treated by a doctor who does not take their insurance, after top lawmakers reached a bipartisan, bicameral agreement.
The current proposal would protect patients from surprise bills, and would require insurers and medical providers who cannot agree on a payment rate to use an outside arbitrator, who would determine a payment amount based partly on what other doctors and hospitals are typically paid for similar services.
Pelosi said in a statement Friday night that the House planned to push for the legislation to be included in a final spending package.
But on the matter of providing additional pandemic relief, the two policy divides that have long impaired a deal — Republicans’ insistence on sweeping coronavirus liability protections and Democrats’ demands to provide an infusion of federal funds for states and cities facing fiscal crises — remain sticking points.
Democrats and some Republicans have argued that providing another round of relief for cash-short state and local governments is critical to avoid laying off city workers. But many Republicans have derided the proposal as a so-called blue-state bailout that could be used to close preexisting budget shortfalls that were a result of mismanagement, not the economic fallout from the pandemic. Democrats have likewise warned that a sweeping liability shield prioritized by Republicans is a nonstarter, arguing that there has not been a surge in lawsuits related to the pandemic, and offering blanket protections against such suits would serve only to weaken worker protections.
Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the majority leader, has suggested jettisoning both provisions to get a swift agreement on a narrower package that would include funding vaccine distribution and the Paycheck Protection Program, a popular loan program for small businesses. But some lawmakers are reluctant to resort to that, citing the urgency of addressing the toll of the pandemic.
“These problems don’t go away,” said Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, who is part of the group that is working on a bipartisan $908 billion compromise framework. “If anything, they just get bigger. So if we can just stick to it, get a proposal that we can advance that resolves not only goals like unemployment, PPP, food security, but also the state and local and tribal and the liability issue — this is what we’ve been working on. This is what we need to keep doing.”
President-elect Joe Biden again signaled his support for a smaller relief package Friday, saying at an event in Wilmington, Delaware, that “this relief package won’t be the total answer even if it gets passed, but it’s an important first step.”
But the $908 billion framework that moderate lawmakers have labored over remains unfinished even after days of private meetings and negotiations. Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., told reporters that “it is proving to be extremely difficult to close” the gap on liability protections.
Should a final agreement and legislative text emerge, it is expected to include some form of limited legal protection for coronavirus-related lawsuits, $160 billion in state and local funding, billions of dollars for schools, businesses and vaccine distribution, and $300-a-week supplemental federal jobless payments until the spring.
The proposal, for now, does not include direct payments in the form of stimulus checks. But Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 2 Republican, suggested that in exchange for removing funding for state and local governments, a compromise plan could include another round of direct payments.
“You wouldn’t be able to get as much as they’re talking about, but it would still be a pretty significant direct payment to people out there,” Thune said as he left the Capitol. “I think there’s a whole range of things that both sides agree on, and we ought to do today what we can agree on, and leave the other issues for another day.”

NEW YORK — Although most indoor live performances have been banned in New York since the coronavirus began its deadly spread in March, about a dozen people turned up Wednesday night at Birdland, the jazz club near Times Square, for a 7 p.m. performance that was billed as dinner with live jazz. They had reservations.
Among them was Tricia Tait, 63, of Manhattan, who came for the band, led by tuba player David Ostwald, which plays the music of Louis Armstrong. Until the pandemic hit, it had performed most Wednesdays at Birdland. She admitted to health worries “in the back of my mind,” but said, “Sometimes you just have to take a chance and enjoy things.”
Birdland, and a number of other noted jazz clubs and piano bars across the city, were quietly offering live performances again, arguing that the performers were playing “incidental” music for diners, and that the music was therefore permitted by the pandemic-era guidelines set by the New York State Liquor Authority. But the shows will not last long: Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Friday that he would close all indoor dining in New York City beginning Monday, citing troubling signs of the virus’s spread.
“We’re going to close,” Ryan Paternite, the director of programming and media at Birdland, said after the announcement. “We’re not going to flout the law.”
That the performances had been taking place at all was perhaps surprising, given that the number of daily new coronavirus cases in New York City has been climbing to levels not seen since April, in-person learning has been suspended at public middle schools and high schools, and most other indoor shows were banned.
But the clubs argued that they were following guidelines from the liquor authority, which state that “only incidental music is permissible at this time” and that “advertised and/or ticketed shows are not permissible.” The guidelines continue: “Music should be incidental to the dining experience and not the draw itself.”
That was enough for a number of New York venues that are better known for their performances than their cuisine — including Birdland, the Blue Note and Marie’s Crisis Cafe, a Manhattan piano bar that reopened Monday with a show tune singalong after declaring itself a dining establishment — to begin offering live music again.
“We think it’s incidental,” Paternite said of its calendar of performances that included a brass band and a jazz quartet. “It’s background music. That’s the rule.”
The state rules have been challenged in court. After Michael Hund, a Buffalo guitarist, filed a lawsuit in August challenging them, a judge in the U.S. District Court in the Western District of New York issued a preliminary injunction last month preventing the state from enforcing its ban on advertised and ticketed shows.
“The incidental-music rule prohibits one kind of live music and permits another,” the judge, John L. Sinatra Jr., wrote in his Nov. 13 decision. “This distinction is arbitrary.”
The state is appealing the ruling.
“The science is clear that mass gatherings can easily turn into superspreader events, and it is unconscionable that businesses would attempt to undermine proven public health rules like this as infections, hospitalizations and deaths continue to rise,” William Crowley, a spokesman for the liquor authority, said Thursday.
He noted that a federal judge in New York City had ruled in another case that the restrictions were constitutional. He said the state would “continue to vigorously defend our ability to fight this pandemic whenever it is challenged.”
But it is far from clear what, exactly, “incidental” music means. Does that mean a guitar player in the corner? A six-person jazz band like the one that played at Birdland on Wednesday night? The Harlem Gospel Choir, which had been set to perform at the Blue Note on Christmas Day?
Crowley did not respond to questions seeking further clarity Thursday, or about what enforcement actions the state has taken.
Robert Bookman, a lawyer who represents a number of New York’s live music venues, said venues interpreted the ruling as allowing them to advertise and sell tickets for incidental-music performances during dinner.
So venues had been choosing their words carefully. They were taking dinner reservations and announcing calendars of lineups for what Paternite, of Birdland, characterizes as “background music during dinner.” Unlike Mac’s Public House, the Staten Island bar that declared itself an autonomous zone and was recently lampooned on “Saturday Night Live,” they have no interest in openly flouting regulations.
Paternite said Birdland, after laying off nearly all of its 60 employees in March, came back with a “skeleton staff” of about 10.
“It’s a huge risk for us to be open,” he said. “And it only brings in a pittance. But it helps us out in our agreement with our landlord, because to pay our rent over time and stay current on our utilities and taxes, we need to stay open. But we’re losing massive amounts every day.”
Cuomo, in announcing the pending closure of indoor dining, called for federal aid to help bars and restaurants survive, and for a moratorium on commercial evictions.
If venues are unable to reopen now, Paternite fears, they may never do so. The Jazz Standard, a beloved 130-seat club in Manhattan, announced last week that it would close permanently because of the pandemic. Arlene’s Grocery, a club that hosted the Strokes before they became well known, said it was “on life support” and, without aid, would have to close Feb. 1.
Randy Taylor, the bartender and manager at Marie’s Crisis Cafe, said the last time the piano bar had served food was probably in the 1970s — or perhaps earlier.
“There’s a very old kitchen that’s totally disconnected upstairs,” he said. Its dining options had been extremely limited: It was offering $4 bowls of chips and salsa. “We are required to sell them,” he said. “We can’t just give them away.”
Shortly before the indoor dining ban was announced, Steven Bensusan, president of Blue Note Entertainment Group, said he hoped it could be avoided.
“I know cases are spiking,” he said. “But we’re doing our best to keep people safe, and I hope we can continue to stay open. We’re not going to be profitable, but we have the ability to give some people work who’ve been with us for a long time.”
The clubs said they had been taking precautions. At the Blue Note, which reopened Nov. 27, the formerly shared tables were 6 feet apart and separated by Plexiglas barriers, and its two nightly dinner seatings were each capped at 25% capacity, or about 50 people.
At Marie’s Crisis Cafe, where masked pianist Alexander Barylski was ensconced behind clear shielding Wednesday night as he led a jubilant group chorus of “Frosty the Snowman,” Taylor said tables were separated by plastic barriers and that the venue conducted temperature checks and collected contact tracing information at the door.
Marie’s Crisis Cafe had been livestreaming shows on Instagram and its Facebook group page, but Taylor said it wasn’t the same. On Wednesday night, 10 customers belted out holiday tunes through masks, some sipping their first drinks at a venue since March.
“There have been some tears,” Taylor said. “People really, really missed us. We can’t see their smiles through their masks, but their eyes say it all.”
He said he heard the news that indoor dining would be banned again while he was at Sam’s Club buying more chips and salsa for the bar.
“We’re closing and locking everything down, but we’ll be ready to go whenever we can go again,” he said. “It makes me sad because I had such a great night last night.”

In a reflection of debates nationwide over whether to keep classrooms open during the current surge in coronavirus cases, about 100 teachers in Arizona’s third-largest school district staged a sickout Friday, demanding that schools close after winter break and stay remote until the region’s infection rate declines.
The protest in the Chandler Unified School District, a sprawling string of suburbs east of Phoenix with 46,000 students, was planned in opposition of the district’s recently announced plan to continue with in-person instruction in January despite a steep rise in infections in the region, according to a letter that teachers sent to the district Thursday.
“When we returned to in-person learning, teachers and parents did so with the understanding that if any ONE metric went into the red, we would return to virtual learning,” the letter states. “We were also assured that we would not be expected to teach virtually and in-person at the same time. Both of those promises have now been broken.”
The sickout represents a small fraction of the district’s 2,000 teachers, and the district said it had found enough replacement teachers to keep all its schools open. But it underscores the anxiety of many teachers in a county that has reached new peaks in coronavirus infections and deaths in recent weeks.
Both the state and Maricopa County, home to the Chandler school district, set single-day case records within the past week, and Maricopa County added more cases Thursday than almost any other county in the United States. This month, both parents of a Chandler High School student died hours apart of complications related to COVID-19.
The protest also reflects the contentious debate over the safety of in-person instruction that is playing out in many of the nation’s school districts as another wave of the pandemic continues to wash across many states.
Responses have differed widely from state to state and even district to district, as elected officials, teachers unions, parents and school administrators have debated how to balance health and safety issues with concerns that students are losing out educationally under remote instruction. The nation has about 13,000 school districts, most of which are run by independently elected school boards.
In November, Kentucky ordered all schools, including private ones, to close temporarily and shift to remote learning, while Michigan ordered all high schools to halt in-person instruction temporarily. But many districts in Georgia, Texas and Florida, where Republican governors have been adamant about keeping schools open, have resisted closing classrooms even as virus cases surged this fall.
Providence, Rhode Island; Los Angeles; and Miami-Dade County have all seen cases rise sharply in recent weeks — yet all have responded differently.
Providence has reduced density in its high schools by shifting 10th and 11th graders to remote learning but has kept ninth and 12th graders attending every other day. Los Angeles Unified School District, the country’s second largest, has only held remote classes this semester and will do so for the foreseeable future. And the Miami-Dade school district continues to have students who opted into in-person instruction visit classrooms five days a week.
The patchwork of approaches is even visible within Arizona. Some of the Chandler school district’s neighbors in Maricopa County have shifted to virtual or hybrid instruction during the surge, plan to in the near future or have postponed reopening.
Paradise Valley Unified School District, north of Phoenix, moved to remote instruction just before Thanksgiving because of a rising tide of virus cases. The district’s superintendent resigned this week, reportedly because of threats from people who want classrooms reopened.
Chandler Unified School District began the year fully remote and staggered the return to classrooms by age groups. But it also allowed students to enroll in its “online academy,” a separate all-remote curriculum that has attracted between 9,000 and 10,000 students, district officials said.
On Wednesday, when the school board voted to maintain in-person instruction, it also agreed to allow in-person students in seventh through 12th grades to take classes remotely for at least the first two weeks of January, using the same online platform that serves students in quarantine. The district requires social distancing and face coverings in all schools, officials said.
But the teachers who joined the protest want the district to go completely remote in January and stay closed until the virus transmission rate has declined to what they deem a safer level. They have also requested a role in the process of deciding between in-person and remote instruction.
“Our educators are exhausted and stretched to their breaking point,” said the Chandler Education Association, a teacher advocacy group.
More than three-quarters of the district’s students are attending all of their classes in person, with the rest receiving all-remote instruction.
“We encourage staff to report to work in the best interest of their students and colleagues,” the district said in a statement. “We understand this is a stressful time and invite teachers to work directly with administration as we seek ways to lessen any negative impact on them.”
