Texto completo: Former vice president Joe Biden is accustomed to fielding questions from voters about picking a running mate. But on Monday, he was asked a particularly provocative one: Would he consider choosing a Republican as his vice president?
“The answer is I would, but I can't think of one now," Biden said at a town hall-style event in Exeter, N.H., drawing laughter from the crowd.
“There are some really decent Republicans that are out there still, but here's the problem right now of the well-known ones: They've got to step up," he said.
Biden has emphasized the need for a future Democratic president to work with Republicans, stressing the importance of consensus to get things done.
On Monday, Biden made a point of noting that it was presumptuous to talk about a running mate, given that he has not won the Democratic nomination. As for his own vice presidential pick, Biden noted that there were “a lot of qualified women" and “a lot of qualified African-Americans."

Bernie Sanders is in 'good health,' his doctors say
Senator Bernie Sanders on Monday released three letters from doctors declaring him healthy, nearly three months after he had a heart attack while campaigning in Las Vegas, and disclosing that he no longer needed some medications relating to the attack.
One of the letters, dated Dec. 28 and signed by Dr. Brian P. Monahan, the attending physician of Congress, characterized Sanders as “in good health currently."
“You have been engaging vigorously in the rigors of your campaign, travel and other scheduled activities without any limitation," Monahan wrote.
Detailing Sanders' recovery from the heart attack, Monahan disclosed that some of the medications he initially required, such as a beta blocker and a blood thinner, have been discontinued “based on your progress."
Sanders, 78, also released letters from two cardiologists at the University of Vermont about his recovery from his heart attack, with one, Dr. Martin M. LeWinter, saying his recovery had been “uneventful."
Sanders' health has been under scrutiny since early October, when he experienced chest pains during a campaign event in Las Vegas. He then had two stents inserted into an artery. His campaign did not reveal that he had suffered a heart attack until after he was released from the hospital three days after being admitted.
New York Times
Judge dismisses suit from former White House aide
A federal judge on Monday dismissed a lawsuit from a former White House official who had challenged a congressional subpoena in the impeachment inquiry involving President Trump.
Charles Kupperman, a former deputy national security adviser, sued in October after being subpoenaed by House Democrats to testify in their impeachment investigation into Trump's interactions with Ukraine. He had asked a judge to decide whether he had to comply with that subpoena from Congress or with a conflicting directive from the White House that he not testify.
Both the House of Representatives, which withdrew the subpoena, and the Justice Department, which had said it would not prosecute Kupperman for contempt of Congress for failing to appear, had asked the court to dismiss the case as moot. US District Judge Richard Leon agreed Monday in throwing out the case.

Texto completo: The Washington Post
Millions of smartphone users globally got an unpleasant surprise this holiday season. ToTok, one of those "free, fast and secure" messaging apps they used to chat with family and friends, was a spying tool designed by the government of the United Arab Emirates. Americans ought to be alarmed by the news, but they also ought to be alarmed by something else: Our private data isn't actually private, either.
The New York Times obtained a cache of location information from 12 million phones that combine together for 50 billion geographic pings. Each phone user is captured by thousands of dots on a map that, when connected, reveal the most intimate details of his or her day-to-day life. Seemingly innocent apps, from jewel-swapping games to weather services, soak up our movements and sell them to brokers who in turn sell them to advertisers. The entire enterprise is completely legal.
That a massive market for location data exists isn't a revelation, but viewing so vast a collection of information in so concentrated a place still is revelatory. The Times was able to track Inau guration Day protesters, follow scientists at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, trace a Post journalist through Arlington, Virginia and even travel in President Donald Trump's digital footprints as he lounged at Mar-a-Lago and golfed at his club in Jupiter, Florida.
The data was safe in the Times's hands, but what about the hands of an enemy state seeking to blackmail an intelligence operative, or an abusive husband trying to find his fleeing wife? And what about the idea of ambient privacy - our ability to move through the world without the knowledge that someone, somewhere, is always watching?
Many have used the Times report to call for the regulation of location data, which, as the paper's analysis makes manifest, can never be truly anonymized. They're right to ask for that, but they should ask for more along with it: a comprehensive privacy framework that looks beyond a single category to restrict how companies collect, keep, process and share our personal information.
That framework should put an emphasis on what data companies reasonably need to gather (much less sell) to provide a service, rather than what data they'd like to collect to fill their coffers.
The Times's project and those that have come before it reveal that it doesn't take a plot by a repressive regime to get people to surrender to surveillance. It takes only pages on pages of opaque terms of service and a legal landscape free of restraints. Perhaps if members of Congress could see their own thousands of dots moving across a map, they would finish the work they started more than a year ago and produce the robust law the country deserves.

Mast gives advice at synagogue: Be prepared

Texto completo: The note affixed to the door at the Chabad of Palm Beach Gardens warns those who wish to enter that “All bags, vehicles and persons may be subject to search … Photo IDs may be required.” Armed security man the doors. And Rabbi Dovid Vigler assures that the center spends “many, many thousands of dollars” on security — a topic so sensitive, he declines to detail it further.
But after a weekend in which a machete-wielding man felled five Hasidic Jews in New York and a gunman opened fire in a Texas Church of Christ, killing two, the leaders at the synagogue say they wanted to hear from and be heard by their elected and government officials
On the last day of Hanukkah, a holiday intended to celebrate the miracle of enduring light over the darkness of oppressors, the guest list at the synagogue just west of Florida’s Turnpike included U.S. Rep. Brian Mast, R-Palm City, the local assistant police chief, Marty Bechtel, and Gardens Councilman Matthew Lane.
One takeaway Mast and several around him took from the weekend’s violence — the targets fought back, no doubt saving lives. Indeed, the Texas shooter was himself shot dead within seconds by a member of that church’s volunteer security team.
“I always said on the battlefield I wasn’t going to die for lack of shooting back,” Army veteran Mast told the crowd.
“Are you saying worshippers should be shooting back?” questioned the audience.
“Absolutely,” Mast said.
“There’s always been a need to guard places of worship. … Jews have had to defend themselves in the face of evil for thousands of years,” Mast said. “Train. Go out and train. Be prepared to defend yourself and the ones you love.”
Police can’t be everywhere, Mast said. He told his audience he is comforted knowing that security teams are in place at Christ Fellowship Church where he worships.
The local police also are playing an integral security role in places of worship, said Bechtel.
The city’s department works with congregations to keep accurate building schematics on hand and coordinate active-shooter training.
Instances of anti-Semitic acts are on the rise nationally, according to the Anti-Defamation League, which counted 1,879 such incidents, including more than 1,000 involving harassment, in 2018. The organization has yet to tally figures for 2019 but it estimates the numbers will meet or exceed last year’s.
The uptick in violence is particularly palpable in New York City, where anti-Semitic crimes have jumped 21% in the past year, The New York Times reported. Across the state, anti-Semitic incidents from harassment to murder have totaled in the 300s this year and last, according to ADL tracking.
In Florida, the numbers including harassment, vandalism and assault have been trending higher in the past seven or eight years, but peaked at 137 in 2016 and then dropped into double digits in 2017 and 2018, according to the last annual report issued in May.
Most of those incidents happened in South Florida, including several in Palm Beach County. The local offenses, none involving violence, included unwelcome email screeds to a Jewish organization’s general inbox, a swastika etched on a home doorpost, a defaced sign at a synagogue and a middle school girl on the receiving end of an anti-Semitic text from a classmate.
But by the time incidents rise to the level of a police or media report, it’s gone too far, said Lonnie Wilk, director of ADL Florida.
“In most cases, perpetrators don’t start at the point of violence,” Wilk said. That has to be cultivated or learned. And it begins with acts of bias, jokes, rumors or stereotypes. “When that goes unchecked it can easily elevate to bullying and slurs.”
“Hate can become normalized,” Wilk said. To get to the base of the problem, the ADL advocates for anti-bias training in schools, where students learn what Wilk and the ADL refers to as the “pyramid of hate.”
At least one congregant at Monday’s gathering stood to ask Mast how he could support President Donald Trump, whom she described as “the most hateful president we’ve ever had.”
But before she could finish her question, her voice was lost in a sea of “boos” and met with a chorus of retorts including, “This is not a political forum. This is the wrong place.” And “Run for Congress.”
“Take your hate somewhere else.” “Shame on you.” And “Write a letter.”
After the room was hushed, Mast said, “I do support our president. He doesn’t hate somebody for being Muslim or of color or being Jewish or any other thing. The policies he undertakes … are policies to make sure we have a safe nation.”

It’s Not Anti-Semitic To Criticize Israeli State

Texto completo: When I was a Jewish kid growing up in suburban Los Angeles, we thought being Jewish meant supporting Israel.
If you identified as Jewish, the religious education we got, the youth groups we joined, and the summer camps where we played were all grounded in one thing. It wasn’t God - it was Zionism, the political project of settling Jewish people in Israel.
We never asked, and no one ever taught us in Sunday school, who already had been living on that land, long known as Palestine, when European Jews arrived around the end of the 19th century and started building settlements there.
My own break with Zionism came in my mid-20s, after reading the letters of Zionism’s founder, Theodor Herzl, imploring Cecil Rhodes, the leader of British land theft in Africa, to support his work in Palestine.
Today, younger Jews are asking hard questions at earlier ages, and more of them have been actively critical of Israel in its assaults on Palestinians and Palestinian rights.
When the Trump White House says that criticizing or boycotting the state of Israel is anti-Semitic and issues an executive order that aims to shut down criticism of Israel on college campuses, many Jewish students aren’t buying it. One 20-year-old Jewish student and Hillel member at the University of North Carolina told The New York Times that she worried the executive order “falsely equates anti-Zionism with anti-Semitism” and is targeted at eliminating criticism of Israel.
Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and adviser, claims that the executive order is intended to make sure that Jews are protected by the Civil Rights Act’s “prohibition against discrimination based on race, color, or national origin.”
He says that the executive order does not define Jews as a nationality, but he goes on to proclaim that “anti-Zionism is anti-Semitism.” This formulation essentially labels Jews, along with Palestinians and all others, who don’t support Zionism as anti-Semitic.
Jews come in all races, colors and ethnicities. The Trump/Kushner view is an insidious way of claiming that Jews all are somehow linked to or accountable to Israel. That charge of “dual loyalty” is one of the oldest anti-Semitic canards around.
Of course, even as the Trump administration tries to silence criticism of Israel, real anti-Semitism is rising, especially during the Trump administration. We know what it looks like.
Anti-Semitism looks like the attack on a synagogue outside San Diego. It looks like Pittsburgh, where the alleged Tree of Life synagogue killer accused Jews of “bring(ing) invaders in that kill our people” by supporting refugee resettlement. It looks like Klansmen and Nazis shouting “Jews will not replace us” in Charlottesville, Virginia.
That anti-Semitism comes from the violent white supremacists operating publicly and proudly. Those anti-Semites are still reveling in the support of the president, who called them “very fine people” after Charlottesville.
Real anti-Semitism also is coming directly from a president who tells Jewish Republicans that he doesn’t expect their support because he doesn’t need their money, who invites to a White House Hanukkah party a Christian pastor who says Jews who don’t convert to Christianity “are going to hell,” and who asserts that Jews will “have to vote for me, you have no choice” because Democrats are proposing tax hikes on millionaires and billionaires.
Trying to suppress criticism of Israel even as Israel’s government becomes ever more repressive of Palestinian rights won’t work, especially when the White House itself is surrounded by anti-Semitism
Likewise, insisting that anti-Zionism is anti-Semitism doesn’t make it true. A new generation of young Jews, and a whole bunch of us who aren’t so young anymore, know that’s wrong.

Full Effects Are Often Hidden in the Bottom Line

Texto completo: New taxes should be a big expense for many companies. But they have found a way around disclosing it in annual reports.
Armed with legions of lobbyists, companies have been pushing hard -- and successfully -- to weaken new federal taxes that take aim at overseas tax havens.
Many of them have managed to avoid publicly disclosing how much they owe under the new taxes. Without such figures, it becomes virtually impossible for outsiders to work out how much companies are saving from the watered down tax rules.
In theory, this opacity should not exist. United States securities regulations have long required public companies to disclose even relatively minor tax expenses. Over the past year, this requirement has led to a small number of companies revealing the effect of the new taxes on overseas income.
Yet many others -- including some longtime users of tax havens -- appear to have found ways around disclosing how the overseas taxes will affect them.
How the new taxes are supposed to work
President Trump's 2017 tax law did not just cut taxes for companies. It also introduced new provisions aimed at discouraging the practice of routing income through countries with ultralow taxes.
One of those was a tax on "global intangible low-taxed income," known as GILTI, which acts as a minimum tax on certain profits that companies earn abroad. GILTI was expected to hit corporations that appeared to be paying almost no tax on their overseas income.
In 2016, for example, Facebook's foreign taxes were only 3 percent of its foreign profits. By taxing income that flows through offshore havens, the GILTI initiative was supposed to bring in tens of billions of dollars for the United States Treasury and to partially offset the revenue lost from the 2017 law's deep tax cuts.
What companies should reveal
United States securities laws require publicly traded companies to provide detailed explanations of their taxes in their annual reports. Specifically, companies must reveal any individual tax expenses (or benefits) that exceed 5 percent of what is known as their statutory income tax expense.
Say a company had $ 100 in income. At today's 21 percent corporate federal income tax rate, its federal income tax expense would be $ 21. Under the disclosure rule, that company would have to divulge any particular tax expenses that exceeded $ 1.05 (5 percent of $ 21).
For companies that were big users of tax havens before the passage of the 2017 law, the GILTI tax was expected to be a significant new expense -- and one that would presumably have to be individually disclosed. A small number of companies, including Netflix and Bristol Myers, the pharmaceutical giant, did so in their 2018 annual reports.
But many of the companies that were most likely to face a large bill from the new tax -- like Apple, Google, Microsoft and Facebook -- have not disclosed how much the GILTI tax took out of their earnings.
Understanding the GILTI silence
The lack of disclosure may be masking the financial impact of how the Trump administration is writing rules governing how the 2017 tax package is enacted. Under pressure from corporate lobbyists, the Treasury Department has allowed multinational companies to partly or completely avoid taxes on certain overseas income.
Tax experts told The New York Times that the impact of those weakened rules, while hard to measure precisely, is likely to exceed $ 100 billion.
The companies' silence about what they actually are paying under the GILTI makes it hard to quantify the true costs of the Treasury's rules.
It's possible that some companies did not reveal how much the GILTI tax was costing them because, after accounting for tax credits and other factors, the amount fell below the 5 percent threshold. Microsoft said that was the case with its GILTI tax in its 2019 fiscal year.
But other companies appear to have bundled GILTI together with other tax expenses and benefits in a way that makes the cost invisible. Facebook, for example, quantifies "the effect of non-U. S. operations" on its overall tax liability. And Apple provides a number for its taxes on "earnings of foreign subsidiaries."
The cost of the GILTI tax is most likely lumped into those categories, tax experts said. Over the years, they say, corporate auditors -- who have to review and sign off on companies' financial disclosures -- have adopted a loose reading of the tax-disclosure rule, enabling companies to combine items that are not directly related.
Facebook did not respond to a request for comment. Google declined to comment. Apple said in an emailed statement, "Since 2008, Apple's corporate taxes have totaled over $ 100 billion. We pay all that we owe according to tax laws wherever we operate."

Texto completo: A reader says there is "zero indication of a stirring of conscience in the Senate" over impeachment. Also: The deaths of Don Imus and the songwriter Jerry Herman.
To the Editor:
Re "A Stirring of Conscience in the Senate" (editorial, Dec. 28):
Senator Lisa Murkowski voted against the appointment of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. She also opposed repeal of the Affordable Care Act, voted "no" on the appointment of Betsy DeVos as education secretary, and called President Trump's policy of separating families at the border "cruel." Now she says she is "disturbed" by Mitch McConnell's pledge to coordinate with the president's legal team on impeachment.
Ms. Murkowski has been falsely touted on numerous occasions as a glimmer of hope that Republicans might break with Mr. Trump. Let's not get carried away. There is zero indication of a stirring of conscience in the Senate. Ms. Murkowski is not a Republican trendsetter. She's a lone voice of independence in a G.O.P. Senate whose members have lost their appetite to think for themselves.

To the Editor:
Re "Don Imus, an Equal Opportunity Offender for 50 Years, Is Dead at 79" (front page, Dec. 28):
I'm sad to hear of the death of Don Imus. While he stepped over the line later in his career, he pioneered the fusion of politics, culture, satire and raunch in ways that changed radio and morning cable TV. He got politicians and pundits to play and make news they didn't intend.

To the Editor:
Am I the only Times reader who wishes the prominent front-page obituary in Saturday's paper was about Jerry Herman, whose heartfelt talent thrilled and delighted generations of theater lovers, rather than Don Imus, whose language and attitudes helped make acceptable the kind of public discourse that has, to everyone's detriment, become ubiquitous today?
Instead Mr. Herman's obituary ("Jerry Herman, 88, Composer of 'Hello, Dolly!' and Other Broadway Hits") was relegated to the back of the paper.

Texto completo: Mr. Sanders released three letters from doctors with details about his health, nearly three months after he had a heart attack while campaigning in Las Vegas.
DES MOINES -- Senator Bernie Sanders on Monday released three letters from doctors declaring him healthy, nearly three months after he had a heart attack while campaigning in Las Vegas, and disclosing that he no longer needed some medications relating to the attack.
One of the letters, dated Dec. 28 and signed by Dr. Brian P. Monahan, the attending physician of Congress, characterized Mr. Sanders as "in good health currently."
"You have been engaging vigorously in the rigors of your campaign, travel and other scheduled activities without any limitation," Dr. Monahan wrote.
Detailing Mr. Sanders's recovery from the heart attack, Dr. Monahan disclosed that some of the medications he initially required, such as a beta blocker and a blood thinner, have been discontinued "based on your progress."
"Your heart muscle strength has improved," he added. "You have never had symptoms of congestive heart failure. The heart chamber sizes, wall thickness, estimated pressures, and heart valves are normal."
Mr. Sanders, 78, also released letters from two cardiologists at the University of Vermont about his recovery from his heart attack, with one, Dr. Martin M. LeWinter, saying his recovery had been "uneventful."
Dr. LeWinter, the attending cardiologist at the University of Vermont Medical Center and Mr. Sanders's personal cardiologist, also said that Mr. Sanders had experienced "modest heart muscle damage" but that his heart function was now "stable and well-preserved."
"At this point, I see no reason he cannot continue campaigning without limitation and, should he be elected, I am confident he has the mental and physical stamina to fully undertake the rigors of the presidency," Dr. LeWinter wrote.
Mr. Sanders's health has been under scrutiny since early October, when he experienced chest pains during a campaign event in Las Vegas. He then had two stents inserted into an artery. His campaign did not reveal that he had suffered a heart attack until after he was released from the hospital three days after being admitted.
In October, Mr. Sanders said he would release his medical records by the end of the year, vowing that they would be "comprehensive." Letters from doctors are not the same as full medical records, but his campaign said that the information Mr. Sanders revealed was in line with what other candidates typically release.
According to the letter from Dr. Monahan, Mr. Sanders's most recent physical examination, on Dec. 19, showed that he was 6 feet tall and 174 pounds. His blood pressure was 102/56, with a pulse of 62 beats per minute. His total cholesterol was 117 milligrams per deciliter of blood, HDL cholesterol (or "good" cholesterol) was 32 milligrams, and LDL cholesterol (or "bad" cholesterol) was 58 milligrams.

Texto completo: The man accused of injuring five after breaking into a rabbi's home in New York kept journals that contained anti-Semitic views and referenced Adolf Hitler.
Grafton Thomas, 37, allegedly broke into the home of Rabbi Chaim Rottenberg and stabbed five people with a machete on Saturday night as the group gathered to celebrate the seventh night of Hanukkah. On Monday, prosecutors filed hate crime charges against Thomas, according to the New York Times.
Law enforcement officials announced that they found handwritten journals that referenced Hitler, showed swastikas, and promoted anti-Semitic views, according to the complaint filed against Thomas, which was signed by FBI Special Agent Julie S. Brown. There were also references to "Nazi culture," and he also asked “why ppl mourned for anti-Semitism when there is Semitic genocide," according to the Associated Press.
Thomas's phone also revealed a search history of phrases like, “Why did Hitler hate the Jews” and “German Jewish Temples near me.” On the day of the attack, his phone pulled up an article titled “New York City Increases Police Presence in Jewish Neighborhoods After Possible Anti-Semitic Attacks. Here’s What To Know.”
His family has since claimed that Thomas suffers from mental illnesses and had been hospitalized previously. "He has no history of like violent acts and no convictions for any crime,” his family said late Sunday in a statement issued by attorney Michael Sussman. “He has no known history of anti-Semitism and was raised in a home which embraced and respected all religions and races. He is not a member of any hate groups.”
“We believe the actions of which he is accused, if committed by him, tragically reflect profound mental illness,” the statement went on.
The attack at Rabbi Rottenberg's home marks the 14th apparent anti-Semitic crime in the New York area, according to the Anti-Defamation League. The attack follows the deaths of four people when two shooters opened fire inside a Jewish market in New Jersey earlier this month.

Gunman kills 1 at Texas church before being shot

Texto completo: A gunman walked in to a North Texas church and opened fire Sunday morning, killing one person before being fatally shot by parishioners, authorities said.
The "heroic actions" abruptly ended the shootout at the West Freeway Church of Christ in White Settlement, about 10 miles west of Fort Worth, Police Chief J.P. Bevering said. He provided no information on the motive for the attack.
MedStar Mobile Healthcare spokeswoman Macara Trusty said one person died at the scene, one died on the way to the hospital and one was in critical condition. She said all the victims were male.
"It's tragic and it's a terrible situation, especially during the holiday season," said Jeoff Williams, a regional director with the Texas Department of Public Safety. "We have a couple of heroic parishioners who stopped short of just anything that you can even imagine, saved countless lives."
Licensed handgun owners can legally carry loaded weapons into Texas churches that do not have posted signs banning weapons. Church security became a major concern in the state after a gunman walked into a church in Sutherland Springs two years ago and shot 26 people to death and wounded 20.
Authorities provided few details on the shooting. A witness told CBS11 News the gunman walked up to a server during Communion with a shotgun and began firing until another church member shot the suspect.
"It was the most scariest thing," Isabel Arreola told the TV station. "You feel like your life is flashing before you."
Mike Tinius, a church elder, told The New York Times that one of those killed was a security guard and friend who responded to the shooter. Tinius said that he didn't know the gunman and that the shooting appeared to be random.
The security guard "was trying to do what he needed to do to protect the rest of us," Tinius said.
Gov. Greg Abbott issued a statement of condemnation for the "evil act of violence" at a place of worship.
"I am grateful for the church members who acted quickly to take down the shooter and help prevent further loss of life," Abbott said.
White Settlement is a city of about 17,000 people in Tarrant County. Mike Drivdahl, spokesman for the Fort Worth Fire Department, said his department was assisting city and county authorities. Bomb-sniffing dogs were on the scene, he said.
Drivdahl said he did not know how many people were attending the service when the shooting started.
"It's a very tragic day whenever anyone in our community suffers."

More than two decades on, Fore Street gets better and better The granddaddy of Portland's farm-to-table ethos stays blissfully true to its mission.

Texto completo: Twenty minutes too late to spot the lead actor from a popular HBO series, I take a seat in Fore Street's bar room. The woman to my left and her boyfriend can't wait to tell me about him.
"He sat right where you are now. He and his girlfriend just sat down, and they literally did not talk the whole time," she says to me in breathy, hurried tones as she pulls out her phone to unveil the amateur paparazzi photos she snapped of the couple when they weren't paying attention.
There's Eric Dane (or someone who looks uncannily like him, his face partly obscured by the photographer's finger), scanning the evening's freshly printed menu. Look, there he is again, mouth open as a forkful of turnspit-roasted Quebec pork enters blurrily from the right of the frame.
In another half-hour, I'd be enjoying my own order of the herby pork sirloin ($28), one of executive chef Sam Hayward's signature dishes that - crusted with an electrifying coriander, juniper and black pepper rub - answers the unspoken question: What if Montreal steak seasoning were bumped up to first class?
And just like the actor who occupied my seat at the well-worn concrete bar, I can't speak as I eat. It isn't my choice, but my focus telescopes so that all I can think about is the plate in front of me.
Mea culpa to the bartender: I genuinely didn't hear you ask if I wanted another ramekin
Please see dine out, Page F5
of whipped salted butter for the torn remains of the quartered Standard Baking baguette in front of me. Time and again that evening and during a repeat visit a few days later, I kept losing track of my surroundings.
I swear I wasn't being rude - just blissfully preoccupied by my meal.
Considering that Fore Street turns 24 this coming year, that's a remarkable statement. Co-owners Dana Street and Sam Hayward have, for more than an entire generation, through all of the rapid phases of evolution that have seen Maine blossom into a real culinary destination, maintained their staunch commitment to seasonal menus driven by local suppliers.
The entire staff seems to understand the centrality of this ethos. Cooks and servers alike can tell you precisely which farms produce most components of your meal, even when they are sourced ... rather unusually. When I ask head chef Daniel Young to tell me about the squash used in a phenomenal buttery puree served alongside an undercooked wood-grilled pollock ($28), he laughs as he confesses, "It's some kind of heirloom squash. I'm not saying that because I forgot the name, but Frank Gross doesn't know the name of it either. He's a farmer who has been growing food for Sam and for Fore Street for over 20 years. We never order any food from him. He just shows up with whatever came out of his field, and we buy it because it's good."
Not knowing what's coming in to your kitchen makes menu planning a challenge, which is why Fore Street's chefs improvise, rewriting the menu every day. That's no exaggeration: Two days after my first visit, I returned to find components of many dishes tweaked, some eliminated, and at least three new menu items added to the list. Every meal is like dipping your toes into the currents of Heraclitus' famous river: You'll never have precisely the same experience twice.
"Our dynamic ability to write the menu every day is beautiful, special and unique," said Young, who until early this year helmed kitchens for celebrity chef Michael Symon. "It forces you to think and approach the food new every day. You could never come in and just phone it in. The versatility of changing the menu causes happy accidents, which is one of the reasons why I say it's the most interesting restaurant I've ever eaten at or been a part of."
Hayward and Street are no strangers to praise. In addition to Hayward's 2004 "Best New Chef: Northeast" award from the James Beard Foundation, Fore Street has often been showcased in Maine travel guides and food-focused profiles of Portland. Five years ago, this paper's then-reviewer swooned over the restaurant's "always changing but always extraordinary menu" and "wood space that never seems too crowded or too empty." I could have written much of that five-star review today.
Take pastry chef Peter Robbins' oversized caramel pot de crÃ¨me, spiced with star anise, capped with a torched dollop of bittersweet, marshmallowy Italian meringue and plated with a pair of snappy molasses cookies that judder with clove and cinnamon ($11). Had I tasted this dish just a week earlier, before my filing deadline, it would have topped my list of the best desserts I ate in 2019.
Robbins' chocolate-mousse-topped dacquoise of walnuts, hazelnuts and pecans ($11) wouldn't have trailed far behind, although the plate's true scene-stealer is an exquisite scoop of ice cream made by steeping cream with star anise, vanilla and hunks of snowy coconut meat.
Not everything at Fore Street is perfect. In addition to the underdone (and aggressively salted) wood-roasted Gulf of Maine pollock I mentioned, service occasionally grows absent-minded, especially if you dine late. On my second visit, one of the floor's servers kept abandoning his tables to report scores from a Patriots game to his colleagues. At one stage, a woman from his section stood up and waved him down with a napkin.
Still, it is a small miracle that a restaurant as old as Fore Street can count its minor lapses on one hand. And for every one of them, a countervailing triumph more than balances the scale.
On my first visit, it was a side order of carrots from Goranson Farm in Dresden ($8) that won my heart: steamed until al dente, then blasted in the raging wood oven. As their miniature cast-iron pan is retrieved from the flames, the oblique-cut, blistered French Bolero carrots get tossed in a coriander-orange vinaigrette and freckled with locally foraged sumac.If you're after a less-expensive way to enjoy Fore Street, this is your ticket. Order the carrots and a glass of the lemony Torbreck Barossa Valley Semillon ($11), and you'll leave satisfied, yet not stuffed, and just $25 lighter after tax and tip.
Indeed, light (and less costly), mostly plant-based meals are easy to assemble at Fore Street, even in the winter. That's due in no small part to Hayward and Street's enduring relationships with local farmers willing to dedicate valuable hoop house real estate to greens like succulent winter purslane (aka miner's lettuce) from Bowdoinham's Dandelion Spring Farm.
In the Northern Spy apple salad ($15), a generous thicket of the delicately tart greens get a drizzle of aged balsamic, olive oil and finely rasped, field-frozen ginger preserved in rice wine vinegar. The inflammatory tartness of the dressing and sweetness from crunchy fruit and fire-roasted parsnips conspire to create a fascinating illusion: You'll taste cranberries, even though there are none on the plate.
Believe me, I searched for them, dislodging candied hazelnuts from the salad's summit and teasing apart crimson radicchio from miner's lettuce. I must have spent 15 minutes alternating small bites with bewildered rummaging through the contents of my plate. My server mentioned later that he came by to ask how the salad was, but I didn't even notice. I was, once again, happily transfixed.

Texto completo: We tracked your interest, and these are the year's most-viewed listings.
Every week, we track the most-viewed listings on The New York Times's Find a Home site and report back to our readers. Now, with 2019 nearly behind us, we've tabulated the most popular listings of the year. With an average list price of more than $ 16 million, a strong curiosity for lavish lifestyles is clearly on display. Only one property, a West Village one-bedroom, was listed under $ 1 million.
5. Undulating Glass Walls
$ 16.3 MILLION | 194 Roxborough Drive, Toronto
The fifth-most popular property of 2019 was this six-bedroom, 17,000-square-foot, undulating home built in 2010. It was second most popular in our combined March and April edition of this roundup, and first in May. It's still available.
Broker: Chestnut Park Real Estate Limited, Brokerage

4. Presto, Chango!
$ 899,000 | 78 Charles Street, No. 5W, West Village
In fourth place was this Manhattan one-bedroom, which appeared in every monthly roundup starting in August. Along the way its price was reduced (from $ 950,000), and recently the apartment was spruced up with a snow-white paint job.
Broker: The Corcoran Group
3. Beaux-Arts on Fifth
$ 50 MILLION | 854 Fifth Avenue, Upper East Side
Third most popular, after appearing in our Top Five roundups in January and February (continuing its streak from the end of 2018) was this 20,000-square-foot, 17-bedroom, 15-bath home with eight levels of ornately decorated spaces and 10 rooms facing Central Park. It's off the market, according to Zillow.
Broker: Douglas Elliman

2. Park Avenue Classic
$ 2.695 MILLION | 1133 Park Avenue, No. 3 West, Upper East Side
In second place was this three-bedroom, two-bath corner unit that was most popular in January and February. Listed for $ 3.25 million by Brown Harris Stevens and eventually for $ 2.695 million by Warburg, it's now under contract.
Broker: Warburg Realty Partnership
1. Magical Acres
$ 11.8 MILLION | 5225 Renner Road, Lake Quivira, Kan.
This seven-bedroom retreat packed with amenities on 18 acres was the most popular listing of the year after holding the top spot in August and September and then sliding to third in October. Located 15 miles from Kansas City, its most curious features are scuba tunnels to a grotto with a waterfall.
Broker: Crown Realty

Assassins in Florida?

Texto completo: People wanted Charles Abbe dead. Abbe was a northerner, a postmaster, a progressive businessman and worse, a Republican in a mostly Democratic county.

So when Abbe's wife, Charlotte, heard the shots from a half-mile away on Dec. 27, 1884, she felt a rising panic. Charles could have been the one. He was.

The triggerman and his accomplice let a man who was with Abbe run away unharmed, to later testify about the crime.

The men dragged the postmaster's bleeding body through the sand and onto a boat, leaving bits of Abbe's brains on the ground.

Then they sailed through Big Pass and threw the body "to the sharks," wrote the Chicago News.

The New York Times called them the "notorious Sarasota Assassination Society." At its peak, there were as many as 20 men in the vigilante group at a time when the area had about 60 families. They shot a farmer on horseback before slitting his throat, and they terrorized Charlotte before shooting her husband in broad daylight with both barrels of a shotgun 135 years ago on Friday.

On Christmas day, two days prior to the murder, the men plotted Abbe's demise in the parlor of Alfred Bidwell's house. Bidwell, the Buffalo, N.Y. transplant from a wealthy family, was later convicted, as a member of a secret society of vigilantes and for helping to mastermind Abbe's murder.

Bidwell is long gone. So are the nine men who were indicted in the murder, the seven who were found guilty and sentenced to death by hanging or life behind bars. Two escaped from prison. The others were pardoned long before Scottish settlers arrived and Sarasota was incorporated as a city.

But Bidwell's one-half story wood frame house still stands, surviving hurricanes, relentless summers and the city that grew up around it. It's the area's oldest building and has been moved three times. Walking through it, the stairs creak, and the windows hardly seem storm-worthy. Today, the parlor, where the murder was planned, is decorated for Christmas. Little white fabric snowflakes hang over the fireplace. There's a Christmas tree nearby. On the wall is a copy of Bidwell's obituary. Printed in a Jacksonville newspaper, it talks of his narrow escape from a hanging, his commutation and a jailbreak.

Then there is the screenplay, resting on Sue Blue's lap. Blue is a former vice president of the Historical Society of Sarasota County and leads the Sarasota history trolley tours. She wrote "Mr. Bidwell" over a decade ago to help raise money to save this place.

Blue cast former Sarasota Mayor Lou Ann Palmer and former County Commissioner Jon Thaxton to re-enact the trial in the historic Sarasota courthouse.

Harold Bubil, the Herald-Tribune's real estate editor, played the clerk of court. Tom Lyons, a former Herald-Tribune columnist, was cast as Bidwell, the accused. He was represented by a local attorney who specialized in DUI cases. Unlike the real Bidwell, Lyons was found not guilty.

Research and writing the screenplay gave Blue some insight. For one thing, shooting Abbe, in broad daylight, with a shotgun that was infamous for firing the second barrel right after the first, was a silly idea.

"That would be a ridiculous way of carrying out a murder," said Blue. "I'm sure the real plan was more thoughtful."

Abbe moved with his wife and two daughters in the 1870s. That was a time when most people lived in shanties and slept on beds with their children. His problems were many. For one thing, Abbe was successful. He owned a great deal of what is now downtown Sarasota. He was a shrewd investor and bought up a lot of land along the waterfront.

Abbe was ambushed and murdered in front of Bidwell's store on Cunliff Lane, Sarasota's then sandy main street. The gunman, Charlie Willard, and his accomplice, Joseph Anderson, hid behind a corner of Bidwell's store as Abbe passed by. His body was never found.

Newspapers across the country ran stories of vigilantes loose in the South. As far away as New York, newspapers carried stories of Bidwell's arrest and an attempted suicide. In his hometown, The Buffalo Sunday Morning News reported his family's incredulity. His family continued to be supportive of him, eventually getting him pardoned. He sold his house for one dollar.

Bidwell's house has survived, thanks to the efforts of people like Arnie Berns. On March 14, 2009, Sarasota's oldest building was rededicated in Pioneer Park as the home of the Historical Society.

Texto completo: When I was in grade school, I didn't know anything about stocks or savings accounts, but I did know something about running a grocery store. You see, I operated one in the basement of my home.
Indeed, my store had boxes of oatmeal, cereal and pancake mix, along with tomato paste and other canned goods. All were on display on shelves next to my checkout stand - a card table with a white sheet on top. I even had a toy cash register to hold pennies and cardboard currency.
Every now and then, my mom would restock my shelves, buy some items and have me count out the exact change owed to her.
Full disclosure: My grandparents owned a small, neighborhood grocery store in Omaha where I would spend many a day under their watchful eyes. So, a play store was a natural for me.
I remember these early playful buying and selling experiences about money matters and the business world vividly.
I mention this now because the holiday season presents a great opportunity for parents to give their kids experiences to help them learn about money. No lectures or instructional videos necessary.
"With research telling us that most Americans could not handle a $400 expense if it came up, we need to start earlier than ever reaching and teaching kids about money through experiences," said Susan Beacham, a children's financial literacy expert and creator of the award-winning Money Savvy Pig bank.
There's plenty of research on this topic.
A recently released study published in JAMA Pediatrics on children's brain development found that preschoolers who spent less time in front of computer screens had better brain development, especially in language skills.
Dr. Perri Klass, who wrote about the findings in a November New York Times story, advised parents to provide kids with "human experiences like being there, interacting, talking, playing, singing, asking and answering questions, and of course, reading" for their brains to develop optimally.
This study supports a 2013 report by researchers in the United Kingdom who concluded that it is more impactful for children to learn from experience than learning through instruction, particularly in the first four or five years of their life.
Parents, creating learning opportunities is not that difficult, and it doesn't require scanning a website list of frequently asked questions or watching a YouTube video. You simply need to get involved, be a little bit creative and encourage your kids.
Here are some ideas:
*With younger kids, think about my grocery store experience. Create something similar by repurposing all those empty cardboard boxes that are stacking up in your garage. Perhaps buying a toy shopping cart or a cash register with play money can launch a grocery store or a restaurant.
*Give your kids a wallet or purse to carry money around. It should spark conversations about wants and needs, delayed gratification and making good choices with money. Piggy banks work, too.
*With older kids, there are games, including classics such as Monopoly, Life and Pay Day, or newer ones like Franklin's Fortune and Grandpa Beck's Cover Your Assets.
*If your youngster like to read, check out "Swindle," about a sixth-grader who discovers a rare Babe Ruth baseball card in an old house.

One Step Too Many In A.A.

Texto completo: Women who drink too much need help. But we don't need to give up our power.
I got sober in 2013. It took me about six months to transition from throwing back a few bottles of wine or pints of cheap whiskey a night to total abstinence.
I didn't go to Alcoholics Anonymous. I didn't go to 90 meetings in 90 days. I didn't have a sponsor. I didn't work the steps. Most important: I wasn't required to enumerate my character defects and work to eliminate them, or to buy into the idea that an outsize ego and lack of humility were the causes of my need to numb myself with alcohol.
My eschewing the status quo by refusing to use the program scared my loved ones, signaling to them that I wasn't taking my recovery seriously. I wasn't surprised. Participation in A.A. is not the only effective way to stop drinking, but we've been trained to believe that refuting or even questioning it means you're in denial.
The truth is, A.A. may be the foundation of global recovery, but it wasn't made with everyone in mind. It's a framework created in the 1930s by upper-middle-class white Protestant men to help people like them overcome addiction. Its founders believed the root of alcoholism was a mammoth ego resulting from an entitled sense of unquestioned authority.
A.A. was a miracle for those men who, until then, had almost nowhere to turn for help. It was radical in that it was free and it was fueled by an ethos of service. But it grew out of a fundamentalist Christian organization, the Oxford Group, and as a result, it is undergirded by the same belief system that asserts Eve grew from Adam's rib.
The values baked into its founding continue to shape the way the organization works, and it still has too many echoes for my liking of the ways women are expected to blame themselves, follow instructions and fall into line in a patriarchal society.
Participants are expected to accept the tenets of A.A. without question, and there is a common refrain that the program "works if you work it." In other words: Don't ask questions, and any failure is your own fault. The 12 steps include things like admitting powerlessness, turning one's will over to God, cataloging defects of character, asking God to remove those defects and making amends for any wrongdoing.
This program, which was designed to break down white male privilege, made sense for the original members: It reminded them that they were not God and encouraged them to humble themselves, to admit their weaknesses, to shut up and listen. Perhaps these were much-needed messages when it came to the program's original intended audience. (Keep in mind, this was just 10 years after women's suffrage, at the height of the eugenics movement and 30 years before the dismantling of Jim Crow.)
But today's women don't need to be broken down or told to be quiet. We need the opposite. I worry that any program that tells us to renounce power that we have never had poses the threat of making us sicker.
I know a lot of women in recovery, in my real life and social media social circles, and through the recovery program I run. They aren't drinking themselves numb because they are awash in oh-so-much power, or because of some pathological inability to follow rules or humble themselves, or because their outsize egos are running the show, as A.A.'s messaging would suggest. Quite the opposite: They're drinking because they have so little power, because all they've ever done is follow the rules and humble themselves, because their egos have been crushed under a system that reduces their value to subservience, likability and silence.
When I entered recovery, I didn't need to do a searching inventory to catalog all of my character defects. They had been played back to me my entire life by almost everyone around me. I was highly aware of the parts of me that were wrong, unruly and messy -- those things that made me unlovable, or worse, unladylike. Ever since I could remember, I'd asked God to take those parts away. I drank to feel a sense of wholeness that had been conditioned out of me by society, to combat a powerlessness that was my birthright as a woman.
Submitting to the rules of A.A. was the last thing I needed. Instead, I tapped into a combination of existing approaches to recovery. I focused on developing self-trust, agency, compassion, self-nurturing and a reclamation of the agency I'd given up.
The antidote to my drinking problem was learning it was safe to trust myself, developing a sense of confidence and rejecting the humility women are conditioned to embrace. I also turned a critical eye on the society that helped make me sick in the first place.
In other words, the antidote to my drinking problem looked a lot like feminism.
To be sure, A.A. works for many people, including many women, and has saved millions of lives. I don't want to see it dismantled or discourage anyone from trying it out -- I simply want more people to recognize it's not for all. There are many other evidenced-based options available now -- from medically assisted treatments to cognitive behavioral therapy to the emerging use of psychedelics including psilocybin. For most of the people I know who have found success in recovery, it isn't just one but a combination of treatments that ultimately works.
Women are the fastest-growing demographic becoming dependent on alcohol, which means we're on our way to being a majority of participants of recovery programs. There's no question that we need help. But we don't need to give up our power.

Many reasons exist to move to Topeka, Kansas

Texto completo: Although headlines have simplified Choose Topeka as a program that hands over cash to people who move to the city, the actual program is more nuanced. Local employers who hire out-of-town residents can offer between $ 10,000 and $ 15,000 to help cover moving expenses. If the new hires remain in Topeka for a year, Topeka’s economic development organization will reimburse the employer half of the expenses.
The program is based on a similar initiative, albeit with different requirements, in Tulsa, Okla.
Within days of the program’s launch, Choose Topeka became a national news story, with coverage from the New York Times, Fox Business, CNN, TIME and other national outlets. Much of the coverage was positive, but the program also brought some ridicule. Colbert joked that the program was needed because “Topeka’s current residents are all drivers who ran out of gas on their way to anywhere else.”
Topekans have shown their sense of humor by taking the punchlines in stride.
Days after the Colbert comments, a group of residents produced a video featuring a group of young people running out of gas and joining a friendly, enthusiastic party at a new downtown restaurant, their empty gas cans littering a corner near the bar.
Topeka-based clothing manufacturer Reliant Apparel quickly produced a line of shirts, patches and hats with the now-popular “Topeka: a Great Place to Run Out of Gas” slogan.
There are good reasons to move to the Sunflower State.
According to US Census Bureau data, home costs in Kansas are 36% lower than the national average, and lower still in Topeka. Seasonally adjusted unemployment rates released last week by the Bureau of Labor Statistics show Kansas at 3.1 percent, slightly below the national average at 3.5 percent. The capital city, specifically, is in the midst of a cultural renaissance that includes dozens of new downtown businesses, a growing arts district and a range of interesting attractions scattered among historic neighborhoods.
Choose Topeka is breaking new ground in the state. Economic incentive packages are common in Kansas, but most are focused on attracting and retaining businesses, or encouraging business expansion. Such initiatives are important, but a program that gives money directly to residents, even if through their employers, is a welcome addition to the mix of programs drawing new residents to Kansas.
Other Kansas communities should look carefully at the results of the program in the coming years and consider their own initiatives to bring new residents to their towns.
Thus far, the program has generated inquiries from thousands of interested applicants, an encouraging sign. Kansas will welcome new residents to Topeka, whether out of gas or at a full tank.

Texto completo: In 2019, the line between movies and television continued to blur, thanks largely to Netflix.
"The Irishman," "Dolemite Is My Name" and "The Two Popes" played at the Enzian Theater in Maitland before streaming on Netflix. "Marriage Story" screened in theaters elsewhere before arriving on Netflix. All those films are Oscar hopefuls.
The third season of "The Crown," Netflix's series about Elizabeth II, was every bit as good. Ten finely made episodes rolled into one epic, "The Crown" will gain a lot of Emmy love.
The caliber of filmed entertainment was encouragingly high this year, and there was so much of it that no list can be definitive. But here are titles that stood out: 10 on the film side, 10 on the TV side.
Film
'Parasite'
The year's most amazing film was "Parasite," South Korean director Bong Joon Ho's unusual thriller about two families, one affluent and one impoverished. The film initially seems a comedy about grifters but morphs into an escalating shocker, with echoes of Alfred Hitchcock, set against a lavish home.
'The Farewell'
Director-writer Lulu Wang based "The Farewell" on her own family's remarkable story. A family keeps a terminal diagnosis from a grandmother (Zhao Shuzhen) in China, then stages a wedding so relatives can spend time with her. Comedian Awkwafina was a revelation as a granddaughter who dislikes the ruse. Talk about unforgettable endings.
'The Irishman'
"The Irishman" was Martin Scorsese's strongest film in years, a sobering mob drama about the toll of violence. Robert De Niro shines as the aging hitman of the title. The film offers two classic supporting performances in contrasting styles: Al Pacino flashy as Jimmy Hoffa and Joe Pesci low-key as a mob boss.
'Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood'
Quentin Tarantino's "Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood" takes a loving look at movies and TV in 1969. Leonardo DiCaprio is hugely entertaining as a washed-up TV actor, and Brad Pitt has never been better as the actor's stunt double and emotional support. Tarantino writes a cathartic ending that affirms the power of storytelling.
'1917'
Sam Mendes' "1917," which arrives in Florida early next year, is a World War I drama with a shattering, you-are-there quality. Done in a style that resembles one take, the film has an emotional power that transcends technique. This one should be seen in theaters.
'Marriage Story'
Noah Baumbach's "Marriage Story" examines how outside forces transform a couple's initially amicable decision to split up. Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson are first-rate as the spouses.
'Little Women'
Greta Gerwig takes a fresh, feminist approach to the oft-filmed "Little Women." Saoirse Ronan makes a fierce, radiant Jo March, and Florence Pugh brings new depth to sister Amy.
'Jojo Rabbit'
Taika Waititi's inventive "Jojo Rabbit" examines World War II through a German boy's imagination. Zany comedy gives way to poignant drama in a film that is fable and a tribute to mothers.
'Waves'
Orlando filmmaker Trey Edward Shults broke through with "Waves," a family drama with an immersive style and a rich, colorful look. The high point: a scene between father (Sterling K. Brown) and daughter (Taylor Russell).
'Queen & Slim'
"Queen & Slim," about a couple on the run from the law, explores the divergence between what actually happened and the legend that follows. Daniel Kaluuya and Jodie Turner-Smith are exceptional as the couple in a vivid drama from director Melina Matsoukas and writer Lena Waithe.
Television
'The Crown'
The towering achievement in television was "The Crown," with Oscar-winner Olivia Colman coming aboard as Elizabeth II. She was matched by Tobias Menzies ("Outlander") as Prince Philip.
'Fleabag' and 'Modern Love'
Amazon Prime delivered two series to remember. Andrew Scott as Hot Priest electrified season two of Phoebe Waller-Bridge's "Fleabag." The anthology "Modern Love," inspired by the New York Times column, was an addictive delight for its offbeat stories.
'Country Music' and 'Leaving Neverland'
The documentary format was enriched by Ken Burns' epic "Country Music" on PBS and by the devastating "Leaving Neverland" on HBO. In the latter, two friends of Michael Jackson accused the pop star of abusing them as boys.
'David Makes Man'
"David Makes Man," a filmed-in-Orlando drama, was a moving drama about a conflicted African American teenager (Akili McDowell). OWN has renewed the risk-taking work from series creator Tarell Alvin McCraney.
'Evil'
CBS' creepy "Evil" proves that broadcast TV can still compete when it takes chances.
'Killing Eve,' 'Dead to Me' and 'The Kominsky Method'
Acting partnerships elevated other series: Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer in BBC America's "Killing Eve," Christina Applegate and Linda Cardellini in Netflix's "Dead to Me" and Michael Douglas and Alan Arkin in Netflix's "The Kominsky Method."

The Safdie brothers' pursuit of Sandler

Texto completo: There's a chance Adam Sandler could land an Oscar nomination for 'Uncut Gems' next month " perhaps a surprising development to those who can recall the comedian's numerous nods from the Razzies, which parody traditional award shows by honoring cinema's greatest failures each year.
While some point to Sandler's dramatic turns in 'Punch-Drunk Love' and 'The Meyerowitz Stories' as proof of his acting abilities, sibling filmmakers Josh and Benny Safdie credit his comedy records and some sillier roles " including 'Billy Madison,' 'Happy Gilmore' and even the Razzie-nominated 'Big Daddy' " as the reason they wanted him for their latest project. 'Uncut Gems,' which came out Wednesday, stars Sandler as Howard Ratner, a jeweler in Manhattan's Diamond District who tries to repay his gambling debts by auctioning off a long-sought-after rock from Ethiopia containing rare black opals.
As is to be expected, Howard's convoluted scheme doesn't quite go as planned " and the same could be said of 'Uncut Gems' itself. The buzzy thriller, inspired by stories the Safdies's father told them about his time working on the West 47th Street block, has been roughly a decade in the making. There were the usual delays " script rewrites and whatnot " but also the brothers' tireless pursuit of Sandler.
'He can ground these insane situations in reality to the point where you care and you're rooting for this character with all your heart,' Benny recently told The Washington Post over the phone. 'That was something we knew was important for Howard. He's going to test you, but you always need to love him and root for him.'
It took years to secure Sandler for a role that the Safdies, along with frequent collaborator Ronald Bronstein, seem to have written with the actor in mind. His team passed on the script upon first receiving it in 2011. It wasn't until Sandler witnessed the giddy chaos of 'Good Time,' the Safdies's 2017 film starring Robert Pattinson as a bank robber that premiered at the Cannes Film Festival, that Sandler asked, per Benny, 'Look, who are these guys and why do they want to meet with me?'
The answer surprised him " Howard, as Benny recalled Sandler saying, 'is not a good guy.' The Safdies have continually described him as lovable, if not likable. He's the lying, cheating, philandering protagonist of a film that Variety compared to a 'protracted heart attack,' and yet you can't help hoping his ploys work out in the end. Sandler's magnetic screen presence is undeniable, but it's his ability to make the careful distinction between lovable and likable that could cast him into the tight race for best actor.
'He could see it,' Benny said of Sandler. 'It's like Rodney Dangerfield, [Howard] gets no respect. All he wants to do is get to that seat at the table. He's a dreamer and wants something larger than himself.'
Although Sandler grounds 'Uncut Gems,' his performance is just one of many out-of-the-box elements " the Safdies, for instance, rewrote parts of the script each time they cast a role. Howard's wife, Dinah (Idina Menzel), and their children rose in prominence at Sandler's request. The brothers asked Julia Fox, a newcomer who steals scenes as Howard's mistress, how she would react to certain situations. The film takes place in 2012 in part because casting former Celtics player Kevin Garnett as a version of himself meant it would make sense to feature games from the Eastern Conference semifinals that year.
This all served a sense of realism, which extends to the frenetic soundscape, as well. In Howard's store, which was built on a sound stage, you can hear five conversations at once, layered atop Midtown street sounds, Daniel Lopatin's score and a high-pitched beep each time the showroom's door opens.
Of that beep, Benny said: 'To me, that's the one sound that makes the entire space feel real. . . . When the front door is open, everybody needs to know. That little noise can do so much. It's all in the details. When you add them together, it creates a full sense of the world.'
That world can be overwhelming to the senses, but then so can New York City. The Safdies depict their hometown with a gritty honesty perhaps akin to that of Martin Scorsese, an executive producer on 'Uncut Gems.' At the mention of Scorsese's name, Josh, who was sick at the time of the phone call and trying to rest his voice as much as possible ahead of recording DVD commentary, piped up anyway to praise 'one of the masters and monsters of the art form.'
'When he got on board, it was a shot of adrenaline,' Josh said. 'It raised the profile. When he puts his name on something and brings it up, he's basically saying, 'You should see this film.' That's unbelievable. Him putting his belief behind something means a lot. I guess, yeah, the fact is that we can't help but be inspired by him. The characters he puts on screen, the emotional complexity of those people, the camera movements and the way he explores life is so " it's evergreen.'
Much has been made of Scorsese's recent comments that Marvel films aren't cinema. ('It's absurd that was even a controversy,' Josh said.) But the New York Times op-ed Scorsese penned in reaction to the hullabaloo wound up being a thoughtful piece that, per Josh, explored how movies are 'documents that really allow us to question human behavior and really look at it in a microcosmic way.'
Scorsese states in the op-ed that an essential component of cinema is 'the unifying vision of an individual artist,' describing something immediately apparent in the Safdies's film. (In this context, they operate together as that artist.) Each of their projects favors an empathetic, if not always sympathetic, view of its flawed characters. This was true of 'Good Time,' as well as of 'Heaven Knows What,' their raw 2014 film about a heroin addict that led Pattinson to approach them about collaborating.
Such characters give 'Uncut Gems' its title, according to Benny. They're 'rough and ugly on the outside' but can be fascinating once you look below the surface. As with the opal, which Garnett's character regards as a magical token of good luck but that Howard values only for its monetary worth, you have to put in the work to see that beauty. The Safdies mine for what lies beneath Howard's loathsome behavior.
'Howard may be doing bad things, but he's not a bad person,' Benny said. 'It wouldn't work with anybody else. We looked at other actors, but it never fully made sense. It was really only when Sandler hopped on board that we really could take it home.'

Whicker: Santa Anita turns to technology in effort to limit horse tragedies

Texto completo: They will not quit running into each other. They will not quit having heart attacks, or clipping the heels of their competitors. They will not stop getting sick.
But maybe more thoroughbreds will get through this Santa Anita meet alive, thanks to a scanner that deepens the power of probability.
Santa Anita is the first track to use the Mile-Pet Scanner, developed by the veterinary medicine department at UC Davis.
Its purpose is to find things inside a horse’s leg, specifically the ankles, that will cause a problem today and tomorrow.
It will not eliminate tragic outcomes on the racetrack, but the hope is it will keep unfit horses in the barn and perhaps reduce the 2019 death toll of 37, capped by Mongolian Dream in the last steps of the last race of the Breeders’ Cup in November.
Forget all the championship performances that preceded it that weekend, before the arrival of the dreaded Green Screen. The New York Times headlined it like this: “Another Horse’s Death Overshadows Vino Rosso’s Win At Breeders’ Cup Classic.”
According to Dr. Andrew Spriet of UC Davis, the Mile-Pet finds trouble spots in two ways.
“Before, we could only see the images in two dimensions,” he said. “Now we can use three dimensions.
“And before, we could focus on the structural problems. This allows us to see what the molecular issues might be, and we can take action before it becomes a bigger injury.”
Dr. Dionne Benson is the chief veterinary officer for the Stronach Group, which owns Santa Anita. She points out that most of the concerning injuries involve the ankle, specifically the sesamoid bones.
We have sesamoids, too, but horses have three of them inside each limb, and they provide anchor points for the ligaments. Heavy work can cause the ligaments to rub against those bones and cause damage, which, until now, couldn’t always be seen by imaging technology.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and other scans have been involved in racing for many years. But in order to properly examine a horse, you needed comprehensive anesthesia, when the horse has to lie down.
“They can’t tell us how they’re feeling coming out of anesthesia,” Dr. Benson said, “and when they do wake up it can be dangerous for them and the people working with them.”
UC Davis found a scanning technique that bypassed all that. The horses are still sedated, but they are still standing. They can be guided into a wheeled device shaped like a ring that compresses tightly around the leg.
“Since horses can sleep standing up,” Dr. Benson said, “this makes the procedure simpler and also faster.”
Spriet said four horses were recently scanned at UC Davis in a span of 35 minutes. Nine horses at Santa Anita have been examined with the Mile-Pet technology.
Still, there has to be a trigger mechanism to send a horse to the new scanner.
Trainers who feel a horse isn’t reacting normally, or even if the horse’s performance has slipped inexplicably, can ask for a Mile-Pet scan, which begins with the injection of an isotope.
“A lot of people have a misconception about a bone, as if it’s made of steel or some other substance,” Benson said. “A bone is a very active thing, and it changes, particularly after exercise. What this technology does is show us what’s going on before there is a fracture.
“It’s always a challenge, but 80 percent of the problems involve the sesamoid or something else in the fetlock area.”
Spriet emphasizes that the Stronach Group’s investment is a prime reason this technology has become available. There have been complaints about the manner of Santa Anita executives, particularly when it comes to pressuring trainers to fill out fields with horses that the trainers feel aren’t ready to run. But Stronach management, particularly with Craig Fravel on board, seems to realize another 2019 is not survivable.
There are too many downward pressures on horse racing’s popularity, and too many trainers and top horses moving east and south for bigger purses, to tolerate Santa Anita’s image as an equine graveyard.
The track also plans to install a standing MRI at the Nuclear Medical Facility early in 2020.
Spriet has said the Mile-Pet will “transform the diagnostic approach for finding pre-existing conditions in horses.”
Naturally, the picket lines won’t dissipate if the death toll goes down. Nobody applauds a pilot for a safe landing. And the fingernail-chewing will not decrease Saturday when the new meet begins.
It is not about eliminating the risk. For the short term, it’s about eliminating confusion and dread from Santa Anita’s pre-existing conditions.

Texto completo: Hallmark Doesn’t Do Its Very Best
Last week, the Hallmark Channel pulled an ad featuring a lesbian wedding and, after a firestorm of protests, reversed itself and apologized. Hallmark pulled the ad after a protest by a group that calls itself “One Million Moms.” Before the reversal, WILLIAM “Capt. Kirk” SHATNER was one of Hallmark’s biggest critics. Shatner, 88, tweeted: “Shame on Hallmark Channel. Put the commercials back! 1milmoms has 4K followers. I have 2.5 million and my friends have more. Who are you going to listen to? They are NOT a majority here. Both me and my followers watch your shows, do they? ... Do the right thing.”
There wasn’t a firestorm about two new Hallmark Channel original holiday movies with Jewish characters that premiered this month (“Holiday Date” and “Double Holiday”). However, the films were so bad that the New York Times and the Washington Post published long, scathing reviews. The Post said they “relied on anti-Semitic tropes.” The Times was only a little kinder. Both thought “Holiday Date” was particularly egregious. The premise is that a woman hires a Jewish actor to play her boyfriend and join her at her family’s house for Christmas. The Times says it’s absurd that the Jewish fake boyfriend knew nothing about Christmas. The Post says the boyfriend’s “sneaky” role fits anti-Semitic stereotypes.
Year End Confession
Recently, I reviewed some of my previous columns and re-visited some mistakes I made that I spotted after the column was submitted. While I correct very rare serious errors in my next column, I am reluctant to use precious space to correct minor errors. This week I have some space. So, here goes: in my Sept. 26th column, I had an item on 2019 Jewish NFL players. I somehow omitted MITCHELL SCHWARTZ, 30, a Kansas City offensive tackle. An 8-year veteran and a former bar mitzvah boy, Schwartz was first team all-pro last season.
In my Oct. 3 column, I said that Nick Offerman appeared in “Lucy”, a NATALIE PORTMAN film. Offerman is in the film, but he isn’t Jewish. I knew that, but I guess my brain was somewhere else. Perhaps I was thinking of NICK KROLL, 41, who is Jewish and has been in a lot of things lately. Also on Oct. 3, I had a list of Jews who served as the political leader of their country. I should have included BRUNO KREISKY, who was chancellor of Austria (1970-83).
Briefly Noted
Parade Magazine reports that the bright colored lipsticks that characters on “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” wear got so many inquiries from viewers that Revlon has introduced a line called the “Marvelous Super Lustrous Collection”. Parade also reports that the lipstick colors used in the show are a planned signal about the character’s feelings. For example, if Mrs. Maisel, or another woman character, is wearing the bold “Fire & Ice” color, she is feeling strong. If she is wearing the slightly pinker “”Cherries in the Snow” color, she is feeling more vulnerable.
Some of this season’s “Mrs. Maisel” scenes were filmed on location at the Fountainebleu hotel in Miami. The hotel’s architecture is so “over-the-top” that for a long period of time most of the architecture establishment labeled it garish. Now, its exuberance is celebrated by most of the architecture world. Opened in 1954, the Fountainbleu was designed by architect MORRIS LAPIDUS (1902-2001), a Jewish immigrant from the Ukraine who marched to his own drummer.
NBC will air the special “The Paley Center Salutes Law & Order: SVU” on Thursday, Jan. 2, at 9PM. The series is now in its 20th season. I expect that RICHARD BELZER, 75, will appear on the special. He played the (Jewish) police detective John Munch for the first 15 “SVU” seasons. Before “SVU”, Belzer played Munch in 7 seasons of the series “Homicide Life on the Street.” The Belzer character was based on JAY LANDSMAN, a real life Jewish police officer.
As I write this, it is a day after the President’s impeachment and a day after Nancy Pelosi surprised everyone by delaying the transfer of the articles of impeachment to the Senate until she’s satisfied that a fair trial, including witnesses, will take place in the Senate. Immediately, better pundits pointed to an article in the Washington Post, published two days before the impeachment vote, by LAURENCE TRIBE, 78. In this article, he suggested the strategy that Pelosi is pursuing. A Harvard Law professor, Tribe has long been a top constitutional scholar.

Texto completo: They will not quit running into each other. They will not quit having heart attacks, or clipping the heels of their competitors. They will not stop getting sick.
But maybe more thoroughbreds will get through this Santa Anita meet alive, thanks to a scanner that deepens the power of probability.
Santa Anita is the first track to use the Mile-Pet Scanner, developed by the veterinary medicine department at UC Davis.
Its purpose is to find things inside a horse’s leg, specifically the ankles, that will cause a problem today and tomorrow.
It will not eliminate tragic outcomes on the racetrack, but the hope is it will keep unfit horses in the barn and perhaps reduce the 2019 death toll of 37, capped by Mongolian Dream in the last steps of the last race of the Breeders’ Cup in November.
Forget all the championship performances that preceded it that weekend, before the arrival of the dreaded Green Screen. The New York Times headlined it like this: “Another Horse’s Death Overshadows Vino Rosso’s Win At Breeders’ Cup Classic.”
According to Dr. Andrew Spriet of UC Davis, the Mile-Pet finds trouble spots in two ways.
“Before, we could only see the images in two dimensions,” he said. “Now we can use three dimensions.
“And before, we could focus on the structural problems. This allows us to see what the molecular issues might be, and we can take action before it becomes a bigger injury.”
Dr. Dionne Benson is the chief veterinary officer for the Stronach Group, which owns Santa Anita. She points out that most of the concerning injuries involve the ankle, specifically the sesamoid bones.
We have sesamoids, too, but horses have three of them inside each limb, and they provide anchor points for the ligaments. Heavy work can cause the ligaments to rub against those bones and cause damage, which, until now, couldn’t always be seen by imaging technology.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and other scans have been involved in racing for many years. But in order to properly examine a horse, you needed comprehensive anesthesia, when the horse has to lie down.
“They can’t tell us how they’re feeling coming out of anesthesia,” Dr. Benson said, “and when they do wake up it can be dangerous for them and the people working with them.”
UC Davis found a scanning technique that bypassed all that. The horses are still sedated, but they are still standing. They can be guided into a wheeled device shaped like a ring that compresses tightly around the leg.
“Since horses can sleep standing up,” Dr. Benson said, “this makes the procedure simpler and also faster.”
Spriet said four horses were recently scanned at UC Davis in a span of 35 minutes. Nine horses at Santa Anita have been examined with the Mile-Pet technology.
Still, there has to be a trigger mechanism to send a horse to the new scanner.
Trainers who feel a horse isn’t reacting normally, or even if the horse’s performance has slipped inexplicably, can ask for a Mile-Pet scan, which begins with the injection of an isotope.
“A lot of people have a misconception about a bone, as if it’s made of steel or some other substance,” Benson said. “A bone is a very active thing, and it changes, particularly after exercise. What this technology does is show us what’s going on before there is a fracture.
“It’s always a challenge, but 80 percent of the problems involve the sesamoid or something else in the fetlock area.”
Spriet emphasizes that the Stronach Group’s investment is a prime reason this technology has become available. There have been complaints about the manner of Santa Anita executives, particularly when it comes to pressuring trainers to fill out fields with horses that the trainers feel aren’t ready to run. But Stronach management, particularly with Craig Fravel on board, seems to realize another 2019 is not survivable.
There are too many downward pressures on horse racing’s popularity, and too many trainers and top horses moving east and south for bigger purses, to tolerate Santa Anita’s image as an equine graveyard.
The track also plans to install a standing MRI at the Nuclear Medical Facility early in 2020.
Spriet has said the Mile-Pet will “transform the diagnostic approach for finding pre-existing conditions in horses.”
Naturally, the picket lines won’t dissipate if the death toll goes down. Nobody applauds a pilot for a safe landing. And the fingernail-chewing will not decrease Saturday when the new meet begins.
It is not about eliminating the risk. For the short term, it’s about eliminating confusion and dread from Santa Anita’s pre-existing conditions.

Resumen: Here’s some of what it takes: * You need a legislative draftsman, someone who understands the specialized language of bill-writing and how to translate ideas into law; * You’ll almost certainly need several lawyers involved to steer clear of legal shoals, as well as budget experts who can handle cost estimates and projections; * It’s helpful to have someone who understands what constitutes ethical and unethical behavior in the field you’re addressing; * There are a lot of subject matters that play a role in almost any major problem: environmental, financial, security and military, logistics, health, education, international dimensions — and you’ll want to be able to consult with experts in all of them; * Because, almost invariably, you’re dealing with computer systems or actual machinery, it’s helpful to have the appropriate types of engineers on hand; * It’s often helpful to work with a historian or two who can put the problem in context; * You need people who are familiar with the private sector and understand what businesses and corporations can and cannot reasonably achieve, since so many issues today involve both the public and private sectors; * You have to be able to understand and cover the politics of your approach, meaning you need people who can bridge the White House and Congress or the governor’s office and the legislature; * Somewhere along the line you’ll need PR experts who understand radio, print, TV, and social media, since you’ll have to enlist the public, or at least win its support; * And, of course, you’ll need to figure out how to raise the money you’ll need, both through the public purse and from the private and nonprofit worlds. By and large, this country is served by a professional and dedicated group of public employees, whether you’re talking about the National Weather Service, the Foreign Service, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Defense Department ...

Texto completo: Not long ago, I was in a meeting to talk about a public policy issue. It was a little complex, and as we considered the various angles I began to think about what it would take to translate talk into change on the ground. I wasn’t analyzing the politics of it — I was focused on the types of people who’d have to roll up their sleeves.
What I came away with was a list of skills, none of them unusual, but all of them vital to getting things done in the increasingly complicated world that government faces. Here’s some of what it takes: * You need a legislative draftsman, someone who understands the specialized language of bill-writing and how to translate ideas into law; * You’ll almost certainly need several lawyers involved to steer clear of legal shoals, as well as budget experts who can handle cost estimates and projections; * It’s helpful to have someone who understands what constitutes ethical and unethical behavior in the field you’re addressing; * There are a lot of subject matters that play a role in almost any major problem: environmental, financial, security and military, logistics, health, education, international dimensions — and you’ll want to be able to consult with experts in all of them; * Because, almost invariably, you’re dealing with computer systems or actual machinery, it’s helpful to have the appropriate types of engineers on hand; * It’s often helpful to work with a historian or two who can put the problem in context; * You need people who are familiar with the private sector and understand what businesses and corporations can and cannot reasonably achieve, since so many issues today involve both the public and private sectors; * You have to be able to understand and cover the politics of your approach, meaning you need people who can bridge the White House and Congress or the governor’s office and the legislature; * Somewhere along the line you’ll need PR experts who understand radio, print, TV, and social media, since you’ll have to enlist the public, or at least win its support; * And, of course, you’ll need to figure out how to raise the money you’ll need, both through the public purse and from the private and nonprofit worlds.
My point is simple: To make our system and this country work, we need a lot of experts and competent bureaucrats to deal with the problems that come cascading down on government. And here’s what I can tell you, after decades of close contact with federal civil servants: We have them. By and large, this country is served by a professional and dedicated group of public employees, whether you’re talking about the National Weather Service, the Foreign Service, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Defense Department ... We’re blessed with a lot of talented people.
Which is why I’ve never shared the contempt and outright hostility toward federal bureaucrats that is so often expressed in the public arena these days. They deal with very tough problems and they’re usually good at what they do. They just don’t toot their own horns about it.
This was on full display in the recent House Intelligence Committee hearings on impeachment. As New York Times columnist David Brooks put it recently, "[T]he civil servant witnesses answering questions inspired a lot more confidence than the elected officials who were asking them." He went on to quote political scientist Hugh Heclo, "It is when you deal with someone who does not perform in a ‘professional’ manner that you learn to appreciate those who do."
This doesn’t mean that there aren’t some bad apples within the bureaucracy. There always are, but they’re rare. And most of the time, inspectors general, administrative processes, and, when it’s working, congressional oversight address the problems reasonably well. Attacking cabinet officials and civil service employees publicly, the way President Trump seems to enjoy doing, seems counterproductive. These are, after all, the very people he has to depend on to move his programs forward.
In the face of the many challenges we confront, the professionalism, talent, and competence of our civil servants matter. We’ve been fortunate: many of them have withstood attacks on themselves and the systems they depend on for support. So far.
Former Congressman Lee H. Hamilton is a senior adviser for the Indiana University Center on Representative Government.

California businesses at the breaking point due to minimum wage hikes

Texto completo: California’s minimum wage rises to $13 an hour on Jan. 1, and a number of its localities now have wage rates above $15 an hour.
Labor groups promised that $15 would be an economic boon for the state, while then-Gov. Jerry Brown worried that “economically, the minimum wage may not make sense.” The state’s experience with rapidly rising wage rates show the former governor was right to be concerned.
Consider the impact on the state’s full-service restaurant industry, which faces a double-whammy when the wage floor rises. California is one of a handful of states that doesn’t count tips towards an employee’s income; even if a server earns $300 on a Friday night, an effective wage rate of $60 an hour, his employer can’t count one cent of it towards the minimum wage requirement.
Restaurant owners are forced to give a raise to top-earning employees who take home far more than the minimum, with few options to offset the cost.
Paul Fraga, who announced he’s closing Sacramento diner Original Perry’s after more than 50 years in business, explained the dynamic. “For every dollar that [minimum wage] goes up, it costs me around $40,000…I can’t raise menu prices fast enough to compensate [for] that.” He added: “If they could sign a waiver, 99 percent of my servers would be against a minimum wage increase…”
Fraga isn’t alone in feeling the pinch from a rising minimum wage. Another affordably-priced option in town, the beloved Greek restaurant Opa! Opa!, announced that after 14 years in business it would be shuttering its doors. The owner said that since he first opened, prices have increased over 50 percent as a result of burdensome mandates placed on him by the state. Now, fourteen employees are left jobless right before the holidays.
These aren’t just anecdotes. Census Bureau data suggests the state’s restaurant owners have reacted to scaled-up wage costs by scaling back on hiring. In Los Angeles County, for instance, year-over-year full-service employment growth topped seven percent as recently as 2012; it’s fallen every year since then, and dipped below one percent in 2018. In Orange County, growth last year was near-zero.
A similar trend is seen statewide, with sub-one percent growth replacing five percent growth from as recently as 2013. In San Francisco County, stagnant growth turned negative last year, with the city losing nearly 1,000 restaurant jobs. A study published by Harvard University Business School and Mathematica examined the impacts of wage increases in the San Francisco Bay Area. The results were startling. The research found that each one dollar increase to the minimum wage resulted in a 14 percent increase in the likelihood that a 3.5 star (the median rating) restaurant would be forced to close.
Another study, recently released by my organization, found that in states like California with a high minimum wage for tipped employees, full-service restaurants hired 18 percent fewer tipped workers as a share of the workforce. In practice, that means full-service restaurants embrace self-service alternatives where the customer provides much of the service themselves. (The New York Times chronicled a trend in San Francisco of fine-dining restaurants adopting elements of fast-food style service models.)
Will California legislators wise up? Don’t hold your breath.
The state’s Future of Work Commission, which was assembled by the governor to examine future workplace challenges for employers and employees, is stacked with some of the very parties responsible for those challenges. SEIU president Mary Kay Henry, who co-chairs the governor’s commission, has overseen more than $100 million in spending on the Fight for $15, a policy that has forced countless employers to replace human employees with automated alternatives. Another commission member, labor activist Saru Jayaraman, has encouraged other states to follow California’s failed payment model for tipped employees. She’s been opposed in that goal by thousand of tipped servers, who understand the consequences for their own bottom line should their states make California’s mistake.
Gov. Newsom boasts that California is setting an example for the rest of the country to follow. He’s right; the state is showing the rest of the country why a $15 minimum wage is a bad idea.

Texto completo: Mark Galli is retiring in January from his position as editor in chief of Christianity Today, a publication founded by the late evangelist Billy Graham. On Thursday, he decided to go out with a bang by expressing an unpopular sentiment among much of the religious right in an op-ed titled “Trump Should Be Removed from Office,” which took off on social media, briefly caused the magazine’s website to crash and drew this lamentably predictable response from the president:
“A far left magazine, or very ‘progressive,’ as some would call it, which has been doing poorly and hasn’t been involved with the Billy Graham family for many years, Christianity Today, knows nothing about reading a perfect transcript of a routine phone call and would rather have a Radical Left nonbeliever, who wants to take your religion & your guns, than Donald Trump as your President,” Trump said in a series of tweets. “No President has done more for the Evangelical community, and it’s not even close.”
Trump’s defenders are sure to chalk this up as just one more example that shows he is a “counterpuncher,” someone who always “hits back” when attacked. But the op-ed isn’t an attack — Galli concedes that the debate over impeaching and removing Trump is rife with partisanship, and he grants that reasonable minds can differ about whether impeachment or an election should decide Trump’s political fate. Rather, he is defending Christianity after years of its adherents’ moral compromises in the realm of politics.
He is clear that he will not immediately change minds and might lose readers: a December NPR-PBS NewsHour-Marist poll found that 80% of white evangelical Christians oppose the Senate removing Trump from office, compared to 49% of the public overall. But on Friday, Galli explained his real mission: “As a Christian,” he told CNN’s John Berman, “I like to think of myself as a person who has given my ultimate loyalty to Jesus Christ and the gospel he’s called us to proclaim.”
Christians are taught at an early age that earthly desires, power, prominence and even life itself are less important than obeying God. One commonly taught Bible story deals with how God’s people wrongly worshipped the idol Baal instead of the true God. “How long will you waver between two opinions?” a flummoxed prophet Elijah asked in 1 Kings 18:21. “If the Lord is God, follow him; but if Baal is God, follow him.” Galli, fed up with the way many Christians have treated Trump like a demigod instead of a fallible human, displays some of the same consternation.
He wrote: “Whether Mr. Trump should be removed from office by the Senate or by popular vote next election — that is a matter of prudential judgment. That he should be removed, we believe, is not a matter of partisan loyalties but loyalty to the Creator of the Ten Commandments.”
As evidence, he noted that Christianity Today has consistently encouraged its readers to prioritize the eternal — no matter the president and regardless of party affiliation — citing its 1974 editorial describing President Richard Nixon as a “person who has failed gravely to live up to the moral demands of our Judeo-Christian heritage” and its 1998 editorial calling Bill Clinton a president who operated “several commandments short of a decalogue.”
Galli described Trump’s use of political power “to coerce a foreign leader to harass and discredit one of the president’s political opponents” as not just unconstitutional but also “profoundly immoral.” And he went on to say that “this president has dumbed down the idea of morality in his administration. He has hired and fired a number of people who are now convicted criminals. He himself has admitted to immoral actions in business and his relationship with women, about which he remains proud. His Twitter feed alone — with its habitual string of mischaracterizations, lies, and slanders — is a near perfect example of a human being who is morally lost and confused.”
Too many evangelicals, Galli said, have taken a transactional approach to Trump, and they “have pointed to his Supreme Court nominees, his defense of religious liberty, and his stewardship of the economy, among other things, as achievements that justify their support.” He asked: “Can we say with a straight face that abortion is a great evil that cannot be tolerated and, with the same straight face, say that the bent and broken character of our nation’s leader doesn’t really matter in the end?”
And he anticipated that Trump’s defenders, such as Billy Graham’s son, the Rev. Franklin Graham, would counter that “all past presidents and as each one of us are” guilty of sin. But, Galli stressed, “none of the president’s positives can balance the moral and political danger we face under a leader of such grossly immoral character.”
A Christianity dependent on Trump is a weak faith, indeed.
Christianity has endured and flourished for two millennia, often against unimaginable persecution. When a faith is sustained by God, it has no need to compromise its witness in service of an adulterous, mendacious reality TV star.

Texto completo: The Associated Press
NEW YORK - A chat app that quickly became popular in the United Arab Emirates for communicating with friends and family is actually a spying tool used by the government to track its users, according to a newspaper report.
The government uses ToTok to track conversations, locations, images and other data of those who install the app on their phones, The New York Times reported, citing U.S. officials familiar with a classified intelligence assessment and the newspaper's own investigation.
The Emirates has long blocked Apple's FaceTime, Facebook's WhatsApp and other calling apps. Emirati media has been playing up ToTok as an alternative for expatriates living in the country to call home to their loved ones for free.
The Times says ToTok is a few months old and has been downloaded millions of times.
Government surveillance in the Emirates is prolific, and the Emirates long has been suspected of using so-called "zero day" exploits to target human rights activists and others.
Zero days exploits can be expensive to obtain on the black market because they represent software vulnerabilities for which fixes have yet to be developed.
The Times described ToTok as a way to give the government free access to personal information, as millions of users are willingly downloading and installing the app on their phones and blindly giving permission to enable features.
As with many apps, ToTok requests location information, purportedly to provide accurate weather forecasts, according to the Times. It also requests access to a phone's contacts, supposedly to help users connect with friends. The app also has access to microphones, cameras, calendar and other data.
A security expert who said he analyzed the app for the Times, Patrick Wardle, said that ToTok "does what it claims to do" as a communications app, which is the "genius" of the app if it is being used as a spy tool. "No exploits, no backdoors, no malware," he wrote in a blog post. The app is able to gain insights on users through common functions.
In a blog post Monday, ToTok did not respond directly to Sunday's Times report, but said that with "reference to the rumors circulated today about ToTok," the one goal of the app's creators was to create a reliable, easy-to-use communications platform. The post said ToTok had high-security standards to protect user data and a privacy framework that complied with local and international legal requirements.
ToTok said the app was temporarily unavailable in the app stores from Google and Apple due to a "technical issue."
The Times says that based on a technical analysis and interviews with security experts, the company behind ToTok, Breej Holding, is most likely affiliated with DarkMatter, an Emirati cybersecurity company that has hired former CIA and National Security Agency analysts and has close business ties to the Emirati government.
Emails sent to ToTok through its website and to the Emirates embassy in Washington were not immediately returned.

Texto completo: Not long after Bob Wagner became the head football coach at the University of Hawaii in 1987, he said an elderly fan beseeched him with a fervent request.
“Please, please beat BYU before I die.’”
The Cougars were in the midst of what would become, for the Rainbow Warriors, an onerous 10 consecutive losses over an 11-year (1978-88) span and ending that frustration took on the passion of a crusade.
That UH lost in all manner of ways — close games, blowouts and on some freakishly bizarre plays — only magnified the pain. That BYU often did it with several homegrown Hawaii players and coaches on their roster made it exceedingly personal for the whole state.
So much so that the mother of Norm Chow, the Hawaii born and bred offensive Cougars coordinator many of those years, would hear about it from her hairdresser as the UH-BYU games approached each year and returning players would be vociferously booed at the stadium.
Today’s Hawaii Bowl gives us the first matchup of UH and BYU in a postseason setting and while the series no longer packs Aloha Stadium to the rafters or creates the sparks of yesteryear, it does rekindle tales of a more vibrant time.
1. UH 56, BYU 14 (Oct. 28, 1989, Aloha Stadium)
UH had lost by two points in 1987 (16-14) and one in 1988 (24-23). But in his pregame message to the players, Wagner told them of the breakthrough, “Guys, it doesn’t have to be close.”
And it wasn’t.
2. UH 59, BYU 28 (Dec. 1, 1990, Aloha Stadium)
The one-sidedness of the game was so reminiscent of the previous year that the radio station carrying the game, KGU, got calls inquiring whether it was replaying the 1989 game.
This one, however, was almost as delicious for UH fans as the ’Bows tarnished what started out as a red-letter day for fourth-ranked BYU in which its quarterback, Ty Detmer, was awarded the Heisman Trophy long distance hours earlier.
UH quarterback Garrett Gabriel stole the day, passing for three touchdowns. “It takes a lot away,” Detmer said afterward. “You can’t enjoy it like you should be able to, because we’re riding home on a long flight.”
Asked if he would return for his senior year, Detmer told the New York Times, “Oh, yeah, I think it will probably be for this (Hawaii) game. I’ll be glad to get a chance at them (in) Provo next year. We’ll see what it is like for them over there on the mainland at 4,500 feet.”
3. UH 72, BYU 45 (Dec. 8, 2001, Aloha Stadium)
This was the unbeaten (12-0) Cougars’ nationally televised stage to state their case for inclusion into the Bowl Championship Series against a UH team that had no bowl possibilities at all.
Instead, with quarterback Nick Rolovich passing for a school-record eight touchdowns and Chad Owens returning two kicks for scores, BYU got dumped from national title consideration and the game led to the birth of the Hawaii Bowl, so UH would never be left out of the postseason after going 9-3.
4. BYU 13, UH 3 (Nov. 14, 1981, Aloha Stadium)
The stars seemed to align for UH, which was 7-0, had its first national ranking, an ABC nationally televised game against a ranked BYU team and Sports Illustrated on hand to document the ’Bows rise with a cover story.
Alas, the story never materialized because BYU quarterback Jim McMahon, who had been unable to lift his arm earlier in the week, was taken to an acupuncturist in Honolulu by Chow and ended up throwing an NCAA-record 60 passes. McMahon, who was right-footed, also picked up an errant snap and, with his left foot, punted a ball 37 yards to the UH 1-yard line.
5. BYU 18, UH 13 (Sept. 22, 1984, Aloha Stadium)
Perhaps the greatest defensive play in BYU history — and one of the most disappointing offensive ones in UH annals — both happened in this game on the then-fourth-ranked Cougars’ march to their only national championship.
With BYU leading, 12-10 in the fourth quarter and UH on the Cougars’ 2-yard line, safety Kyle Morrell’s perfectly timed leap over the line of scrimmage — dubbed the “Leap of Faith” — allowed him to sack quarterback Raphel Cherry. UH was forced to settle for a field goal.
Later, with BYU leading 18-13, and UH on the Cougars’ 16-yard line, a wide-open Walter Murray dropped a pass in the end zone with 40 seconds remaining.
6. BYU 41, UH 38 (Sept. 11, 1993, Provo)
Coming off their Western Athletic Conference title of 1992, this would be as close as the ’Bows have ever come to winning in Provo.
But place-kicker Carlton Oswalt’s 23-yard field goal bounced off the left upright, denying the ’Bows a shot at winning.
7. BYU 24, UH 23 (Oct. 22, 1988, Aloha Stadium)
The ’Bows go for a game-winning 2-point conversion but get stuffed at the goal line.
8. UH 36, BYU 32 (Sept. 26, 1992, Aloha Stadium)
Jason Elam kicked three field goals, including a school-record 56-yarder, and Ivin Jasper passed 9 yards to Marlowe Lewis for the go-ahead touchdown with 37 seconds remaining.
9. UH 15, BYU 13 (Sept. 14, 1974, Honolulu Stadium)
Austrian-born Reinhold Stuprich kicked a school-record five field goals in what would be the ’Bows’ last victory over the Cougars until 1989.
10. BYU 35, UH 18 (Oct. 19, 1991, Provo)
After two consecutive blowout losses at Aloha Stadium, BYU head coach LaVell Edwards pledged to jump off Mt. Timpanogos if the Cougars lost this one at home.

'MEDICARE FOR ALL' OPPONENTS AREN'T MURDERERS THE ABSURD CLAIM THAT OPPONENTS OF SINGLE-PAYER HEALTH CARE ARE CAUSING SICK PEOPLE TO DIE

Texto completo: Health care is a major point of contention in the Democratic primary campaign. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren favor a single-payer system, while Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg support a federal insurance program to compete with private insurers, also known as the public option. Some fans of single-payer have begun to deploy a dire-sounding argument: failing to implement "Medicare for All," they claim, would be tantamount to murder.
It's not clear to what extent these arguments are tongue-in-cheek. News outlets are fond of running articles declaring that the U.S. health-care system is "literally killing people"; the actual content of these articles is almost always only about the well-documented shortcomings of the present system, but the headlines suggest a flirtation with the idea that refusing to reform a flawed system amounts to murder.
That idea has its roots in an old philosophical debate about responsibility. Few would dispute the notion that if you ignore a dying person that you could easily save, you've done something deeply immoral. But this principle is hard to put into practice because it hinges on the incredibly hard task of assessing how much danger someone would have to put themselves in to help someone else. And equating laziness with homicide seems mushy; few of us would judge a couch potato to be a murderer simply because she's not spending her free time saving lives as a paramedic.
But this time single-payer advocates do more than just rehash this old argument about negligent bystanders. They also invoke statistics, which introduces even more problems.
Assessments of the deaths attributable to various policy regimes rely on statistical calculations of mortality rates. One way to do this is to compare states that implement a policy - for example, Medicaid expansion - with those that don't and observe differences in death rates before and after the policy. Because mortality depends on things besides Medicaid, making an accurate comparison requires that researchers control for various factors. Differences in the set of things that get controlled for, and how the comparisons are constructed, can produce changes in the mortality estimates.
This isn't such a big problem if we're just using statistics to determine whether a policy is helpful. Over time, a body of evidence accumulates that leans toward the conclusion that Medicaid expansion is helpful or harmful. But relying on statistical estimates to determine the precise number of people that heartless politicians have murdered seems highly unreliable.
It also leaves open the possibility that new findings will turn a murderer into a hero, or vice versa. For example, it was long believed, based on credible economic studies, that government-provided health insurance wasn't very effective in improving people's health. A politician who spent less on health insurance might thus be hailed as a hero if she directed the money to other, better uses. But recent evidence suggests that medical insurance has a substantial beneficial effect on health. Does that academic shift mean the hero is now a murderer? That question is a bit absurd.
Assigning moral culpability for policy decisions is even harder when politics is taken into account. Sanders supporters generally acknowledge that passing Medicare for All will be difficult because of the partisan composition of the Senate. Instead, they see it as the opening gambit in a negotiation, an effort to shift the debate so that a public option seems mainstream instead of fringe. But their political calculations could be wrong: it's possible that pushing for Medicare for All results in no major health reform getting passed at all. It wouldn't be the first time that the failure of an ambitious health plan led to many years of inaction. Would that mean that pushing for Medicare for All literally killed people? Of course not.
The idea of preventable-deaths-as-homicide runs into another big problem: Should we view any American as a murderer who refuses to reduce their living standard to a bare subsistence level and give all of their remaining income to children in Africa at high risk of dying of disease or starvation? There are people who think deeply and seriously about this sort of question - the effective altruism movement - but they have come up with few definitive answers.
A quick scan of Twitter confirms that there is no shortage of policies - and lack of policies - that are "literally killing people." Equating statistical estimates of mortality rates with homicide will lead society in directions that are absurd at best and ominous at worst.

We saw the unseeable
You've seen black holes in science fiction movies and in illustrator's impressions. But until the morning of April 10, you never saw what a black hole really looks like. And then there it was, the monstrous void at the middle of the galaxy Messier 87, staring back at you like the eye of Sauron.
The story of how one astronomer, Katie Bouman, became the face of the quest to visualize the singularity, was a good yarn, too.
Landing on the moon is difficult
The year started with China's successful landing of Chang'e-4 on the moon's far side. No country had done that before. That success, along with the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing, made it seem like a year ripe for new lunar accomplishments.
But in April, Beresheet, a lander built by an Israeli nonprofit, crashed on the moon's surface. Early in September, India's space agency lost contact with the Vikram lander during its attempt to touch down near the lunar south pole. Only with the volunteer labor of an Indian hobbyist was NASA finally able to show the world where it had crashed.
In the United States, the Trump administration pledged that the first American woman and next man would walk on the moon's surface by the end of 2024. But whatever technical challenges must be overcome for the Artemis program to succeed, political, budgetary and bureaucratic hurdles might prove greater obstacles to an American lunar return.
Women need more than an all-female spacewalk
First NASA scheduled the first spacewalk with two women astronauts. Then they canceled it, because the space station lacked the right spacesuits for the two women. Then they got the right suits, and history was made.
It was a reminder that the space program was designed by men, for men, the science fiction novelist Mary Robinette Kowal wrote. NASA, she noted, is at its best when it is learning from mistakes, and it is highly capable of making improvements as it prepares to put the first woman on the moon.
A year in orbit changes a person
NASA scientists compared Scott Kelly, the astronaut who spent 340 days on the space station, with his twin brother, Mark, on Earth. In orbit, Scott Kelly's body experienced a vast number of changes, including mutations in DNA and declines in some cognitive tests. Many of the changes reverted once he returned to Earth, although some did not. Some scientists deemed the risks manageable; others saw the findings as a cautionary tale -- a warning over whether long trips in space will ever be safe for humans.
A space crime allegation was made for the first time
Summer Worden filed for divorce in 2018 from Anne McClain, a NASA astronaut. This year while Ms. McClain was aboard the International Space Station, Ms. Worden accused her of identity theft and improper access of private financial records. Ms. McClain admitted to accessing Ms. Worden's bank account, but said she had always been responsible for keeping the couple's finances in order.
The case is not yet decided. However it turns out, more criminal allegations and other legal disputes are bound to emerge as more humans and their economic activity move to low Earth orbit and beyond.
Space will become a battlefield

Congress granted President Trump the authority and some budget to begin creating a Space Force. It's unclear what exactly that force will look like. But in March, when India demonstrated an antisatellite weapon, it was a reminder that nation-states are looking beyond the bubble of Earth's atmosphere as they make their defense plans for the future.
An asteroid was bombed; another shot back
Humans have collected samples from asteroids but until this year we had never bombed one. In March, Japan's Hayabusa2 dropped an explosive on the surface of Ryugu, a near Earth asteroid, and later scooped a sample from the scattered debris.
A second spacecraft, NASA's Osiris-Rex, is preparing to land and collect a sample from Bennu, another asteroid. Bennu was found to be ejecting rocks into space. The spacecraft was deemed safe despite the projectiles.
Gassy mysteries were detected on Mars
As NASA said goodbye to the Opportunity rover this year, its other rover, Curiosity, detected unusual signals on the red planet's surface. A large spike of methane, a gas usually produced by living things on Earth, was detected in June. But just as scientists on Earth wondered if the signal was evidence of potential microbial life on the red planet, the gas was gone.
If that wasn't puzzling enough, scientists said in November that they had detected varying amounts of oxygen, which was "confusing, but it's exciting," one said. While four new spacecraft could arrive at Mars next year, none will have instruments to study these gases.
The business of space is messy
Want to buy a trip to the space station? Soon, you might be able to -- for at least $ 35,000 a night. You can also buy a $ 250,000 seat aboard a Virgin Galactic space plane that comes with a snazzy flightsuit. The target customer is obvious; only the wealthiest travelers will be able to afford the privilege of private spaceflight. Who gets to decide what happens in the commons beyond our planet is still an open question.
One private company, SpaceX, launched 120 satellites all by itself this year, the first nodes in one of several proposed orbiting mega-constellations that would beam internet service back to Earth. Astronomers fear that the night sky might never be the same.
We got our first close-ups from beyond Pluto
On New Year's Eve, NASA's New Horizons spacecraft passed an object in the distant Kuiper belt beyond Pluto, and took the first close-up pictures of an object that far from Earth. In the following weeks, new, clearer images of the object, recently renamed Arrokoth, were beamed back to Earth, as scientists made new discoveries about the solar system's furthest reaches.
Get ready for visitors from beyond our solar system
Some people want to believe the moon landing was a hoax. Others are certain the truth is being kept from us. Here's what we do know: A comet from beyond the bubble that contains you, me and everyone we know is hurtling through our solar system right now. In the days ahead, it will pass closer to Earth than it will ever come.
Then it will leave our solar system. If you miss it, don't worry. More interstellar tourists will be passing through our neighborhood, which is just one tiny corner of one spiral arm full of stars that juts out from a supermassive black hole.

Texto completo: My favorite podcasts of 2019 were those that seemed at first about one thing — Dolly Parton, the reality TV show “Cops,” the mysterious death of New York City punk rocker nearly four decades ago — and carried you away on tangents you never saw coming.
Which, mind you, is not to say I lost all of my ardor for the tried-and-true-crime podcasts, such as “In The Dark,” my favorite of 2018, which just this week resulted in the release on bail of Curtis Flowers, a Mississippi man tried six times who six times had his convictions overturned. There remain plenty of those, though I’ve perhaps become more discerning in my criminal tastes.
The list below presents the dozen podcasts that still resonate for me as the year comes to an end. They’re not in any particular order, so the numbers aren’t rankings, but the first two here are my favorites of the year.
1. Headlong: Running From Cops : Dan Taberski returned this year with his third great podcast in a row – “Surviving Y2K” and “Finding Richard Simmons” preceded this one – and this might be his best. A deep dive into the history of the reality TV series “Cops,” this podcast explores everything from the impact of the show on real-world policing to the way the series may interfere with the rights of the arrested in ways you’d never considered. Entertaining, and it makes you think.
2. The Ballad of Billy Balls : This podcast opens like a typical true-crimer – who killed punk rocker and small-time drug dealer Billy Balls in his East Village apartment in 1982 – but under the empathetic storytelling of host iO Tillett Wright it becomes something much more that incorporates love and grief, family and memory. Billy’s girlfriend Rebecca is an amazing presence throughout the podcast, which reveals one secret after another as Wright seeks the truth of the story.
3. 1619 : This podcast from the New York Times came on the 400th anniversary of the arrival of the first slaves in America. No dry history lesson, the anthology-style five-episode podcast looks at ways in which the impact of slavery has rippled across four centuries of our history tot he present day. Topics range from the economy to land ownership to health care. If you’d like to get a sense of it, dip your ears into the episode by the Times’ Wesley Morris who explores the ways in which black American music seeded every genre we listen to today — including yacht rock.
4. Dolly Parton’s America : Host Jad Abumrad grew up in Tennessee where Dolly Parton is everywhere, and, like many, he took her a little bit for granted. Then Abumrad noticed how in these divided times everyone from MAGA hat-wearers to drag queens loves Dolly, and he started to investigate. He got hours of interview time with Dolly, which is wonderful, but it’s the side trips into the stories of those who know her – in person, by her music, her career – that make this story a wonderful narrative about a singular woman.
5. Crime Beat: Mom vs. Murderer : The second season of this true-crime podcast by reporter Keith Sharon, our (full-disclosure) Southern California News Group colleague, tells the story of the murder of Cathy Torrez in 1994 and the 21 years her mother Mary Bennett fought to see the main suspect — who lived across the street — convicted. It’s a story about a terrible crime, the frustrating injustices of the justice system and a mother’s determination that her child not be forgotten.
6. Lost Notes : This anthology series from KCRW-FM/89.9 and host Jessica Hooper explores the lives and work of musicians in ways unlike any other podcast, digging deep into history and meaning with strong standalone narratives. A punk rock musician with a regional hit when he was 17 questions the sexism of its lyrics as a 56-year-old father. The sisters of the now mostly forgotten all-female rock band Fanny share their story. A writer narrates an audio letter to the musician Cat Power about the impact of her work on the lives of him and others. There are more in 2019’s second season.
7. The Clearing : April Balascio had feared for years that her father Edward Wayne Edwards was a murderer, and in 2009, her tip led to his conviction in a decades-old case. In this podcast, she teams with host Josh Dean to explore the legacy of her father’s life and crimes. These included more murders to which he admitted, several more that he likely committed and a few he almost certainly did not. It’s a fascinating tale of a sociopath father and a daughter brave enough to seek the truth.
8. Against The Rules with Michael Lewis : Writer Lewis is responsible for some of the great nonfiction of the past few decades with books such as “Moneyball,” “The Blind Side,” and “The Big Short,” all of which were adapted for film. This debut podcast brings his unique and questioning mind to the topic of fairness. He explores everything from sports to financial markets, law to media, and what happens in a world where fewer people accept the judgments of referees. Smart, funny, thought-provoking — what else you want?
9. Over My Dead Body:Tally : There’s a nasty divorce between two lawyers, and one of them ends up gunned down in the garage at his Tallahassee, Florida home. Host and co-reporter Matthew Shaer takes listeners through the story, which moves from a fairy-tale romance that made the New York Times to the split and crime that followed. This first season of the podcast makes it easy for listeners to come to their own conclusions about who is responsible, but justice isn’t so easily served.
10. Nice Try! : Host Avery Trufelman explores the history of intended utopian communities — the Jamestown settlement, the master-planned modernist city of Chandigarh, India, the Oneida religious commune in New York, among others — and why so often they have failed to find the perfection for which they were intended. Through history, architecture, culture, and beliefs, Nice Try! presents a cool new way of understanding the worlds in which we live.
11. The Thing About Pam : From NBC and “Dateline,” this Keith Morrison-hosted podcast peels back the layers of lies and deceit that led to the wrongful conviction of a Missouri man for the murder of his wife, and the ultimate discovery of whodunnit. “Saturday Night Live” used to skewer Morrison’s intimate style of narration, but it’s a pleasure indeed to listen to him tell this story, which never lags or feels padded like too many “Dateline” episodes do.
12. It’s a Pixies Podcast : The Pixies, one of the great modern rock bands, agreed to something few bands would consider and invited author-turned-podcaster Tony Fletcher into the recording studio for the weeks they worked on their new album, “Beneath The Eyrie.” It’s a fascinating look at the creative process, the collaborative nature of making a record, and the push-and-pull of personalities all working toward the goal of making music together. A must for Pixies’ fans, but almost as essential for fans of any band for the insights it delivers.

One More Drive Around Warroad

Texto completo: It was a rare chance to see the story -- and the people in this small Minnesota town -- through his eyes.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
Residents of Warroad, Minn., a rural community a few miles south of Canada, call a drive around town "taking a whip." I was taken on my first whip on a cold, gray morning in late October. It was a scenic trip that included a frigid lake, a window company and a massive building called "The Shed," where the mayor holds court amid his personal vintage car collection. A traffic light near the front door signals whether the mayor is available; it's lit green if he is and red if he's not.
On this particular morning, the light was solidly red, a disappointment because my driver had hoped to introduce me to the mayor, Bob Marvin, a third-generation owner of the town's biggest employer, Marvin Windows and Doors.
My driver and tour guide was Richard Fausset, a New York Times national desk correspondent based in Atlanta. "I can't believe I'm back here," he said several times as he pointed out the sights. He hadn't expected to return to Warroad, not then but also maybe not ever. He's a reporter responsible for coverage of the South, and Warroad is most certainly not on his beat.
But I had asked Richard to go to Warroad last spring to chronicle the final days of The Warroad Pioneer, a weekly newspaper that ended its 121-year run in early May. He was there for about two weeks, and had taken so many whips around the town's three square miles that he remembered the shortcuts.
During his time in Warroad, Richard spent hours with the newspaper's publisher, staff, pastor and friends. He met incredulous and disappointed loyal readers. He met many others who hadn't read the Pioneer in years, but still mourned its final edition. It was the kind of story no journalist wants to cover. And yet over the last decade, as the presses have stopped rolling in more than 2,000 communities across America, it has become a familiar, dispiriting tale.
Over the last 15 years, Minnesota has lost about 22 percent of its newspapers, leaving vast swaths of the state uncovered. I wondered who would fill the void in Warroad, also known as "Hockeytown, U.S.A." for its outsize production of professional hockey players, now that there was no hometown newspaper to chronicle the high school sports teams or to print the obituaries.
I wanted Richard to return to Warroad, and this time I wanted to go with him. I had edited his story and I wanted to see what he had seen -- the town, its people and the lasting impact of the Pioneer.
So there we were on a cold October morning, and the mayor wasn't in at "The Shed," leaving me and Richard with a couple of hours to kill before we were due at the high school to speak to students and residents about journalism. Richard drove me to what had been the newsroom of the Pioneer, now an Aflac insurance office owned and managed by Rebecca Colden, the Pioneer's former owner, publisher and editor.
We found Rebecca standing at her desk, and her pastor at the front door with his keys in hand, about to leave after a visit. She and Richard hugged hello; it was clear the two had grown close during his reporting trip. She had been through something traumatic and he had served as her witness.
For an editor based in New York, this was a rare chance to behold a reporter in his element. Richard and I are members of the same generation, but in that moment I felt like a parent beaming with pride. Wherever we went, there were people who had read his article, people who appreciated how it had been framed. He had told a difficult story, and he had done so with a lot of care and sensitivity.
Like that of many journalists at The New York Times, my career includes several years in a much smaller newsroom. For about a decade, I saw up close the vital role a local newspaper plays in its community. It connects and informs residents. It shapes and leads conversations.
At Warroad High School that afternoon, I asked students whether they had felt the Pioneer's absence. Most said they had not. They are young and not in the habit of reading newspapers. They said they get their news on Snapchat, Twitter and Instagram. Still, several inquisitive students wondered aloud about the future of journalism in their town. Who would write about their teams? Who would keep them updated if they moved away?
A new publication called The Warroad Advocate launched a free 13-week trial over the summer, but it retreated when it could not attract enough advertisers. Students asked whether they might play a role in creating something altogether different, like student journalists have done elsewhere around the country. Maybe an online publication that would continue where the Pioneer left off -- something distinct and digital that would unite the town's roughly 1,700 residents.
Town officials want that, too. A few weeks after our visit, Mani Harren, the project manager for Warroad Community Development, championed the idea of a new publication in an impassioned blog post, adding that the town "lacks a 'voice' to keep this community connected."
"It's clear Warroad still has many stories to tell," she wrote.
A lot has changed in Warroad since the Pioneer's final edition. Officials have since broken ground on a new hotel in town. And a Canadian brewery has opened a branch in an airy building overlooking its namesake, the Lake of the Woods.
But who will tell these stories?
Before we drove out of town, Richard and I took one last whip around Warroad. We drove past Olympic Arena, an indoor practice facility for aspiring youth hockey players, and down quiet neighborhood streets, where stately brick houses sit alongside modest frame homes.
In that moment, Warroad could have been any small town in America, and as I looked out the window, at the countless stories waiting to be told, I felt certain Warroad would find a way to tell them.

Texto completo: The seventh annual "Ding" Darling-Theodore Cross High School Photography Contest is well underway, with a deadline of Jan. 15. It invites high school students in Lee, Collier, Charlotte, Glades, and Hendry counties to compete for prizes that include a Canon digital SLR camera package, chartered class trips to the refuge, and copies of "Waterbirds: Portraits and Anecdotes from Birding Adventures" by contest namesake, the late Theodore Cross.
Cross, who lived part-time on Sanibel Island, marched with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.; advised the Johnson and Nixon administrations on anti-poverty programs; wrote the influential book "Black Capitalism," among others; played a prominent role in President Obama's election; and created Birders United – a birding website that ranked legislators according to their record of bird protection support.
Late in life, Cross decided to indulge his love for birds and photography and traveled the world to collect stunning portraits and stories to chronicle his adventures. He shot often at J.N. "Ding" Darling National Wildlife Refuge on Sanibel Island, and a number of the images in his book reflect his love for the refuge. Cross published "Waterbirds" in 2009 at age 85 and passed away shortly after that in February 2010.
NPR's All Things Considered called Cross' collection of 179 images and countless anecdotes "spectacular." The New York Times described it as "part visual encyclopedia, part memoir."
"The Theodore Cross Family Charitable Foundation has made possible this contest with a generous grant to the 'Ding' Darling Wildlife Society-Friends of the Refuge (DDWS)," said Birgie Miller, DDWS executive director. "We couldn't be more thrilled that they wanted their donation used in this way for a seventh year."
"We are so happy to be supporting a contest in my father's name, a contest that will get our youth involved with nature by looking at it – as my father so loved doing – through a camera lens," said daughter Amanda Cross.
Digital image entries can be shot from any outdoor venue in the state of Florida. A writing component to the contest requires entrants grades 9 through 12 to submit a 100-word description of the "moment" captured and how it reflects what nature and wildlife mean to the photographer.
Entry rules, guidelines and prize information are also posted at www.dingdarlingsociety.org/articles/photo-contests. Call DDWS at 239-472-1100 ext. 4 for more information.
All entries and personal information must be submitted in digital format to the email address ddhsphotocontest@gmail.com. Submit your full name, high school, grade, and an original photograph that you took of nature and/or wildlife in the open outdoors. Include a title for the photograph and a written description (minimum 100 words) of the "moment" captured and how it reflects what nature and wildlife mean to you.
You and your entry must comply with the following requirements:
High school students attending schools in Lee, Collier, Hendry, Glades and Charlotte (Florida) counties in grades 9 through 12 may enter the contest.
Only digital images are accepted and may be taken with any camera, including smartphones.
Images must be submitted in JPEG format and must have a size of at least 2000 x 1500 pixels or resolution of 2 megabytes.
The photograph must be taken of nature and/or wildlife in the open outdoors in the state of Florida, which may include parks, refuges, backyards, and other open spaces.
Panoramic photos are NOT allowed.
Filters, cropping, enhancements and boarders are permitted. However, adding any elements not existing in the original scene will not be allowed. Judges, at their discretion, will disqualify any photos that appear to be manipulated beyond these guidelines.
Each participant may enter up to two (2) photos but is eligible to win only one award.
Judging will be anonymous. Please do not put your name or anything that will identify you on your photograph.
There are three judges: A refuge staff person, a professional photographer, and a resident of the five-county region.
Judging criteria:
Technical excellence (sharpness, lighting, composition, exposure)
Creativity
Explanation of photograph (minimum of 100 words)
All photos will become the property of the society. Photos may be used by the society in any way with appropriate credit.
After the images have been submitted electronically, they will be printed out for judging. The winners of the contest will have their images matted and displayed in the "Ding" Darling Visitor & Education Center.

Texto completo: The United Arab Emirates is using one of the most popular messaging apps in the United States to track the conversations, locations, and interactions of all of the app’s users.
The app ToTok became one of the most downloaded messaging apps in the U.S. last week on both Apple and Google’s app store. The app, sold as a safe and secure way to communicate, is being used by the U.A.E. to spy on its own people and others around the world, according to the New York Times.
ToTok is most popular in the U.A.E., but also serves millions of users in Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and North America. The company that created ToTok, Breej Holding, is believed to be a front group for an Abu Dhabi-based hacking firm called DarkMatter. The firm employees ex-cyberintelligence employees from the Emirates, Israel, and the U.S. National Security Agency.
Google and Apple have pledged to look into the popular app. Google removed it from its store on Thursday, and Apple followed suit on Friday.
ToTok is a close copy of a Chinese app called YeeCall but adapted for a different audience, according to an analysis by a former NSA hacker.

Texto completo: Free-market capitalism won't survive unless it makes structural changes toward long-term investing.
In 2007, James Rogers did the unthinkable. As chief executive of Duke Energy, one of the largest coal-powered utilities in the country, he lobbied for the passage of aggressive cap-and-trade legislation. The bill, if passed, would have imposed billions of dollars in costs on his business, and it was vigorously opposed by the coal industry's primary lobbyist.
Mr. Rogers, who died in 2018, was no masochist; he was a visionary who understood something fundamental about the relationship between time and profits: Over the long run, the profitable thing and the right thing are usually the same.
We live in an economy increasingly at odds with this truth. Short-term business practices are polluting our environment and harming our health and well-being for the sake of quick payouts.
The evidence of a growing short-term orientation among American public companies isn't hard to find. Boeing's corner-cutting on the Max 737, Wells Fargo's fraudulent customer accounts and Johnson & Johnson's opioid scandal are all examples of short-term behavior with disastrous long-term consequences.
The causes are most likely structural. In 1950, a typical share of stock in United States public markets was held for eight years. Since 2006, the average share of stock has been held for less than a year. This shift is largely because of the spread of technology-enabled trading and the rise of activist hedge funds looking for short-term profits. And it may be changing how the most important companies in America are managed. A 2006 study conducted by economists at Duke University found that 78 percent of executives at public companies said that they would sacrifice long-term economic value for a short-term lift in share price.
They are under intense pressure to do so. In 2018, the median tenure for chief executives fell to a historic low of five years. Wall Street analysts dissect corporate quarterly earnings scorecards like never before, leading executives to focus more of their efforts on hitting near-term targets. This means executives may be increasingly unable, not just unwilling, to pursue long-term value-creating activities like investing in research or training for their employees.
Instead, they are being evaluated by investors on their ability to produce immediate financial value, almost always in the form of value-extracting activities such as cost-cutting, price increases, share buybacks or other forms of financial engineering. This behavior is at least partly to blame for the unethical business practices that have dominated recent news.
Unfortunately, the problem of short-termism isn't confined to public companies whose share prices are at the mercy of the stock markets. A willingness to gamble long-term reputation and growth for a short-term valuation bump is now a hallmark of private companies in Silicon Valley as well. The ethos of move fast and break things, which has defined a generation of start-ups, is not the mantra of long-term investors. It is the clarion call of speculators, who fully expect to get out before any of their own things can get broken.
The causes of short-term behavior in private markets mirror the story in public markets. Ownership of America's privately held companies has shifted away from long-term operators, like family-owned businesses, to third-party investors -- venture capital and private equity firms like SoftBank and TPG. Since mid-2009 investors have allocated $ 5.8 trillion to global private equity alone.
The "exit-seeking" nature of virtually all of these institutional funds means investors seek to sell the businesses they acquire, and make a profitable exit, within five to 10 years. There is, as a result, a growing mismatch between the horizons of investors who control more of our private companies and the horizons of the employees, customers and suppliers who depend on them.
Solving the problem of short-termism will require difficult structural change that goes well beyond high-minded public statements. There are signs that this is starting to happen. This year, the Securities and Exchange Commission granted permission for the Long-Term Stock Exchange to begin building a novel alternative to traditional public markets. Among the proposals put forward by this new exchange is a tenure-based voting system that would make corporate voting a function of how many shares you own and how long you have held them.
In private markets, BlackRock now offers a fund that intends to invest in businesses "up to forever." It is driven by the idea that, over time, financial value and stakeholder values converge. With no requirement to sell the businesses they own, such funds create a powerful alignment between owners, employees and customers.
Milton Friedman, who popularized the notion of shareholder primacy and pursuit of profit, once lamented that business leaders are often "incredibly shortsighted and muddle-headed in matters that are outside their businesses but affect the possible survival of business in general."
Friedman was right. The modern economy is not working for too many people, who have begun to equate short-term thinking with free-market capitalism and have had enough of both. The survival of business in general demands that we take the long view.

'Bombshell' blows up myths and facts

Texto completo: "Bombshell" exploded into the awards race last week, leading the Screen Actors Guild Awards nominations with four nods, including best ensemble, actress (Charlize Theron) and supporting actress (Margot Robbie and Nicole Kidman).
The drama goes behind the scenes at Fox News in 2016. It chronicles the efforts of a group of women – including on-the-outs host Gretchen Carlson (Kidman) and star anchor Megyn Kelly – to expose a culture of misogyny, leading to the ouster of Machiavellian CEO Roger Ailes (John Lithgow), who was accused of sexual harassment by more than 20 women.
Fox News spokesperson Caley Cronin declined to comment to USA TODAY beyond confirming that "Bombshell" producers "never reached out to Fox News during any part of the production."
The film was directed by Jay Roach ("Trumbo") and written by Charles Randolph ("The Big Short"), who breaks down what's fact, fiction and somewhere in between.
Is Robbie's character real? Robbie plays an ambitious, wide-eyed staffer named Kayla Pospisil. A lifelong Fox News fanatic and young evangelical ("I see myself as an influencer in the Jesus space," she says), Pospisil soon catches the eye of Ailes, who promises to promote her to on-air talent in exchange for sexual favors.
Although Pospisil is a fictional character, her experiences of harassment are drawn from interviews Randolph and Roach conducted with ex-Fox News staffers (some of whom violated their non-disclosure agreements to speak with filmmakers).
"What happens inside of Roger's office is based on the stories of three women we had access to," Randolph says. The rest is pulled from Randolph's evangelical upbringing.
"Her being ideologically fervent like a dedicated Republican, but a little sexually fluid and utterly morally sincere, that's based more on women in my life."
Is McKinnon's character fictional? The "Saturday Night Live" favorite is a scene-stealer as Pospisil's savvy co-worker Jess Carr, a closeted lesbian and liberal who has complicated feelings about working at a network that preaches against her values and lifestyle.
Carr was "all made up," Randolph says.
"I wanted to show the bystander narrative. Megyn's story is the story of someone who comes to discover she is complicit by virtue of the institutional norms and her ability to manipulate them in the predation of a younger generation of women. Likewise with Kayla: Her willingness to look the other way creates this dynamic, and she realizes at the end that it affects herself."
Did someone poison Kelly? The film begins with an anxious but steely Kelly en route to moderate the first debate of the Republican primary campaign. She accepts coffee offered by her driver, only to fall violently ill before the debate is about to begin. Rattled, she later relays the incident to Ailes, wondering aloud whether it was nerves or if the man tampered with her drink.
The scene is lifted directly from Kelly's 2016 memoir "Settle for More," although the journalist refuted inferences by the New York Times and others that she was poisoned. Yet "Bombshell" leaves the circumstances around her mystery illness intentionally vague.
"Roger said, 'How dare you have a cup of coffee from a guy you don't know. What are you, crazy?'" Randolph says. "Megyn has a good ear for absurdist details."
Did Ailes consult Rudy Giuliani? "Bombshell" is a who's who of famous faces, including Malcolm McDowell as Rupert Murdoch, Allison Janney as Ailes' legal counsel Susan Estrich, and Connie Britton as Ailes' wife, Beth. Then there's Richard Kind, who portrays Ailes' friend Rudy Giuliani. The embattled Ailes asks the politician/attorney how to handle the fallout.
"Ailes had three different lawyers who we let Giuliani stand in for," Randolph says. "If you wanted to be a Republican public intellectual, all avenues went through Roger Ailes' office, and that mattered in terms of his ability to prey on young people who had aspirations."
Was Ailes known as 'the legs man'? The film shows a competitive work environment at Fox News for female anchors and producers, many of whom rarely spoke or befriended each other. (Kelly and Carlson, for instance, only share the screen once in passing in an elevator – true to real life, where they worked different shifts and "almost never interacted," Randolph says.)
"Bombshell" also illustrates Ailes' predatory behavior: asking women to spin in front of him during meetings, and demanding that on-air talent wear short skirts to show off their legs. Such scenes were drawn from Kelly's book, as well as Gabriel Sherman's 2014 Ailes biography, "The Loudest Voice in the Room," and Sarah Ellison's 2016 expose for Vanity Fair, Randolph says.
"All the women who filed complaints about him who have gone public have been really brave in articulating ... what happened to them," Randolph says.
The film's most chilling scene is a private meeting between Ailes and Pospisil when he pressures her to lift her skirt. The camera lingers on Pospisil, near tears, as he orders her to inch it higher and higher, revealing her underwear. By letting the abuse play out in real time, Randolph hopes male viewers, in particular, will feel uncomfortable but also feel greater empathy for victims.

Texto completo: The New York Times headline reads, "A President Impeached, and a Nation Convulsed."
But if you're looking for evidence of a political convulsion - on either side of the aisle - you'll need a microscope. The most newsworthy aspect of the "historic" impeachment of President Donald Trump may be how little effect the "historic" event has had on American politics.
Supporters of Trump have repeatedly pointed to the fact that Democrats have been urging Trump's impeachment since he tookoffice - and they're right. An anti-Trump website, ImpeachDonaldTrumpNow.org, launched literally on Inauguration Day 2017. ("From the moment he assumed the office, President Trump has been in direct violation of the US Constitution," the website reads.)
As Majority Leader Mitch McConnell noted on the Senate floor Thursday, Wednesday's vote to impeach Trump wasn't the Democrats' first. It was their seventh. It's just the first time they had a majority of members in support.
This impeachment vote was "the predetermined end of a partisan crusade that began before President Trump was even sworn in," McConnell said.
There are more interesting data from early 2017: Trump's approval numbers. According to the data-crunchers at FiveThirtyEight, Trump's approval average on impeachment day was identical to his support on March 16, 2017: 43.5 percent.
Three years of Russia investigations, 12 weeks of impeachment inquiry, hundreds of hours of speeches by politicians and mountains of negative media coverage, and the president's standing with the voters is where it was back when he first took office. If the Democrats' goal was to "find a way to bring Trump down" - and 59 percent of Americans believe it is, according to a Monmouth poll - they failed.
But that doesn't mean Trump should be popping the champagne corks, either. "It doesn't really feel like we're being impeached," Trump said at a rally in Michigan on Wednesday night as the votes were being cast. "I don't know about you, but I'm having a good time."
Perhaps. But a president who can't get his approval rating above 45 percent still has plenty to worry about. While it's true that a recent Suffolk poll found Trump beating all the Democratic front-runners in head-to-head match-ups, it's also true that Trump trails former vice president Joe Biden by about 5 points in the RealClearPolitics average, and loses to Biden in 47 out of the last 50 polls.
Yes, Trump's approval has risen a bit - a "six-point surge" as his campaign calls it - since the impeachment inquiry, and yes, most Americans believe the Democrats are motivated by partisanship, not patriotism. But those same polls show most Americans think Trump did something wrong and deserved to be investigated, if not punished.
In fact, as bad as Congress' poll numbers are (25 percent approve, 54 percent disapprove), they've also risen a bit since the impeachment inquiry began, as has Speaker Nancy Pelosi's approval rating (39 percent approve, 49 percent disapprove).
Just days before the impeachment vote, Pelosi told The New York Times, "My numbers are better than Trump's. So if I'm not doing well, he's doing worse."
What's actually happening, based on the polling data, is that both politicians are getting higher and more intense support for their bases, while moderate, independent and less-engaged voters are shrugging off the whole impeachment fight.
"I was out talking to customers and vendors all day Wednesday, and you know how many mentioned impeachment to me? None," Randall Bloomquist, a small-business owner in the liberal-leaning Atlanta suburb of Decatur, Ga., said. "It was all over the media, but not on the minds of my customers."
According to the latest Suffolk poll, just 33 percent of independent voters support impeachment, while 46 percent oppose. And in a new Quinnipiac poll, only 28 percent of independents approve of how Congress is doing its job.
And while politicians and the press have talked nonstop about impeachment for months, when Suffolk asked voters to pick their priorities from a list of 12 issues, impeaching Trump came in next to last at 19 percent - well behind the economy (53 percent), health care (48 percent) and immigration (40 percent).
Which is why many Americans simply tuned out. The week before the impeachment vote, more people watched a single episode of CBS's "Magnum, P.I." reboot than tuned into primetime programming on all three cable news networks combined.
"Why bother? They were always going to impeach him," says Paul Norell, a sales executive and Trump supporter in Dallas. "The Senate's not going to throw him out of office, right? So what do I care?"
The net result of the over-hyped impeachment battle is that 40 percent of the country loves Trump, about 45 percent hate him, and the 2020 election will be won by whichever side does the best job of both motivating its base and bringing along the last 5 percent of persuadable voters.
Which is why the biggest news of the week may actually be Pelosi's threat to stretch out the (seemingly unending) process by refusing to send over the articles of impeachment for a Senate trial.
After years of investigations, charges and debates, the only thing the typical American voter hates more than impeachment are the words "more impeachment."

As it settles into New York's cultural fabric, the Shed -- the $ 475 million arts center in Hudson Yards that opened earlier this year -- has a question to answer: After a flashy first season that has included a "kung fu musical," Björk and a concert series conceived by the director Steve McQueen, how do you keep people interested?
The venue's sophomore season, announced Friday, is a response to that question.
"One thing we wanted to do was to have a wide enough range of commissions in that first season to demonstrate that there was something for most people in our program," Alex Poots, the Shed's artistic director and chief executive, said in an interview.
"There's less pressure on this season to do everything," he added.
It's still an eclectic mix.
The 2020 season will include the world premiere of "Help," a theatrical work by the author and poet Claudia Rankine that explores white male privilege -- a subject that Rankine also addressed in an article in The New York Times Magazine this year. "Help" will be directed by Taibi Magar, with movement choreography by the dancer Shamel Pitts. It will debut in March.
The United States premiere of "Misty," a play by the British playwright and actor Arinze Kene, will come in September. "Misty" had a buzzy debut in London at the Bush Theater last year, before transferring to the West End. The Shed has commissioned an altered version.
In May, the Shed's flagship space, the McCourt Theater, will host a large-scale interactive artwork from the visual artist Tomás Saraceno, part of an exhibition, "Particular Matter(s)," that deals with climate change.
The season will also feature work by the artists Ian Cheng and Howardena Pindell, plus commissions from the Shed's "Open Call" program, which develops work by New York artists.
Alongside newcomers, the 2020 slate will feature artists behind two of the first season's big shows.
The choreographer William Forsythe, who brought "A Quiet Evening of Dance" to the Shed this year, will return to the venue in October to debut a new work jointly commissioned by the Shed and Boston Ballet.
And after leading an interpretation of Verdi's "Requiem" at the Shed last month, the conductor Teodor Currentzis, along with the MusicAeterna chorus and orchestra, is set to perform another program in November, the details of which will be announced next year.
More information is available at theshed.org.

Uber settles federal case on sex harassment

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO - In 2017, a former Uber employee wrote a public essay describing how the ride-hailing company had permitted sexual harassment to fester at the workplace.
The revelations led to an outcry over Uber's toxic culture. Federal authorities and others began investigations into the company. More than 20 employees were later fired over their part in the behavior. And the disclosures raised questions about Uber's growthat-all-costs mentality, resulting in the ouster of Travis Kalanick, a ??-founder and then the chief executive.
On Wednesday, Uber resolved one investigation into its workplace culture. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which has been examining the company since 2017, said it had "found reasonable cause to believe that Uber permitted a culture of sexual harassment and retaliation against individuals who complained about such harassment."
Uber said it had agreed to a settlement with the agency by establishing a $4.4 million fund to pay current and former employees who were sexually harassed at work. It also agreed to three years of monitoring by a former agency commissioner to ensure that it changes its practices.
"This agreement will hopefully empower women in technology to speak up against sexism in the workplace knowing that their voices can yield meaningful change," said Ami Sanghvi, a trial lawyer with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission who consulted on the investigation.
Tony West, Uber's chief legal officer, said the company had "worked hard to ensure that all employees can thrive at Uber by putting fairness and accountability at the heart of who we are and what we do" and was working with the commission to improve those efforts.
The settlement showed how Uber was addressing the repercussions of its internal conduct more than two years after the envelope-pushing behavior of its executives and employees first came to light.
The company remains under investigation by the Justice Department over a tool it created to help it evade scrutiny by law enforcement authorities. It is also the subject of a consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission over its privacy practices until 2038. Last month, the authorities in London said they would not extend the company's license to operate there because Uber did not meet the "fit and proper" standard needed to hold a taxi license.
Dara Khosrowshahi, the chief executive, pledged to turn around Uber when he joined the company in late 2017, saying that his motto was "do the right thing." He then replaced much of the senior leadership, eliminated a mandatory arbitration provision for sexual assault and harassment claims against the company, and said that executive compensation would be tied to whether or not Uber reached its goals for hiring a more diverse staff.
Uber has also tried to be more transparent about its track record on safety and harassment. This month, it released its first report documenting the number of sexual assaults that occurred in the United States during Uber rides. Uber said it had counted 3,045 sexual assaults in 2018, which it said represented a small fraction of its rides.
As part of the settlement announced Wednesday, Uber employees who worked at the company after January 2014 will be eligible to submit claims to the commission.

Ex-model slams Harvey as Perv; New suit after $25M deal with most vics

Texto completo: Among Harvey Weinstein's alleged sexual assault victims was a 16-year-old model from Poland whose American acting dreams were dashed when the disgraced movie mogul took off his pants and "threateningly demanded sex," according to a lawsuit filed Thursday.
Former model Kaja Sokola was previously identified only as Jane Doe in an earlier class-action lawsuit against Weinstein.
But in a new suit filed in state Supreme Court against Weinstein, his former studio and its previous owner, Walt Disney Co., Sokola says that in 2002, when she was 16, she met him for a lunch where they were supposed to discuss her career.
But instead, the accused film fiend took her to his SoHo apartment where he "aggressively and threateningly demanded sex," the suit says.
Weinstein "instructed her to take off her clothes, before he took off his pants and, over her objections, forced her to touch his penis while he grabbed at her breasts," according to court papers.
"When I was 16 years old, I came to New York from Poland to work as a model and to try to become an actor, which had been my childhood dream," Sokola said in a statement. "Not long after I arrived in New York, I was sexually abused by Harvey Weinstein. I have been living with the trauma of that day ever since."
Last week, Weinstein reached a tentative $25 million settlement with many of his alleged sexual misconduct victims, according to The New York Times, which first reported the deal. The terms are such that Weinstein personally doesn't have to pay a dime, the paper reported.
Under the agreement, the insurance companies representing Weinstein's bankrupt film studio would foot the $25 million bill for payments to some of his accusers who are blocked by technicalities from filing civil claims.
The deal also does not require Weinstein to admit any wrongdoing.
Among those objecting to the settlement was lawyer Douglas Wigdor, who represents several of Weinstein's alleged victims, including Sokola.
"While others may have decided to settle, albeit under some of the most offensive and one-sided terms, we hope that the filing of this complaint encourages other victims and the New York attorney general to join us as we continue our efforts at holding Harvey Weinstein and his enablers accountable," Wigdor said in a statement. "Kaja Sokola, who was sexually abused by Harvey Weinstein when she was only 16 years old, is entitled to justice, and we intend to see that she gets it."
A Weinstein representative did not respond to a request for comment.
Sokola said her encounter with Weinstein made her give up on her career.
"I have long since moved on from modeling and, because of Harvey Weinstein, gave up on my dreams of acting," Sokola said.
"I am grateful to do important work as a clinical psychologist and psychotherapist. As part of my professional education and experience, I have learned that some wounds never fully heal. Memories of sexual abuse are like a scar after a burn, but because the injury is to the psyche, it is invisible to everyone except the victim. By revealing my own scar, I hope to encourage others to speak up about their own experiences," she added.

Texto completo: Our guide to plays and musicals coming to New York stages and a few last-chance picks of shows that are about to close. Our reviews of open shows are at nytimes.com/reviews/theater .
Previews & Openings
'GRAND HORIZONS' at the Hayes Theater (previews start on Dec. 23; opens on Jan. 23). The playwright Bess Wohl ("Continuity," "Small Mouth Sounds") makes a commitment to Broadway. In this new play, seen this past summer at the Williamstown Theater Festival, an elderly couple, freshly installed in a retirement community, contemplate divorce. Leigh Silverman directs a remarkable cast including Jane Alexander, James Cromwell, Ben McKenzie and Ashley Park.

Last Chance
'CYRANO' at the Daryl Roth Theater (closes on Dec. 22). The director Erica Schmidt's adaptation of Edmond Rostand's "Cyrano de Bergerac," with music by two members of the National, lays down its sword. While Ben Brantley's review described this New Group show as "somber and monotonous," he praised its star, Peter Dinklage, as being "by no means a disappointment as the witty, wily and dangerously underestimated title character."
800-745-3000, thenewgroup.org
'FIRES IN THE MIRROR' at the Pershing Square Signature Center (closes on Dec. 22). Anna Deavere Smith's 1992 anatomization of the Crown Heights riots ends its run. In Saheem Ali's revival, the piece is handed over to Michael Benjamin Washington, who performs verbatim monologues based on interviews with African-Americans and Hasidic Jews as well as others. The piece still, Ben Brantley wrote, "makes you catch your breath and shake your head in sorrow."
212-244-7529, signaturetheatre.org
'THE HALF-LIFE OF MARIE CURIE' at the Minetta Lane Theater (closes on Dec. 22). Lauren Gunderson's play about chemistry -- onstage and otherwise -- ends its experiment. Francesca Faridany stars as Marie Curie with Kate Mulgrew as her friend Hertha Ayrton. Elisabeth Vincentelli wrote that the show, directed by Gaye Taylor Upchurch, "is at its best when it lets the two stars strut their stuff."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Seven candidates took the debate stage Thursday night, hoping to make a splash at the last debate before the new year.
While the Democratic field has grown and shrunk repeatedly in the past few weeks, the stage held only seven candidates — the fewest of any debate so far this cycle.
Here's a look at the winners and losers:
Winners
Joe Biden
Former Vice President Joe Biden looked stronger and more relaxed Thursday night than he has in previous debates.
When asked about how to return to “normal” after a President Donald Trump administration, Biden pushed back against the notion of just returning to business as usual, stating, "Look, I didn't say return to normal. Normal is not enough. Normal, in fact, we would have to move beyond normal, whether health care, the environment, whatever it is. "
He continued to expand on working with his Republican counterparts, and that he refuses “to accept the notion, as some on this stage do, that we can never, never get to a place where we have cooperation again. If that’s the case, we’re dead as a country. ”
“If anyone has reason to be angry with Republicans and not want to cooperate, it’s me. They have attacked me, my son, my family,” he said, addressing the GOP's unfounded claims that Biden strong-armed the Ukrainian government to fire its top prosecutor in order to thwart an investigation into an Ukrainian energy company company tied to his son, Hunter Biden.
Explainer: Biden, allies pushed out Ukrainian prosecutor because he didn't pursue corruption cases
“We have to be able to get things done, and if we can’t convince them, we go out and beat them like we did in the 2018 election, in red states and in purple states,” he declared
When asked about Obama’s recent comments that there would be "significant improvement across the board" if countries were led by women, and that "old men" needed to get "out of the way," Biden joked that he is "going to guess he wasn’t talking about me either,” earning laughter from the audience.
But Biden did differentiate himself from the former president by stating he disagreed with Obama’s surge of troops in Afghanistan, and firmly quipped that he was the "guy from the beginning who argued that it was a big, big mistake to surge forces to Afghanistan, period. We should not have done it. And I argued against it constantly. "
Through Thursday night's showing, Biden displayed himself to be the strong, experienced, and leveled politician his campaign has been trying to present.
"Joe Biden tonight looked like a frontrunner, he fought like a frontrunner, he sounded like a frontrunner, and he deserves the credit,” CNN analyst Van Jones said after the debate.
Andrew Yang
Businessman Andrew Yang jokingly asked, "I know what you're thinking, America: How am I still on this stage with them?"
While Yang hasn't missed a debate thus far, he had more airtime than previous debates, and was able to expand on his answers with fewer candidates to compete with.
Yang had a forceful answer on a question related to people with disabilities, saying "Special needs children are going to become special needs adults . . . We have to stop confusing economic value and human value. . . We have to say 'Kyle, you have intrinsic value because you are a human being. ' "
Yang also answered firmly on needing more women in leadership across the globe, and declared, "Our country is deeply misogynist . . . money and men are tied together. The fact is, strong societies would elect more female leaders. "
He also got some chuckles from the audience after saying, "if you get too many men alone and leave us alone for awhile, we kind of become morons. "
Amy Klobuchar
Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar strategically acted as a peacekeeper a few times Thursday, touting her Midwestern roots by stopping a few word-battles between other candidates on stage with a "come on, you guys. " She then seamlessly dovetailed into her own stance on the issue.
She then hit Mayor Pete Buttigieg on his lack of experience, accusing him of “denigrating” the experience of the senators on stage.
“We should have someone heading up this ticket that has actually won and been able to show that they can gather the support that you talked about from moderate republicans and independents, as well as a fired-up democratic base,” Klobuchar said. “And not just done it once – I have done it three times. ”
Losers
Health care
Despite dominating the first half of the past several debates, health care took two hours to even be talked about at Thursday’s debate.
A November report by the New York Times found that health care had dominated the debates so far, with 95. 4 minutes were spent on the issue, besting the second-most mentioned issue of foreign policy by over 22 minutes.
The topic was brought up at the tailend of the debate, but did not bring forth any new debate on the topic.
Julián Castro and Tulsi Gabbard
Two Democratic presidential candidates who weren’t on stage Thursday night didn’t even get name checked.
Castro and Gabbard, who didn’t qualify for December’s debate, will likely struggle to gain traction and grow their base without the national audience a debate brings. Gabbard campaigned in Manchester, New Hampshire, during the debate, while Castro on Twitter answered what his responses to the debate questions would have been.
Sen. Cory Booker, who also didn’t make the stage, was at least mentioned by entrepreneur Andrew Yang.
“I miss Kamala (Harris), I miss Cory (Booker), though I think Cory will be back,” Yang said when asked about the lack of people of color on the stage. Castro is the only Latino candidate in the 2020 presidential election. Tulsi Gabbard is Samoan American.
Gabbard is at 1. 7% nationally, according to an average of polling by Real Clear Politics. Castro’s polling average is at 1. 3%.
What about Mayor Pete?
Buttigieg is polling ahead of the pack in multiple early states, and came out nearly unscathed during November's match up.
That was not the case Thursday.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren criticized Buttigieg on his recent fundraiser in a wine cave.
"Billionaires in wine caves should not pick the next president of the United States," she said.
But Buttigieg responded that he was the only one on the debate stage in Los Angeles who's not a millionaire or billionaire. He then was hit by Klobuchar for lack of experience.
"If you want to talk about the capacity to win, try putting together a coalition to bring you back to office with 80% of the vote as a gay dude in Mike Pence's Indiana," Buttigieg said to Klobuchar.
But it's unclear whether the mayor will see boost from his performance, and whether the jabs from other candidates will hurt.

Texto completo: (JTA) — Leonard Cohen’s son is releasing a new album of his late father’s music.
Adam Cohen asked some of his father’s longtime collaborators to flesh out the raw tracks left over from Cohen’s 2016 album, “You Want It Darker,” released just before the singer’s 2016 death.
“There’s that Jewish tradition of bringing a tiny rock or stone to a gravesite,” Adam Cohen told The New York Times in a story posted Tuesday ahead of the album’s release on Friday. “I felt like every person was there to just humbly deposit their little rock near the engraving of his name.”
Among the performers on the new album are Jennifer Warnes, who interpreted Cohen’s songs in a well-received 1987 album, and Javier Mas, a Spanish guitarist.

Texto completo: The president inquired about the jet and the company's health more broadly in a call with Dennis Muilenburg the day before Boeing paused production.
President Trump called Boeing's chief executive on Sunday to discuss the company's plans to halt production of the 737 Max, according to three people with knowledge of the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk about a private call.
Mr. Trump told the executive, Dennis A. Muilenburg, that he had heard that Boeing was planning to permanently shut down the Max production line, according to two of the people. Mr. Muilenburg assured the president that any pause to production would be temporary, and that there would be no layoffs as a result of the move, they said.
A day later, Boeing announced it was temporarily halting production of the 737 Max, which has been grounded for nine months after two crashes that killed 346 people.
On the call, which lasted five to 10 minutes, Mr. Trump expressed concern about the health of the company more broadly, and asked whether Mr. Muilenburg was doing O.K., the two people said.
Mr. Trump also asked about the status of the fix for software that Boeing developed for the Max and which was found to have played a role in both crashes. Mr. Muilenburg said that the company had a fix ready, but that American and international regulators still had to test it and approve it.
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The decision to temporarily shut down the Max factory in Renton, Wash., has sent ripples across the economy and the aviation industry, and underscored just how deeply the Max crisis has rattled one of America's most influential companies.
Until weeks ago, Boeing had been saying that it believed regulators would issue an order allowing the plane to return to service this year. But last week, Stephen Dickson, the administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration, said that the Max would not fly until 2020.
Over the weekend, Boeing's board gathered in Chicago for a scheduled meeting and, with company executives, deliberated either further reducing production of the Max or temporarily shutting the factory down. The company decided to halt production of the plane, a drastic move that signals just how uncertain the return of the plane remains.
On Tuesday, Southwest Airlines, the biggest Max customer, said it would further postpone Max flights until April. Suppliers around the world are bracing for a prolonged disruption as a result of the shutdown.
Boeing began work on the new model of its 737 under pressure in 2011 as the company sought to fend off competition from its European rival, Airbus. But after the two crashes, prosecutors, regulators and two congressional committees are investigating whether Boeing overlooked safety risks and played down the need for pilot training in its effort to design, produce and certify the plane as quickly as possible.
As the public face of the company, Mr. Muilenburg has been under intense pressure over the last year from lawmakers, Boeing board members and the families of the crash victims.
In October, the board stripped Mr. Muilenburg of his title as its chairman but allowed him to continue as chief executive. He faced aggressive questioning from lawmakers at hearings later that month, where relatives of the victims also called for him to resign.
The call on Sunday was not his first conversation with the president.
Before the Max was grounded, Mr. Muilenburg and Mr. Trump negotiated about Boeing's contract to build Air Force One planes at the president's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Mr. Trump joined Mr. Muilenburg for a tour of Boeing's 787 Dreamliner factory in North Charleston, S.C.
Then, two days after the second accident, in Ethiopia on March 10, Mr. Muilenburg called Mr. Trump and insisted the Max was safe. The United States grounded the plane the next day, however, after most other regulators around the world had already done so.
Mr. Trump has made the promise of a revival for America's manufacturers a tenet of his presidency. During the 2016 campaign, he vowed to bring back industrial jobs, helping him carry states like Michigan that had voted for Barack Obama in 2012.
And he has followed the Max crisis closely. "If I were Boeing, I would FIX the Boeing 737 MAX, add some additional great features, & REBRAND the plane with a new name," he wrote on Twitter in April. "No product has suffered like this one. But again, what the hell do I know?"

Texto completo: The colorized portrait of Joachim Peiper, whose unit slaughtered more than 80 American prisoners, was part of a Facebook commemoration of the battle on its 75th anniversary.
A unit of the United States Army said on Tuesday that it regrets sharing a colorized photograph of a Nazi war criminal in a Facebook post commemorating the 75th anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge after the post drew a widespread backlash on social media.
The photo was posted on the Facebook page of the Army's XVIII Airborne Corps on Monday morning, the first post in what the corps said would be a weekslong series about the battle. It was accompanied by a short, dramatic narrative about how the German officer, Joachim Peiper, decided to "gamble everything" and attack Allied forces in the Ardennes Forest on Dec. 16, 1944.
Peiper was also the commander of troops who would, a day later, commit what is known as the Malmedy massacre, during which more than 80 unresisting American prisoners were gunned down by a German SS armored division, which was not included in the corps' post.
The portrait of Peiper was also shared on Monday on the Defense Department's Facebook page before being deleted. The department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Many, including a public affairs officer with the Army, were quick to criticize the posts on social media.
"I am dumbfounded by the decision to prominently display a Nazi on military social media on the 75th anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge," the public affairs officer, Lt. Col. Brian Fickel, said on Twitter. (Colonel Fickel's biography on the site stipulates that "tweets are my own opinion and do not represent the Department of Defense or the United States Army.")
One comment on the corps' post called the photo a "nazi glam shot." Some also criticized the write-up accompanying the photo, with one commenter saying it was a "'fanboy' flavored piece."
The narrative begins with an anecdote about Peiper, who "hated to be alone with his thoughts," according to the post.
"There was an atmosphere of heaviness," the narrative reads. "This was the way he always thought the end of the world would feel."
Jonathan A. Greenblatt, the chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League, said in a statement Tuesday that "we should be honoring the brave soldiers who fought the Nazis and helped defeat their evil, anti-Semitic and hateful regime."
"Prominently featuring the colorized image of a Nazi war criminal does exactly the opposite: It serves to glorify Nazism," he said.
The Airborne Corps said in a Facebook post on Tuesday morning that the "intent was to tell the full story of the Battle of the Bulge, which will continue here, by explaining the incredible odds that were stacked up against the American Soldier by the time the reserve was called in on 18 Dec."
Col. Tage Rainsford, a spokesman for the Airborne Corps, said that the image had been bought from a community photo sharing website called ipernity, but that it was not immediately clear who sold the photo. He said a black-and-white version of the photo originally came from the National Archives.
The bottom right corner of the photograph that was posted on Facebook indicates that it was "colored by Tobias Kurtz." The photo still appeared Tuesday on an account on the art and graphics website DeviantArt bearing the name Tobias Kurtz of Slovakia, as identified on Twitter by Corey Pein, a journalist. The account shows several colorized Nazi photos and comments praising Nazis and Hitler.
The account did not respond to a message seeking comment on Tuesday.
The episode came amid a larger conversation about how institutions including the news media portray Nazis and other white supremacists, with some arguing that portraying extremists in context-free ways helps to place them in the mainstream or in a glamorous light.
It also occurred as the military was already under scrutiny over episodes involving white supremacist symbols and reported connections between service members and extremist groups. United States military officials said this week that they were investigating whether Army cadets and Navy midshipmen had flashed hand symbols associated with hate groups during a nationally televised pregame show before their football matchup on Saturday.
West Point recently announced that it had removed a racist slogan from its football team's spirit flag.
Colonel Rainsford said the Airborne Corps' Facebook post was not intended to glorify German forces or Peiper. The unit said the post was part of a series that would last for six weeks, with each post highlighting what happened during the battle on that day 75 years ago.
The Airborne Corps was one of numerous American military units that fought in the Battle of the Bulge, a surprise counterattack by the Germans that was one of their last attempts to turn the tide of the war after the Battle of Stalingrad and the D-Day landings. The Americans sustained about 75,000 casualties during the battle and the Germans about 80,000 to l00,000, according to an Army history.
Peiper was later tried by an American military tribunal and spent more than 10 years in prison. He traveled to France in 1969 and worked in public relations for an auto dealer.
In 1976, a group of armed Frenchmen surrounded his house and fought a gun battle with him, The New York Times reported. He was believed to have died in the attack.
Violence in his name, however, continued: In 1977, Reuters reported that a group calling itself the "Peiper Group" claimed responsibility for several attacks on Jewish and antiracist organizations in France.
Photograph The Defense Department deleted this Facebook post after complaints that it glamorized Joachim Peiper, a Nazi war criminal tied to a massacre.

Texto completo: El próximo debate presidencial demócrata se realizará según lo programado el jueves, después de que l os negociadores alcanzaron el martes un acuerdo tentativo sobre un contrato de tres años , finalizando así una disputa laboral que había amenazado con evitar que el evento tuviera lugar en la Universidad Loyola Marymount .
La disputa laboral entre un sindicato de trabajadores de cafetería y una empresa de servicios de alimentos en la universidad involucró solo a unos 150 trabajadores, pero amenazó con suspender un debate televisado a nivel nacional después de que los siete demócratas participantes dijeron que no cruzarían una línea de piquete.
El presidente del Comité Nacional Demócrata (DNC), Tom Pérez , pasó el fin de semana hablando por teléfono con el sindicato, Unite Here Local 11, su empleador, el proveedor de servicios de alimentos Sodexo; y otros funcionarios locales, informó The New York Times.
Luego de un largo fin de semana de discusiones, y una maratón de sesiones de negociación el lunes por la noche, el sindicato UNITE HERE Local 11 y la compañía de servicios de alimentos, Sodexo, anunciaron el martes que se había alcanzado el acuerdo tentativo.
El debate reunirá a Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, Andrew Yang y Tom Steyer.

Texto completo: The singing competition show will crown a new winner, and Stanley Kubrick's "The Killing" is available to stream.
What's on TV
THE VOICE 9 p.m. on NBC. It's the first time in seven seasons that all four of the current judges or team leaders of this singing competition -- Kelly Clarkson, John Legend, Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani -- have been represented in the season finale. Last week, America chose the powerhouse vocalist Katie Kadan (Team Legend), the country crooner Jake Hoot (Team Kelly), the rocker Ricky Duran (Team Blake) and the soulful songstress Rose Short (Team Gwen) as the four finalists. On Tuesday the show will crown its new winner. Each contestant will have a chance to perform a duet with a celebrity guest performer before the champion is announced.
DOGS OF THE YEAR 8 p.m. on the CW. If you're a dog owner, you are entitled to regard your good boy or girl as the dog of the year, every year. Aside from them, the pups rounded up in this year-end special have been recognized for going above and beyond in 2019. Kevin Frazier and Nischelle Turner from the American Kennel Club Museum of the Dog host this show that highlights the dogs of the year, like Barclay, the Labrador retriever adopted by the St. Louis Blues hockey team, and Taka, the shiba inu who survived a house fire and now works as a therapy dog for burn victims.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
WELL GROOMED 9 p.m. on HBO. In a reality version of the mockumentary "Best in Show," this documentary profiles dog lovers from all over the country who face off at cutthroat competitions. But their pooches aren't paraded around for judges in a traditional show. They're dyed, trimmed and coifed into living works of art by master dog groomers. The film follows a handful of these passionate artists for a year as they prepare for the Groom Expo, which bills itself as the world's largest grooming show.
What's Streaming
THE KILLING (1956) Stream on the Criterion Channel. This early Stanley Kubrick noir centers on the $ 2 million score a gang of criminals conspires to steal from a racetrack. In an "Ocean's Eleven"-style heist, a veteran crook, Johnny Clay, teams up with a corrupt cop, a racetrack betting teller, a bartender, a wrestler and a hired gun to loot the cash, which ends up causing more problems than it is meant to alleviate. In his review for The New York Times, A.H. Weiler called the film "an engrossing little adventure." "Chances are it will be less exhausting than a day at the track," he added.
RONNY CHIENG: ASIAN COMEDIAN DESTROYS AMERICA! Stream on Netflix. This comedian has made name for himself as a correspondent on "The Daily Show," where he lends his acerbic brand of humor to criticisms of Fox News and trends reserved for the ultra wealthy. For this Netflix comedy special, Chieng touches on his multicultural upbringing (born in Malaysia, raised in America and Singapore and schooled in Australia), the effects of rampant consumerism, and how he thinks the United States would fare with an Asian-American president.

Texto completo: DES MOINES — U. S. Sen. Cory Booker had a simple answer for what he does when he has trouble sleeping.
Watching the TV show "Jane the Virgin. "
“When your girlfriend is kissing another person, it’s something you have to watch,” he said of his partner, Rosario Dawson, who starred in the popular telenovela. Booker was on season five at the time of his October interview with the Des Moines Register’s editorial board.
Booker said he and Dawson also read out loud to each other. When they’re apart and he can’t sleep, the presidential candidate switches on Netflix.
“This is an endurance test, and God bless every candidate that is pushing themselves beyond the limits that they ever knew they had,” the New Jersey senator told the Register.
Presidential candidates, after all, are human — just the kind who've chosen to throw themselves into the draining endeavor that is the campaign trail, bopping from one state to the next, giving speeches, shaking hands and answering questions.
The remaining 15 Democratic presidential candidates have held a combined 1,278 election events in Iowa ramping up to the 2020 caucuses.
Over the past five months, as they stopped by the newsroom, the Register asked Democratic presidential candidates how they stay energized.
Their answers ranged from being exercise fanatics to consuming “copious amounts of caffeine,” but most, in the end, circled back to the energy they get from their missions and their supporters.
Hitting the gym
Last month former U. S. Rep. John Delaney of Maryland — who's known for making time for the gym — posted a video on Twitter of himself doing box jumps.
"Lots of people 'jumping' into the race so I decided to do a few sets of 10 box jumps on the 30 inch platform as a warm-up to my workout!" he tweeted.
Tom Steyer, an activist and billionaire from California, described himself as an exercise "fanatic. "
He aims to work out an hour every day. When on the campaign trail, that often means 50 minutes on the elliptical, five minutes of stretching and five minutes of push-ups, Steyer told the Register following his October editorial board meeting.
Former secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julián Castro said he tries to hit the treadmill often. It’s part of a routine that Castro said he’s come to value as he aims to become "one of those people" who go to bed by 10 p. m.
Castro said he also tries to avoid junk food and loves to Facetime his kids when he’s away.
Former Vice President Joe Biden, who hasn't yet visited the Register newsroom, said that he, too, tries to work out.
“I work out every morning,” Biden told the New York Times. “I usually work on the Peloton bike, and I lift. ”
South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg said he often builds running into his daily regimen.
“I wish I could say it’s by riding a bicycle for an hour,” U. S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar said when asked how she re-energizes. The Minnesota senator said she tries to exercise as often as she can, but also tends to rejuvenate by taking occasional breaks here and there, and by going to the movies.
When she spoke with the Register in August, Klobuchar had recently watched "The Farewell," a movie she recommended highly. She planned to watch "Where’d You Go, Bernadette," the following weekend.
Coffee versus tea
“I don’t drink coffee,” U. S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts told the Register in November. “Can you imagine me on coffee?”
She joked that she’s still working off the half a cup of coffee she had at Dunkin' Donuts several years ago. Warren said she won’t even touch decaf coffee, though she does drink very weak tea.
Entrepreneur Andrew Yang, also a tea aficionado, said he downs one to three bottles of green tea each day.
During Booker’s interview with the Register’s editorial board, he accidentally kicked over a drink, which he later admitted was comprised of four shots of espresso over ice from Mars Sidebar coffee shop.
A Mars Sidebar barista later reported that Booker bought another quadruple shot of espresso on his way out, after the meeting.
When asked how many of those he consumes a day, Booker said his diet consists of “copious amounts of caffeine. ”
Other candidates prefer a noncaffeinated high.
U. S. Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado said he tries to take a few minutes each day on the campaign trail — usually when he's in the car between events — to call his wife and three daughters.
"The calls aren't always long, but they're enough to keep me motivated and recharged," Bennet told the Register. "It beats coffee. "
Chasing sleep
The New York Times earlier this year asked the candidates how many hours of shut-eye they get a night.
While Bennet and U. S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii said they clock in around six, Castro said if he gets more than five, he's "doing well. "
Meanwhile, author and candidate Marianne Williamson told the Times she aspires to eight hours of pillow time, but rarely achieves it.
Yang, who has two young children, told the Register he gets “normal amounts of sleep,” but acknowledged his kids usually wake him up pretty early.

On average, Warren said she gets seven hours of zzz's, plus she tries to eat every two or three hours to keep up her energy.
Klobuchar said she tries to get five to six hours of sleep each night, but she takes naps sometimes, too.
Steyer said he “sleeps like a baby,” adding that it helps not to have anything weighing on his conscience. When his alarm goes off in the morning, he's ready to jump out of bed and throw on one of his 10 plaid ties before hitting the next stop on the campaign trail.
When asked if he sleeps, U. S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont said “not enough,” but said he’s sleeping better “since the incident,” referring to his October heart attack.
But really, they have voters to thank
When asked what gives him energy throughout the day, Sanders turned to a response that many candidates offered.
“I’m going to give you an answer that you think is not truthful, but it is," Sanders said. "I get my energy by meeting fantastic people all over this country. ”
Booker, in providing a similar answer, pointed to the late-night hospitality of Iowan Nancy Bobo as an example. He stayed at her home while campaigning in Des Moines, and he recalled her putting out his favorite snacks and a T-shirt when he arrived at midnight.
He said her energy at that moment soothed, nurtured and energized him.
“When I am tired, when I’m on my third or fourth flight of the day, it is the kindnesses and energy of the people that come to see you, that bring you vegan food, that do all kinds of nice things," Booker continued.

Yang said that when he launched his campaign two years ago, small crowds turned out. He braced himself for that kind of response for the duration. But now, he's sometimes met by hundreds of members of the Yang Gang, as his supporters call themselves. It's invigorating, he said.
Warren said the inner dialogue that motivates her every day centers on the connections she will make in the coming hours.
“It’s one more chance to tell one more person and hope that it will spark a little optimism that we could fix this," she said.

Texto completo: Best known for her work with Jean-Luc Godard, she also appeared in films by Visconti, Fassbinder and others, as well as pursuing a singing career and writing four novels.
Anna Karina, the Danish-born actress who became a symbol of the French New Wave in Jean-Luc Godard's 1960s films, died on Saturday in Paris. She was 79.
The death was confirmed by France's culture minister, Franck Riester, in a post on Twitter and by her agent, Laurent Balandras, who said the cause was cancer.
Making her first film in her teens, Ms. Karina started at the top: Godard's "Le Petit Soldat" ("The Little Soldier"), about terrorism during the French-Algerian War. The film, shot in 1960, was not released until 1963 because of censorship. Between those two events, Ms. Karina won the 1961 best actress award at the Berlin International Film Festival for Godard's "Une Femme Est Une Femme" ("A Woman Is a Woman"), in which she played an unmarried stripper who wants to have a baby.
Her other full-length Godard films, released between 1961 and 1966, were "Vivre Sa Vie" ("My Life to Live"), about a young woman who drifts into prostitution; "Bande à Part" ("Band of Outsiders"), a crime comedy about a romantic triangle and a burglary; "Pierrot le Fou," a crime drama about a bored husband on the run with his former mistress, an arms smuggler; "Alphaville," a science-fiction tale set in a loveless dystopian future; and "Made in U.S.A.," a crime comedy set in Atlantic-Cité, a fictional French town.
In later years, Ms. Karina played down the notion that she and Godard -- whom she married in 1961 -- were reinventing cinema, as some film historians liked to say, but she did acknowledge his unusual directorial style.
"In older Hollywood movies, a character will make an entrance, close a door, light a cigarette, sit down, have a drink," she told The New York Times in 2016. "In Jean-Luc's movies, you were doing everything at once. And sometimes you wouldn't shut the door all the way. Sometimes your cigarette wouldn't light on the first try." It was, she recalled, "more like being than acting."
Whether playing a streetwalker or a terrorist, Ms. Karina managed to look a bit like a schoolgirl, with her dark hair, wispy bangs, heavy eyeliner and lycée-chic wardrobe of sailor-uniform tops, knee socks, lots of plaid and perky headwear, from berets to boaters.
She went on to make about three dozen other films, and took up directing with the 1973 film "Vivre Ensemble." "I wanted to see if I could do it. That's all," she told The Guardian decades later. She also directed, wrote and starred in her last film, "Victoria" (2008), about a woman with amnesia traveling in Canada.
Ms. Karina also pursued a singing career, with late-1960s hits like "Sous le Soleil Exactement" and "Roller Girl," both written by Serge Gainsbourg. And she wrote four novels, including "Golden City" (1983), which she described to the quarterly Film Comment as "a kind of thriller, with gangsters."
But she was still best known for her earliest film roles.
"Whatever Godard required, Karina provided," a 2016 article in The Guardian said. "She could be headstrong and wayward, gorgeous and broken. She was the effervescent free spirit of the French New Wave, with all of the scars that the position entails."
Hanne Karin Bayer was born on Sept. 22, 1940, in Solbjerg, Denmark, a suburban town on the country's east coast. Her father left the family a year after her birth. Her mother ran a dress shop.
Hanne lived with her maternal grandparents for three years and was in foster care for four years but eventually went back to live with her mother.
She dropped out of school at 14, sang in cabarets and worked as a television model. At 17, she ran away from home -- hitchhiking to Paris -- and was discovered by the casting director of an advertising agency while sitting at Les Deux Magots, the fashionable Left Bank cafe. During a photo shoot for Elle magazine, she met the fashion designer Coco Chanel, who advised her to change her name.
Godard, a film critic at the time, saw her in a movie theater ad for a Palmolive bath product. When he subsequently offered her a small part in his first full-length film, "Breathless" (1960), she objected to doing a nude scene. Godard said he didn't understand -- after all, he had just seen her onscreen in a bathtub, looking very comfortable and showing plenty of skin.
"I wasn't nude," she told him, according to a 2016 interview with Vogue magazine. "That was your imagination." She had been wearing a swimsuit in the tub, she said, and "the soapsuds were up to my neck."
Godard called again and cast her in his next film, "Le Petit Soldat." Because she was a minor at the time, she had to seek permission from her estranged mother, who flew to Paris to sign the contract.
Information on survivors was not immediately available.
Ms. Karina had little connection with American movies. She had a role in George Cukor's "Justine" (1969), but that movie had an international cast, including Anouk Aimée and Dirk Bogarde. She also made an appearance in Jonathan Demme's "The Truth About Charlie" (2002), but it was filmed mostly in France.
After her divorce from Godard ("He would say he was going out for cigarettes and come back three weeks later," she told The Guardian), she married several other times. Her second and third husbands, Pierre Fabre and Daniel Duval, were actors, and both marriages ended in divorce. She married the American-born film director Dennis Berry in 1982.
Ms. Karina was happy to acknowledge Godard as a Pygmalion figure but also pointed out her own contributions. As she told a French video interviewer in the 1960s, "I gave him self-confidence."

'Bombshell' Opens, Cuing Talk of Kelly

Texto completo: A year after the anchor was ousted from NBC, Charlize Theron brings her back as someone who helped take on Fox News from the inside.
Megyn Kelly last appeared on NBC more than a year ago, trying to contain an uproar over on-air remarks about blackface that ultimately brought her tenure at the network to an abrupt, unhappy end.
In a few weeks' time, she will make a return -- of sorts.
On Jan. 5, NBC will broadcast the 2020 Golden Globes, where Charlize Theron will walk the red carpet as a leading nominee for her portrayal of Ms. Kelly in the movie "Bombshell," a dramatized account of the Fox News chairman Roger Ailes's downfall that puts Ms. Kelly center stage.
Viewers will be treated to clips of Ms. Theron's uncanny rendition of Ms. Kelly -- the actress captures, with startling precision, the vocal tics and lawyerly cadences of the former Fox News anchor -- in a performance that generated awards buzz even before the film opened on Friday in New York and Los Angeles. (Its wide release begins next Friday.)
But so far, Ms. Kelly has shown little interest in weighing in on her big-screen doppelgänger.
She did not participate in the making of the film -- which was directed by Jay Roach from a script by Charles Randolph -- and she and Ms. Theron have never spoken. Ms. Kelly attended a screening of "Bombshell" in New York last month, according to two people familiar with the event, but made no public remarks about it.
Ms. Kelly declined to comment for this article. On Friday, in an Instagram post, she wrote that watching "Bombshell" was "an incredibly emotional experience for me," and that she had seen the film "once it was past the point of any possible edits, though there are certainly some I would have made."
Her quietude may be strategic. Behind the scenes, Ms. Kelly is pondering a route back into the national media, according to several people who requested anonymity in describing private conversations with the anchor.
In recent weeks, Ms. Kelly has begun to re-emerge. After months of communicating primarily via Twitter, she appeared on Tucker Carlson's prime-time show in October -- to the chagrin of many of Mr. Carlson's Fox News colleagues -- and has posted two self-produced interviews to her Instagram account, including one with the House minority leader, Representative Kevin McCarthy.
Still, these appearances are a far cry from Ms. Kelly's previous perch as a daily presence in American living rooms, first in prime time on Fox News and then, less successfully, in the 9 a.m. hour of NBC's "Today." On Fox News, she regularly drew two million to three million viewers a night; her Instagram videos have received a small fraction of that.
Ms. Kelly's portrayal in "Bombshell" may return the anchor to public consciousness, and the depiction is, on balance, a positive one. Ms. Theron's Kelly is a tack-sharp anchor who presses Donald J. Trump on his sexism during a major debate, puts up with verbal abuse from right-wing trolls (and newsroom colleagues) and ultimately comes forward about being harassed by Mr. Ailes, a testimonial that seals the once-invincible TV king's fate.
But like the real-life Ms. Kelly, the movie version has already proved divisive.
In The New York Times, Manohla Dargis described the onscreen Ms. Kelly as "a warrior" who "could lead an army or maybe a rebellion, if she chose," even as the character hesitates between principle and ambition. (The film also dings Ms. Kelly for lobbing softball questions at Mr. Trump in a 2016 prime-time interview.) But Ms. Dargis, as well as critics at BuzzFeed News and The Guardian, also faulted the filmmakers for playing down Ms. Kelly's role in Mr. Ailes's success; after all, she was a willing star on his network for years.
Her rocky tenure at NBC -- where she clashed with colleagues and drew low ratings -- has dimmed the likelihood of a return to broadcast television. Instead, Ms. Kelly has discussed potential jobs in digital news, including conversations with podcast production companies, according to the people familiar with her thinking.
Ms. Kelly, the people said, believes she can find a niche as an equal-opportunity skeptic amid a divided news media. She has told friends that she did not feel comfortable at her previous employers. "I felt like the Rachel Maddow of Fox News and the Sean Hannity of NBC," she has said.
Ms. Kelly is not currently restricted from working for another outlet, and she is still collecting the remainder of her roughly $ 30 million exit agreement with NBC, according to two people familiar with the terms of her deal. Other people who have spoken with her say they do not expect an imminent career announcement.
"She will be an asset to any television (or other) network who is seeking an exceptional journalist who has a gift of finding the right angle to a story or interview," said Eric Bolling, a former Fox News personality who now hosts a national affairs show for Sinclair Broadcast Group.
Any attempt to revive her fortunes, however, will face resistance.
It was nearly three years ago that Ms. Kelly made her splashy, $ 69 million deal with NBC, which gave her a Sunday night newsmagazine show as well as a daytime slot and made her one of the richest personalities in television news. The move went sideways in a hurry.
An early broadcast of "Sunday Night With Megyn Kelly" sparked criticism after she interviewed the Infowars leader Alex Jones, and the show failed to find an audience. The sunny environment of morning television proved an odd fit for Ms. Kelly's prosecutorial persona; the anchor initially delivered poor ratings and caused a stir after she offended a guest, Jane Fonda, by asking about her plastic surgery; she later assailed Ms. Fonda on-air as "Hanoi Jane."
Since "Megyn Kelly Today" was canceled in October 2018, viewership for the hour has gone up 9 percent, according to Nielsen, a noticeable uptick when ratings across the board have gone down.
All the while, Ms. Kelly was attacked from the left for her comments over the years at Fox News, most prominently a segment where she insisted that Santa Claus is white. (The Santa uproar is mentioned several times in "Bombshell.") Last fall, she stunned co-workers by musing on-air that it was once appropriate for white people to dress up in blackface for Halloween. Days later, her show was canceled.
Ms. Kelly believed that NBC executives had used the blackface uproar as a pretext to fire her because they were uncomfortable with her reporting on the network's own harassment scandal, involving the "Today" host Matt Lauer, who had been fired after allegations of sexual misconduct in November 2017. On Twitter, she continues to suggest a double standard: Last week, she posted a video from an early-2000s episode of Comedy Central's "The Man Show" in which Jimmy Kimmel, now the host of ABC's late-night program, wore blackface to portray the basketball player Karl Malone.
"America's late night darling Jimmy Kimmel? Who every Hollywood star cozies up to?" Ms. Kelly tweeted. "The very same stars who then lecture the rest of us on woke culture? Whatever could he have done??"
Her attack on Mr. Kimmel is typical of the online persona Ms. Kelly has cultivated over the past year. In between updates on her family life in Manhattan and a newly adopted dog, Ms. Kelly has aimed spiky commentary at the mainstream media, including former NBC colleagues like Seth Meyers and the "Today" host Craig Melvin.
On Mr. Carlson's show in October, Ms. Kelly faulted NBC for failing to commission an independent investigation of its newsroom culture. Her appearance was a hit: More than four million people tuned in, higher than Mr. Carlson's average audience and making it the most-watched program in all of cable that night.
Her efforts since have not had the same reach. Ms. Kelly joined Instagram last month to promote an interview she secured with a young TV producer involved in a dust-up at ABC News over the network's decision, several years ago, not to air an investigative report about Jeffrey Epstein. The interview has been viewed about 272,000 times on YouTube.
On Mr. Carlson's show, Ms. Kelly said she was relishing spending time with her young children. But her comments suggested that "Bombshell," and Ms. Theron's portrayal of her, might not be the final word.
"I'll get back on that horse soon, because this has been fun," Ms. Kelly told Mr. Carlson, smiling. "I'll probably get back out there."

Texto completo: It finally happened. Monroe County has admitted what many have long known: local government will not be able to save all places and properties from losses due to rising seas.
Based on the projected costs of raising roads in the Florida Keys, Monroe County recognized that the price tag would be too high. The estimated cost to keep one three-mile stretch of road dry from expected 2060 flooding is over $60 million per mile.
But which roads - and the properties that depend on them - will be saved? And who pays? The private property owners? The county's taxpayers? The State of Florida (again, taxpayers)?
One possible approach is buyouts. While buyouts are increasingly discussed as a method of promoting "managed relocation" away from rising seas, buyouts present serious challenges as a long-term policy. First, the concept of buyouts originally developed as way to address problems in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), not as a response to rising seas. Buyouts were developed to address the fact that about 1 percent of the properties insured by the NFIP represented over 30 percent of the payouts.
This led to the argument that it would be cheaper for the federal government to buy properties that repeatedly flood rather than continue to pay insurance losses on those properties. But sea-level rise and the challenges of the NFIP are different. Buying out properties with elevated buildings that do not flood but are unlivable because they are not accessible does not, ultimately, save taxpayers money. Second, buyouts are expensive. There is not enough money to buy out all of the properties that are or will be at risk from sea-level rise.
Third, recent research indicates that while wealthier and more highly populated counties conduct more buyouts, the buyouts occur disproportionately in areas of greater social vulnerability. This leads to a fourth challenge. The notion will grow that, "If that property being swallowed by the sea got a buyout at a good price, then I don't need to worry about the future since when my property is at risk or lost, I'll get a good price for my property as well." As more property owners begin to think of the government as the insurer of their property, political and legal pressure to fulfill these expectations will grow. This conflicts with the knowledge that there is not enough money to buy out all of the properties at risk.
This dynamic highlights a fifth risk of buyouts as a general policy: they represent a potentially massive redistribution of wealth from taxpayers to property owners, essentially making government the insurers of properties that may be lost to rising seas.
As Florida Keys Mayor Heather Carruthers told the New York Times: "[W]e'll probably face some lawsuits."
Yes, that is almost guaranteed. But it will not usually be the poor hiring lawyers; it will be the wealthier landowners.
But courts are seldom the best way to make good public policy. Rather than waiting for lawsuits, governments should engage citizens in discussions about how to address the losses that sea-level rise will cause.
Local and state government need to develop policies that save what can be saved, prolong the quality of life where it can reasonably be prolonged, and accept the loss of what cannot be saved without bankrupting governments.
The complexity of developing such policies is not the job of courts. It is the responsibility of legislative bodies.
And they have options for policy development, though none will be easy. One basic policy that many have advocated is better notice to property owners and purchasers of potential impacts on properties.
Currently only a few states provide potential purchasers notice of flood risk. However, providing notice of the current and expected impacts due to sea-level rise is not being done. Providing such information would allow potential purchasers to make more informed decisions. Providing this type of information could have other benefits: it would help people understand that government cannot, and is not legally obligated to, serve as an insurer that property owners do not experience loss; it would promote the property market integrating the costs of potential risk into the pricing; and it could serve as a point in time where we say that taxpayers are not liable to pay for the costs of risks knowingly undertaken by property purchasers. Sea-level rise is going to cause extensive loss of property and money. Legislative bodies need to develop defensible policies that seek not only to "protect" areas from sea-level rise but also to help guide what happens and who shoulders the burden when the inevitable occurs.

Texto completo: Lovers in Auschwitz, Reunited
Hundreds of readers responded by letter or at nytimes.com to Keren Blankfeld's article on a man and woman who met at Auschwitz and reconnected 72 years later. Comments have been edited. Thirty years ago, I was staying at the home of a friend in Jerusalem, a child of survivors. One day we took a local bus ride to the center of the town. I remarked to my friend that the stories of the people for whom the Jerusalem streets are named must be extraordinary. "You don't need street signs," my friend said. "Just look around the bus -- their stories, too."
Richard Altabef, Queens
The utter improbability of surviving Auschwitz coupled with a love story demonstrates the power of luck and faith. The talents of each of the survivors kept them alive as privileged inmates. The twisted ideology of the Nazis somehow still created an opportunity to live if you could sing or create art. The Nazis' strict adherence to detail and recording the victims as only numbers hardly seems to allow for anything so subjective as creativity or anything resembling humanity.
Auschwitz was a massive factory of death and yet romance flourished. The idea that something in life is meant to be is proved by this beautiful love story and reunion after 72 years. The last Hungarian song the cantor sang to his lover had created a life saving connection and that is unforgettable.
Steven A. Ludsin, East Hampton, N.Y. The writer was on the President's Commission on the Holocaust and the Holocaust Memorial Council.
This is a beautifully treasured story. To finally know the answer after 72 years is astonishing. Oftentimes, we seek answers to questions from our childhood and we never find the answer. My grandfather was an American soldier during World War II, helping to liberate Germany. I spoke with him a few times. He never spoke about the war. His silence and faraway eyes left me numbed after our meetings. He died many years earlier. He never shared his war experience. His experience is lost forever. I am glad this story will live for generations.
Sergio Lira, Houston
I'm lying here in bed this morning with tears in my eyes having just read this beautiful and heart-wrenching, truly life-affirming story. Lately I find myself approaching my daily (sometimes hourly) perusing of The New York Times online with anticipated dread and a low level of anxiety. To me, the news of the day remains bleak and filled with depressing news. It never used to be that way. Just when I consider that I should break from The Times and stop reading it, even going so far as canceling my subscription, along comes a story which supports my belief in the basic good of humanity. That there are in fact people among us who recognize the value of decency, of moral courage, and the hopes we may share for the potential for a caring, nonviolent global community is rooted in the most basic of relationships -- that between just two people.
Rtd, Orange County, N.Y.
During my childhood, David Wisnia was my cantor at Temple Shalom. He had a joy about him and a lightness to his singing. He is the standard by which I judge other cantors. I knew early in my life that he was an Auschwitz survivor, as were some others in our temple. I am grateful to Helen Spitzer for saving him so my family could know him.
PCh, Fort Myers, Fla.
My parents were Holocaust survivors. It was like the Holocaust itself was a family member -- always there, always present, always warning that as safe or good as the world seemed, it could turn on a dime in a flash.
Sharon Levine, Roosevelt, N.J.
My uncle was a survivor, and the rest of my father's family were killed in Poland. My father came to the United States before the war. He read numerous survivor stories, and in his opinion the one thing they had in common was pure luck. But, I think it was luck combined with courage. We must never forget!
Carol Selick, Monroe Township, N.J.
My parents were young concentration camp survivors. I grew up without knowing any of my grandparents, who perished in the Shoa. I grew up with the Holocaust being a presence in my life, and when my son was young I pondered way too much being a mother in a camp. The story of these Auschwitz lovers is like a small flower among ruins -- an act of defiance, the victory of hope. I can now imagine that there were many others who fought the Nazis by this basic weapon of life.

Tears flowing. What a testament to human spirit and devotion. To think she saved him five times, from "bad transport." They both made a life worth living, filled with love and purpose. Triumphed over their captors and survived, not only for themselves but also for those that perished.
To think how many lives were taken, people that could have lived and loved. Taking their lives was one evil, robbing them of a life of happiness and love was the ultimate cruelty. What was the purpose? The motivation? That this gentle and caring man had to witness and drag dead bodies from the electric fences, at just 17, is horrific. He was brave and daring, and she too.
Andrew B, Sonoma County, Calif.
Mr. Wisnia's need to ask Ms. Spitzer if she had saved his life is an iteration of the question that haunts most of the Holocaust survivors I've worked with: How is it they stayed alive when others, even those with identical "advantages" did not? By any measure, Ms. Spitzer was an extraordinary woman. It was Mr. Wisnia's great luck to have crossed paths with her, someone who saved his life not once, but five times. And luck? That is the only answer Holocaust survivors I've known give to the question of how they survived. May Mr. Wisnia have found peace in Ms. Spitzer's reply.

Texto completo: The soccer club distanced itself after Mesut Özil condemned China's mass detention of Uighurs. But Chinese state media, and sports fans, were not mollified.
BEIJING -- The German soccer star Mesut Özil is the latest international sports celebrity to be at the center of controversy over China's hard-line policies, igniting fury among Chinese internet users by denouncing the country's mass detention of Muslims.
Mr. Özil, who is of Turkish heritage and plays for Arsenal, an English Premier League club, took on one of China's most sensitive policies with his comments on Friday about Uighurs, a largely Muslim Turkic minority in Xinjiang, in northwestern China.
The Chinese authorities have held as many as a million Uighurs, and possibly more, in indoctrination camps meant to drastically weaken their commitment to Islam. The internments have drawn international anger and led to legislation in the United States Congress that could impose sanctions on Chinese officials over the detentions, which China says are intended to deter terrorism.
"They shut down their mosques. They ban their schools. They kill their holy men. The men are forced into camps and their families are forced to live with Chinese men," read identical posts on Mr. Özil's Twitter and Instagram accounts, according to a translation by The Guardian.
"But Muslims are silent," they read. "Don't they know that giving consent for persecution is persecution itself?"
While some foreign celebrities and companies who have offended Chinese sensitivities in recent years seem to have done so unwittingly, there seems little doubt that Mr. Özil's remarks were carefully chosen. His reference to Xinjiang as East Turkestan, a name for the region used by advocates of self-rule for Uighurs, made matters worse for many Chinese.
Arsenal quickly tried to distance itself from Mr. Özil's posts, but the club's response did not stave off a wave of online anger in China.
"The content posted was entirely Özil's personal view," Arsenal said in a statement early Saturday on Weibo, a social media platform that, like Twitter, allows users to share comments. "As a football club, Arsenal always adheres to the principle of keeping out of politics."
That statement was not enough, many commentators in China said.
Some likened the controversy to one in October, when the N.B.A. was the target of condemnation. Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Houston Rockets, had issued a tweet (quickly deleted) that seemed to express sympathy with protesters in Hong Kong demanding democracy.
The N.B.A., in a statement in Chinese, said it was "extremely disappointed" by Mr. Morey's tweet. But the N.B.A.'s commissioner, Adam Silver, then said that the league was committed to freedom of speech for its employees, drawing another round of anger from Chinese basketball fans and state media.
"Özil, you're even worse than Morey!" read an online article in Global Times, a stridently nationalist Chinese tabloid, on Saturday. It cited an outpouring of furious comment on the Chinese internet, including an announcement that a fan chat room devoted to Mr. Özil would close.
"As Chinese people we cannot accept this," the chat room announced. "Where nationalist interests are concerned, nobody's personal pastimes are worthy of mentioning."
China's internet is heavily censored, usually making it an echo chamber of officially approved opinion. Even so, many Chinese people do support the government's harsh policies in Xinjiang, including the detention camps, which the government calls job training centers.
In his comments, Mr. Özil referred to the widespread reluctance of many Muslim-majority countries to openly criticize China over its policies in Xinjiang. Chinese officials may worry that his statement could inspire more Muslims abroad to demand action against Beijing.
Mr. Özil's comments "hurt the feelings of the Chinese people," the Chinese Football Association said in a statement quoted by The Paper, a news site based in Shanghai. "This is unacceptable to us," the association said.
International debate about Xinjiang escalated in recent weeks after investigative reports from The New York Times and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists that provided new details about the indoctrination camps.
The Chinese government has denounced the reports as false or as part of a conspiracy to foment ethnic unrest in Xinjiang. The government also issued English-language videos to make the case that China was menaced by extremist violence among Uighurs.
Many foreign experts argue that while anti-Chinese violence has been a problem in Xinjiang, the government has unfairly painted vast numbers of Uighurs as potential extremists and exacerbated ethnic divisions with its mass detentions.
If recent experience offers any guidance, Mr. Özil and Arsenal can expect days, maybe weeks, of bitter criticism from Chinese media and officials.
"It's safe to say that this incident will damage the image of Özil and the Arsenal club in the eyes of Chinese football fans," Hu Xijin, the editor of Global Times, wrote in a commentary. But he advised fans not to go too far and stoke international attention.
"I argue that we Chinese people should maintain a scornful attitude toward these kinds of people and their games," he said.

One last trip into the Black Hole

Texto completo: Their team Las Vegas-bound, rabid Raiders fans aren't sure what the future will hold
Prison, Hall of Fame tight end Shannon Sharpe once reckoned, was a more suitable place to be than playing football in front of Oakland-Alameda County Stadium's Sections 104, 105, 106 and 107, the seats behind the end zone referred to by Raiders fans as the Black Hole.
'It's a lot safer,' Sharpe told the New York Times in 2001. 'I've been hit in the head with nails, batteries, had beer thrown at me.'
For hometown fans, the Black Hole and its pregame tailgates have the familiarity and welcome grunge of a dive bar. For all others: 'No joke, visitors should beware,' former Washington Post columnist William Gildea wrote in 2001.
But as the Raiders prepare to leave Oakland for Las Vegas in 2020, members of the Black Hole " not just the seating section but a fan club with more than a dozen chapters, including in Germany and Australia " are contemplating their group's future.
The team's final game in Oakland is Sunday against the Jacksonville Jaguars. The Black Hole's presence in Las Vegas, where there's no affiliated chapter, is unclear. Group leaders said they have had no communication with the team about what presence the Black Hole may have at the Raiders' new home.
'I'm sad, disappointed and angry all in one,' Cisco Ortega, the group's vice president, said in a phone interview.
'I just love it here,' Coach Jon Gruden, now in his second stint coaching in Oakland, told the Associated Press. 'I had my first son here, and I kind of have a lot of history here, and some of my friends, a lot of my friends are in the Black Hole. A lot of my only friends are here. I don't have a lot of friends except the guys in the Black Hole. I only get to see them six or seven times. I get emotional talking about it.'
Part biker gang, part fraternity, part congregation of football evangelists, the group was born in 1995 when the Raiders moved back to Oakland after 13-years in Los Angeles. Members embodied the buccaneering spirit of franchise owner Al Davis, who jousted with the NFL over relocation issues, seeming to personify the team's mascot: a grinning pirate wearing an eye patch in front of crossed swords, a la a skull and crossbones.
'Raiders fans look scary sometimes,' former quarterback and coach Tom Flores told the Associated Press. 'It's like Halloween every Sunday.'
The group wasn't afraid to employ tactics such as brutalizing opposing players in effigy, once tying a noose around the neck of a dummy made to look like Miami Dolphins quarterback Jay Fiedler and tossing it into the crowd for kicks and punches. Members famously greeted opponents' buses as they pulled onto the stadium grounds. Offensive lineman Kevin Donnalley joked to Gildea the fans were famous for 'the one-finger hello.'
They made the stadium one of the NFL's loudest and, for opponents, one of its most reviled. Along with the infield dirt on the playing surface " the Coliseum is the league's last multisport venue " and the dingy locker rooms, there were the fans to deal with.
'Batteries, chicken bones, coins, you name it,' longtime offensive lineman Kevin Mawae listed for the Times in 2003 the items pelted at him while playing before the Black Hole. 'I've had it all. You just hope you don't get backed up, and when you do, you keep your helmet on.'
Members took on nicknames (Ortega goes by 'Black Hole Cisco Kid') that instilled a sense of individuality and collegiality. Gildea wrote about fans who were known at the stadium simply as Mr. Mack, Run Run Jones and the Cigar Man. The group ferociously defended its members, even as some developed a bad reputation over disputes with opposing fans that could lead to fisticuffs.
As foreboding as the group looked to outsiders, the community is full of the 'aloha spirit,' as Ortega explained.
'We reference each other as family,' Ortega said. 'Any time you get to the tailgate, of course there's handshakes, but there's hugs first.'
As the team prepares to relocate about 400 miles away, Black Hole members are grappling with how to carry on while the NFL and franchise executives attempt to court new fans who have never had a home football team.
'You have the home fans, the Oakland-Bay Area fans, that are angry and sad and pissed off, so to speak, and through the wonders of social media, they speak their minds,' Ortega said. '. . . And people from the East Coast, all they were seeing was this brand new beautiful stadium and saying, 'Now I can go to Vegas and party it up with a football game.' And I thought, San Francisco is one of the most beautiful cities in the world; why not come out here and watch the game?'
The move isn't as crushing for Ortega as it could have been; his company recently transferred him to Las Vegas from San Francisco. Black Hole members tell him that's 'the big man upstairs looking out for you.' He drives by the construction site of what will be Allegiant Stadium every day.
But he has caught himself crying this week as he prepares for the final game at the Coliseum " he was planning to fly back Saturday " and wondering what his friends will do when the nearest football will be in Santa Clara, home of the 49ers.
'It will never be duplicated, but we just have to go with what it is,' he said. 'We wouldn't be doing justice to our members and our family if we just closed up shop just because the team relocated.'

Texto completo: Ryan Tannehill, acquired by the Tennessee Titans from the Miami Dolphins for draft picks last spring, initially was looked at as an insurance policy for starting quarterback Marcus Mariota, a former first-round pick with injury concerns.
'He understands that he's coming in as a backup quarterback,' Titans General Manager Jon Robinson said of Tannehill in May.
Instead, Tennessee got a fringe MVP candidate who has put the Titans in the thick of the playoff race.
The 8-5 Titans can't clinch a playoff spot this weekend, but they are tied with Houston atop the AFC South and favored over the Texans on Sunday at home. A win would improve Tennessee's postseason chances from 57 to 77 percent, according to the New York Times playoff calculator. If the Titans win Sunday and again when they face the Texans in the regular season finale, Tennessee would lock up the division title and host a wild-card game. Even if they don't win in the division, they are in the hunt for a wild-card spot, tied with the Pittsburgh Steelers for the final berth, although Pittsburgh owns the tiebreaker.
It's a far cry from the situation Tennessee faced when Tannehill took over the starting job in Week 7. The Titans were 2-4, two games back of the Texans and coming off back-to-back losses in which they scored a total of seven points.
'A change at quarterback could be on the horizon, but the problems reach beyond that position,' ESPN.com wrote at the time.
With Tannehill starting, the Titans have gone 6-1, averaging 31.4 points, with the 31-year-old quarterback showing why he was a first-round pick out of Texas A-M in 2012. Tannehill was even named the AFC offensive player of the week after the Titans' 42-21 win over the Oakland Raiders last weekend, his first such honor since 2015. He completed 21 of 27 passes for 391 yards in that contest, throwing three touchdowns and an interception.
According to NFL.com analyst Gil Brandt, he's the only quarterback in NFL history other than Seattle's Russell Wilson to have a stretch of four games with at least two passing touchdowns and a quarterback rating of 125 or higher.
Tannehill has resisted calls to take stock of his stellar play, saying 'I've seen how this thing goes. The waves and the ins and outs of the season, so if you start taking a step back at this point, then you're doing a disservice to your teammates and to yourself.'
Still, it's hard not to gawk at his numbers. Tannehill leads the NFL in yards per attempt (9.8) and passer rating (118.5). He ranks in the top five in completion rate (73.4 percent), touchdown rate (8.9 percent) and first-down rate (44.3 percent). He has been the seventh-best passer of 2019, according to the game charters at Pro Football Focus " and that includes all quarterbacks' performances from the beginning of the season.
Looking at production only since Week 7, when Tannehill made his first start, he has been the league's fourth-best passer, behind only Baltimore's Lamar Jackson, the MVP front-runner; Wilson, another popular MVP candidate; and New Orleans's Drew Brees.
'He's been money at crunchtime,' Oakland Coach Jon Gruden said ahead of the Week 14 matchup. 'You saw the Chiefs game. He's played very, very good football when all the chips are on the table. That's No. 1. And he's showcasing his dual threat ability. He can throw it, he can run it, and they run a lot of creative plays with him because of his athleticism.'
The biggest improvement the Titans have seen after switching from Mariota to Tannehill is in accuracy. Tannehill leads the league in completion percentage above expectation, meaning he is outperforming expectations when considering three factors: how much separation the intended receiver had from the nearest defender, where the receiver is on the field and the separation the passer had from the nearest pass rusher at the time of throw.
That's no small feat considering Tannehill is not afraid to take chances down the field: He is averaging better than nine air yards per attempt, the fifth-highest mark among passers this season.
In addition, 20 percent of Tannehill's passes have been thrown into tight coverage, according to the NFL's Next Gen stats. Only three quarterbacks with at least 200 passing attempts " Matthew Stafford, Daniel Jones and Ryan Fitzpatrick " have thrown more often into tight windows this season, and they're a combined 8-19-1 as starters.
Mariota, by comparison, completed fewer passes than you would have expected this season (59 percent, compared with 62 percent expected) while averaging just seven air yards per attempt in 2019.
A higher completion rate naturally leads to a more efficient offense. From Weeks 1 to 6, with Mariota as the starter, the Titans scored 1.3 points per drive (30th) and converted 53 percent of their red-zone opportunities (tied for 18th). During Weeks 7 to 14, with Tannehill under center, that has improved to 2.5 points per drive (fifth) and 86-percent in the red zone (first).
There has been a noticeable boost for running back Derrick Henry, too. He produced four rushing touchdowns over 113 carries during the first six weeks of the season while averaging 3.7 yards per carry. Since Week 7, Henry has nine touchdowns on 137 carries while averaging better than six yards per rush. He shares the league lead with 13 rushing touchdowns, taking advantage of defenses as they scramble to stop the Titans' newly potent passing attack.
'We just have to keep it rolling. The offense is firing on all cylinders right now,' Tennessee's offensive tackle Jack Conklin said. 'That's the goal for us every week: Come in and wear down a team.'

Join HK kids in protesting Chinese tyranny

Texto completo: As the largest protests in weeks rocked Hong Kong last Sunday, with hundreds of thousands filling downtown streets, I was struck by the simple statement from Alice Wong, 24, a biology researcher, a protester among the many in the city’s Victoria Park: “We don’t want to become like China.”
That’s it. Well, she also told a New York Times reporter the obvious intertwined truth in what the mostly young constant demonstrators are after: “We want Hong Kong to continue being Hong Kong.”
That is, she wants her city-state, the former British colony, to continue being culturally Chinese in the broader sense of the diaspora, in the way that Singapore is Chinese — but not; that vast parts of Kuala Lumpur are Chinese — but not; that, well, Arcadia is Chinese — but not.
A heritage, common tongues, an entrepreneurial bent — but without the snooping authoritarian leadership with which the Communist Party has merely replaced the ancient Chinese landlord class in a political system that is anything but communal.
If the plutocrats in Beijing were smart about it, were able to let go of their manic goal of roping all the billions of Chinese peoples in the world into one system, they would realize letting Hong Kong be Hong Kong — letting Taiwan be Taiwan, for that matter — would be by far the best thing for the Mainland as well. That way they don’t have to move toward systems like those in HK and Taipei and Singapore that are mildly democratic, with a few more civil liberties. They can let the broader Chinese nation let off a little steam of freedom without becoming more open themselves.
Instead, the People’s Republic has to control all things in the territories of its growing empire, even if that means putting a million Uighur Muslims in concentration camps.
I wish I could say that it was remotely possible to foresee a successful end game in the Hong Kong kids’ mass marches. But I can’t. As there’s something in a scorpion’s nature that leads it to sting, there’s something in Beijing’s emperors that won’t broach dissent. Sooner or later they’ll send in the People’s Army to put down the actual people.
But it’s not just Chinese people Beijing wants to control. It’s the rest of us, too.
Pasadena lawyer Rob O’Brien, President Trump’s new national security advisor, came back to town last week to speak at a defense forum.
Outside it, he gave an interview to NPR from which I was very happy to find he’s leading the administration’s anti-China world domination wing by detailing the dangers of other nations allowing the Chinese telecommunications company Huawei to build the internet’s new 5G networks:
“So every medical record, every social media post, every email, every financial transaction, and every citizen of the country with cloud computing and artificial intelligence can be sucked up out of Huawei into massive servers in China,” O’Brien told NPR.
Inside the meeting, he kept up the theme, telling defense industry and military officials: “This isn’t a theoretical threat.”
It’s not. And, as if in some over-the-top parody of international bad guys, China’s leaders are coming after your kids, too. TikTok, that latest fad you don’t understand, is the most-downloaded app this year, featuring 15-second videos mostly shared by young people. Here’s how Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Missouri, puts it: “A company compromised by the Chinese Communist Party knows where your children are, knows what they look like, what their voices sound like, what they’re watching and what they share with each other.” If that sounds like a real-life “The Man in the High Castle” world, then I suggest we join the HK kids, and protest.

Allen: Philly Urban League diversity award to Comcast 'despicable'

Texto completo: The Urban League of Philadelphia, which is in its own words "committed to advancing the social and economic achievement of African Americans and other underserved residents of Philadelphia," has selected a peculiar member of the city's business community as the recipient of its 2019 Corporate Diversity and Inclusion Award.
On Friday morning, at the civil rights organization's 17th annual Whitney M. Young Community Empowerment Luncheon at the Loews Hotel on Market Street, the organization will present the award to Comcast/NBC Universal.
Yes, that Comcast. No. 32 on the Fortune 500 list. The second-largest media company in the world, headquartered right here in Philadelphia.
And yes, it is the same Comcast that African-American media mogul Byron Allen is suing for $20 billion. Both sides are currently awaiting a ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court, and if the court sides with Comcast, it could roll back the Civil Rights Acts of 1866. Specifically at issue is Section 1981, which ensured that newly freed slaves would be guaranteed the same opportunity to contract as whites, one of the statue's most crucial provisions, is under direct attack.
Allen alleges that Comcast discriminated against him in its refusal to carry cable channels owned by his company, Entertainment Studios Networks - a claim Comcast denies. A victory for Comcast could make it harder for victims of discrimination to prove so, by forcing them to prove that racial discrimination was the only factor in any disputed contracting decision.
Why then, with so much hanging in the balance for Black people, would the Urban League of Philadelphia honor with a diversity and inclusion award a company that appears to prefer taking a wrecking ball to diversity and inclusion?
Could it be that Comcast Senior Executive Vice President David L. Cohen is a member of the Board of Trustees of the National Urban League? Could it be that the National Urban League, as reported by The New York Times and Center for Public Integrity Investigation, received an $835,000 donation from Comcast for expressing support in 2014 of a proposed merger between Comcast and Time Warner?
The National Urban League and the Urban League of Philadelphia responded with a joint statement:
"Neither the Urban League or the National Urban League has taken a position on the merits of Byron Allen's lawsuit against Comcast. National Urban League, in partnership with the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, filed a friend of the court brief urging the Supreme Court to affirm the lower court's ruling that intentional race discrimination claims under Section 1981 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 are viable if the plaintiff is able to show that race played a role in the challenged discriminatory decision."
But isn't the Urban League of Philadelphia taking a side when it gives Comcast an award?
Allen seemed to think so, and said as much in a phone call earlier this week.
"With Comcast challenging the Civil Rights Act of 1866, section 1981, in the U.S. Supreme Court, which will hurt over 100 million minorities in America, the Urban League of Philadelphia should be ashamed of themselves for honoring Comcast in any way. As far as I'm concerned, this is a despicable act."
Allen's case has the support of the Los Angeles Urban League. That group's president and CEO, Michael A. Lawson, wrote a scathing letter to Comcast Chairman and CEO Brian Roberts and Cohen in September, threatening a boycott over its battle the media mogul.
He accused Comcast of refusing to negotiate in good faith with Allen. He wrote that Comcast's "only pathway to success is to eviscerate a 153-year-old civil rights statute, set back civil rights for millions of Americans, and embolden the racist elements throughout our country, which grow stronger on a daily basis."
One wonders how it's possible for divisions within the same national civil rights organization - representing two of its larger, more progressive cities - can have such distinctly divergent opinions of Comcast? How is it that one is honoring that organization as a champion of diversity while the other is accusing it of using the Supreme Court as a cudgel to eviscerate civil rights gains dating back to Reconstruction?
Are you confused yet? Is the Urban League of Philadelphia tone deaf in 2019?
Urban League of Philadelphia President and CEO Andrea Custis said that Comcast has a strong record of supporting diversity and inclusion, and has received a number of awards for it. She pointed to a Comcast/NBCUniversal report that said in 2018, Comcast's overall workforce was 44% people of color, 54% of new hires were women and people of color, 21% of vice presidents were people of color, and 26% of director-level employees were people of color.
The Urban League of Philadelphia's theme for this year's luncheon is "Getting to Equal: United Not Divided," a national unifying movement to promote equity and inclusion, and raise awareness about the challenges urban communities face in Philadelphia and across the country.
That sounds great. However, it could mean nothing if Comcast wins the case and the 400-year-old hurdles toward equality that have been deliberately placed in the paths of African Americans are raised. That's something I would have thought the Urban League of Philadelphia would never fail to consider.

Ecuatoriano salvó una vida aún herido de muerte en masacre terrorista de Nueva Jersey

Texto completo: Douglas Miguel Rodríguez, trabajador inmigrante de Guayaquil (Ecuador) que murió en la masacre del martes en un supermercado judío en Jersey City, ha sido proclamado un “héroe” porque aún herido ayudó a una persona a escapar por la puerta trasera del establecimiento.
La Fiscalía de Nueva Jersey confirmó ayer que el tiroteo que culminó con la muerte de seis personas -4 víctimas y 2 novios pistoleros fanáticos religiosos- se investiga como “potencial acto de terrorismo doméstico”, alimentado por el antisemitismo y el odio a los agentes del orden.
Anoche se realizó una vigilia emocional en Jersey City. Parientes, amigos y completos extraños se unieron en memoria de las cuatro vidas inocentes que se perdieron en un instante, reseñó CBS2.
El rabino David Niederman dijo que Rodríguez murió como un héroe. “Después de recibir un disparo, abrió la puerta trasera para que rescataran a un cliente”, dijo a la prensa. “Desafortunadamente, murió al pisar esa puerta”.
Su esposa contuvo las lágrimas mientras agradecía al mercado que empleaba a su esposo por aceptarlo. “La comunidad judía aprendió a amar a mi esposo y estuvo allí para él y lo recibió”, dijo.
Otro doliente dijo que Rodríguez era como un hermano para él. “Lo amamos, lo extrañamos, pero sabemos que estará bien porque creía en Jesús”, dijo.
Su servicio conmemorativo se llevará a cabo de 5 a 9 p.m. mañana sábado en el Michigan Memorial en Paterson, Nueva Jersey.
Una página ha sido creada en GoFundMe en su memoria. Al momento se han donado allí más de $70 mil dólares para su esposa e hija. El Consulado de Ecuador también las está apoyando.
Rodríguez murió trabajando en “Jersey City Kosher Supermarket”, el único negocio kosher en la zona, informó The Fayetteville Observer.
También murieron la dueña del local, Leah Minda Ferencz (33), y su primo Moshe Hirsch Deutsh (24), miembros de la comunidad judía ortodoxa; el detective Joseph Seals (40), considerado un héroe local; y los atacantes, el hombre David Anderson (47) y la mujer Francine Graham (50), que se cree están vinculados al grupo religioso “Israelitas Negros” (Black Hebrew Israelites), según The New York Times.

Should cursive handwriting be taught in public schools?

Texto completo: Love letters and missives home from the war front wouldn't be as touching if they were printed instead of written in cursive. Our Declaration of Independence and Constitution wouldn't seem as distinguished, either.
A lot of "boomers" have great penmanship. My mother's writing is exquisite. Mine? Sloppy at best.
I never mastered the craft. When my signature is required, I print the capital letters at the beginning of my name, then transition to cursive.
My teenage sons don't write in cursive even when they sign thank you notes, birthday cards and the like. They print. They sign their names only when it's required.
Which raises the questions: Should schools be teaching students to write in cursive? Would that time be better spent on more practical areas such as technology?
The question is in the news as New Jersey lawmakers consider whether to require elementary schools to teach students to read and write it by the end of third grade. Similar legislation has been quietly pending in Pennsylvania for almost a year.
I believe basic lessons should be taught. But the instruction doesn't need to be extensive. That would be a waste of time and resources.
We don't have to write or even print much anymore. Most kids communicate through text messages and chat apps. My generation uses email, too. We don't get that many checks to endorse because of direct-deposited paychecks and electronic payments platforms such as PayPal and Venmo.
Schools should teach students to sign their names. Then move on.
Some people believe cursive handwriting should be taught because it's a tradition. They argue that students should be able to read historical documents such as the Constitution.
That's nostalgia talking. Don't let it outweigh practicality. The text of the Constitution is readily available online in typewritten letters.
Cursive writing instruction was dropped from national Common Core standards in 2010, leaving it up to states to decide whether to teach it.
There's no statewide requirement in Pennsylvania. The decision is left to each school district, according to Nicole Reigelman, communications director for the state Department of Education.
My colleague, Morning Call senior reporter Daniel Patrick Sheehan, surveyed Lehigh Valley districts when he wrote about the issue a few years ago. Parkland, East Penn and the Catholic Diocese of Allentown schools were among those who taught it.
The Allentown School District doesn't include it among its formal curriculum, "but there is exposure to the cursive alphabet and informal instruction that occurs due to student and teacher interest," spokeswoman Melissa Reese told me Tuesday.
While New Jersey has been getting national attention for legislation pending there, a similar effort in Pennsylvania hasn't attracted much attention.
State Rep. Angel Cruz, D-Philadelphia, wants to require handwriting instruction in kindergarten through fifth grade. The goal would be to ensure students can legibly print by third grade and write in cursive by the end of fifth grade.
Thirteen other representatives have signed on as co-sponsors, including Rep. Bob Freeman, D-Northampton.
Cruz said in a legislative memo that research has shown that handwriting improves hand-eye coordination; boosts comprehension and information retention rates; and expands neural development. The sponsor of the legislation in New Jersey, Democratic Assemblywoman Angela McKnight, has made similar arguments.
"We are doing our children a disservice by not teaching them a vital skill they will need for the rest of their lives," she said in a news release.
The New York Times reported in April that about two dozen states have formalized requirements to teach it since it was dropped from Common Core standards.
This spring, Ohio students were required to learn cursive by fifth grade. Illinois requires at least one class to be taught.
One class probably isn't going to do it. But a few should.
Signatures don't have to be Colonial-era quality. They don't even have to be legible. They just have to be consistent, so a bank or other authority can recognize when someone is trying to forge your name and commit fraud.
I read varying legal reviews debating whether a printed name will suffice for a signature.
Sports fans pay hundreds of dollars for autographs from athletes that are nothing more than a few scribbled letters. That shows how little the quality matters.
Cursive letters are nice. I still get them occasionally from readers. I think it's cool that people take the time to do that. But the reality is that younger generations won't.
We need to recognize that and use our education time and dollars wisely.

Texto completo: She successfully challenged a professional reprimand and in the process helped redefine free speech rights for lawyers and advocacy groups.
Edna Smith Primus had graduated from the University of South Carolina School of Law -- the first black woman to do so, in 1972 -- when barely one year later she was assigned a case that could have jeopardized her career.
She had been working at the time for the South Carolina Council on Human Rights as a volunteer lawyer when it dispatched her to Aiken, S.C., where an obstetrician had refused to deliver babies to women on welfare with two or more children unless they agreed to be sterilized.
The doctor's refusal came amid a national public outcry over reports in The New York Times and elsewhere in the early 1970s that poor women, most of them black, were being involuntarily sterilized in the South.
Ms. Primus, who died on Nov. 29 at 75, was sent to Aiken to talk to mothers involved in the controversy there, some of whom had consented to sterilization. She told one woman who had undergone the procedure that the American Civil Liberties Union, for which Ms. Primus also volunteered at its South Carolina office, would represent the woman free of charge if she filed a lawsuit against the doctor.
Instead, Ms. Primus became a target of legal action herself.
The doctor not only dissuaded the woman from suing but also complained to the state bar association that Ms. Primus had violated professional ethics by directly soliciting potential clients for personal financial gain, although she was not being compensated for her work. She was cited by both the bar association and the South Carolina Supreme Court for what amounted to ambulance-chasing -- soliciting law clients for private gain.
The A.C.L.U., in turn, challenged those public reprimands, taking Ms. Primus's case, under her name, all the way to the United States Supreme Court. It won. In a decision handed down in 1978, the court overturned the legal foundation for the reprimand, affirming the First Amendment right of advocacy groups to advance their political agendas through litigation.
The sterilization dispute erupted in the early 1970s after a 20-year-old white woman on welfare publicly complained that Dr. Clovis H. Pierce had refused to deliver her fifth child unless she agreed either to have her fallopian tubes cut and tied or to pay a $ 100 down payment on his $ 250 fee.
Dr. Pierce -- the only obstetrician in Aiken County who would accept patients on welfare -- made sterilization a condition of her continuing to receive welfare benefits through Medicaid. The woman had started receiving public assistance after her husband was sentenced to prison for grand larceny.
Ms. Primus's soliciting the woman was brought to the attention of the state Supreme Court's Board of Grievances and Discipline (now the Office of Disciplinary Counsel), which accused her of violating an ethics provision intended to protect unsophisticated plaintiffs from high-pressure sales pitches by lawyers who would benefit if their clients eventually sued and won money damages.
The board's censure was upgraded to a public reprimand by the state Supreme Court. It rejected Ms. Primus's argument that her motivation for soliciting a lawsuit -- to advance a civil liberties political agenda -- was protected by the First Amendment guarantee of free speech and free association.
But the United States Supreme Court disagreed with that lower court decision. It ruled, 7 to 1, that the civil liberties union was a "bona fide, nonprofit organization that pursues litigation as a vehicle for effective political expression and association, as well as a means of communicating useful information to the public."
The ruling, written by Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr., concluded that efforts to reach out to the potential client "were undertaken to express personal political beliefs and to advance the civil liberties objectives of the A.C.L.U. rather than to derive financial gain."
The case has since been taught in law school professional responsibility courses, said Robert Wilcox, the dean of the University of South Carolina School of Law in Columbia. Speaking of Ms. Primus, he said in an email:
"I think her legacy was her steady commitment to helping people who had no other voice to advocate for them. As a very young lawyer, she had made clear that she had the courage to fight for clients and for change, even when it might come at a cost to her career."
Edna Smith was born on June 27, 1944, in Yemassee, S.C., a tiny town in the state's Lowcountry, the daughter of sharecroppers. She earned a bachelor's degree from the University of South Carolina in 1966 before enrolling in its law school.
She retired in 2006 from Palmetto Legal Services in Columbia, S.C., where she had been managing attorney.
Her marriage to Marcellous Alphonzo Primus ended in divorce.
Ms. Primus died at her home in Columbia, her daughter, LaCelle Primus, said. In addition to her, she is survived by three grandchildren. Her niece Tina Herbert is a lawyer, and a grandniece is graduating from the University of South Carolina School of Law on Dec. 14.
Ms. Primus once recalled that as a young, newly minted lawyer she had not been prepared to be thrust into a public controversy.
"We were scarce then, black women lawyers," Ms. Primus told the Columbia newspaper The State in 1989. "A public reprimand splashed all over the papers, that was totally demoralizing."
But she expressed no regrets about getting involved on behalf of women who were being involuntarily sterilized. "I really felt they were being victimized," she told the newspaper. "I thought it was important for people with little resources to be informed of their rights."
Marietta Williams, the woman whom Ms. Primus approached as a potential client, was informed of her right to sue only after the sterilization. Dr. Pierce had persuaded her to sign a release freeing him of liability.
"I wouldn't marry again," Ms. Williams told The Times in 1973. "Who would want me, knowing I cannot have any children?"
The Times reported that 18 of the 34 Medicaid-funded deliveries in Aiken County Hospital in 1972 included sterilization. Of those, 16 were performed on black women, all by Dr. Pierce, a former Army doctor.
"People with three children -- three already or two with one on the way who are on Medicaid -- are required to voluntarily submit to sterilization," Dr. Pierce told The Aiken Standard in 1973. "In a sense, it isn't really voluntary, because no other obstetrician will see a Medicaid patient."
He added: "I feel that if I'm paying for them as a taxpayer, I want to put an end to their reproduction. If I control my own family size so that I can provide for them, then I don't want to have to pay for others."
Dr. Pierce was charged with malpractice but acquitted. He was later sued in federal court by two women, one who had undergone sterilization at his insistence; the other said he had prematurely discharged her from a hospital, a day after she gave birth to her third child, because she had refused to undergo a tubal ligation, or sterilization. A jury awarded the first woman $ 5 in damages, finding that Dr. Pierce had violated her rights, but it awarded nothing to the second. The verdict against Dr. Pierce was later reversed by a federal appeals court.
Information about Dr. Pierce's practice remains on health care websites in South Carolina, but calls to his listed office phone numbers went unanswered.

Re "It's Not Over for Me Yet" (Sunday Review, Dec. 8):
I applaud the bravery of former Representative Katie Hill for describing in vivid detail her darkest moments, including that of trying to commit suicide. Her story shows that it doesn't matter who you are and what your profession is: Anyone can have challenges.
I hope that by sharing her story, she demonstrates that there is no stigma in it, or for reaching out to help. If that can be her legacy from her time in Congress, it will be a very rich one indeed.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department has released several internal legal opinions that could help bolster President Trump's claim of executive privilege in barring Congress from interviewing witnesses and collecting documents from the executive branch.
The legal opinions were written during previous Democratic and Republican administrations by the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, which provides legal opinions for the executive branch. Some of them had not been made public until they were posted to the department's website on Thursday.
CNN first reported the publication of the opinions.
The department cited the opinions in a recent case before Federal District Court involving the former White House counsel Donald F. McGahn II, whom the administration had said was "absolutely immune" from complying with a congressional subpoena issued in the House impeachment investigation.
Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia ruled last month that Mr. McGahn must testify before House investigators about whether Mr. Trump tried to obstruct the Russia inquiry. Judge Jackson said in her 120-page decision that the administration's arguments to the contrary were "fiction."
The Justice Department appealed the ruling.
In its defense of Mr. McGahn, the department cited Office of Legal Counsel opinions written during the Reagan, Bush, Clinton and Obama administrations that say that presidents can exert privilege to keep executive branch communications private.
The Office of Legal Counsel, which is overseen by Steven A. Engel, made the opinions public after the House requested them as part of its lawsuit against Mr. McGahn, according to a Justice Department official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to openly discuss that decision-making process.
Among the opinions cited in the McGahn case was one titled, "History of Refusals by Executive Branch Officials to Provide Information Demanded by Congress," written by Theodore B. Olson, who ran the Office of Legal Counsel during the Reagan administration and is now a partner at Gibson Dunn.

"The memorandum seeks to show that presidentially mandated refusals to disclose information to Congress -- though infrequent -- are by no means unprecedented acts of this or any other administration," he wrote.
The memo listed examples of presidents refusing congressional requests for information or other forms of cooperation dating to the 1700s, and having those claims upheld. More recently, Mr. Olson noted that President John F. Kennedy directed the defense secretary and all personnel under him to not give the Senate any testimony or documents that would reveal the names of aides who had made or recommended changes in specific speeches.

Texto completo: It is really not a good sign to be starting a piece of writing on the question of “what is a Jew?” Generally, it is best when there’s less dwelling on this question, not more. And yet, that’s where we are, because there’s apparently a great deal of confusion on the basics of the subject, and the confusion seems to issue from ambiguity about words, especially the words nation, people, and country.
Here’s how we got here: People started saying preposterous things almost immediately after the New York Times reported that President Trump was about to issue an executive order bringing the Title VI of the Civil Rights Act protections “on the ground of race, color, or national origin” to Jews by way of classifying Jews as a nationality.
Bianna Golodryga, the “senior global affairs analyst” at CNN, managed to fire off the following on Twitter before making her way out of the country: “The defining label [of Jews as a nationality] is very… Soviet.” Social justice and science writer Erin Biba, reflecting on the same policy change, said the order is "a good way to start deporting Jews” from America. She recalled that “Hitler kicked off the Holocaust with the Nuremberg Laws that, among other things, declared German Jews weren’t of German nationality.” The other things here are actually sort of important, but anyway, Trump’s executive order is emphatically not declaring that Jews are not of "American nationality.” In this sense of nationality, there is no such thing.
I am not religious, I do not have so much as an Israeli stamp in my passport, and I am Jewish. This is not any kind of contradiction, because the noun “nation” we’re talking about here means people, not political or geographic entity. Jewish also happens to be a word for a religion, but lots of words have more than one meaning. If “Irism” were a religion, I would not be a member of the “Irish” religion, but I would still be part Irish, the ethnicity.
Our colloquial vocabulary surrounding all of this is further complicated by the fact that the now-50 semi-self-governing provinces of the United States of America are called “states.” Calling them that was a sop to people attached to a bunch of ideas about Delawarean and Virginian sovereignty and independence from the federal government that were a great deal more salient in the Revolutionary period than in our own.
When Romantic-era nationalism came about, it got termed that because it was the idea that a people should determine its own government and life, and “nation” is a word for people. All kinds of nations decided that they didn’t like being a population within countries that were large, multinational empires and that they wanted to separate off and form their own nation-states — countries populated largely by one people. We use “nation” sloppily to mean “sovereign country” or “state” now because following the rise of nationalism, the nation-state became the sort of default idea of a country in our heads. Why is the term “nation-state” not redundant? Because a state is a politically sovereign area, and a nation is a group of human beings with some shared, binding history, culture, language ... whatever, so long as they understand themselves to be a people and/or are understood by others to comprise one.
Poles are a nation, and they wouldn’t stop being one if Poland stopped being an existing sovereign country (this thesis has been rather repeatedly and dramatically stress-tested). Greeks are a nation, Greece is a country. Armenians, like Jews, were in the 19th and early 20th centuries not a majority in any area, so the ethnic violence surrounding nationalism didn’t turn out very well for them during the period of the breakdown of the great empires. The Armenian people were nearly destroyed in a genocide during a world war and only after that was given the area that is now the sovereign country of Armenia with its capital in Yerevan. The idea was that having a nation-state is a matter of survival for a people.
In this sense, neither Jewry nor Israel is unique or special at all, except in being late to a party that most other nations occupying the former great Imperial Zone of Europe threw in the previous century. Only in 1948, after the same sort of thing happened to Jews that happened to Armenians, did they succeed in the nationalist project to get a state, Israel, for the previously existing people, Jews. That’s why the obsession with Israel and Palestine seems like a matter of Jew-hatred to people who understand this history and these words: It’s one piece of a historical process involving dozens of basically identical situations, and the Jewish one is what gets all the condemnatory United Nations resolutions and ranting by Noam Chomsky.
So, Trump’s executive order on Jews as a nation only affirms the idea of Jewish peoplehood that is, first, totally coherent within the ordinary framework of how we understand nations, and second, only doing about Jews what Title VI already does for other demographic categories. Suddenly a lot of people don't like the constitutional implications of applying the Civil Rights Act the day it extends to Jews? Well, that seems odd. Debate the policy all you like, but this is not the Wannsee Conference, and everybody pretending it is has revealed that they do not understand the very elementary issues here and should read more and seethe less.

Texto completo: Some recent news stories verge on the bizarre — for example, the House Democrats’ futile fuss over impeachment and Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s simultaneous acceptance of President Trump’s U.S.-Canada-Mexico trade treaty. But they’re not as bizarre, or possibly as consequential, as unanticipated developments in the Democrats’ presidential nomination contest.
Consider the role of money, which Democrats are always saying plays too big a role in politics. This year, it plainly isn’t. Their two billionaire late entrants, Tom Steyer and Michael Bloomberg, aren’t running away with the contest.
Steyer is at 1.7% in the RealClearPolitics average, and Bloomberg’s 5.5% surely owes as much to his formidable three terms as New York mayor and his groveling apology for his successful stop-and-frisk policy as it does to his $30 million Thanksgiving week ad buy.
Internet technology has made big money less important. Twitter and Facebook are orders of magnitudes cheaper than TV ads, which used to be the only way, post-Iowa/New Hampshire, to reach voters. And the internet has enabled seemingly long-shot candidates like Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Pete Buttigieg to substantially outraise Joe Biden, who relies on traditional Democratic big contributors.
If money doesn’t work the way it once did, neither does ethnic or racial identity. John Kennedy could count on Irish Catholic voters and Barack Obama on blacks; Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton ran well with white Southerners back when they cast a big share of Democratic primary votes.
But this year, half of black Democrats, about one-quarter of primary voters, are supporting Joe Biden, and only handfuls have supported the three black candidates. Kamala Harris ended her candidacy earlier this month. Cory Booker has bemoaned the lack of “diversity” among the candidates qualifying for the December debate (he’s not one of them). Late entrant Deval Patrick has made no perceptible impact beyond canceling one Iowa event after only two people showed up.
Historically, black voters have tended to give near-unanimous support for one candidate. It’s a rational strategy if you identify as a member of a group systematically discriminated against, and black candidates have been among the beneficiaries.
But that impulse may be fading. The first black president has been elected and reelected, one of only four presidents in the last century to clear 50% in two elections. Even as the New York Times’s 1619 Project argues that slavery was just as relevant as ever, many black voters may not feel as beleaguered or oppressed as in the past, particularly as black Americans’ unemployment rates reach record lows and blacks’ incomes rise faster than the average.
Similarly, Julian Castro has not won significant support from Hispanics (a category invented by the Census Bureau in 1970). It’s not clear what a part-time mayor of San Antonio has in common with Puerto Ricans in Florida, Dominicans in New York, or Mexican Americans in California.
The third thing that seems bizarre or at least surprising about the Democratic race is that left-wing policies are proving not nearly so popular as media coverage of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and her Green New Deal would suggest. Elizabeth Warren’s embrace of and then backing away from "Medicare for all" is the prime example, and Tom Steyer’s crusade against climate change is not winning votes from many of the Democrats who tell pollsters it’s on their list of important issues.
In early debates and campaigning, Democratic candidates seemed eager to endorse left-wing policies — a wealth tax, racial reparations, racial quotas and preferences, ninth-month abortions, open borders — unlikely to appeal to majorities of general election voters. Now, they seem more skittish. Policies advanced on the Democratic Twitterverse by clever young staffers but lacking any significant popular yearning turn out to be duds.
This may be due to a disconnect between what animates the Democratic Party and its vision of what it once was. The Democratic Party, always a coalition of out-groups, is united these days by fear and loathing of the cultural style and populist proposals of Trump. But their self-image, rooted in history, is that of the tribune for the economically deprived, and they are drawn to advance redistributionist policies in the hope of regaining the working-class whites who were their largest constituency 50 years ago.
That hope is probably vain, and the result has pitted current Democratic constituencies against each other. Gentry liberals are attracted to Elizabeth Warren (but not her taxes) and Pete Buttigieg; seniors like Joe Biden; low-income Gen Zers and Hispanics (there’s considerable overlap here) dig Bernie Sanders. And undoubtedly, more surprises, maybe bizarre surprises, are to come.

Harvey Weinstein alcanza un acuerdo inicial de $25 millones para indemnizar por agresiones sexuales

Texto completo: NUEVA YORK – Harvey Weinstein llegó a un acuerdo de principio para indemnizar a presuntas víctimas, indicó el miércoles a la AFP el abogado de una de ellas, un arreglo que no concierne las demandas penales contra el exproductor de cine inculpado por agresión sexual.
El acuerdo, revelado inicialmente por el diario The New York Times, prevé el desembolso de $25 millones de dólares a estas víctimas y aún debe ser validado por un juez para tornarse oficial.
El acuerdo de principio fue confirmado a la AFP por el abogado Aaron Filler, que representa a la actriz estadounidense Paz De La Huerta , quien afirma haber sido violada por Harvey Weinstein en 2010.
Un inminente acuerdo con las víctimas estaba sobre el tapete desde mayo, pero varias mujeres dijeron en público que no lo aceptarían.
La indemnización de decenas de presuntas víctimas del magnate de Hollywood se inscribe en un documento que saldaría el conjunto de deudas, contenciosos y obligaciones de The Weinstein Company, la productora creada por Harvey Weinstein y su hermano Bob.
Las aseguradoras del grupo, que ha declarado la quiebra, aceptaron pagar en total $47 millones de dólares a las presuntas víctimas de acoso y agresiones sexuales, y también a los acreedores del grupo, según The New York Times.
El acuerdo pondría fin a las demandas iniciadas por todas las mujeres que acepten sus términos, mientras quienes no acepten conservan el derecho a buscar una indemnización en la justicia.
Según el diario The Wall Street Journal, saldaría también la acción civil que inició el fiscal del estado de Nueva York contra los dirigentes de la Weinstein Company por negligencia.
Harvey Weinstein no tendría que pagar ni un dólar de la suma, ya que el total sería solventado por las compañías de seguros, incluido sus gastos judiciales en el ámbito civil.
Pero el acuerdo no concierne las demandas penales iniciadas por el fiscal de Manhattan, Cyrus Vance, que desembocarán en un juicio cuyo inicio está previsto para el 6 de enero.
En lo penal, Weinstein fue inculpado de cinco cargos por la presunta violación de una mujer en 2013 y la agresión sexual de otra en 2006. Se ha declarado no culpable.
Un total de 87 mujeres acusan al exproductor de cine de agresión o acoso sexual, incluidas varias actrices famosas como Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie y Salma Hayek. Pero ninguna de estas participó en las negociaciones del acuerdo ni ha demandado a Weinstein ante la justicia.

Trump mocks Greta Thunberg, and she jabs back

Texto completo: Two things have long obsessed President Trump: Time's person of the year and the 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg.
This week they collided when Time picked her for its annual cover. It was never in doubt that the president would tweet about it. The only question was when.
Early Thursday, the answer arrived.
“So ridiculous," Trump tweeted. “Greta must work on her anger management problem, then go to a good old fashioned movie with a friend! Chill Greta, Chill!"
Thunberg was quick to respond.
“A teenager working on her anger management problem," read a new version of her Twitter biography. “Currently chilling and watching a good old fashioned movie with a friend."
Trump wasn't the only person to criticize Time's 2019 selection.
“No matter your political leaning, whether you love her or hate her, whether you're for Trump or against him," Speaker Nancy Pelosi “has had a much bigger impact," Jake Sherman, a senior writer at Politico, said on Twitter on Wednesday.
Thunberg was selected over Pelosi, Trump, the Ukraine whistle-blower, and the Hong Kong protesters, who won Time's 2019 person of the year in a reader poll that had more than 27 million votes.
Thunberg said she was “surprised" to learn she had been selected as Time's person of the year, but said the accolade should be shared.
“It should be everyone in the Fridays for Future movement because what we have done, we have done together," she said.
New York Times
Senate recognizes Armenian Genocide
WASHINGTON — The Senate, without fanfare and over longstanding objections from President Trump, unanimously passed a resolution Thursday officially recognizing the Armenian Genocide, joining the House in condemning Turkey's mass slaughter of 1.5 million people early last century.
The move follows a Wednesday vote in the Senate Armed Services Committee to impose sanctions on Turkey over its recent purchase of a Russian missile system and its offensive against the Kurdish minority in Syria.
Turkey's actions have caused great frustration in Congress, putting fresh momentum behind efforts to revive the issue of Armenian Genocide recognition, which languished for decades in Congress as presidents and lawmakers warned that such a vote would disrupt relations with NATO ally Turkey.
The Senate's resolution cannot force the Trump administration's hand, nor does it require the president's signature; it merely expresses "the sense of the Senate" that it is US policy to recognize the Armenian Genocide and commemorate it as such.
Washington Post
Warren's tax estimate misses mark, study says
Senator Elizabeth Warren is overestimating the proceeds of her wealth tax by at least $1 trillion, according to a new study, raising questions about the Democratic presidential candidate's plans to fund her sweeping proposals to reshape the US economy.
Warren's tax would raise $2.3 trillion to $2.7 trillion over a decade, far short of the $3.75 trillion her campaign has said the levy on the accumulated wealth of millionaires and billionaires would raise in that period, according to new estimates from the Penn Wharton Budget Model.
The estimate calls into question the Massachusetts senator's frequent assertion that taxes on the wealthiest Americans would be sufficient to cover her plans for universal child care, college tuition, and erasing student debt, with about $1 trillion allocated toward paying for her $20.5 trillion Medicare for All health care plan.
Economists on the right and left have cautioned that she may be relying on overly generous estimates of her taxes and low-balling how much the new programs could cost.
Warren has dismissed any suggestion that she would need to raise taxes on the middle class to finance her proposals.
The key reason for the difference between Warren's estimate and the one from the Penn Wharton Budget Model is that the authors of the new study have factored in what they believe is a likelihood that more people than Warren expects will avoid the tax, whether legally or illegally, said Kent Smetters, a professor of business economics and public policy at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.

People
A tentative $25 million settlement revealed Wednesday to end nearly every sexual misconduct lawsuit brought against Harvey Weinstein and his former film studio's board was praised by a plaintiff and some lawyers but criticized by others who say those who opt out are punished.
Louisette Geiss, a plaintiff in a Manhattan federal court class-action lawsuit, said the settlement was "our way to hold all women up. We are trying to create a new reality where this type of behavior is not accepted."
In a statement, she said the lawsuit was intended as "a wake-up call for all companies that they will be held accountable if they protect predators in their midst."
"Now that The Weinstein Company is in bankruptcy and Harvey is about to stand to trial, this settlement will ensure that all survivors have the chance for recovery and can move forward without Harvey's damaging lock on their careers," Geiss said.
The New York Times first reported the deal, which was confirmed to the Associated Press by several lawyers for plaintiffs.
Attorney Thomas Giuffra said the agreement was the same deal announced several months ago but with more punitive provisions aimed at forcing holdouts to accept it.
Reynolds says he related to Peloton actress' plight
Ryan Reynolds says he relates to the social media criticism heaped on the Peloton ad actress. In fact, that feeling led him to hire her for a commercial promoting his gin company.
Reynolds spoke Tuesday about the uproar while promoting his new action flick, the Michael Bay-directed "6 Underground."
In the Peloton commercial, Monica Ruiz portrays a wife who receives an exercise bike as a Christmas present and chronicles her yearlong journey to get in shape. The commercial ends with the wife thanking her husband for the gift. After the spot aired, the character was mocked for several reasons: Some noted she was already thin, others mocked her for having a "nervous" expression, and others were angry her husband gave her an exercise gift, as if she needed to lose weight.
Reynolds thought the viral negativity was unfair, and said it's "a situation that I've been in many times before" as an actor.
"You put it out there, and it doesn't quite work, and you feel a little alienated and stuff. So, I had tremendous empathy for her in that moment," Reynolds said at the premiere of his movie.
"Doing the Aviation Gin ad sort of gave her some authorship over some of this conversation, which I loved," he said. "And she's, she's the best. She's really funny, really smart."

Texto completo: NEW YORK >> Harvey Weinstein and his former film studio's board have reached a tentative $25 million settlement that would end nearly every sexual misconduct lawsuit brought against him and his company, The New York Times reported Wednesday.
The Times cited a half-dozen lawyers in its report, some of whom spoke about the proposed terms on the condition of anonymity.
More than 30 actresses and former Weinstein employees, who have sued the movie mogul for accusations ranging from sexual misconduct to rape, have agreed to the deal, according to the lawyers.
Weinstein would avoid paying any of his own money and he would not be required to admit any wrongdoing as part of the deal. Insurance companies representing the Weinstein Company would cover the settlement's cost, the Times reported.
Representatives for Weinstein declined to comment to the Times.
The proposed settlement has gotten preliminary approval from the major parties involved. It would require court approval and a final signoff before moving forward.
The settlement's terms remain uncertain. Eighteen of the alleged victims would split $6.2 million, with no individual receiving more than $500,000. A separate $18.5 million would go toward those involved in a class-action case, the New York attorney general's suit and any future claimants, the Times reported.
Actress Katherine Kendall, 50, said she agreed to the terms of the settlement because she didn't want to stop other plaintiffs from receiving recompense.
"I don't love it, but I don't know how to go after him," she told the Times. "I don't know what I can really do."
Weinstein is scheduled to be tried on rape and sexual assault charges on Jan. 6. His bail was increased from $1 million to $5 million on Wednesday for allegedly mishandling his electronic ankle monitor.
He has pleaded not guilty to charges that he raped a woman in a Manhattan hotel room in 2013 and performed a forcible sex act on a different woman in 2006.

Texto completo: Orthodox Jews are horrified and fearful in the wake of Tuesday's attack on a Jersey City kosher store.
The fierce gunbattle through the city streets left six people dead, including a police detective, the store's co-owner and the two suspects.
In response, state and local leaders said they will increase police patrols in vulnerable areas, as fears of copycat attacks rise.
Jewish leaders and others have warned that months of physical and verbal assaults on Hasidic and other ultra-Orthodox Jews in the New York-New Jersey region could lead to killings.
"The latest reports that a suspect involved in the Jersey City attack had published anti-Semitic posts online and that investigators believe the attack was motivated by these sentiments are frightening," said Allen Fagin, the executive vice president of the Orthodox Union.
"Anti-Semitism has always been a torment that Jews have been forced to reckon with for centuries," he continued. "However, its resurgence both in the United States and abroad is alarming for a new reason: the degree to which the mainstream of civil society has seemingly tolerated, without loud and sustained outcry, the most blatant acts of intolerance."
Jersey City has seen a migration from Brooklyn of Chabad Lubavitch Jews and Satmar Hasidim. The families moved into what's viewed as a predominantly non-white neighborhood, establishing businesses, schools and synagogues.
Rivkie Feiner, a lifelong Monsey resident, said the expanding Jersey City Orthodox community was well-known.
"I've heard about them," she said. "That it is a really lovely community."
Authorities continue to probe Tuesday's killing spree that saw hundreds of shots fired along the streets. Police have said that after killing 15-year-veteran Jersey City police officer Joe Seals at a local cemetery, two shooters attacked a kosher market, located near a synagogue with a private school. The New York Times has reported that one of the two suspects was tied to the extremist Black Hebrew Israelites group and had published anti-Semitic and anti-police writings.
Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop said the gunmen targeted the Jewish community.
Feiner called on Rockland government and law enforcement officials to ramp up security in Jewish spaces.
"Even though we are in a state over, we are horrified and frightened," she said. "I call on them to do whatever they can to make use feel safe because right now we don't feel that."
Gov. Andrew Cuomo has called on state police to increase patrols at synagogues and Jewish establishments.
Rockland Sheriff Louis Falco said communities will see increased police presence as he is working with Ramapo, Spring Valley, and Clarkstown police departments. Rockland features a large Jewish population, including Orthodox and Hasidic communities in Ramapo and Spring Valley, as well as more cultural institutions like the JCC and Jewish Federation.
Across the border and north of Jersey City, Bergen County Sheriff Anthony Cureton said he is ordering increased patrol at synagogues and surrounding population centers.
While there is no specific or credible threat at this time, the office is operating on heightened alert and is working cooperatively with local law enforcement to ensure the safety of Bergen County residents. The Sheriff's Office reminds residents to report any and all suspicious activity to law enforcement.
Copycat fears mount Falco said he's concerned about copycat attacks and he's been in contract with law enforcement in New York City and New Jersey.
"We're monitoring everything closely," he said. "I've been getting intel briefings. We do have some concerns and we will be putting out extra patrols along with the Ramapo, Spring Valley and Clarkstown police for the foreseeable future."
Rockland has been a hotbed of strong rhetoric against Hasidic Jews and Ramapo politics, including exchanges of videos citing anti-Semitism and claims the communities are looking to take control of the county, violating zoning and ripping off social services and other government programs.
Bassie Friedman said her family's synagogue, Cheder Chabad of Monsey, had previously stepped up security, as had her daughter's school. She said she talks to her children about safety, "but not excessively. We talk more about, what are we going to do positive, how are we going to make someone smile."
The fears that this was yet another anti-Semitic attack shook Friedman, but the Pomona resident said that education and interaction are key.
"You light a candle it illuminates the entire room," she said. "We'll always have people who hate. For the rest of us who don't want to live in a world like that, just bring more light. I don't think you can ever go wrong focusing on the positive."
Rabbi Shmuel Gancz of the Chabad Jewish Center of Suffern said he knows the rabbi, Moshe Schapiro, who is the Chabad leader in Jersey City and Hoboken. Chabad practices outreach with others in the Jewish and non-Jewish communities. Gancz said his biggest fear is that such violence could happen in Rockland, where the Jewish community is much stronger and influential than in Jersey City.
He said the gentrification of Jersey City, started decades ago, has continued with the influx of Orthodox Jews. He said he sees and hears the argument that there's a loss of housing and rents have increased, angering people.
"Seems, if you are not happy with your neighbor and can't fight in town hall, you fight with a gun," Gancz said.
Gancz said self-interest by all sides is a problem, it's about voting blocs, taxes, housing or business. But he said the answer is for all community members to work together.
"All people have selfish lifestyles, he said. "The over-arching idea as human beings is we need to find ways to unify and connect with our neighbors. We are all sharing the same universe and have to respect each other."
Ramapo Supervisor Michael Specht said the attacks and killings highlight "the tremendous sacrifice and commitment our men and women in the law enforcement community make every single day and we stand in solidarity with the department and their families."
He said Ramapo police will increase patrols.

Texto completo: PARIS - France's prime minister said Wednesday that the full retirement age will be increased for the country's youngest, but offered concessions in an ill-fated effort to calm a nationwide protest against pension reforms that critics say will erode the nation's way of life.
The government says it wants to make the pensions system sustainable and simpler but is facing public pressure, including a week of the most debilitating transport strikes in decades.
Major unions were quick to reject the proposals and vowed to strike on.
The day after more than 300,000 people protested across France, metro lines in Paris but two were closed and many train routes remained canceled as unions dig in their heels against President Emmanuel Macron, whom they accuse of shaping policies in favor of the rich.
Prime Minister Edouard Philippe detailed the pension changes in a speech Wednesday, saying bluntly that the French "will need to work longer."
People born after 1974 will have to work until age 64 to get a full pension, instead of 62 previously. Those born before that date will not be affected, he said.
The new scheme is aimed at replacing a complicated pension system that included dozens of special privileges for some sectors, like public transport, with one set of rules.
Philippe said the changes ensure the pension system is "fair and sustainable" for a growing population with a record number of people over 90.
For people entering the workforce, the reforms will only start to apply in 2022, which happens to be the last year of Macron's term.
Nobel laureate Suu Kyi defends Myanmar army in UN court
THE HAGUE, Netherlands - Nobel Peace Prize winner and former political prisoner Aung San Suu Kyi denied Wednesday that Myanmar's armed forces committed genocide, telling the United Nation's top court that the mass exodus of Rohingya people from the country she leads was the unfortunate result of a battle with insurgents.
The image of the former pro-democracy icon appearing before the International Court of Justice to defend the army that kept her under house arrest for 15 years was striking.
Myanmar's accusers have described a deliberate campaign of ethnic cleansing and genocide that drove more than 700,000 Rohingya to neighboring Bangladesh.
Suu Kyi calmly rebuffed allegations that army personnel killed civilians, raped women and torched houses in 2017.
Leaders scramble for votes as UK's ugly campaigning ends
LONDON - Britain's election has been like the country's late-autumn weather: chilly and dull, with blustery outbursts.
On the last day of the campaign, political leaders dashed around the U.K. on Wednesday trying to win over millions of undecided voters who will likely determine the outcome.
Opinion polls suggest Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservatives have a lead over the main opposition Labour Party led by Jeremy Corbyn ahead of Thursday's election.
Britain's first December vote since 1923 for all 650 seats in the House of Commons has been dubbed the Brexit Election. It comes more than two years early in hopes of breaking the political deadlock over the country's stalled departure from the European Union.
Report: Giuliani settles long divorce from his third wife
NEW YORK - Former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and his third wife have reached a settlement in a yearslong court battle that exposed details about their luxurious lifestyle, The New York Times reported.
Giuliani, 75, and his wife, Judith, put an end to their differences and "intend to remain friends in the years to come," Judith Giuliani's divorce attorney, Bernard Clair, told the newspaper.
The couple was married for 15 years.
Throughout the divorce, details about the couple's $230,000 monthly budget became public, including six houses, 11 country club memberships and $12,000 on Rudy Giuliani's cigars.
Giuliani previously was married for 20 years to Donna Hanover. Before that, he was married for 14 years to Regina Peruggi.
YouTube cracks down on racist, sexist insults
SAN FRANCISCO - YouTube is taking another step to curb hateful and violent speech on its site.
The video streaming company said it will now take down videos that lob insults at people based on race, gender expression, sexual orientation or other "protected attributes." The Google-owned company will also prohibit veiled threats of violence, taking a step further into moderating what people can say on the videos they create and upload.
YouTube has been slapped with criticism from politicians, viewers and video creators for the material it allows on - and bans from - the site. The site has been accused of allowing and fostering hate speech and extremism and creating spaces for harassment to linger online, along with other digital sites that allow people to upload their own material, such as Facebook and Twitter.
Chile: Debris found believed to be from missing plane
PUNTA ARENAS, Chile - The Chilean Air Force says it has recovered debris believed to be from a military transport plan carrying 38 people that vanished days earlier en route to Antarctica.
Air Force Gen. Eduardo Mosqueira says "sponge" material was found floating roughly 18 miles from the place the C-130 Hercules last had radio contact.
It had left southern Chile and was flying over Drake Pass, a notoriously turbulent area.
Mosqueira said Wednesday the debris will be analyzed to see if it corresponds to the missing plane. He says the process could take up to two days to confirm.
The C-130 Hercules took off Monday afternoon from a base in far-southern Chile on a regular maintenance flight for an Antarctic base. Radio contact was lost 70 minutes later.
In Niger: About 100 Islamic militants ambushed an army camp in western Niger, a military spokesman said late Wednesday, killing at least 71 soldiers in the deadliest attack on the West African country's forces in years.
The large-scale attack comes amid a surge of assaults on army camps in the Sahel region, which have allowed jihadists to amass weapons and vehicles for their arsenal. Neighboring Mali has seen such an increase in ambushes on its army that it has even closed some of its most remote and vulnerable army outposts.
A Niger army spokesman read the death toll announcement on state TV Wednesday night and said a dozen others had been wounded after the ambush overnight.

New Jersey shootout has community on edge

Texto completo: JERSEY CITY, N.J. – A shooting spree that killed a police officer and three other people targeted a kosher market and could have been far more deadly had officers on patrol nearby not quickly intervened, city officials said Wednesday.
"We now know this did not begin with gunfire between police officers," city Public Safety Director James Shea said. "It began with an attack on civilians in the store."
In an afternoon news conference, New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal said a pipe bomb was recovered at the scene.
Grewal identified the victims as Mindy Ferenz, 32; Miguel Douglas, 49; and Moshe Deutsh, 24. Ferenz and Deutsh were members of an Orthodox community. Chabad Rabbi Moshe Schapiro said Ferenz and her husband owned the market.
Grewal said a fourth person in the market, whom he did not name, escaped the attack.
Authorities suspect that the attackers, whom they identified as David Anderson, 47, and Francine Graham, 50, gunned down police Detective Joe Seals about noon Tuesday at a cemetery before heading to the market a mile away. The two are also the lead suspects in the killing of a Jersey City man found beaten to death in the trunk of a car Saturday night.
Shea said surveillance video shows two people pull up in front of the JC Kosher Supermarket in a stolen van, slowly exit the vehicle armed with long guns and "immediately begin firing." Shea, noting that the market is surrounded by schools and other stores, said the officers "heroically placed themselves in the line of fire."
"Both of them received gunshot wounds as a result," Shea said. Officers Ray Sanchez and Mariela Fernandez were treated at a hospital and released.
Shea and Mayor Steven Fulop declined to characterize the attack as an anti-Semitic hate crime. Multiple media outlets, including The New York Times, reported that one of the suspects published anti-Semitic posts on social media.
Grewal said the shooters' motivation remains under investigation, and he urged the media not to speculate about any ideology that might have prompted the assault.
The attorney general highlighted the diversity of Jersey City and the area where the kosher supermarket sits next to a Catholic school and near a Dominican bodega.
"Yesterday that city came under attack," he said. "Not just the city but the values this city stands for, and we will respond as we have responded in the past. And we recognize many in the community are coming together and showing that we are stronger than the hate that fueled this terrible tragedy."
Fulop, in a tweet earlier, said anti-Semitism has no place in the city. "I'm Jewish and proud to live in a community like #JerseyCity that has always welcomed everyone," Fulop said. "It is the home of #EllisIsland and has always been the golden door to America. Hate and anti-semitism have never had a place here in JC and will never have a place in our city."
History 'screaming at us'
Authorities warned about scams seeking to take advantage of the tragedy.
Craig Carpenito, U.S. attorney for the District of New Jersey, said fake GoFundMe pages have been set up purporting to raise money for victims' relatives. He said no legitimate pages had been established as of Tuesday night.
"I can't find the words for how disgusting this conduct is," Carpenito said, urging those exposed to the fraud to contact the FBI.
Evan Bernstein, regional director of the Anti-Defamation League, said he was waiting for details about the attack.
"The Jewish community is shaken," Bernstein said.
Residents were rattled by the violence.
"I just think that everyone wants to leave," said Khalis Harris, 37, who has lived in the neighborhood his entire life. "If it's not yesterday's shooting, it'll be another one."
Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams said two of the victims were borough natives. Authorities said anti-Semitic hate crimes have risen 22% in the city in 2019.
"History isn't trying to talk to us right now – it's screaming at us," New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a news conference. He warned Americans not to discount the possibility that a Holocaust could happen again: "It is not the distant past. It's right here with us."
Two hours of terror
Rabbi David Lederman, who spoke on behalf of the Jewish community, thanked de Blasio for "having the courage" to call the shooting an act of anti-Semitism. Lederman fought back tears as he recounted the lives of the Jewish victims.
"May all communities, including us in the Jewish community, feel that we are safe," Lederman said.
Still unclear is the connection between the bodega shooting and an earlier shootout at a cemetery. Police said Tuesday night that the suspects killed Seals in the cemetery in another section of the city of 270,000 people before driving the van to the bodega.
Shea did not address that information Wednesday. Jersey City Police Chief Michael Kelly said Tuesday that the officer was trying to stop some "bad guys" near Bayview Cemetery.
Seals, a married father of five, was part of a department tasked to get guns off the city's streets. Seals was on duty and in plainclothes Tuesday when he was shot by at least one of the suspects, Kelly said.
The suspects then drove a stolen rental van about a mile and engaged police in the shootout from inside the market. The shootout lasted two hours before police killed the suspects around 2:30p.m.
The suspects and three other people were found dead inside the store.
Bystanders were struck by rounds thought to have been fired by the suspects, police said. The store is in a section of the city that has become home to about 100 Orthodox Jewish families.
The front of the bodega was in ruins. Bullet holes riddled the walls and windows of Sacred Heart School that face the market.
New York Police Commissioner Dermot Shea, the brother of James Shea, said Jewish sites throughout the city are getting extra security.
"There is an escalation" in anti-Semitic hate crimes, Shea said. "It's ignorance, it's hate and it has to be denounced."

Power struggle fuels 'Virtue and Vengeance'

Texto completo: "Children of Virtue and Vengeance" (Henry Holt and Co., 416 pp., ) is the highly anticipated sequel to "Children of Blood and Bone," the first book of Tomi Adeyemi's West African-inspired fantasy trilogy, Legacy of Orïsha. Famously, "Children of Blood and Bone" netted the now-26-year-old Adeyemi a seven-figure advance, one of the biggest in the history of young adult fiction. Quickly after that, Fox 2000 picked up the film rights. As of now, "Children of Blood and Bone" has been on The New York Times best-seller list for more than 34 weeks, and has spent 20 weeks on the USA TODAY Best-Selling Books list.
The dynamics of power, corruption and identity are further explored in "Virtue and Vengeance." Where "Blood and Bone" explores how persecuted minorities find ways to retain their culture, "Virtue and Vengeance" places that minority on an equal playing field with their oppressors overnight. The characters are forced to rethink what they know about their culture and exactly who gets to own it.
The first book follows Zélie, her brother Tzain and runaway princess Amari in a quest to return magic to the land of Orïsha, where the maji people who formerly had powers are being ruthlessly persecuted by the monarchy. The monarchy chases the trio as well as Amari's brother, Prince Inan, who also discovers he has powers and a special bound to Zélie. Unlike Zélie, Inan sees his magic as curse rather than a blessing, especially under the rule of his father, who sees the maji only as "maggots."
At the end of "Blood and Bone," Zeilie, Tzain and Amari return magic to the lands of Orïsha, and the once-powerless majis now have the magic they had lost, and with it a desire to reclaim their culture that had nearly been wiped out.
Yet, the majis are not the only ones who wake up with powers. The ruling class also discover they have new powers and even more reason to wipe out the majis for good. And that includes the genocidal queen of Orïsha, Nehanda, who now takes her husband's place on the throne after he is killed by his daughter Amari at the end of "Blood and Bone."
Peace has never been more fragile. The book grapples with the idea of compromise when unspeakable violence has been committed against a group of people who are now returning such violence with a vengeance. The central conflict of the story is the war between the monarchy and the newly empowered maji, but the discord starts in the intimate bonds among the main characters, with characters' actions rippling out from the personal to acts of war.
Adeyemi expands on the strengths of the first book and raises the stakes in both friendships and in war, challenging the loyalties that were strongly cemented in "Blood and Bone." (though some relationships, especially the romances, feel underdeveloped and rushed). "Virtue and Vengeance" also introduces characters and revives old ones, revealing more difficult questions about redemption, power and reparations. Adeyemi does not pull any punches relating the horrors of genocide and war, yet her books still maintain a spirit of fantasy and adventure without her message losing its impact.
It builds to an ending that leaves the reader with a feeling that can only be described as dread. The dread is not a negative point, but adds scope to the series and more complexity to the theme of identity. Adeyemi writes a mean cliffhanger and successfully upends expectations.
The last chapter will undoubtedly leave fans shaking with questions until the final installment of the trilogy is published.

Texto completo: SAN DIEGO — Major League Baseball has been taking a beating over its minor league contraction proposal that would strip 42 teams of their major league affiliations.
Here at the Winter Meetings, MLB has finally decided it's time to start fighting back.
Not only did commissioner Rob Manfred describe the state of the talks as a “tale of two cities" and advise Minor League Baseball to leave its “take it or leave it" stance to reporters Wednesday afternoon, his deputy commissioner Dan Halem took the battle to another level.
Halem brought 21 photographs from 13 minor league stadiums that he said depicted unsafe playing conditions, high-school-level clubhouses, and cramped training rooms, and shared a copy of an internal e-mail sent from the president of the Carolina League to 10 minor league owners extending them the opportunity to sell 50 percent or more of their club and move it to Wilmington, N.C.
The e-mail is dated Nov. 22 — a month after word leaked out about MLB's plan to effectively abandon 42 communities.
Since October, Minor League Baseball as an organization and many of its owners have spoken to the media about the economic impact the plan would have in the affected communities and scoffed at the viability of an MLB-run independent “Dream League" and college-style wooden-bat leagues.
Congress has latched on to the abandonment issue, with US senators and representatives flooding Manfred's inbox with letters decrying the plan, along with the creation of a “Save Minor League Baseball" task force comprising minor league owners and a 100-plus group of bipartisan House members.
It's a messy, big-dollar dispute that likely will not subside much before the sides reach a September 2020 deadline to hammer out a new Professional Baseball Agreement.
To date, MLB has said little in its own defense, but the exhibits Halem brought to an interview Wednesday marked a new offensive.
Halem also said the list of 42 teams that has leaked is out of date and thus wrong. For example, he said, the Lowell Spinners, the Red Sox' sole affiliate on the list, are not technically affected.
“You can write this: No decision has been made regarding Lowell — internally and not across the table," said Halem. “That list is inaccurate. There are a lot of different moving parts."
For now, Halem said, MLB is not going to release a revised list because of its fluidity and the negotiation's intensity.
And while MLB is willing, for now, to endure criticism, it is unwilling to allow MiLB to continue to frame itself as the victim.
Halem made it clear that MLB believes MiLB has been unwilling to address the concerns about facility upgrades. Talks degenerated when the sides hired auditing firms to decide on facility standards and came up with different results. Trust was not helped, Halem said, when he discovered that information he had shared with MiLB president Pat O'Conner wound up in the New York Times and Baseball America in October.
Minor league owners don't have enough stake in the game because they play in stadiums that are mostly government owned, Halem said, and those leases don't stop a team from leaving a community.
“You have to understand their mind-set, too: They leave communities all the time; this is not like they've never left a community, they've left three in the last year," said Halem. “The problem with them, there is what they say publicly, and what they say privately is different.
“Publicly they're saying, 'We're staying in all these communities blah blah,' and what they say privately is, 'We're going to deal with these situations such as Batavia and Binghamton, we're going to leave and we have an area, a city here that's going to build us a new stadium' — that's the way they're going to deal with it.
“If you don't think they've been trying to get new facilities in some of these places for years, you're mistaken. They have."
Halem described the minor league owners as “very smart" for how they have leveraged major league owners into buying into some of their teams to prevent them from leaving.
“If I wasn't in my job and I had the money, I would buy a minor league affiliate, because these things do not really have any intrinsic value," said Halem. “We supply the players, the city or state supplies the stadium.
“They'll go to the Brewers, let's say, and say, 'We're thinking of affiliating with another club but we'll stay with you if you buy us at a higher valuation.' And our clubs have bought into this because they're desperately afraid if they lose their affiliate, they're going to get stuck in a worse place."
MLB does not think there is a need for 160 affiliated teams in large part because it believes a majority of MLB owners would be satisfied with four affiliates — a total of 120 teams — with more players on those teams having a better chance of making the majors and also making it easier for the MLB to pay them more.

Texto completo: Rep. Ted Lieu will miss the remainder of the week in Congress after being hospitalized for chest pains on Monday evening.
The California Democrat was admitted to George Washington University Hospital at the recommendation of the Office of Attending Physician after experiencing chest pains. While in the hospital, physicians ran blood tests and an electrocardiogram and ruled out that the pain was caused by a heart attack or existing damage.
Doctors did, however, find a partial blockage in an artery, which was likely the source of his symptoms. On Tuesday, the congressman underwent surgery to place a stent to open up the artery. The surgery was successful, and Lieu is expected to be released from the hospital later in the day on Wednesday.
In a statement, his office wrote, “Due to a medical procedure, Congressman Lieu will be missing work for the remainder of the week. He is in good spirits and plans to be back at work next week.”
They added, “Congressman Lieu is deeply grateful to all the dedicated professionals at the [Office of Attending Physician] and [George Washington] University Hospital. He does plan to watch a lot of TV as he recovers.”
Lieu, 50, is a member of the House Judiciary Committee, which just drafted articles of impeachment against President Trump. The articles will be marked up Wednesday evening, which Lieu does not plan to attend while recovering.

Kosher market shooter published anti-Semitic posts before 'targeted' attack

Texto completo: One of the two suspects in the recent kosher deli shooting had published anti-Semitic and anti-police posts online.
Investigators believe that Tuesday’s attack on a Jewish-owned market in Jersey City, New Jersey, was motivated by anti-Semitic sentiments, according to the New York Times. The shooting ended with six people dead, including the two gunmen who carried out the attack and prolonged gunfight with the police.
A brief, “rambling” manifesto was also found in the van that the assailants were driving, but the note provided no motive for the shooting. A live pipe bomb was also found inside the van during a search by investigators.
The violence began near a cemetery where the suspects fatally shot Jersey City Police Department Detective Joseph Seals, 40, in the head. Seals had approached the van because it was tied to another homicide over the weekend. Surveillance video showed that after killing Seals, the duo drove slowly to the kosher deli about a mile away.
“The perpetrators stopped in front of there and calmly opened the door with two long rifles,” Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop said.
After getting out of the van, surveillance footage shows them enter the market while firing their guns, killing three more people. The shooting was described as a “targeted” attack. They then began an extensive firefight with the police and other responding forces, which caused a lockdown of the area and of schools across the entire city.
Law enforcement managed to kill the two assailants during the gunfight, which lasted for more than an hour.
The attack took place in Jersey City’s Greenville neighborhood, where several Hasidic Jewish families have moved to from Brooklyn, New York, in recent years. The kosher market that was targeted opened about three years ago and was a central hub of the area’s Jewish community.
Although there has been speculation that the shooters were Muslim, the mayor said that there is “zero indication to that being accurate.”

Texto completo: It’s not every night two rock icons take the stage for intimate acoustic performances.
Eighties singer-songwriters Rick Springfield and Richard Marx will each offer a solo acoustic set on Sunday, Dec. 15, at F.M. Kirby Center for the Performing Arts, 71 Public Square, Wilkes-Barre. The show begins at 7 p.m., and tickets start at $39.50. They can be purchased at the box office, kirbycenter.org or 570-826-1100.
During a phone interview from his home in Malibu, California, Springfield assured crowds can expect his hits like “Jessie’s Girl” and “I’ve Done Everything for You” but also storytelling songs.
After Springfield’s autobiography, “Late, Late at Night: A Memoir,” came out in 2010, the musician found an outpouring of requests for a storytelling show. During these performances, Springfield feels he can connect with fans personally. While he’ll playfully call out audience members who are getting up for drinks, he also feels the connection between himself and those in the room. The atmosphere allows for more communication and emotion, which means everything to him as an artist.
“It’s telling stories, some jokes and sort of one-on-one,” he said. “I can actually talk to the audience. It’s low-key, laid-back and completely different from a full-band show. ”
As for Marx, the musician released a string of hits during the late ’80s and early ’90s including “Endless Summer Nights,” “Hold On to the Nights” and “Right Here Waiting.” Springfield said he and Marx have been friends since 1985 and decided to join together to go out on the road. Each will perform his own songs in separate acoustic sets before coming together for the encore. It’s a special night for the musicians and fans alike.
“You get to really hear the lyrics of the songs and the stories behind the music,” Springfield said. “You’re all together, sharing those moments.”
An Australia native, Springfield’s first U.S. No. 1 hit, “Jessie’s Girl,” earned him a Grammy award and solidified his place in pop culture. He followed its success with four more top 10 hits, including “Don’t Talk to Strangers” and “Love Somebody,” and has released more than a dozen albums during his career. He also wrote a novel, “Magnificent Vibration,” which made The New York Times Best Sellers list.
Springfield also has kept busy with acting. He starred in the film “Ricki and the Flash” opposite Meryl Streep as well as on TV, including more sinister roles as Dr. Pitlor in HBO’s “True Detective,” Lucifer on “Supernatural” and, most recently, Pastor Charles on “American Horror Story: Cult.”
“Doing stuff against type is always fun for an actor,” he said. “Showing that dark side.”
Springfield promised fans will see him in more acting roles in 2020, and he plans to release a second novel, a new record and a greatest hits album next year. Springfield also will hit the road with Chicago during the band’s summer tour around North America.
“There’s a lot in store over the next year,” he said.

Duct-taped banana catches fire in the art world

Texto completo: MIAMI — I was there. I saw it. The real one. Not the replacement banana.
I stood not seven inches from its golden peeling. I could note the perfect angle of the duct tape attaching it to the wall. I may have even detected a little aroma already heralding its existential demise.
But I saw the darned thing — a piece of conceptual art in the extravagant exhibition called Art Basel in Miami Beach. A piece of banana art that almost immediately sold for $120,000 — but which only hours after we left, WAS PULLED OFF THE WALL AND EATEN by an itinerant performance artist in front of an incredulous photo-snapping horde.
Art Basel draws not only the art loving public, but international connoisseurs of the avant-garde. High-end collectors, museums, and those looking to be seen all pop nearly $100 for a day of eye-popping modern artistic expression.
Miami itself is transformed with wall to wall exhibitions all over the city. But Art Basel, whose parent exhibition in Switzerland has the same cache, is clearly the larger of the two international events — certainly the draw-card for the three-day event in South Florida. Covering nearly 500,000 square feet, Miami's Convention Center becomes a gridwork of booths and stalls, each with a tiny desk circled by eager gallery personnel, racking up millions of dollars in sales.
Before getting back to the banana-duct-taped-to-a-wall that has been covered by the New York Times and Washington Post, the one which caused a sensation and nearly a riot in the hall — let me describe a couple of other pieces drawing viewers' attention at Art Basel and beyond.
1. At the Bass Museum, another exhibition featured five full-size car wash brushes whirring into each other and patrons, frightening children and sucking up stands of teenager's long tresses.
2. Art Basel showed A Vessel in a Vessel in a Vessel and So On: A pirate wench with the head of Martin Luther King hangs upside down by her heels leaking a chocolate-like, but poisonous mixture of Floetrol every few seconds. Apparently, it is to represent the toxicity of black stereotypes.
3. Untitled: A chain suspended from the ceiling upon which hang a bundle of rags. (Nothing more to say.)
4. A five-foot by five-foot painting upon which the artist criss-crossed clear packing tape. Then ripped it off... taking along much of the painting... and leaving the hanging tape. (Actually, pretty interesting.)
5. There is another sculpture consisting of nothing but wadded-up tape.
6. Then there were the somewhat imitative installations:
A series of concrete blocks arranged on the floor (and easy to stub your toe on.)
A series of empty pizza boxes arranged on the floor (and easy to draw ants to)
A series of pieces of newspaper scattered across the floor (Though it looked artistic, it may have been tumbled out of the garbage bin nearby.)
7. There were a number of large white empty canvases, differing only in their having one, two, or multiple slashes stabbed in their middles by what appeared to be a bread knife.
8. Blinking neon signs with pithy slogans were ubiquitous; piles of what seemed to be dirty laundry with either a chain, piece of rope, or in one case a loaf of bread on top were popular.
9. Empty canvases also came in colors including orange, black and purple.
Over the weekend, millions of dollars will have exchanged hands, reportedly with most of the pieces sold even before the general public was admitted. Yet the public was as much on display as the art.
Men dressed in black. Men dressed in ripped ... everything. Women exposing decollete' to their tummies. Women dressed as Frieda Kahlo and perhaps Louise Nevelson. Women with very tight skin and very large lips. And lots of curious, fascinated, true art-loving attendees who simply wished to have their horizons expanded.
And when their feet were aching, they could always recline (or even sleep as some did) on bleacher-like banquettes, while they sipped or wearily slobbered champagne at $25 a flute.
At last, back to the banana. Maurizio Cattelan's piece called, "Comedian," is no more. After crowds began to form around the work, bumping into adjoining exhibits, jostling the art up and down the concourse where the banana seemed to radiate a magnetic pull, a middle-aged "performance artist" named David Datuna, pulled the banana off the wall... and ate it while shocked hundreds shoved each other for a better view... staring aghast and eagerly snapping away.
Apparently, there had actually been three buyers of "the banana" — though as gallery owner Emmanuel Perrotin said, "not "the" banana." "The banana is a representation of our own ephemeral transience," he explained. The banana art piece was a "concept."
As such, the original work comes with a Certificate of Authenticity, and therefore the banana can be replaced with other bananas—and still be an original work of art. Get it? Yes, and in this case, a concept that apparently racked up a cumulative $390,000.
And so, back again in Tallahassee after a stimulating and enlightening foray into the world of high-concept art... I needed to make one stop before pulling into my driveway. This odd hankering just kept rushing over me... "fruit salad," "fruit salad," it seemed to say.
But oddly, Publix was really, really low on bananas. I don't understand. Maybe grapes? Why not a carrot? Now, that's an original concept.

Texto completo: When someone has irked you and you want to lash out at him, it is natural, apparently, to mock his looks. Donald Trump and Joe Biden have both exemplified this.
Last summer, Mr. Trump was doing one of his rallies, and it was interrupted by protesters. The crowd started chanting "U.S.A.!" "U.S.A.!" of course. Then Mr. Trump said - apparently referring to one of the protesters - "That guy's got a serious weight problem. Go home. Start exercising."
The guy was not a protester but a Trump man.
Here is a slice of The New York Times' report:
"The man with the 'serious weight problem,' Frank Dawson, was standing in the arena near some protesters who were being ushered out. Mr. Dawson, donning his Trump gear, was fist-pumping the air as they were guided away.
"Mr. Trump's aides quickly realized the problem and tracked down Mr. Dawson's contact information so the president could call him. From Air Force One, Mr. Trump left a voice mail message for Mr. Dawson, but did not apologize for his insult, an aide said, and instead said he did not mean to refer to him. The president then thanked Mr. Dawson for his support."
And Joe Biden? He got into a tussle with an Iowa voter recently. The voter said he knew negative stuff about Mr. Biden because he watched television. "I know you do," said Mr. Biden, "that's why you're ..." Then he stopped himself and continued, "I'm not sedentary, I get up and ..." Then he veered off in another direction.
Toward the end of their exchange, Mr. Biden said, sort of absent-mindedly, "Look, fat ..." His campaign later claimed he had said "fact" or "facts."
For good measure, Mr. Biden challenged the fellow to an IQ test.
He has a history of this, Mr. Biden does. You remember the 1988 cycle? He said to a questioner, "I think I have a much higher IQ than you do."
Mr. Trump, of course, is the all-time champeen at invocation of IQ. Here is a classic tweet: "Sorry losers and haters, but my I.Q. is one of the highest -and you all know it! Please don't feel so stupid or insecure,it's not your fault."
About Mika Brzezinski: "low I.Q. Crazy Mika." About Robert De Niro: "a very Low IQ individual." About Mr. Biden: "another low I.Q. individual!" Etc., etc.
Even Kim Jong Un got in on the act. After Mr. Biden called him a tyrant - which is the least you can say about Mr. Kim - Mr. Kim called him a "fool of low IQ" and also an "imbecile bereft of elementary quality as a human being."
Mr. Trump obviously dug this. He tweeted, "North Korea fired off some small weapons, which disturbed some of my people, and others, but not me. I have confidence that Chairman Kim will keep his promise to me,&also smiled when he called Swampman Joe Bidan a low IQ individual,&worse. Perhaps that's sending me a signal?"
Some old-fashioned, elite types thought an American president should not be chortling with a North Korean dictator about the mental ability of an American former vice president. Others had a different view, naturally. Mr. Trump's press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said of Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim, "I think they agree in their assessment of former Vice President Joe Biden."
I have known some smart people in my life: Bill Buckley, Paul Johnson and Michael Hersch, to name three. I've never heard any of them put down anyone on the basis of IQ. In fact, I've never heard any of them mention IQ, period.
Those who do? They tend to be mightily insecure about their own intelligence, in my observation.
If Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden never mentioned IQ or weight again for the rest of their lives, it would be too soon.

Texto completo: "Michelle Wolf: Joke Show" debuts on Netflix. And a documentary about deafness airs on HBO.
What's Streaming
MICHELLE WOLF: JOKE SHOW Stream on Netflix. "We can't wait to hate people," Michelle Wolf says in this, her latest stand-up special. "We can't wait to have them canceled. And because of that, we get mad before we get logical." She's talking about a snarky reply she got to a social media post she made about otters (of all things), but the observation also addresses the reason many people now know who Wolf is: Last year, she was catapulted to national prominence after delivering a piercing monologue at the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner. Some celebrated the routine. Some denounced it. Looking back on the evening in a recent interview with The New York Times, Wolf mentioned just one regret: "I would maybe go harder." She presumably had more freedom to push boundaries in her streaming "Joke Show," in which she addresses subjects like manspreading, gender equality and the physical fitness (or lack thereof) of some past presidents. "I say this all the time: Don't bring your baggage into my joke," Wolf said in the interview with The Times. "A comic's job isn't to be right or wrong. They're just supposed to be funny."
FAST COLOR (2019) Stream on Amazon and Hulu; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. The director Julia Hart combines two popular genres -- post-apocalyptic thriller and superhero movie -- in "Fast Color," which stars Gugu Mbatha-Raw as a recovering addict and mother whose mind has the ability to both disintegrate objects and put them back together. Set in an America plagued by extended drought, the plot involves Mbatha-Raw's character reuniting with her mother (played by Lorraine Toussaint) and daughter (Saniyya Sidney), both of whom also possess supernatural powers. "Rewarding despite its restraint," Jeannette Catsoulis wrote in her review for The Times, "the movie has an elasticity that pushes the imagination in any number of directions, offering an expressive allegory for a lineage of powerful black women whose strength, unleashed, could literally shake the earth."
ROCKETMAN (2019) Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. The nominees for the 77th Golden Globe Awards were announced Monday, and this Elton John biopic is up for three awards in movie categories: best comedy or musical, best song and best actor in a musical or comedy. That acting nod is for Taron Egerton, who plays John on a rocky brick road to stardom.
What's on TV
MOONLIGHT SONATA: DEAFNESS IN THREE MOVEMENTS (2019) 9 p.m. on HBO. In her 2007 feature debut, "Hear and Now," the documentary filmmaker Irene Taylor Brodsky followed her middle-aged parents as they got cochlear implants that allowed them to hear for the first time. Those parents are brought back here, alongside a new primary subject: Brodsky's young son, who gets cochlear implants much earlier in life. The different experiences of deafness that these two generations have are the focus here, in a movie that, Teo Bugbee wrote in her review for The Times, is "sweet, but formally unimaginative."

Texto completo: While many American officials are eager to avoid the new tariffs, the president could go either way.
New tariffs on over $ 100 billion of Chinese goods are due to take effect on Sunday, but the Trump administration is sending mixed signals on delaying them as the United States and China keep haggling over a trade deal.
American officials have recently hinted in public remarks that President Trump could pause the new tariffs, which, if imposed, would expand American taxes to nearly every product imported from China. While many American officials are eager to avoid the tariffs, people with knowledge of the deliberations said that no decision had been made and that the president could go either way when he meets with advisers this week.
The United States and China announced in mid-October that they had reached a so-called Phase 1 trade agreement that would allow Chinese purchases of American agricultural goods to resume while the United States would cancel additional tariffs scheduled for Oct. 15. American officials said that future tariff increases could also be avoided if the pact were signed.
Since then, negotiators have continued to grapple over the deal's terms. The two sides remain divided over how many of Mr. Trump's tariffs will be canceled in return for China's trade concessions, and over the terms that will govern Chinese purchases of tens of billions of dollars of American agricultural products.
A completed deal appears unlikely before Mr. Trump's next scheduled tariff increase, set for 12:01 a.m. on Dec. 15. The move would place a 15 percent tariff on $ 160 billion of products, including toys, smartphones and other electronics, weighing on consumers and potentially turning into a political liability for a president headed into a re-election campaign. Business groups are worried about further levies.
"We're still in a high-stakes poker game," said Myron Brilliant, the executive vice president at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
"Having another round of tariffs would be a poison pill in the context of the current U.S.-China negotiations, and in the context of the global economy," Mr. Brilliant added. "We hope both sides understand the urgency of getting an agreement finalized as soon as possible."
If Mr. Trump delays those tariffs to allow more time for negotiations, it would be the fifth time this year that he has delayed or canceled tariffs. That could prompt criticism that China is taking advantage of the negotiating process.
With pressure growing, administration officials have weighed a variety of options. Michael Pillsbury, a Hudson Institute scholar who advises Mr. Trump, drafted a memo that has been circulated to the White House outlining possible actions.
The memo, which was reviewed by The New York Times, included options like extending the deadline with a commitment to hold additional talks. A more aggressive approach would entail Mr. Trump ratcheting tariff rates higher, perhaps beyond 50 percent, and refusing to soften on any of his original demands.
The significant progress this week on moving Mr. Trump's revised North American trade deal toward a vote in Congress appears to have further slowed progress toward a resolution by diverting the administration's attention away from China.
As the deadline nears, the December tariffs' fate has grown particularly cloudy. Some say that China has tried to appeal to Mr. Trump's desire to see more farm purchases by offering a waiver on tariffs it had placed on American soybeans, a move that prompted Chinese companies to make large bulk purchases of American goods.
Sonny Perdue, the agriculture secretary, said this week during a trip to Indiana that he did not expect the new tariffs would be imposed.
"I think we may see some backing away," Mr. Perdue said, according to Bloomberg News. "I don't think the president wants to implement these new tariffs but there's got to be some movement on their part to encourage him not to do that and hopefully the signal that they sent over soy and pork reduction might be that signal."
Last week, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that the two sides were in constant contact and that an agreement should not be sidetracked by an "arbitrary" deadline.
But other officials were careful not to lift the threat just yet.
"Those tariffs are still on the table," Larry Kudlow, the chairman of the National Economic Council, said at a WSJ CEO Council event on Tuesday, adding that he did not want to sound pessimistic about a deal.
Speaking at the same gathering on Monday, Jared Kushner, a close adviser to the president, said that he did not know what decision Mr. Trump would make but that the talks were "heading in a good direction." Mr. Kushner has recently taken a more prominent role in the talks, offering to try to find common ground between the Chinese negotiators and his father-in-law.
Since Mr. Trump announced that he reached a deal in October, China has pushed for the United States to roll back tariffs it has placed on $ 360 billion worth of goods. Negotiations have centered on whether the United States would lift the tariffs it has imposed since September, or whether it might slash the overall rate for all or some of the tariffs in effect -- for example reducing the existing tax on China by half.
Critics have said that the Phase 1 deal may only temporarily calm relations since it would do little to address America's longer-term concerns about China's economic practices.
The preliminary deal promises to lock in Chinese purchases of American agriculture goods, open Chinese financial markets to American companies and strengthen China's protections for intellectual property. But analysts say it appears to secure only limited protections against China's practices of coercing technology away from the United States, and does nothing to stop China's pattern of heavily subsidizing its industries.
In a series of interviews in Beijing on Tuesday, people familiar with China's trade policies said that the Chinese government had discernibly hardened its negotiating positions since Mr. Trump and Vice Premier Liu He reached their agreement in October.
The Phase 1 agreement attracted criticism from the more nationalistic wing of the Chinese government because it called for Beijing to resume buying American farm goods in exchange for the United States not raising tariffs further, but without any American pledge to roll back some of the tariffs already imposed. Any tariff cuts were left for later phases, an arrangement that was assailed in China as too favorable to the United States.
Since early November, Chinese negotiators have demanded that a Phase 1 deal include some tariff relief.
"They believe this will make the deal equal -- otherwise it will be one-sided," said Professor Tu Xinquan, the executive dean of the China Institute for WTO Studies at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing. The trade ministry founded the university and retains close links to it.
Deferring rollbacks to a Phase 2 or subsequent agreement is being resisted by Chinese negotiators, Mr. Tu said, adding that, "they want every agreement to be equal."
But China has been wary of offering further concessions to offset a tariff rollback. That has stymied negotiators at least temporarily.
American officials say that they are still waiting for China to signal its willingness to make the necessary concessions to seal a deal.
Clete Willems, a partner at Akin Gump who left the White House this year, said China appeared to be taking actions, like the soybean purchases, to persuade the administration to delay the tariffs as both sides work toward a deal.
"The president has a decision to make," Mr. Willems said, "and realistically he could still go both ways."

Fitzhugh Mullan, Who Fought Inequities in Health Care, Dies at 77

Texto completo: As a doctor, he saw the inequities in the system at first hand; as a writer and administrator, he called them out.
Dr. Fitzhugh Mullan, who as a physician, administrator and professor spent a lifetime pushing back against what he saw as inequities in the health care system that left minority groups and low-income people underserved, died on Nov. 29 at his home in Bethesda, Md. He was 77.
Kathy Fackelmann, director of media relations at the Milken Institute School of Public Health at George Washington University, where Dr. Mullan had been a professor since 1996, said the cause was lung cancer.
Dr. Mullan had an earlier encounter with cancer in the mid-1970s, when he was 32. He turned that experience into a book, "Vital Signs: A Young Doctor's Struggle With Cancer," and in 1986 he was among the founders of the National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship.
But his main interest was in bringing social justice to the health care system, which he saw as fundamentally flawed both in how it recruits, trains and motivates doctors and in how it delivers care. It was a passion he developed in the summer of 1965, after his first year in medical school, when he spent several months in Durant, Miss., working with impoverished black residents.
"A simple choice presented itself in my mind," Dr. Mullan wrote in "White Coat, Clenched Fist: The Political Education of an American Physician," a sometimes blistering memoir published in 1976. "Either their poverty resulted from their being black and, therefore, inadequate (the racist explanation), or their poverty derived from their being black and therefore segregated, exploited and oppressed. While I was in Mississippi I saw enough to persuade me forever that the squalor of the black community was caused by the system and not the people."
That revelation, eye-opening at the time for a white Northern medical student from a relatively privileged background, defined the rest of Dr. Mullan's life.
"In the woods of Mississippi," he continued, "away from the medical center, far away from the labs and lecture halls, well outside the standard avenues of medical approbation, I discovered why I wanted to be a doctor."

He carried that inspiration into his career in pediatrics once he graduated from medical school in 1968, and then into top administrative posts, including at the United States Public Health Service and, from 1991 to 1996, as an assistant surgeon general. And he imparted a social-justice ideal to countless students and health professionals. One is Susan Hassmiller, senior adviser for nursing at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, whom he mentored when she was a doctoral student 30 years ago.
"He always gravitated to the less fortunate," Dr. Hassmiller said by email, "and always became the voice for those who had no or little voice."
Fitzhugh Seumas MacManus Mullan was born on July 22, 1942, in Tampa, Fla. His father, Hugh, was a physician. His mother, Mariquita MacManus Mullan, was a poet and a daughter of Seumas MacManus, an author famed for his interpretation of Irish folk tales.
Dr. Mullan grew up in New York City and attended the Dalton School. After graduating from the Pomfret School in Connecticut, he enrolled at Harvard, receiving a bachelor's degree there in 1964.
He graduated from the University of Chicago's medical school in 1968 and did residencies at Jacobi Hospital and Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx, where he encountered an urban version of the inequities he had seen in Mississippi. Lincoln, where he was a resident in 1970 and 1971, mostly served black and Puerto Rican patients.
"We still had a diarrhea room," he said in an interview with Kaiser Health News in 2009. "They didn't have enough resources to do anything other than put anybody with any type of diarrhea in one part of the general ward.
"This was not 1970s medicine; this was very primitive," he added. "And it was part of the disequities that were built into the health care system."
In 1972, under the newly formed National Health Service Corps, which places health professionals in underserved areas, Dr. Mullan began practicing medicine in New Mexico. It was the beginning of a decade-long association with the corps that saw him become its chief medical officer and then, from 1977 to 1981, its director.
In the 1980s he held posts with the state of New Mexico and the National Institutes of Health, as well as academic positions at the National Academy of Sciences and Johns Hopkins University. While assistant surgeon general, he was also director of the Bureau of Health Professions at the Health Resources and Services Administration.
Dr. Mullan wrote prolifically -- books, scholarly articles, essays -- and he was outspoken about the problems he saw in the health care system and the medical profession. One problem, he said, was what kinds of doctoring were rewarded and respected.
"The prestige walks of medical life today are research and the subspecialties," he said in a 1978 essay in The New York Times, adding, "No one gets a Nobel Prize for ghetto medicine."
He advocated neighborhood clinics staffed by doctors with a sense of mission -- "practitioners," as he put it in the same essay, "for whom medicine is something more than a meal ticket or an exercise in technobiology."
"We will never improve the infant mortality rates or the longevity statistics of the inner city by hunkering down among the radioisotope scanners and incubators of the large hospitals," he wrote.
He bridled at the term "health care safety net" when it came into vogue to describe the last line of defense for society's disadvantaged.
"It seemed to me an insult to the dignity of patients that they would get no more than uncertain, makeshift, last-resort medicine," he wrote in a 2009 article for the website and journal Health Affairs. "Worse, the term, trotted out antiseptically in policy circles, seemed a capitulation to doing anything better for the medically disenfranchised and a happy codification of the idea that haphazard, second-class care was part of the American way of life."
His interests extended beyond the United States. A study he led found in 2005 that Africa and the Caribbean were losing large numbers of their trained doctors to four developed countries: the United States, Britain, Canada and Australia. The abandoned countries were left drastically underserved, the study found, and Dr. Mullan called on the United States to increase its supply of homegrown doctors.
In April, the George Washington University Health Workforce Institute, which examines issues like the recruitment and distribution of health workers, was renamed the Fitzhugh Mullan Institute for Health Workforce Equity.
Dr. Mullan's first marriage, to Judy Wentworth in 1968, ended in divorce in 1998. He is survived by his wife, Dr. Irene Dankwa-Mullan, whom he married in 2007; a sister, Quita Mullan; two brothers, Anthony Mullan and Alex Cohen; three children from his first marriage, Meghan Mullan, Caitlin Crain and Jason Mullan; a stepdaughter, Perpetua Buadoo; and four grandchildren.
In a 2015 TED Talk, Dr. Mullan noted that life expectancy in the United States had increased by 30 years in the 20th century, to 77. But, he noted, that gain was not uniform -- black people, people in low-income states and people without insurance did not reap the full benefit. That, he said, presented a challenge for health professionals and policymakers in the future.
"Is our goal to see to it that the privileged people in the United States put 30 more years on, and live on average to be 107," he asked his audience, "or should we think about our priority being the earnest, serious, durable disparities within this, and move the floor up?"

Texto completo: MOSCOW -- It began not so much as an invasion, but as a slouching stumble through mud and snow by frightened, ill-fed Russian conscripts, the hollowed-out remnants of a force that, before the collapse of the Soviet Union just three years earlier, had been the mighty Red Army.
But the Russian troops who advanced from three directions into the rebellious region of Chechnya on Dec. 11, 1994, carried history-changing forces that have since reshaped Russia and the world.
The Russian attack, initially in staggering disarray but then increasingly organized and brutal, signaled not just the start of the First Chechen War -- a merciless conflict that killed tens of thousands of people, mostly civilians -- but also the end of Russia's liberal dream.
It was a turning point that tilted Russia toward the rule of President Vladimir V. Putin, now in power for two decades. At the time, Mr. Putin was an unknown municipal official in St. Petersburg, but five years later he became master of the Kremlin, propelled there by yet another Chechen war.
Anatoly Shabad, a former physicist and prominent pro-democracy politician in the early 1990s, visited Chechnya repeatedly in 1994, first to try to prevent war and then to halt the killing once it started.
Holed up in the basement of the presidential palace in Grozny, the Chechen capital, as Russian forces launched a disastrous, all-out assault on the city on New Year's Eve 1994, Mr. Shabad emerged in the morning to find streets strewn with the corpses of Russian soldiers and their burned-out tanks.
Despite the Grozny debacle and many others, Mr. Shabad said, security and military officials who had pushed for the war -- known as "siloviki," or men of force -- came out on top, regaining much of the influence they had lost to democratic forces after the Soviet Union imploded in 1991.
"The siloviki were the losers on the ground but they acquired power. The time of democratic transformation passed and society returned to its old state of mind," Mr. Shabad, now retired from politics, recalled.
When President Boris N. Yeltsin, Russia's first elected leader, announced 25 years ago that he would "employ all means at the state's disposal" to crush Chechen demands for independence, he expected to subdue the Chechens with a swift show of overwhelming force.
The hope and expectation was that Russia would repeat the success that the United States military had in Haiti, which it had invaded in September 1994 to swiftly remove a military dictatorship.
Instead, the Chechen war dragged on for nearly two years and achieved none of Russia's principal aims other than the death of the region's despotic leader, Dzokhar Dudayev, who was killed in April 1996 by a laser-guided Russian missile.
The war reduced Grozny, a modern, multiethnic city, to a rubble-strewn wasteland reminiscent of Stalingrad in World War II, and shredded Russia's post-Soviet image as a peaceful democracy. It also set up a second war in 1999 that helped convince Mr. Yeltsin -- ill, often drunk and never fully recovered from the trauma of the first war -- to hand over power to Mr. Putin on the eve of the new millennium.
The horrific brutality of the conflict turned what began as a secular nationalist movement in Chechnya into a cause increasingly colored by militant Islam, with many fighters viewing their battle against Russia as part of a global jihad.
Money and fighters poured in from the Middle East during the later stages of the war, turning Chechnya into a breeding ground for the violent ideology of Al Qaeda.
The 1994-96 war was freighted with foreboding from the start, with many of Mr. Yeltsin's most stalwart supporters and senior military figures warning of disaster.
"It will be a blood bath, another Afghanistan," predicted Gen. Boris Gromov, the deputy defense minister, who had led the last Soviet troops home from that country in February 1989. The deputy commander of Russia's ground force resigned in protest.
Like the Soviet war in Afghanistan, the first Chechen war ended in a stalemate. Russia pulled out after signing a peace accord that left Chechnya's ultimate status undecided but essentially gave the region the self-rule that Moscow had gone to war to prevent.
And like the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, the Russian departure from Chechnya left a devastated land that quickly descended into lawless strife among rival factions.
While the Afghan war had pushed the Soviet Union toward collapse, the Russian Federation survived the Chechen debacle. But it was utterly humiliated and fundamentally reshaped.
That made the ascent of a strongman like Mr. Putin, a former K.G.B. agent who vowed to restore order and avenge Russia's defeat in Chechnya, not only possible but perhaps also inevitable.
The 1994 invasion "was a real crossing of the Rubicon for Russia," said Thomas de Waal, a British expert on the Caucasus who co-wrote "Chechnya: Calamity in the Caucasus," a classic book on the conflict, with Carlotta Gall, now a reporter with The New York Times.
The war, he said, "sucked the whole country into a violent nightmare" as soldiers, mostly ill-trained conscripts, were thrown into the caldron.
"The hawks lost the war but won power," Mr. de Waal said.
The official Russian military death toll was nearly 6,000, but most independent estimates put the real figure at perhaps twice that or more. The number of civilian deaths has been estimated at between 30,000 and 100,000.
Mr. Yeltsin's decision to send troops into Chechnya was initially billed as a straightforward exercise to "restore constitutional order" and reverse the declaration of an independent state.
But as with subsequent Russian military interventions, notably in Georgia in 2008 and Ukraine in 2014, the war began with an elaborate subterfuge orchestrated by Russian intelligence.
Fifteen days before the main invasion, dozens of tanks and armored personnel carriers poured into Chechnya, in what was presented as a push by Chechen opposition groups to topple Mr. Dudayev. The attack fit into a Russian narrative -- repeated today in eastern Ukraine -- that Moscow was simply a bystander in a local conflict.
But this story quickly unraveled, when Chechen fighters halted the advance, captured tank crews, revealed them to be Russian, and paraded them before Russian and foreign journalists.
Mr. Shabad, who visited Grozny in late November 1994 with other Russian lawmakers, said it was immediately obvious that official denials of Russian involvement were lies.
"They pretended that the Chechens were just fighting among themselves," he said, "but the whole thing was organized by Russia, mainly the F.S.K.," the domestic intelligence agency that succeeded the K.G.B., with the connivance of the military.
Andrei Rusakov, an army captain among the 20 or so Russians captured, told how he had signed a secret contract in which the F.S.K. -- now called the F.S.B. -- offered him several thousand dollars to take part in the phony Chechen opposition attack.
The revelation of the security service's failure prompted public gloating by Russia's military. Pavel S. Grachev, the defense minister, stated on television that the armed forces could have taken control of Chechnya with "one paratroop regiment in a couple of hours."
His boast quickly came back to haunt him, when Mr. Yeltsin ordered the military to invade. The disastrous performance of the armed forces made Mr. Grachev perhaps the most reviled man in Russia, amid accusations that he had pushed for a military solution simply to disperse the whiff of corruption around him and his ministry.
After the failed New Year's Eve attack on Grozny, Russian forces pounded it relentlessly from the air, an orgy of destruction that Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany denounced as "sheer madness." The Russians finally captured the city, but as the war ground on amid horrendous brutality on both sides, Chechens recaptured it the following year, and laid siege to Russian forces in other major towns.
In August 1996, Gen. Aleksandr Lebed, Mr. Yeltsin's national security adviser, reached an agreement with the Chechens to stop the fighting. Mr. Yeltsin, increasingly infirm, erratic and under siege politically, initially balked at the deal, which effectively acknowledged Russia's defeat, but ultimately endorsed it.
"The main thing," he said, "is that bloodshed has been stopped."

Texto completo: Is a bronze statue discovered in France a 16th century Renaissance masterpiece or a (much less valuable) 17th century copy? Readers shared their theories, opinions and expertise.
"Is it a '5' or a '6'?" a New York Times headline asked readers several days ago as the article detailed an art history dispute that is roiling the curatorial ranks. It was the kind of question that inspired the detectives among our readers. The story also sparked a debate among readers, akin to 2015's viral blue dress or gold dress discussion, that highlighted how two people can look at the same image and see very different things.
This dispute revolves around a bronze statue titled "Bathing Venus" that is being presented as a newly discovered artwork by the venerated Italian sculptor Giambologna and exhibited in Florence, Italy.
But several experts argue the piece is actually a copy of another Giambologna statue, currently in the Getty in Los Angeles. They say "Bathing Venus" was made a century later by an obscure Swedish bronze maker. The debate turns, in part, on whether a number inscribed on the sculpture is read as a "5" or a "6," making the year of the Venus's creation 1597 -- or 1697, long after Giambologna's death, which would make it much less valuable.
More than 100 readers commented and dozens offered their own vision of what sort of evidence made a convincing case for their viewpoint, with some dipping into their knowledge of casting of metallurgy and of history.
Below is a selection of the readers' reactions, some of which have been lightly edited, including two for whom the question was silly and the answer obvious.
"A poorly cast 6"
"Definitely a 5."
-- Karen Hutton, Brisbane, Australia
"The number definitely looks like a poorly cast 6."
-- Issac Basonkavich, United States
"It's a 5."
In the art history debate, some experts who believe the number is a "6" say it might look like a "5" because it wasn't fully closed because of an unintended casting fault. One reader had an explanation for why he thought this was unlikely.
"There is no way the 5 is actually a 6 with a "casting error." That's not how bronze casts fail, by filling in a volume in plane with the rest of the number's surface. And this doesn't simply pop out of the mold finished, there is an immense amount of work here after the cast itself where such an obvious thing would have been noticed. The artist finishing the work and chasing out the bronze would have had plenty of opportunity to correct it should it have been an error in the carving. It's a 5."
-- Aaron, New York
"The Gerhardt Meier business also raises a big question mark."
Over all, over half of readers argued it was a "6," than a "5." They pointed to the "5" contained elsewhere in the inscription in the date "November 25."
The trouble is, that too proved inconclusive.
"I've seen dozens of '5' written in that way (even in notarial deeds of the time). In addition, the '5' is the same as the date written below (25 November). There is no possibility that that number is a '6'."
-- Alfredo, Italy
"Complete nonexpert here. But I find it odd that the 5s in "25 November" and "1597" don't match. The Gerhardt Meier business also raises a big question mark."
-- Girard, Louisiana
"I can't believe there is any confusion or debate."
Along with the date, the statue carries the inscription, in Latin, 'ME FECIT GERHARDT MEYER HOLMIAE,' or 'Gerhardt Meyer Made Me in Stockholm.' For some readers that ended the discussion.
"I can't believe there is any confusion or debate. The claim that Gerhardt Meyer, whose name is inscribed on the piece and who was a leading bronze founder active in Sweden at the end of the 17th century, was NOT the artist. Huh?"
-- Matt Butters, Guelph, Canada
Among the comments, there were several from readers frustrated by the 5 or 6 debate because the art should speak for itself.
"Isn't this exactly what is wrong with the "art world"? If it is a beautiful sculpture, isn't that enough?"
-- Ed, Miami

Texto completo: Major nonprofits and other organizations have pledged millions of dollars toward groups trying to build a modern trust-busting movement.
WASHINGTON -- Critics of big tech companies are eager to keep up their momentum -- and some of the country's wealthiest foundations are providing the financial firepower.
Major nonprofits including the Ford and Hewlett Foundations have pledged millions of dollars in total toward taking on the power of the country's corporate giants like Facebook and Amazon. Other supporters include groups run by George Soros, the billionaire financier, and Pierre Omidyar, an eBay founder.
The foundations regularly fund critical looks at capitalism. The Ford Foundation, for example, supports many organizations that study and fight inequality. The Hewlett Foundation, whose lineage goes back to a founder of Hewlett-Packard and has a $ 10 billion endowment, has put a slice of its money toward organizations re-examining the free market economic policies that dominate Washington.
But the financial support is reaching new heights, and it could help the activists keep pressure on Silicon Valley by building the sort of political might that has powered liberal policy victories on issues like civil rights and net neutrality. Activists recently announced a coalition to take on Amazon, for example, that includes organizers around the country.
One of the groups receiving foundation money is led by Chris Hughes, a Facebook co-founder who now publicly argues for breaking up the social media giant. His group, the Economic Security Project, is pooling some of the money and then distributing it to projects focused on antitrust and concentration concerns. Mr. Hughes, wealthy from his time at Facebook, has contributed some of the money himself.
The Economic Security Project plans to give antitrust activists $ 10 million over the next 18 months. On Tuesday, the organization will announce how it plans to spend the first $ 3 million, putting the money toward grass-roots organizers, researchers at several Washington think tanks and a group that recruits artists to make graphics that "expose how our economy really works."
The coming years will test whether the efforts of the advocates can harness the skepticism about large corporations and the wealthy that is animating the Democratic presidential primary race. Federal and state officials have already announced investigations into Amazon, Facebook, Google and Apple.
Ultimately, these advocates hope to address corporate concentration in numerous businesses, including drugs and farm products, and combat rising economic inequality.
They have their work cut out for them. Tech companies spend tens of millions of dollars on lobbying every year. And antitrust issues hinge on dense questions of law and economics that don't fit on bumper stickers.
"It's not just about trends and corporate accountability," said Maria Torres-Springer, the vice president for United States programs at the Ford Foundation, which has a $ 12 billion endowment. "It's about creating and sustaining a movement that rebuilds political and economic power for everyday Americans."
A leading beneficiary of the money is the Open Markets Institute, a research group whose focus on antitrust issues has been pivotal in making corporate concentration a matter of public debate. It expects to bring in more than $ 3 million in 2020, according to an internal document from the first half of this year. In 2016, before the group split off from a bigger organization, New America, its revenue topped out at just over $ 900,000.
This year, the Knight Foundation, which focuses on journalism, awarded Open Markets $ 2 million to study the impact that concentration among technology platforms has on the media. In September, the Ford Foundation gave it $ 200,000 to examine how tech monopolies affect workers. A public campaign it has led to break up Facebook will expand to include Google next year, according to Sarah Miller, the organization's deputy director.
Mr. Hughes's Economic Security Project is contributing to that campaign. It is also paying for Open Markets to conduct public opinion polling.
"Our view is you need an ecosystem," Mr. Hughes said. "You need a community of people who generally share the same values but who, among themselves, may even have different approaches to the issues."
Another progressive group, Jobs With Justice, plans to hold sessions next year explaining to people the antitrust case against tech companies in simple terms. In the draft script of the training, the session's leader seizes on a simple metaphor, asking attendees to consider two lemonade stands.
The first stand belongs to someone whose family owns the local grocery store, so it gets its lemons free. The family's neighbors, who opened a competing stand, aren't so lucky. Over time, the first stand is able to slash its prices to undercut the second stand.
The session leader asks for a volunteer to play the person running the stand that can't use a family connection to get free fruit. The volunteer has to decide whether to engage in a price war with the more powerful competitor while an organizer charts the volunteer's dire financial situation on butcher paper.
Each situation ends with the volunteer's lemonade stand closing and a revelation: Amazon, the session leader will tell participants, has used this tactic against its competitors.
"What we wanted to do was create some field materials, some training materials, just to even explain what a monopoly meant for people," said Erica Smiley, Jobs With Justice's executive director. "Outside of people maybe playing the board game, it's kind of an old idea that maybe they learned in their fourth grade civics class but haven't necessarily re-upped on."
Ms. Smiley's group is one participant in Athena, the new coalition organizing opposition to Amazon over antitrust, privacy and other concerns. The coalition says it wants to raise $ 15 million in its first three years.
Athena will receive money from Mr. Hughes's fund, along with other groups trying to rally the grass roots to the cause.
The civil rights group Color of Change plans to use its funding from the project to pay for new hires to lead public campaigns around antitrust issues, while the Action Center on Race and the Economy will run "corporate campaigns designed to influence the public narrative on corporate concentration and win real victories for communities of color around the country."
Other projects, like the artists' group, are focused on finding new ways to explore the antitrust issue. Mr. Hughes's group paid for a New York event in November -- held by a project called the Museum of Capitalism -- where people could play versions of the board game Monopoly that are meant to call out inequities in the economy.
Mr. Hughes will also finance some groups doing academic research on corporate concentration and intends to support more researchers in the future.
"If you're going to see real change, you need a community of scholars who are in dialogue with one another," he said.
Money is already flowing to campuses. In November, the Knight Foundation allocated $ 3.5 million to researchers to examine questions about digital platforms, including competition issues.
The foundation, along with Mr. Omidyar's philanthropic network, has also provided the money to introduce an antitrust-focused initiative at Yale's business school. In an interview, Sam Gill, a Knight executive, said the foundation had not yet taken a position on whether there should be an antimonopoly movement but felt it was important to finance inquiries into the questions posed by major tech companies.
In recent years, more potential solutions to corporate concentration have emerged. While some believe in aggressive approaches like breaking up companies, others prefer new regulations or other measures.
At a conference at the University of Utah this fall, Dan Crane, a conservative law professor, challenged a group of participants including Tim Wu, a legal scholar and New York Times contributing opinion writer who is a leading voice calling for more aggressive antitrust enforcement. Mr. Crane pushed them to be more specific about the changes they would like to see in how antitrust laws are interpreted and enforced.
Over box lunches, the group wrote a statement, later published by Mr. Wu, listing legal precedents the group hopes will be overturned and policies it hopes will be enacted.
"Those who believe in a strong revival of antitrust, and a return to its antimonopoly roots, have a duty to specify what, exactly, they mean, in concrete, legal detail," the statement said.
Mr. Wu said that, among other purposes, the statement could be a test for judicial nominees. It's a focus reminiscent of the playbook that helped build the conservative legal movement -- which in turn shaped the antitrust laws Mr. Wu and his compatriots criticize today.
"Over a 30-year period, they won almost every one of those battles," Mr. Wu said. "They just sort of said, 'Here's what it should be,' and it happened."

Texto completo: A surge in searches for the definition of an old-school pronoun signals a new, nonbinary meaning.
Merriam-Webster announced the pronoun "they" as its word of the year on Tuesday, marking the rise of the use of the venerable plural pronoun to refer to a single person whose gender identity is nonbinary.
The word of the year, the dictionary publisher said, is based on data: Searches for the definition of "they" on the publisher's website and apps increased by 313 percent in 2019 over the previous year. Last year's word was "justice." In 2017, it was "feminism."
The public's interest in words is often driven by major news events, said Peter Sokolowski, an editor-at-large at Merriam-Webster. Other words that generated high year-over-year comparisons this year -- "quid pro quo" and "impeachment" -- are tied to political headlines.
But a surge of searches for the meaning of a utilitarian word like "they" is less common. It is likely to reflect both curiosity and confusion about the growing use of the pronoun for nonbinary individuals.
"A pronoun like 'they' is one of the building blocks of the language," Mr. Sokolowski said. "But with the nonbinary usage, people are sensing that it means something new or different, and they are going to the dictionary. When you see lookups for it triple, you know that 'they' is a word that is in flux."
Many Americans, especially older ones, stumble over the use of "they" as a singular pronoun. "For those who haven't kept up, the complaint is this," Merriam-Webster wrote in an earlier blog post on the topic. "The use of they as a gender-neutral pronoun (as in, 'Ask each of the students what they want for lunch.') is ungrammatical because they is a plural pronoun."
But for nonbinary individuals who identify as a gender other than male or female, being referred to as "he" or "she" is inaccurate. Over a third of Americans in their teens and early 20s know someone who uses gender-neutral pronouns, according to a Pew Research survey conducted last fall. That is double the number of those in their 40s, and triple those in their 50s and 60s.
Efforts to destigmatize other gender identities have sparked the disclosure of pronouns on social media profiles and email signatures. Some state and city governments have recently added an "X" option for nonbinary genders on state identification documents, which used to be limited to the options "M" and "F." And amid efforts this year in at least six states to make the practice law, state legislators have been grappling with the singular "they," The New York Times reported.
Merriam-Webster added the singular "they" for a person with a nonbinary gender as a definition of the word in its dictionary, noting that the use of the singular "they" to refer to nonbinary individuals is increasingly common in published, edited text, as well as on social media.
To illustrate, the dictionary cited a passage from a recent Times article:
I knew certain things about ... the person I was interviewing ... They had adopted their gender-neutral name a few years ago, when they began to consciously identify as nonbinary -- that is, neither male nor female. They were in their late 20s, working as an event planner, applying to graduate school.
On Tuesday, Merriam-Webster cited several 2019 news events to explain the curiosity that appears to have driven searches for "they." During a House Judiciary Committee hearing, Representative Pramila Jayapal noted that "they" is her child's pronoun; the singer Sam Smith announced that their pronouns are "they" and "them"; and the American Psychological Association recommended that singular "they" be used in academic writing to refer to a person whose gender is unknown or who uses it.
"As a word lover, what's interesting in this story is to see that social factors play so directly into language change," Mr. Sokolowski said. "That is something that we sort of know intuitively but we don't often see it as clearly as we see it here."

Texto completo: Authorities on Monday continued to investigate a shooting at a Florida naval base that left three people dead and eight wounded as a possible act of terrorism.
A Saudi pilot training at Pensacola's Naval Aviation Schools Command was fatally shot by a sheriff’s deputy during the rampage Friday.
Second Lt. Mohammed Alshamrani, 21, of the Royal Saudi Air Force was the sole shooter, armed with a legally purchased 9mm Glock handgun and several extra magazines, and no arrests have been made in the case, FBI special agent in charge Rachel Rojas said Sunday.
Rojas also said investigators were still trying to determine a motive for Friday's attack.
Here's what we know about the investigation Monday:
Why is the shooting being investigated as an act of terror?
"We work, as we do with most active-shooter investigations, with the presumption that this was an act of terrorism," Rojas said at a Sunday news conference. However, she said the "investigation has not led us to any information that indicated any credible threat to our community. "
More on Pensacola shooting: FBI investigating Pensacola rampage as act of terrorism; Saudi student recorded attack
Rojas said investigators were probing whether the shooter acted alone or within a network, or whether "any possible ideology" prompted the attack.
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis called the shooter somebody with "deep-seated hatred for the United States," who should have been vetted by both the American and Saudi militaries.
Hours before the shooting, tweets purportedly written by the suspect railed against the United States for its support of Israel and for stationing troops at bases in Saudi Arabia. Rojas declined to confirm the tweets came from the Saudi military trainee.
Authorities were tracking a trip that the shooter made to New York with three other students in the days before the attack, a person familiar with the matter said. Based on interviews with those who made the trip, the person said, there is no indication so far that the travel was linked to anything sinister.
The trip lasted about four days. “They did touristy things,” said the person, who is not authorized to speak publicly.
After the group returned to Florida, the person said, the shooter and others at a dinner gathering watched videos related to mass shootings.
Rojas declined to comment on the trip and the dinner party.
The Associated Press also reported one of the three students who attended the dinner later recorded video outside the building while the shooting was taking place. Two other Saudi students watched from a car, AP reported, citing a U. S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity after being briefed by federal authorities.
The New York Times, citing a person briefed on the investigation, said the student who recorded the video later told investigators he just happened to be in the area when the shooting broke out. The FBI said in a statement that it had obtained video taken by a bystander from outside the building after the attack had begun and after first responders had arrived.
How did the gunman have access to a firearm?
The pistol used in the shooting was purchased "legally and lawfully" in Florida through a process that was open to "any foreign national," Rojas said.
"That’s a federal loophole that he took advantage of," said DeSantis, adding that he would urge President Donald Trump and other federal decision-makers to change policies that allow foreign nationals to arm themselves.
DeSantis says to end 'loophole': Florida Gov. calls for gun restrictions after deadly Pensacola rampage
Under U. S. code, foreign nationals who have been lawfully admitted to the U. S. can purchase and possess a gun under a few specific conditions:
If they were admitted to the U. S. for lawful hunting or sporting purposes or if they are in possession of a U. S. -issued hunting license or permit
If they are an official representative of a foreign government who is accredited with the U. S. government; if they are accredited with a government-partnered international organization headquartered in the U. S. ; or if they are in transit to or from a country where they are accredited
If they are an official of a foreign government or a distinguished foreign visitor as designated by the U. S. Department of State
If they are a foreign law enforcement officer of a friendly foreign government entering the U. S. on official law enforcement business
There is also a process where a foreign national can petition the U. S attorney general directly for a waiver that allows them to possess a gun.
It is unclear exactly what criteria allowed the Pensacola gunman to purchase a firearm, but he was a member of the Royal Saudi Air Force who was credentialed with the U. S. through an aviation training program.
However, Acting Defense Secretary Mark Esper said he had ordered a review of the Defense Department's security and vetting policies. Guns are not allowed on the base, said Navy Rear Adm. Gary Mayes, without prior approval.
Why was the gunman training in the United States?
Alshamrani was one of 852 Saudi nationals in the United States training under a cooperation agreement. He was among 5,180 foreign students from 153 countries in the United States for military training. Many of those students operate U. S. military hardware that foreign governments buy from the United States.
Training international students at Navy Air Station Pensacola is a core part of the base's mission.
The shooter began his three-year course in August 2017 with English, basic aviation and initial pilot training, said officials, who were not authorized to speak publicly because of the ongoing investigation.
Foreign military trainees are vetted before traveling to the United States. U. S. Embassy personnel research databases for activities such as support for terrorism, drug trafficking, corruption and other criminal behavior. Travel orders are denied to those who fail to pass the screening, one official said.
US-Saudi alliance: Pensacola shooting by Saudi national raises new questions
The shootings in Florida come at an already tense moment in U. S. -Saudi relations after Saudi Arabia's role in the 2018 slaying of Jamal Khashoggi, a U. S. resident and Washington Post journalist.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Saturday that he spoke with Saudi Arabia's foreign minister, "who expressed his condolences and sadness at the loss of life in the horrific attack" in Florida.
Who are the victims?
The Navy identified the victims as Airman Mohammed Haitham, 19, of St. Petersburg, Florida; Ensign Joshua Kaleb Watson, 23, of Coffee, Alabama; and Airman Apprentice Cameron Scott Walters, 21, of Richmond Hill, Georgia.
Watson "saved countless lives," his family said after the shooting.
“Heavily wounded, he made his way out to flag down first responders and gave an accurate description of the shooter,” his father, Benjamin Watson, said. “He died serving his country. ”

Cal Thomas: Stop socialism from taking over this country

Texto completo: Not many people think of the Ten Commandments these days, unless some group is trying to fight a legal battle to place them on public property.
Still, these laws of God, which may be familiar to some only through the Cecil B. DeMille classic film starring Charlton Heston as Moses, contain worthy guidelines that are applicable to today.
<img class="size-medium wp-image-2656862" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/Cal-Thomas-Color-300x190.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="190" />
When considering the “wealth tax” proposed by presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, the 10th Commandment is particularly relevant: “Thou shall not covet thy neighbor’s house, thou shall not covet thy neighbor’s wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbor’s.”
One definition of “covet” is: “to desire wrongfully, inordinately, or without due regard for the rights of others: to covet another’s property.”
Warren, Sanders and others intent on soaking the rich might argue their proposals to massively increase government power and reach is not wrong, or inordinate, or without due regard for the rights of others, because they believe health care for all is a right. But at the heart of their health care and other plans they claim would be paid for by additional taxes on the wealthy and successful is a failure to understand basic economic principles.
One principle is that money is not a limited resource. If billionaires were depriving others of earning money then these politicians would have a credible argument, but the money pot is bottomless. There was a time when my income was so low that by today’s standards, I would have been considered poor. But I graduated from college, started in journalism at entry level and worked my way up (or down, depending on your view of journalists).

A Survey Monkey poll for The New York Times shows that Sen. Warren’s plan to tax wealthy individuals “continues to draw broad support from voters, across party, gender and educational lines.” Sure, everyone likes “free stuff” until they realize that nothing is free and that someone must pay for it. Several analyses of Warren’s plan say it is impossible to achieve without tax increases on the middle class. There simply isn’t enough money that can be taken from earners to underwrite the left’s multi-trillion-dollar spending plans.
Then there’s the notion that government will run health care better than the private sector. All one has to do is look at the often inferior “care” offered by the Veterans Administration to see this as a bogus argument.
Perhaps the best line I have heard on the subject is from our 30th president. Calvin Coolidge: “Don’t expect to build up the weak by pulling down the strong.”
Much of this is driven by our modern education system in which some professors teach theories of economics, along with envy, greed and entitlement, that are the opposite of what once was called the Puritan ethic, an ethic of personal responsibility and accountability with government as last resort. This belief helped build and sustain America through many economic and societal challenges.
Instead of celebrating and promoting the greatness of America, liberals and socialists spend their time denigrating the country and apologizing for its success. Instead of encouraging the poor and middle class to make decisions and adopt attitudes that will enhance their chances for success, they promote the belief that the rich and successful achieved by robbing others.
If America becomes a socialist nation it will be difficult to go back, even when the mistake is realized. The time to stop it is now, or more precisely with a decisive defeat of socialism in the next election.

Texto completo: La llegada de Donald Trump a la Casa Blanca y su discurso en contra de la inmigración impulsó a quienes habían sido sus empleados a denunciar públicamente a su antiguo jefe . El mismo Trump que criticaba a los extranjeros que llegaban a Estados Unidos por supuestamente robar el trabajo a los nacionales o que generalizaba apuntándoles como criminales, se había aprovechado en sus propiedades de la inmigración indocumentada .
Durante el año pasado, el Washington Post habló con 48 personas que habían trabajado para Trump sin tener permiso de trabajo . La ahora primera familia había usado los servicios de esta gente en 11 instalaciones de Florida, Nueva Jersey, Nueva York y Virginia. Estos trabajadores habían pasado años -algunos incluso dos décadas- manteniendo limpios los resorts Trump y alimentando a sus invitados.
La mayoría de estos empleados indocumentados perdieron su trabajo o lo abandonaron después de que se hiciera público el escándalo laboral que los salpicaba . Sin embargo, la organización Trump -aún propiedad del presidente aunque dirigida por su hijo mayor-, asegura que no sabía si los inmigrantes tenían permiso para trabajar o no. Por su parte, la Casa Blanca desprestigió las investigaciones del diario llamándolas “basura de tabloide”.
Margarita Cruz, una de las limpiadoras de la familia presidencial, dijo que Trump preguntaba a cada inmigrante que trabajaba para él su nombre, cuánto tiempo llevaba en el lugar y si le gustaba. Tras la pequeña conversación, Trump les daba un billete de $50 o $100 dólares.
El miedo se extendió entre el personal de la organización Trump cuando su jefe llegó a la presidencia hasta que un día, Sandra Díaz y Victorina Morales -ambas en algún momento limpiadoras en Bedminster- decidieron hacerse visibles y hablaron con the Post, The New York Times y otras publicaciones. Lo hicieron, según ellas mismas explicaron, para sacar a la luz la hipocresía del presidente .
Un año después de estos contactos con la prensa, Díaz y Morales ya no trabajan para Trump y las denuncias no han tenido repercusión legal para organización Trump . Tampoco se conoce ningún caso de deportación derivado de lo que revelaron las mujeres pero, aún así, amigos y colegas las han tachado de traidoras por poner sobre la mesa un tema que afecta a la economía sumergida de EEUU. Aún así, ellas insisten en que valió la pena.

Texto completo: ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — Pianist Gleb Ivanov will return to Taos this weekend to immerse his audience in three days of Russian music at the Harwood Museum of Art.
The Moscow-born musician will perform a solo recital of Sergei Prokofiev sonatas. Ivanov has been playing all 11 of the composer’s sonatas in concerts in Boston and New York.
On Friday, Dec. 13, Ivanov will perform sonatas number 1, 2, 3 and 8 in Taos. Some critics consider them among the finest works in the repertoire. The first was written when Prokofiev was still a student. The third is an explosion of virtuosity.
“It’s a complete tour de force of emotion and technical demands,” Taos Chamber Music Group director and flutist Nancy Laupheimer said.
On Saturday, Dec. 14, and Sunday, Dec. 15, Ivanov and the chamber musicians will perform music by the lesser-known Russian composers Alexander Borodin (the “Piano Trio in D Major”), Mikhail Glinka (“Trio Pathétique in D Minor”) and Anton Arensky (“Piano Trio No. 1 in D Minor”).
The Borodin is an incomplete trio, Laupheimer said.
“He never completed the fourth movement,” she said. “It’s really lovely.”
Borodin was a chemist and a Romantic composer. He was one of the prominent 19th-century composers known as “The Mighty Handful,” a group dedicated to producing a uniquely Russian kind of classical music, rather than imitating earlier Western European models.
Glinka was the first Russian composer to gain wide recognition within his own country, and is often regarded as the fountainhead of Russian classical music. Arensky was a composer of Romantic classical music, a pianist and a professor of music.
“I’ve tried to keep it light,” Laupheimer said, “because most Russian music is so dark. The Arensky is deep and beautiful.”
Now living in New York, Ivanov was awarded the Michaels Award of Young Concert Artists, which brought him his Lincoln Center recital debut and a rave New York Times review. While he was growing up in Russia, he was a protégé of the great cellist and conductor Mstislav Rostropovich.

Texto completo: Anne Hathaway didn't have to dig deep for her latest role in "Dark Waters."
In Todd Haynes' whistleblower drama, the Oscar winner plays the real-life Sarah Bilott, whose husband, lawyer Rob Bilott (Mark Ruffalo), helped expose decades of environmental contamination by chemical company DuPont.
"It's heartbreaking and infuriating on a human level," Hathaway says. "There wasn't really any acting required, in terms of playing someone who was learning of (corruption) and was equal parts aghast and terrified and angry and emotional."
Based on a 2016 New York Times Magazine article by Nathaniel Rich, "Dark Waters" begins with Rob taking on a new client: a West Virginia farmer (Bill Camp) who believes his cows' mysterious deaths are caused by a toxic runoff from a DuPont landfill, which contaminated a creek on his land.
Rob's work eventually leads to a study that finds roughly 70,000 people were drinking tainted water with traces of PFOA, a toxic chemical used in the production of Teflon products such as non-stick pans until 2013. DuPont was allegedly aware for years that PFOA exposure is linked to illnesses such as kidney cancer, and the company was forced to pay out $671 million in personal injury lawsuits in 2017.
The story hit close to home for Hathaway, 37, already a mom to son Jonathan, 3, with husband Adam Shulman, and now "a thousand months pregnant" with a second child, she says good-naturedly by phone.
After reading the script, "I opened the drawer where I keep my pans and pots, and there was a non-stick pan," Hathaway says. "And despite reading an article when I was pregnant with my first child that said 'don't use non-stick,' there was one that had somehow slipped through the cracks and I'd been feeding my family with it for years.
"I try not to blame myself too hard in those circumstances, because I believe that we as human beings and as Americans should never be put in that position where we're just trying to do our best, and we're inadvertently poisoning ourselves and the people we love."
Hathaway has always had an activist spirit, which is part of the reason why Haynes thought of her to play Sarah. "Anne has this incredible vitality and intelligence and compassion, and you see that in her work," says the director, best known for the Oscar-nominated "Carol" and "Far from Heaven." "Sarah is an essential part of the story of Rob and how he was able to do what he did, but also how hard it is on a domestic relationship when somebody takes on the system."
A vocal member of the Time's Up movement against sexual harassment and workplace discrimination, Hathaway credits her activism to her parents, who instilled the importance of equality and inclusivity.
"I was born in the early '80s, and there were still things I was told I couldn't do because I was a girl," Hathaway says. "I was really lucky I was raised in a household where that sentence was never uttered. It seems strange to me that anybody would try to put me in a box based on the way I was born, when it's so much easier to just accept other people for how they are."
The actress says she is grateful for her "Dark Waters" co-star Ruffalo, who has long spoken out about climate change and fracking. She also feels encouraged by the work of 16-year-old Greta Thunberg and other young environmental activists. "I'm so inspired by them – their priorities are exactly right," Hathaway says. "They are focused and doing all the things we tell young people to do. So I don't understand people's negative reaction to this generation, except to say they must be very comfortable with the greed innate in the status quo."
After roles in "Serenity" and "The Hustle" earlier this year, Anne Hathaway is back on the big screen this fall with "Dark Waters," pictured, which tackles industrial pollution.

Texto completo: If you're tired of running around in circles to find a Christmas gift for the dog lovers on your list, I know just the thing for you to fetch.
The charming softcover book "It's A Dog's Life: Tales from A Dog Named Max," by Max, with help from Nina Hershberger, is now available from Amazon.
For the sake of full disclosure, besides working at a farmers cooperative and writing this syndicated column, I have had a freelance business relationship with Hershberger (founder of MegaBucks Marketing) for the past decade.
For most of that time, Hershberger's adorable pet Schnauzer, Max, has written a widely circulated monthly blog showcasing his hopes, dreams, opinions ("Why is Big Pharma dragging its feet with that CHOCOLATE vaccine?") and (sometimes wildly exaggerated) misadventures. One of my assignments has been to act as a sounding board/coach/muse/editor for the precocious pooch. I've tried my best to translate his lofty canine thoughts into something comprehensible by mere homo sapiens.
Max is quick with a one-liner, but I have labored mightily to clean up his grammar. He's far less concerned with split infinitives than with "Here, let me split that ROADKILL with you."
I also enforce deadlines and shield Max from distractions. I'm proud to have had a small role in helping him keep his nose to the grindstone instead of to a Chihuahua's hindquarters.
Hershberger recently asked me to help select 52 of the best essays that she and Max have collaborated on, so she could self-publish them in book form to satisfy requests from his legion of fans.
So, there is now a convenient way to read dozens of punchy 500-word essays about Max at the North Pole, Max at Dollywood, Max at the Olympics, Max's love for Notre Dame's Fighting Irish, Max's status as the Indianapolis area's most eligible bachelor, Max's presidential aspirations ("Ask not what your country can do for you – ask what kind of MONSTER is impersonating a tree limb rubbing against the window. Woof! Woof! Woof!") and more.
To be sure, Max sometimes bumps up against the Recommended Daily Allowance of jokes about pooper-scoopers, kibble, toilet water and chasing cars; but he's so sincere with his desire to please. Even Mark Twain could get in a rut, although not necessarily one he wallowed out in the sofa.
Max hopes to make the New York Times "Best Smellers" list. Seeing fans line up for his first autograph session had him wagging his tail and purring – until the cultural appropriation activists picketed him. He got no credit for being an honor roll CSL (Cat as a Second Language) student
He is excited to have this shot at immortality, although his excitement was muted by the sudden realization that it would be immortality in dog years.
Acquaintances have asked me, "When are you going to write a book?" — so I must admit I'm envious of Max for beating me to the bookshelves. But at least Max's book is something you can sink your teeth into, whereas one by me would probably be something to bury in the back yard.
I've presented my case for Max's family-friendly volume. I won't beg (unless there's a Scooby Snack involved).
But I truly feel "It's A Dog's Life: Tales from A Dog Named Max," available from Amazon, deserves a "forever home" with you, a loved one or your local library.

Can Natural Wine Be Saved?

Texto completo: The movement, built on honesty and simplicity, is being corrupted by opportunists.
By now pretty much everyone on earth, save for those caught in a Yellow Tail time warp, has heard of "natural" wine. Made from organically grown grapes, with nothing added or taken away, these wines are no passing fad. They are a return to authenticity.
For those of us who have long pushed for wine made from organic grapes as its sole ingredient, this "natural" craze should be a great moment of triumph. It's not just a change in what people are drinking; the sudden enthusiasm for natural production is changing the very shape of the wine world. Abandoned vineyards and regions are being revitalized, and farmed organically. Winemakers are re-evaluating what additives are really necessary. It's far easier for me to grab a glass of natural wine almost anywhere.
But any successful movement, whether in politics or viniculture, is vulnerable to corruption. Just as it is reaching peak fame, the previously innocent world of natural wine is coming under threat by opportunists and big business. Natural wine isn't dead, but something has been lost.
Some of these corrupting influences are predictable, and banal. There's tribal infighting and purity tests: Can a vintner add a minute amount of sulfites, a natural ingredient, and still call her wine natural? There's not enough of the good stuff to go around, and competition is fierce to get the best bottles. Producers, importers, critics and fans who, back when natural wine was still niche, were perfectly pleasant to be around are now aggressively defending their turf. As usual, social media is bringing out the worst in people and their egos.
Until recently, natural wine was no way to put your kids through college: Those who made it, or imported and sold it, did so out of love. Now people are entering the market not just to make a living, but to make a killing. In the late 1990s, the United States' first natural wine importers, Louis/Dressner and Jenny & François, brought with them idealistic values as they championed their farmers and winemakers. Twenty years later, fewer and fewer people are talking about ideals -- unless those ideals make for good marketing copy.
And of course, the big wine companies, which have already gobbled up hundreds of small vineyards around the world, have set their sights on natural, too. "These natural wines connect strongly with the coveted younger demographics and wine companies and retailers won't ignore this opportunity for long," wrote Felicity Carter, the editor of Menninger's Wine International. If imitation is the greatest measure of success, it is also its depressing result.
Even Trader Joe's has started to lean into "natural," with peach-colored signs that imply organic without actually saying it. On a recent visit to one of its Manhattan stores, I saw an Italian wine that made me suspicious. Upon research, I learned the product had no added sulfites -- but that it had used selected yeasts, a cardinal sin in natural wine. Criminal? No. Misleading? Yes.
There's no legal definition of "natural" wine; I have my standards, and I hope others follow them, but I'm no lawmaker. And with no legal definition the door is open for knockoffs. We need to safeguard the category, but the notion of government intervention seems loathsome to a movement started in the spirit of anarchy. A required ingredient list is being lobbied for in the European Union, but that won't stop the use of un-"natural" techniques like reverse osmosis or centrifuges.
Some of these wines, like that Trader Joe's bottle, which went for $ 8, are trying to do "natural" on the cheap. But cheap and tricky is not limited to, well, you know, cheap. A biodynamic winery in Australia, Tahbilk, recently introduced Minimum, an "organic label" extension, starting above $ 20. But the wine is made with a host of natural no-nos: machine-picked grapes, vinified with enzymes, acids and tannins, and then filtered and fined. This is as misleading as the guar gum and carrageenan often found in "natural" ice cream.
With the world perched on the verge of multiple disasters, the battle to defend natural wine might seem to be an elitist fool's errand. We all eat, but we don't all drink, so not everyone connects with the idea of wine as an enduring, magical symbol of humanity. But that's in part the appeal, to me, of natural wine -- as a pure expression of honesty, nutrition, culture, poetry and connection to land, the recognition that each wine comes from a different place.
That's why even people who don't drink it should grasp why the efforts to commoditize and cheapen natural wine is so offensive. A product tailored to perceived broad consumer tastes, and fabricated to deliver no surprises, cannot ever deliver those eloquent intangibles. It cannot be that expression of honest humanity that natural wine should hold at its core.
In "The Society of the Spectacle," the philosopher Guy Debord -- not incidentally, a lover of natural wine -- wrote, "All that was once directly lived had become mere representation." The more that is fake in the world, the more potent is our craving for real. This sums up the reason for the rise of natural, and its crisis. Our post-truth society is thirsting for it, even as we allow ourselves to be tricked by impostors.
Recently, I visited Kenjiro Kagami, a winemaker in the Jura region of France. I always found his wines to strike a riveting balance between liquid and lightning. Thrilling, actually. For near to a decade Mr. Kagami slaved over eight acres of land, refusing even to till his soil -- better for the environment, but resulting in low yields.
Standing in the strong sun, mesmerized by the fluorescent blue dragonflies and wild lady slippers, I asked him for his 10-year plan. "I want to find the balance," he answered.
I assumed he meant the balance between farm work and life. But Mr. Kagami told me no, he meant between the vine and the land.
Goosebumps rose on my forearm. Taken by this devotion, I understood the source of his wine's energy and purpose, both important and delicious. That kind of vibrant sincerity in the bottle cannot be faked. Or at least, one can hope.

Texto completo: One of the things every Catholic child is taught is that the word "hate" should never be used in connection with another human being.
This admonition flows from the expansive Catholic interpretation of the Fifth Commandment. In a General Audience last year in St. Peter's Square, Pope Francis declared that to hate is to murder in your heart.
All of which explains House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's reaction when James Rosen, a journalist for conservative Sinclair Broadcast Group, asked her: "Do you hate the president, Madam Speaker?"
Pelosi, a California Democrat who had been on her way out of her weekly news conference, wheeled around and returned to the lectern.
In an uncharacteristic burst of fury, Pelosi told Rosen: "As a Catholic, I resent your using the word 'hate' in a sentence that addresses me. I don't hate anyone. I was raised in a way that is full - a heart full of love - and always pray for the president. And I still pray for the president. I pray for the president all the time.
"So, don't mess with me when it comes to words like that."
Her critics will question her sincerity, and point out that she has broken with Catholic teaching on big issues of doctrine - chief among them abortion. "The church has their position, and we have ours, which is that a woman has free will given to her by God," Pelosi told the New York Times in 2015.
But those who know her well insist religious belief is at the core of everything Pelosi does. "There are two pillars in her life, in terms of her beliefs: her Catholicism, a very deep faith, and her family," her friend and fellow Democratic California congresswoman Anna Eshoo told my colleague, Paul Kane, on Thursday. "This is the authentic Nancy." No small part of that was the influence of her mother, Annunciata D'Alesandro, a daily communicant who at her funeral was referred to as being molded by "Regina Caeli," the Easter prayer to Mary.
Rosen was taken aback by Pelosi's reaction and claimed that he was merely paraphrasing Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga. The ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee claimed at Wednesday's opening impeachment hearing that Democrats were pursuing this most serious of constitutional sanctions against Trump because they "just don't like the guy."
That Democrats - including Pelosi - find Trump's actions and his character abhorrent is true. "I think the president is a coward when it comes to helping our kids who are afraid of gun violence," Pelosi said. "I think he is cruel when he doesn't deal with helping our 'dreamers,' of which we are very proud. I think he's in denial about the climate crisis."
But disgust, to a Catholic, is not the same as hatred. And, as Pelosi noted, political differences should be resolved in the 2020 election.
The speaker's reluctance to take the path on which she now finds herself is well-known. Despite evidence that Trump attempted to obstruct the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election, she resisted the voices on her party's left who wanted to impeach him over it.
But as she noted on Thursday, Trump's increasingly outrageous actions as president, culminating in his request that a foreign government provide ammunition against a political opponent, left House Democrats "no choice."
Is all of this good politics for the Democrats? I'm doubtful.
But is hatred of Trump what is driving Pelosi to take this historic step? I'm certain that it is not.
Conservatives sometimes forget that they do not have an exclusive claim to faith.
Pelosi's announcement that the House would proceed with impeachment was suffused with religion. "In signing the Declaration of Independence, our founders invoked a firm reliance on divine providence," Pelosi said. "Democrats, too, are prayerful, and we will proceed in a manner worthy of our oath of office to support and defend the Constitution of the United States from all enemies, foreign and domestic, so help us God."
The speaker has said she would rather be doing just about anything else right now. There is legislation she wants to pass on lowering prescription drug costs and on combating voter suppression. Instead, she leads her party toward impeaching a president, driven by her sense of moral obligation, the call of her constitutional duty - and, yes, her values as a Catholic.

Texto completo: We’re a hot mess, this bad-tempered country of ours. More than 40% of Republicans are slouching toward full-blown autocracy, favorably disposed, in one poll, toward a presidency unfettered by constitutional checks and balances. An even greater percentage of the party of Lincoln thinks Donald Trump is a better president than Lincoln.
At the other extreme are those who look out across the fruited plain and see only silos of identity — of race, gender, faith and class — alongside bushels of guilt. It’s shame, shame, shame all the time. Wave a flag at your peril. The founders were not Woke. Cancel them.
There’s no relief from the exhaustion of our national crackup. Even without impeachment, the holidays are a bracket of culture wars, the muted expressions of cheer loaded with political subterfuge. Taking in this eagle with a broken wing, some of our best historians now wonder if any kind of shared national narrative is possible in a nation where so many feel estranged in a strange land.
Yet, if you look again — through obfuscations foreign and domestic, beyond the noise of the social media mob — you find a durable past that may just save us yet. The big story of the American experiment, a nation that is not an ethnic, racial or religious state but an idea , is not dead. It’s not even past.
For starters, despite a presidential policy sourced from the sewers of white supremacy, a nation of immigrants has not turned against immigrants. The consensus, though battered, is intact: About 60% of Americans say openness to outsiders is essential to our identity. The majority says immigrants strengthen the country.
Twice before, this animating idea has been under deadly assault. In the 1850s, as waves of ravaged Irish refugees washed up on our shores, the Know Nothing Party rose to keep them from becoming citizens. The huddled masses were too dirty, too criminal, too foreign, too loud, too clannish, too Catholic. Lincoln despised the Know Nothings; his rise helped lead to their demise.
Then, again, in the early 20th century our better angels were on the run. At a time when upward of 5 million Americans took an oath to the Ku Klux Klan, the America of the 1920s was restructured to the Klan’s design. Black voting had already been wiped out in the South, and the emasculating repression of Jim Crow prevailed even in some Northern states.
With the 1924 immigration bill, the Klan achieved its other top goal: the most restrictive nativist act in history. It was aimed at closing the gate against “undesirables” — mainly Jews from Eastern Europe, Italians and Greeks from Southern Europe and Armenians from Turkey, among others. The Chinese had already been specifically singled out for exclusion. The design was to ensure “pure Americanism,” a nation of white, native-born Protestants.
And yet, here we are again, with the percentage of foreign-born residents at the highest level in more than a hundred years, nearly 14% of the population. And we are all trying to live by the American master narrative — despite pulls from the left and right to go tribal.
“These values my grandparents taught me, they haven’t gone anywhere,” said President Barack Obama in outlining American exceptionalism in 2016. It was one of the great speeches of his presidency, and worth recalling now, in these dark days, as the strongest case ever made for progressive patriotism.
“That’s why our military can look the way it does, every shade of humanity, forged into common service,” he said. “That’s why anyone who threatens our values, whether fascists or communists or jihadists or homegrown demagogues, will always fail in the end.”
This is the country, Obama said in another speech, “where you can write your own destiny.” He certainly could not have said that had he landed here, in chains, in 1619.
But 1619 was not predestination, as some would have it. It was followed by the emancipation of 1863, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Obama’s own election in 2008. None of it purged the original sin of enslavement, but it showed that the American people, more often than not, write their destiny for the better.
Today, there is no external enemy to unite us — not the British Crown, Nazi Germany or a Communist Soviet Union. For much of the world, and more than half of the United States, Trump is the uniter — the repellent-in-chief. As we saw again this week in Europe, the president is a laughingstock, mocked for his buffoonery, ignorance and bluster. In just a few days abroad, he made 21 false statements, a microcosm of his presidency.
At home, he wages war on American institutions: the military, the courts, Congress, the press, respect for truth, the Constitution itself. But he also faces certain impeachment, because what he did warrants no other choice. Though he most likely won’t be removed, a majority of Americans say he has committed an impeachable offense. He will be forever remembered for the gross violations of his oath.
We should be loud and proud with this to the rest of the world: L’état, c’est moi is nowhere in the founding documents. That’s another story America can yet tell.

Texto completo: Won’t you spare a thought for America’s medical debt collectors? And while you’re at it, will you say a prayer for the nation’s health care billing managers? Let’s also consider the kindly, economically productive citizens in swing states whose job it is to jail pregnant women and the parents of cancer patients for failing to pay their radiology bills. Put yourself in the entrepreneurial shoes of the friendly hospital administrator who has found a lucrative new revenue stream: filing thousands of lawsuits to garnish sick people’s wages.
And who can forget the lawyers? And the lobbyists! Oh, aren’t they all having a ball in America’s health care thunderdome. Like the two lobbyists who were just caught drafting newspaper editorials for Democratic state representatives in Montana and Ohio, decrying their party’s push toward a “government-controlled” health care industry. It’s clear why these lobbyists might prefer the converse status quo: a government controlled by the health care industry. If we moved to a single-payer system, how would lobbyists put food on the table, and who would write lawmakers’ op-ed essays?
Welcome to the bizarre new argument against “Medicare for all”: It’s going to cost us jobs. Lots of jobs. Good, middle-class, white-collar jobs in America’s heartland, where Democrats need to win big to defeat Donald Trump.
The argument is specious and morally suspect. Last week, health researchers reported that American life expectancy is declining for the first time in half a century, and some of the leading causes have to do with the ruinous health care system. Even if it is the case that reforming American health care might eliminate some jobs, it would seem to be a good trade for the likely benefit: More people might gain access to affordable health care and get to keep living.
But I worry that the jobs argument might sway moderate politicians, centrist pundits and much of the establishment, because it plays on one of the major fault lines of health reform: that in fixing the system so that more people benefit, those who now enjoy a privileged slice of American health care might end up worse off than they are today.
As a matter of ethics and equality, this should be OK; sticking with a system that is the source of so much death, debt and financial ruin just because you like your doctor or your insurance company or your medical-billing job is not really a defensible position.
On the other hand, in America, “I’ve got mine and I don’t want to lose it” is always pretty good politics.
The jobs argument goes like this: There’s a lot of fat in the U.S. health care industry, and any effort to transform it into a simpler system in which everyone is covered would necessarily eliminate layers of bureaucracy and likely reduce overhead costs. Every year Americans collectively pay about $500 billion in administrative costs for health care — that is, for things like billing and insurance overhead, not for actual medical care.
These costs are significantly higher than in most other wealthy countries. One study on health care data from 1999 showed that each American paid about $1,059 per year just in overhead costs for health care; in Canada, the per capita cost was $307. Those figures are likely much higher today.
Wouldn’t lowering overhead costs be an obviously positive outcome?
Ah, but there’s the rub: All this overspending creates a lot of employment — and moving toward a more efficient and equitable health care system will inevitably mean getting rid of many administrative jobs. One study suggests that about 1.8 million jobs would be rendered unnecessary if the U.S. adopted a public health care financing system.
So what if some of these jobs involve debt collection, claims denial, aggressive legal action or are otherwise punitive, cruel or simply morally indefensible in a society that can clearly afford to provide high-quality health care to everyone? Jobs are jobs, folks, as Joe Biden might say.
Indeed, that’s exactly what Biden’s presidential campaign is saying about the Medicare for all plans that Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are proposing: They “will not only cost 160 million Americans their private health coverage and force tax increases on the middle class, but it would also kill almost 2 million jobs,” a Biden campaign official warned recently.
Note the word “kill” in the statement. That word might better describe not what could happen to jobs under Medicare for all but what the health care industry is doing to many Americans today.
Last week, the medical journal JAMA published a comprehensive study examining the cause of a remarkably grim statistic about our national well-being. From 1959 to 2010, life expectancy in the U.S. and in other wealthy countries around the world climbed. Then, in 2014, American life expectancy began to fall, while it continued to rise elsewhere.
What caused the American decline? Researchers identified a number of potential factors, including tobacco use, obesity and psychological stress, but two of the leading causes can be pinned directly on the peculiarities and dysfunctions of American health care.
The first is the opioid epidemic, whose rise can be traced to the release, in 1996, of the prescription pain drug OxyContin. In the public narrative, much of the blame for the epidemic has been cast on the Sackler family, whose firm, Purdue Pharma, created OxyContin and pushed for its widespread use. But research has shown that the Sacklers exploited aberrant incentives in American health care.
Purdue courted doctors, patient groups and insurers to convince the medical establishment that OxyContin was a novel type of opioid that was less addictive and less prone to abuse. The company had little scientific evidence to make that claim, but much of the health care industry bought into it, and OxyContin prescriptions soared. The rush to prescribe opioids was fueled by business incentives created by the health care industry — for Purdue, for many doctors and for insurance companies, treating widespread conditions like back pain with pills rather than physical therapy was simply better for the bottom line.
Opioid addiction isn’t the only factor contributing to rising American mortality rates. The problem is more pervasive, having to do with an overall lack of quality health care. The JAMA report points out that death rates have climbed most for middle-age adults, who — unlike retirees and many children — are not usually covered by government-run health care services and thus have less access to affordable health care.
The researchers write that “countries with higher life expectancy outperform the United States in providing universal access to health care” and in “removing costs as a barrier to care.” In the U.S., by contrast, cost is a key barrier. A study published last year in The American Journal of Medicine found that of the nearly 10 million Americans given diagnoses of cancer between 2000 and 2012, 42% were forced to drain all of their assets in order to pay for care.
The politics of Medicare for all are perilous. Understandably so: If you’re one of the millions of Americans who loves your doctor and your insurance company, or who works in the health care field, I can see why you would be fearful of wholesale change.
But it’s wise to remember that it’s not just your own health and happiness that counts. The health care industry is failing much of the country. Many of your fellow citizens are literally dying early because of its failures. “I got mine!” is not a good enough argument to maintain the dismal status quo.

Anne Hathaway on 'heartbreaking' eco-drama 'Dark Waters'

Texto completo: Anne Hathaway didn't have to dig deep for her latest role in "Dark Waters."
In Todd Haynes' whistleblower drama, the Oscar winner plays the real-life Sarah Bilott, whose husband, lawyer Rob Bilott (Mark Ruffalo), helped expose decades of environmental contamination by chemical company DuPont.
"It's heartbreaking and infuriating on a human level," Hathaway says. "There wasn't really any acting required, in terms of playing someone who was learning of (corruption) and was equal parts aghast and terrified and angry and emotional."
Based on a 2016 New York Times Magazine article by Nathaniel Rich, "Dark Waters" begins with Rob taking on a new client: a West Virginia farmer (Bill Camp) who believes his cows' mysterious deaths are caused by a toxic runoff from a DuPont landfill, which contaminated a creek on his land.
Rob's work eventually leads to a study that finds roughly 70,000 people were drinking tainted water with traces of PFOA, a toxic chemical used in the production of Teflon products such as non-stick pans until 2013. DuPont was allegedly aware for years that PFOA exposure is linked to illnesses such as kidney cancer and thyroid disease, and the company was forced to pay out $671 million in personal injury lawsuits in 2017.
The story hit close to home for Hathaway, 37, already a mom to son Jonathan, 3, with husband Adam Shulman, and now "a thousand months pregnant" with a second child, she says good-naturedly by phone.
After reading the script, "I opened the drawer where I keep my pans and pots, and there was a non-stick pan," Hathaway says. "And despite reading an article when I was pregnant with my first child that said 'don't use non-stick,' there was one that had somehow slipped through the cracks and I'd been feeding my family with it for years.
"I try not to blame myself too hard in those circumstances, because I believe that we as human beings and as Americans should never be put in that position where we're just trying to do our best, and we're inadvertently poisoning ourselves and the people we love."
Hathaway has always had an activist spirit, which is part of the reason why Haynes thought of her to play Sarah.
"Anne has this incredible vitality and intelligence and compassion, and you see that in her work," says the director, best known for the Oscar-nominated "Carol" and "Far from Heaven." "Sarah is an essential part of the story of Rob and how he was able to do what he did, but also how hard it is on a domestic relationship when somebody takes on the system."
A vocal member of the Time's Up movement against sexual harassment and workplace discrimination, Hathaway credits her activism to her parents, who instilled the importance of equality and inclusivity from an early age.
"I was born in the early '80s, and there were still things I was told I couldn't do because I was a girl," Hathaway says. "I was really lucky I was raised in a household where that sentence was never uttered. It seems strange to me that anybody would try to put me in a box based on the way I was born, when it's so much easier to just accept other people for how they are. So I guess that was my first awareness that the world wasn't a fair place for everyone."
The actress says she is grateful for her "Dark Waters" co-star Ruffalo, who has long spoken out about climate change and fracking. She also feels encouraged by the work of 16-year-old Greta Thunberg and other young environmental activists.
"I'm so inspired by them – their priorities are exactly right," Hathaway says.

Texto completo: Our guide to the city's best classical music and opera happening this weekend and in the week ahead.
CALIDORE STRING QUARTET at Washington Irving High School (Dec. 7, 7:30 p.m.). We are spoiled for choice with youngish string quartets at the moment, but this foursome is particularly fine. As part of the bargain-basement Peoples' Symphony series, they play an early Haydn quartet, Webern's "Langsamer Satz" and Beethoven's Op. 127. In a big week for the late Beethoven quartets, the storied Juilliard String Quartet plays the Op. 131, as well as the Op. 18, No. 1, and Kurtag's "6 Moments Musicaux," at Alice Tully Hall (Dec. 12, 7:30 p.m.).
212-586-4680, pscny.org
STEFAN JACKIW AND MAHAN ESFAHANI at the 92nd Street Y (Dec. 6, 8 p.m.). Audacious performers individually, this violinist and harpsichordist join forces for violin sonatas written by two members of the Bach clan, Johann Sebastian and Carl Philipp Emanuel, as well as two violin-and-harpsichord works from the 20th century: Viktor Kalabis's Sonata and Walter Piston's Sonatina. Also at the Y this weekend, the violinist Carolin Widmann is the soloist in Kurt Weill's Violin Concerto, with the wind players of the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra, who also play Mozart's "Gran Partita" (Saturday, 8 p.m.).
212-415-5500, 92y.org
SHEKU KANNEH-MASON AND ISATA KANNEH-MASON at Weill Recital Hall (Dec. 11, 7:30 p.m.). Good luck getting returns to this recital from two members of an extraordinarily musical septet of siblings. Sheku, a cellist who gained fame playing at a recent royal wedding, and Isata, whose first recording on Decca was an outstanding survey of the piano works of Clara Schumann, one of my discs of the year, play Beethoven, Barber, Rachmaninoff and Lutoslawski.

MODERN PIANO (+) FESTIVAL at Spectrum (through Dec. 19). This sprawling celebration of the piano returns for a second annual festival, with highlights aplenty. This week, check out Jacob Rhodebeck playing Alex Nante's 50-minute "Diario de Abril" (Friday, 8 p.m.); the International Contemporary Ensemble's pianist, Jacob Greenberg, performing works by David Fulmer, Amy Williams, Dai Fujikura and Phyllis Chen (Saturday, 8:30 p.m.); the pianist and conductor Naomi Woo exploring the outer limits of the keyboard in pieces by Gyorgy Ligeti, Louis d'Heurieres and Celeste Oram (Sunday, 8 p.m.); and Alexandra Saraceno playing Messiaen's "Préludes" and "La Merle Noir," with the flutist Jacob Mortensen (Tuesday, 7 p.m.).

NEW YORK FESTIVAL OF SONG AT MERKIN HALL (Dec. 12, 8 p.m.). Harlem's gay underground is brought to life by the pianist Steven Blier and his team of singers, with songs by Bessie Smith, Billy Strayhorn, Porter Grainger and, perhaps most intriguingly, Gladys Bentley. Giovanni Russonello described her in a recent obituary for the Times's Overlooked series as a singer of "gender-bending original blues numbers," which led to her becoming "Harlem's most famous lesbian figure" in the 1930s.
212-501-3330, nyfos.org
ST. THOMAS CHOIR OF MEN AND BOYS at St. Thomas Church (Dec. 10 and 12, 7:30 p.m.). One of the three or four quintessential renditions of "Messiah" in New York will be particularly fresh this year, albeit still with the classic sound made by the choir's boy trebles, in this group's first performances under music director Jeremy Filsell. For reference, this year the New York Philharmonic's "Messiah" gets going on Dec. 17, but you will have to wait until Dec. 20 to hear the best "Messiah" for miles around, at Trinity Wall Street.
212-664-9360, saintthomaschurch.org
SO PERCUSSION at Zankel Hall (Dec. 7, 7:30 p.m.). Joined by a number of friends, this essential quartet looks back on a century of percussion music, from Edgard Varèse's "Ionisation" and Johanna Beyer's "March for 30 Percussion Instruments" to Steve Reich's "Clapping Music" and John Cage's "Third Construction," all the way through to the New York premiere of Julia Wolfe's "Forbidden Love."

Texto completo: Ten years after the original ended, the groundbreaking Showtime series returns with a cast that is more diverse if still a bit fantastical.
Back when the lesbians of "The L Word" first roamed Los Angeles, they had to travel to Canada to wed -- or to be dumped at the altar, as it happened.
Now that the show is back, 10 years after its original six-season run ended, the nationwide legality of gay marriage means much easier access to stories about engagements, weddings and divorces.
It's a changed world out there, and the series's sequel -- whose title bears the more inclusive appendage "Generation Q," for queer -- does it darnedest to reflect it.
Back in the 2000s, for instance, the transgender character Max was depicted as miserable and an object of ridicule. "The L Word: Generation Q," which premieres Sunday at 10 p.m. on Showtime, is comfortable in a world where announcing your personal pronouns has become routine for many, and where a series like "Pose" is an Emmy favorite.
But just as important -- maybe even more important when it comes to the "L Word" DNA -- is what has not changed: By the middle of the first episode, a half-dozen plots have already been hatched, some of them promising to be as far-fetched as we need them to be. Happily, the new showrunner, Marja-Lewis Ryan, is sticking with the common-sense-defying soap opera antics that made the original series a love-hate phenomenon that fans derided while obsessing over it. (This may be what happens when a long-neglected demographic finally sees itself on television, as musical-theater folks who loved to mock "Smash" can attest.)
Based on the three episodes made available in advance to journalists, "Generation Q" both follows in the first series's footsteps and expands its scope.
The three returning cast members start off in fairly exalted positions, having spent their decade away from our screens working their way up the social ladder.
The power lesbian Bette (Jennifer Beals) is campaigning to become the first female and first gay mayor of Los Angeles after heading its department of cultural affairs. She has sole custody of her daughter, Angelica (Jordan Hull), now a headstrong teenager, and she hates anything having to do with opioids for reasons that are sure to be painfully personal.
Best of all, Bette still gets classic Bette lines: "It's incredible, right?" she says, looking mistily at a painting hanging at her office. "Judy Chicago loaned it to me."
The Lothariette hairdresser Shane (Katherine Moennig) is first seen returning to Los Angeles on a private jet, her bank account fatter but her mood uncharacteristically forlorn. As for the goofy spark plug Alice (Leisha Hailey), she now hosts an "Ellen"-like television talk show while playing reluctant stepmom to the children of her new girlfriend (Stephanie Allynne); she also brokers a peace agreement between the former spouses, because how could that possibly backfire?
The newcomers are grafted onto this central trio in a fairly organic manner -- meaning that once again we find ourselves in a metropolis of approximately 30 inhabitants, all of them connected by sex, employment or both.
Among them are Dani (Arienne Mandi) and her live-in girlfriend, Sophie (Rosanny Zayas), who happens to work with Alice. Although Dani's father runs a large company and she has the kind of job that requires stylishly tailored pantsuits, she and Sophie somehow have a roommate, Micah (Leo Sheng), a transgender man with an active, if fraught, dating life.
Over all, the cast now better reflects Los Angeles's ethnic and gender diversity, which may be why the word "relatable" came up a couple of times in a recent New York Times feature about the new show.
This relatable is debatable, though, considering that the characters are conventionally attractive and range from comfortable to wealthy. As a poorly paid production assistant -- yes, on Alice's show -- the 20-something Finley (Jacqueline Toboni) is the lowest on the income totem pole. But Finley's financial predicament is relative in terms of actual hardship and access to power, and she wastes no time moving into Shane's new mansion in the hills.
Admittedly, "The L Word" is an aspirational soap. Still, based on its first three episodes (of eight total), the new series has not adapted to every way in which the world has changed: We just don't watch rich and powerful people like we used to. Now as before, the series focuses on the characters' sentimental and sexual experiences. But it always stood on shaky, uncritical ground when it came to money and class, and "Generation Q" offers little progress in that regard -- unlike, say, the Starz show "Vida," in which sexual, ethnic and cultural identities are pointedly explored within the context of Los Angeles's divisive gentrification issues.
Bette, thus far, remains the perfect distillation of that persisting disconnect. She has always been the show's authority figure, the woman all others look up to, partly thanks to Beals's dashing presence -- a steel blade sheathed in velvet -- and partly because the character is written that way. But she also exhibits fascinating hypocrisies, and the series never seems sure how to handle them. Bette toes the party line, be it lesbian, artistic or political, but she often does not put her money where her mouth is.
And where her mouth is can be a problem, too: When it comes to sex, Bette is an impulsive horndog and a cheater. A couple of early loaded glances indicate there is no reason to believe she has settled down.
Now that she's in politics, her "do as I say, not as I do" attitude may come back to bite her. Or perhaps she will get away with everything once again. In either case, here's hoping that the show will finally acknowledge Bette's true nature, allowing this wolf in Armani clothing to be the glamorous villainess she was always meant to be.

Texto completo: Richard Morgan's Dec. 1 Outlook essay, 'Air travel shows what happens when we give companies ruinous power,' and indeed the fact that The Post deemed it worthy of publication were pathetic reflections on the infantilized state of society.
As with many self-identified victims, Mr. Morgan and his portrayal of events are almost completely divorced from reality: He succeeded in blaming United Airlines for something over which it had zero control " weather " while taking no responsibility for something over which he had total control " sleeping through boarding for the flight on which he was rebooked. He deemed United greedy for failing to provide him with free food and housing and complained that flights subsequent to the one he slept through were full, arguing he has been 'fleeced' and extrapolating this to a broader pattern of abuse he sees visited upon consumers by corporations.
Though Mr. Morgan never proffers an alternative way air travel should work, his desired end state and definition of fairness are clear: Other people should give him things to which he feels entitled. Having been published in The Post, the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, etc., Mr. Morgan clearly has talent, and yet by his own description, he lives hand-to-mouth. Why society is complicit in his career choice or its financial consequences is less apparent. On behalf of the rest of us, I'd offer Mr. Morgan the following advice: Grow up.

The DHS, fake universities and the Obama administration

Texto completo: Headnote IMMIGRATION KORNER
Like many, I too was furious last week when I read the Detroit Free Press story that stated that U.S. ICE had arrested over 250 immigrant students since January, after they enrolled in a fake university set up by the Department of Homeland Security in Michigan. Of course, my first instinct was to slam the Trump administration and its new low. Until of course I stopped to do my research and nearly fell out of my seat.
What the Free Press did not mention was that this fake university, as well as another set up in 2013 in New Jersey, were all done during the Obama administration, while Jeh Johnson was head of the Department of Homeland Security.
Yes, you read that right. This sting operation that engaged in entrapment, deceit and eventual "robbery" of foreign-born immigrant students started way before Donald Trump's time as president.
The fake University of Farmington, registered with Detroit's state Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs and located in the basement of the North Valley office complex located at 30500 Northwestern Highway in Farmington Hills, Michigan, which the Free Press' article focused on, was set up in January 2016, while Trump was still campaigning, and Pres. Obama was in his last year of office.
Now many who know me will attest to the fact that I am no fan of Donald Trump. But I'm all about balance and fairness and the fact that this sort of DHS skullduggery was being done under the Obama administration against immigrants who were not criminals in any real sense, but simply wanted to study in this country and could be an asset to it, blew my mind completely.
I was in shock!
And then I found that another fake university had been created by the DHS' Homeland Security Investigations, a directorate of U.S. ICE-again under the Obama administration. This was done in 2013, one year after Pres. Obama won a second term in office.
The University of Northern New Jersey (UNNJ), like the one in Michigan, was also reportedly set up to "investigate student visa fraud." It claimed to be based in Cranford, New Jersey, with plans to expand to Harrison, Hoboken and Morristown.
And-like in Michigan- the government rented space, this time at 25 Commerce Drive, Cranford, New Jersey, and promoted it as its campus. It created an extensive Internet presence, including an elaborate website with a .edu domain name, created a crest bearing a remarkable similarity to that of Princeton University with a Latin motto, and set up a Facebook presence led by the university's "president," a character named Dr. Steven Brunetti who even had a Linkedln page.
And like with the Michigan operation, the UNNJ was also accredited by the Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges (ACCSC) and recognized by the state of New Jersey.
In April 2016, however, Paul J. Fishman, the U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey, and Sarah R. Saldana, the then director of U.S. ICE, announced that the sting operation had ended with the arrests of 21 people.
Federal agents posed as university officials and worked with the 21 people they arrested and used brokers. They had to then recruit other international students, mostly from China and India, to "attend" UNNJ.
The government claimed, "the brokers" knew that UNNJ did not offer real classes yet "charged the students in a scheme that allowed them to maintain their student visas and stay in the country," and in some cases, illegally arranged for jobs and work visas. They also said the brokers engaged in an illicit "pay to stay" visa scam.
According to Saldana at the time, the brokers arranged student visas for 1,076 people, most of whom had their visas revoked.
But the students, according to a New York Times report in 2016, said that they had been deceived by the government through "in-person meetings with the university's supposed president, letters confirming they could work instead of go to class, and Twitter messages about classes canceled because of bad weather."
Rachael Merola, a senior researcher at the Observatory on Borderless Higher Education, at the time called the U.S. government's establishment of a fake university at the time a "novel strategy" in combating student visa fraud.
She also added the strategy was highly effective but would likely not be replicated in the future, stating, according to the Times: "If anything, the massive amount of coverage that this got would sound an alarm and might act as a deterrent in the future to unscrupulous agents and sham universities."
But sadly, she was so wrong. The same exact strategy was replicated in Michigan and it was business again as usual with immigrant students- not hardened criminals-becoming victims, all under the Obama administration.
So, what does all this prove? That Republican or Democrat- immigrants remain the scapegoats and political football in a pervasive anti-immigration culture here in the good 'ole USA.

Elon Musk’s ‘Pedo Guy’ Trial Shows the Depth, Danger of His Own Mythos

Texto completo: Almost always, Elon Musk gets a pass. Elon Musk is excused when he errs or blunders because he is rich—stupid-rich, No. 23-on-the-Forbes-list rich—and because he is doing Big Things with his wealth, like colonizing space and building unprofitable and impractical but social-media-friendly electric cars.
Someone this successful, this good at earning free and fawning press, must surely be doing something different than peons like you and me—something better— and so, when Elon Musk does something that is quantifiably rash, half-assed, or catastrophically dumb, you are encouraged to unbelieve your own eyes. No, that wasn’t a boneheaded comment, a juvenile lark gone wrong or a very bad and not funny attempt at a “joke.” That was a six-dimensional chess move, a sophisticated misdirection—or, something . You just couldn’t see it!
SEE ALSO: Tesla CEO Elon Musk Reveals His Unique Business Habits
The big problem with this wealth-fueled Elon Musk mythos is that Elon Musk is also susceptible to its spell. Elon Musk is so very often right—look at the proof! Here is everyone saying so—that Elon Musk cannot admit it, to himself or anyone else, when he is so very obviously and egregiously wrong.
That is one theory to explain why Musk has spent the last two days in a Los Angeles courtroom defending himself in a defamation case, the subject of a lawsuit after he very publicly called a man—whom he’d never met, but whom he was having a public dispute via the media—a pedophile, a baseless allegation made in a furious red mist of wounded pride that is now costing him, and us, time and money.
Oh, but that’s not what Elon Musk actually said, or meant, we are now expected to believe. When Elon Musk referred to Vernon Unsworth, a British expatriate living in Thailand and an expert cave diver assisting with the rescue of a group of Thai boys stranded in the Tham Luang cave complex in the summer of 2018, as a “pedo guy”—the retort Musk managed to cook up after an exasperated Unsworth said Musk’s attempt to hijack the rescue with a cave submarine was a ludicrous PR stunt—he just meant that Unsworth was a “creepy old guy,” he tried to tell the court. Pedo means something else for South Africans (quick: name someone else from South Africa who is not Nelson Mandela), we were told.
Elon Musk spent three hours in court on Tuesday trying to argue the meaning of words, attempting to convince rational human beings on a jury that the way he used a word is different than the way the rest of us would use it. This exercise, and the rest of it—actually getting to trial, rather than trying to settle, as most people caught dead to rights doing something wrong (or at least actionable) would do—came after Musk tried to dig his way out rather than admit defeat.
Last summer, after his spat with Unsworth, Musk hired a private investigator to see if Unsworth, who is married to a prominent Thai woman from the Chiang Mai area—an area that Musk apparently discovered has some connection to child sex trafficking after some Googling—in fact, actually fancied boys, like Musk publicly suggested.
That the private investigator was a con man—and that there is no evidence Unsworth is a “pedo guy”—doesn’t seem to matter. Elon Musk was taken in by someone willing to play Musk’s own mythos against him. Then, after he was swindled, he just kept on digging. He told a prominent cybersecurity expert that the allegation was true. He then sent an email to a Buzzfeed News reporter in which he called Unsworth a “child rapist,” and in which he said he hoped “Unsworth fucking sues” him.
Elon Musk built a myth out of whole cloth in a moment of pique and then, with an allegedly cooler head, tried to build a shirt factory out of it. Elon Musk does not know when to quit, Elon Musk cannot admit he is wrong and Elon Musk is perfectly content to sacrifice other peoples’ time and reputation on the altar of his own hubris.
Attractive framings for this imbroglio abound. Attorney Alex Spiro, representing Musk, referred to his client’s dispute as “a fight between men.” Writing in The Guardian , Julia Carrie Wong described yesterday’s proceedings as a forum for the “fragility of male egos,” the stage for a pair of rutting rams to create a noisy distraction that serves only as a monument to their senses of self. Maybe—it’s possible that Unsworth, were he not so peacock-proud, could have just shrugged the whole thing off. But in our analysis, the one asteroid-sized ego so large it is capable of altering the tides, or at least the course of Elon Musk’s actions, is Musk’s alone.
What set Musk off was Unsworth giving an interview to CNN in which he disparaged Musk’s submarine solution. He watched it two or three times, Musk told the courtroom, and then fired off his angry tweets. More than a year later, it’s still a trigger. As the Verge’s Elizabeth Lopatto noted, that interview still infuriates Musk so much that he “turned pink while he watched it.” Musk then followed up that unforced error with a literal parade of more of the same. Musk ensured that Unsworth had no option but to sue—Musk dared him to do it!
Is there some twisted method here? No, and do not waste a second searching for one.
“There are a lot of things I say, and not all of them have the same quality of thought,” Musk said on Tuesday, in an apparent rare moment of clarity. Does he truly think this now—that his Twitter feed is a literal waste of malformed thoughts and $20 million weed jokes, with the occasional deep-space JPG? If he did, surely he would have settled the case, as The New York Times ’ Sarah Jeong observed.
More likely, in Elon Musk’s mind, he believes he’s still right. Just another in a series of world-altering acts of staggering hubris.

Texto completo: Since Barack Obama's White House wins in 2008 and 2012, political mythology has grown around the emerging voting coalition that made him president — the Obama coalition.
Hillary Clinton failed to reconstruct it in her 2016 loss to President Trump. And a scrum of 2020 Democrats now argue they're best positioned to find Obama's magic electoral elixir, what the New York Times called it in late 2016, "an alliance between black voters and Northern white voters, from Mr. Obama’s first win in the 2008 Iowa caucuses to his final sprint across the so-called Midwestern Firewall states where he staked his 2012 reelection bid."
Even some of the most boosterish Democrats acknowledge no 2020 candidate is going to fully recreate the coalition, suggesting the electoral phenomenon was unique to the 44th president. A more realistic goal is to come within striking distance, and win by smaller margins than Obama, 58, both times.
"No one has the connection with voters that Obama did,” said former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell, who is backing former Vice President Joe Biden for the 2020 Democratic nomination.
"If Biden doesn’t put together the coalition by 100%, he’ll put it together by 95%, which I hope is good enough," Rendell, 75, told the Washington Examiner.
Of the 65.9 million who voted for Obama in 2012, about 6 million chose Trump four years later, while 4.4 million didn't vote and 2.3 million back a third-party candidate, according to a New York Times analysis in 2017. Nearly 1.6 million of the non-voters were black, and about 5 million of the Obama-to-Trump voters were white.
Exit polling found that while turnout among young voters was slightly up in 2016 compared to 2012, support for Clinton among 18- to 29-year-olds was down 5% compared to Obama.
“It’s younger voters in general who we had the most trouble turning out in 2016,” said Mike Lux, a liberal strategist who served in the administrations of President Bill Clinton and Obama. “Younger voters are the most likely to do third-party protest votes. I think winning over those young voters is really the heart of rebuilding the Obama coalition.”
In the final weeks of her presidential campaign, California Sen. Kamala Harris talked up electability and argued that only she could gain support from the "coalition of the ascendant" — groups of Americans who have seen their demographic share rise rapidly over the last 20 years and the key to remaking the electoral map in the foreseeable future.
“We've got to recreate the Obama coalition to win. And that means about women, that's people of color, that's our LGBTQ community, that's working people, that's our labor unions,” Harris said during the November debate.
Harris, however, lagged in polls and fundraising, and on Tuesday quit the 2020 race.
Of the remaining top-tier candidates in the 15-person Democratic field, each has its own electoral assets and liabilities in building back the Obama coalition.
South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, struggles to gain support from black voters, while Biden, the former Delaware senator for 36 years, underperforms with voters between the ages of 18 to 29.
That leaves openings for Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren, running in different ways on the far-Left flank of the Democratic primary field, Lux told the Washington Examiner.
"The candidates right now best positioned to win over young voters, according to the polling, are Bernie and Elizabeth,” Lux, 59, who worked on Biden's first presidential run, in the 1988 cycle. “My own view is that the Biden is the hardest candidate for reenergizing the youth vote.”
Rendell downplayed the significance of the youth vote and pointed to Biden's strength with minority voters.
"Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are the losing prescription to rebuild the coalition. They’re not going to get the working-class whites and union guys in Pennsylvania,” the state's governor from 2003-11, Rendell, told the Washington Examiner. "Obama got independents and conservative Democrats and moderate Republicans to support him. And he came off as a moderate. He didn’t come up with outlandish spending plans and appealed to people’s hopes.”
Biden, 77, often suggests that he is well-positioned to pick up Obama’s mantle.
“I'm part of that Obama coalition. I come out of a black community, in terms of my support. If you notice, I have more people supporting me in the black community that have announced for me because they know me, they know who I am,” Biden said during the November debate.
Whoever emerges as the Democratic nominee, one of the more encouraging signs for the party is that nonwhite and foreign-born voters are projected to make up the highest proportion of voters ever in 2020, about a third of the electorate, according to a Pew Research Center analysis.
And Democrats’ path to repairing the Obama coalition may lie less in choosing another transformational candidate and more in building on voters energized to oppose Trump.
"People come out for two reasons. Reason number one is because there’s someone charismatic who people fall in love with, Jack Kennedy, Barack Obama," Rendell said. "There’s a second reason people come out: to vote against someone. And I think people are coming out to vote against Trump.”

La única aerolínea que acepta deportar inmigrantes de alto riesgo

Texto completo: Una aerolínea con sede en Oklahoma que realiza vuelos chárter es la única dispuesta a deportar a inmigrantes considerados por la Oficina de Control de Inmigración y Aduanas ( ICE ) como “ de alto riesgo “.
Y lo hace cobrando precios exorbitantes.
Se trata de Omni Air International , la cual tiene contrato con el Departamento de Defensa de los Estados Unidos para el traslado de soldados y con el Departamento de Seguridad Nacional (DHS) para concretar deportaciones que ICE califica como “ misiones especiales de alto riesgo ”.
Un documento sobre el presupuesto de ICE obtenido por el sitio de noticias Quartz revela que se ha tenido que pagar prácticamente lo que la empresa pide por sus servicios aéreos, ya que es la única dispuesta a realizar esos vuelos especiales.
Un agente de viajes habría advertido a ICE que muchos operadores aéreos no quieren participar en el proceso de deportación ante una posible reacción negativa del público y el impacto en los medios de comunicación.
“Como resultado, nuestro grupo de selección de operadores se ha reducido a uno solo, Omni”, indica el documento de ICE.
El pasado 18 de noviembre ICE pagó $33,500 dólares por hora para trasladar a 166 inmigrantes que fueron deportados de Arizona a Bangladesh, India y Vietnam. Lo que cobró Omni es el doble del precio en el mercado, reconocen las autoridades.
Los inmigrantes detenidos que puedan ser perjudiciales durante un vuelo o que físicamente se rehúsen a ser deportados, serán enviados a su país en un vuelo chárter especial de alto riesgo, establece la unidad de Operaciones Aéreas de ICE .
Omni Air International es la encargada de esos vuelos especiales y también de los casos de deportación de alto perfil , como quienes son considerados una amenaza a la seguridad nacional, violadores de derechos humanos y detenidos con órdenes de arresto en el extranjero o que son buscados en su país de origen.
Esa misma aerolínea tiene operaciones comerciales en los aeropuertos de Las Vegas, Dallas, Seattle, Hawaii y Baltimore.
Otras compañías aéreas que han colaborado en la deportación de inmigrantes, en vuelos que no son de alto riesgo, son Xtra Airways , con sede en Florida y que ha realizado traslados a México y Centroamérica, al igual que Swift Air , que de acuerdo con el New York Times esta empresa estaría recibiendo $15 millones de dólares al año por el contrato que tiene con ICE.
En declaraciones públicas, algunas aerolíneas como American , Frontier y United han dejado en claro su rechazo a participar en la política de deportación del presidente Donald Trump .

Howard Cruse, 'godfather of queer comics,' dies at 75

Texto completo: Cartoons “go straight for feelings," Howard Cruse told The Village Voice in 1988. “A good cartoon is shorthand for a perspective on life," he added. “It can get at the truth of experience without having to depict it literally."
As a pioneering artist in LGBTQ comics, Mr. Cruse illuminated the truths lived by those who were lesbian or gay or bisexual or transgender — whose experiences were largely excluded from that realm of creative expression.
In the 1970s, and even into the '80s when he spoke with the Voice's Richard Goldstein, there was “still a lot of pressure to view comics strictly as a children's medium," he said, and homophobia was not simply prevalent — “it was generally considered hip to dismiss gay people, as it is today."
Mr. Cruse, who had lived in Williamstown in recent years, was 75 when he died Nov. 26 in a Pittsfield hospital. His husband, Ed Sedarbaum, said the cause was complications from lymphoma.
Some forty years ago, Mr. Cruse was the founding editor of Gay Comix, which was one of the first series to feature work by and for openly gay men and women, and which showcased his work and that of women such as Roberta Gregory and Mary Wings.
He then developed “Wendel," a comic strip about a man and his lover navigating the early years of the AIDS epidemic. His work both inspired artists who followed and opened doors for them.
Alison Bechdel, whose 2006 graphic memoir “Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic" was adapted into a Tony Award-winning musical, bought the first issue of Gay Comix at the Oscar Wilde Bookshop in Greenwich Village soon after moving to Manhattan.
“I had no career goals until I picked up that comic, and I knew at that moment what I was going to do with my life," Bechdel told The New York Times. “He created a path for me and many other queer cartoonists."
Cartoonist Justin Hall, a California College of the Arts professor who edited the collection “No Straight Lines: Four Decades of Queer Comics," called Mr. Cruse “one of the greatest cartoonists of his generation."
Hall told The Washington Post that Mr. Cruse “is known as the godfather of queer comics, not just because of his artistic talent, not just because of his pioneering works, but because of his generosity, his belief in community, and his dedication to helping us all."
Mr. Cruse was first known for his 1970s series “Barefootz," which featured a friendly young man with oversized bare feet, and which later included a gay character. The cartoon appeared in magazines and in anthologies by publisher Denis Kitchen.
Kitchen invited Mr. Cruse to edit what became Gay Comix, which was released with the tagline: “Lesbians and Gay Men Put It on Paper!"
Mr. Cruse edited the first four issues of Gay Comix, which debuted in 1980 and also featured cartoonists such as Robert Triptow and Trina Robbins. Gay Comix aimed to present stories that showed gay men and lesbians as true-to-life characters, rather than caricatures. Mr. Cruse eventually handed off editing duties to focus on his 1980s comic strip “Wendel," about a gay writer and his partner during the Reagan years.
Appearing in the LGBTQ magazine The Advocate, the strip “was the first time the intimate life of a gay couple had been shown in a serious way," Hall said.
It also touched on issues including AIDS and gay bashing, which Mr. Cruse said he endured in 1973 when he was attacked in Atlanta's Piedmont Park.
“Almost all of my comic strips, one way or another, are my life seen through a prism — not necessarily the details of it, but my emotional observations of it," he once told the Advocate.
Through his work, Mr. Cruse came to understand the importance of representing himself, as well as other gay men and lesbians, in comic books.
“It's tremendously empowering when you're gay to realize that you've been doing it right, and it's the bigots who are stumbling about in a fog about this subject," he said in the interview with the Voice, where he had been an occasional contributor.
His other work included 1995's “Stuck Rubber Baby," which told the story of Toland Polk, a closeted gay man in Clayfield, Ala. — a fictionalized Birmingham — who becomes involved in civil rights demonstrations.
Toland's friends include Ginger, an activist with whom he has a child (a plot point that paralleled Mr. Cruse's life), and Les, a black man who becomes his first gay lover.
Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Tony Kushner provided Mr. Cruse with some financial support during the writing process and wrote an introduction for “Stuck Rubber Baby," which won a Harvey Award and an Eisner Award, two of the most prestigious honors in comic books.
In a Chicago Tribune review, Harvey Pekar, the comic book writer known for his series “American Splendor," wrote that “barren of superheroes or talking animals, 'Stuck Rubber Baby' certainly isn't standard comic book fare. The people most likely to enjoy the book will be enthusiasts of good contemporary fiction, although most of them are unused to shopping for comics."
Howard Russell Cruse was born on May 2, 1944, in Birmingham and grew up in nearby Springville, Ala. His father, Clyde, was a Methodist minister and photojournalist, and his mother, Irma Russell, was a Southern Bell Telephone executive.
Aspiring to be a syndicated cartoonist from an early age, Mr. Cruse copied the styles of artists such as Al Capp, whose “Li'l Abner," a satirical strip about a hillbilly clan, was extremely popular.
During high school, he published a comic strip in a local paper and also traveled to Manhattan on a trip arranged by one of his high school teachers to meet Milton Caniff, creator of the comic strips “Terry and the Pirates" and “Steve Canyon."
At Birmingham-Southern College, where he studied art and theater, Mr. Cruse acted and designed sets for stage productions. After graduating, he joined a Birmingham television station as an art director and puppeteer and created a daily single-panel cartoon about squirrels that ran for two years in The Birmingham Post-Herald.
Mr. Cruse and Sedarbaum, his partner of 40 years, settled in Williamstown and married in 2004 after same-sex marriage was legalized in Massachusetts.
In addition to his husband, Mr. Cruse's survivors include his daughter, Kimberly Kolze Venter of Roswell, Ga.; his brother, Allan of San Francisco; and two grandchildren.
According to a funeral home notice, services will be private and a public memorial gathering will be announced.
Venter, who is 55 and met Mr. Cruse when she was 21 and in search of her birth parents, wrote of her father on Facebook: “He left a legacy with his artwork and was a trailblazer in this time. I'm so proud of him and so blessed he was in my life."
In the 1988 Voice interview, Mr. Cruse said he was “interested in the undercurrents of life, the ways that people relate to each other, whether they're gay or straight; the way they love each other and betray each other. These are the things that make all narrative art resonate."

Texto completo: Four officers at the city's notorious Rikers Island jail accused of standing idly by as a teenage inmate tried to hang himself on Thanksgiving have been wrongfully punished, their union boss said Wednesday - and he claims jail surveillance video will prove it.
The unnamed Department of Correction officers got bumped off payroll several days after Nicholas Feliciano, 18, wrapped a piece of garment around his neck Nov. 28 while he was in a cell in an intake room at a Rikers facility.
Feliciano (inset) allegedly stepped off a platform in an apparent suicide attempt and then struggled to regain his footing - all while officers watched and did nothing to intervene for at least seven minutes, according to a report in The New York Times.
But Elias Husamudeen, president of the correction officers' union, refuted that account - and said the jail's own footage from the George R. Vierno Center disproves it.
"There is no video of [officers] standing and watching an inmate trying to kill himself," Husamudeen told the Daily News Wednesday.
"How do you insinuate that four corrections officers were standing there for seven minutes watching this man try to kill himself? That's preposterous, that's almost criminal. That never, ever happened."
Feliciano remains on life support in the prison ward at Elmhurst Hospital in Queens nearly a week after his attempted suicide.
The Legal Aid Society - the public defender organization that represents Feliciano in court - has called on the DOC to give his family complete access to his hospital room. Right now, family members must abide by jail visiting hours and restrictions.
Feliciano's grandmother, Madeline Feliciano, felt humiliated by correction officers after visiting Feliciano on Wednesday, a source said. When she asked an officer if she and other family members could be alone with her grandson, the officer said no. The officer then proceeded to search under his pillows, in the closets and other parts of the room while Madeline Feliciano and her daughter were trying to pray.
Mayor de Blasio tweeted the allegations that officers failed to immediately intervene in Feliciano's suicide attempt are "deeply troubling."
"The people in our jails are human beings," de Blasio wrote. "Their well-being is our responsibility."
The teen was being held at Rikers for a state parole violation when he tied a piece of clothing around his neck and the other end around a pipe on the ceiling before stepping off a partition separating a toilet from the rest of the cell, sources said.
Husamudeen - who did not see the video but was been briefed on the surveillance footage - said officers moving around the intake area jumped into action when they realized what Feliciano was doing.
Feliciano - who bought a firearm and tested positive for drug use while on parole - has seven sealed prior arrests, including for public lewdness. He has a long mental health history and has made past suicide attempts, according to Legal Aid.
Husamudeen said the teen should've been housed in a facility that could accommodate his mental health needs.
"The person who made the decision to house this inmate at GRVC should be fired," he said, noting the detention center is not properly equipped to handle inmates like Feliciano. "We're the scapegoat for the incompetency of the department."
Correctional Health Services, which is responsible for those in custody with mental illness, did not respond to request for comment.

Texto completo: Not many people think of the Ten Commandments these days, unless some group is trying to fight a legal battle to place them on public property.
Still, these laws of God, which may be familiar to some only through the Cecil B. De Mille classic film starring Charlton Heston as Moses, contain worthy guidelines that are applicable to today.
When considering the "wealth tax" proposed by presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, the 10th Commandment is particularly relevant: "Thou shall not covet thy neighbor's house, thou shall not covet thy neighbor's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbor's."
One definition of "covet" is: "to desire wrongfully, inordinately, or without due regard for the rights of others: to covet another's property."
Warren, Sanders and others intent on soaking the rich might argue their proposals to massively increase government power and reach is not wrong, or inordinate, or without due regard for the rights of others, because they believe health care for all is a right. But at the heart of their health care and other plans they claim would be paid for by additional taxes on the wealthy and successful is a failure to understand basic economic principles.
One principle is that money is not a limited resource. If billionaires were depriving others of earning money then these politicians would have a credible argument, but the money pot is bottomless. There was a time when my income was so low that by today's standards, I would have been considered poor. But I graduated from college, started in journalism at entry level and worked my way up (or down, depending on your view of journalists).
A Survey Monkey poll for The New York Times shows that Sen. Warren's plan to tax wealthy individuals "continues to draw broad support from voters, across party, gender and educational lines." Sure, everyone likes "free stuff" until they realize that nothing is free and that someone must pay for it. Several analyses of Warren's plan say it is impossible to achieve without tax increases on the middle class. There simply isn't enough money that can be taken from earners to underwrite the left's multi-trillion-dollar spending plans.
Then there's the notion that government will run health care better than the private sector. All one has to do is look at the often inferior "care" offered by the Veterans Administration to see this as a bogus argument.
Perhaps the best line I have heard on the subject is from our 30th president. Calvin Coolidge: "Don't expect to build up the weak by pulling down the strong."
Much of this is driven by our modern education system in which some professors teach theories of economics, along with envy, greed and entitlement, that are the opposite of what once was called the Puritan ethic, an ethic of personal responsibility and accountability with government as last resort. This belief helped build and sustain America through many economic and societal challenges.
Instead of celebrating and promoting the greatness of America, liberals and socialists spend their time denigrating the country and apologizing for its success. Instead of encouraging the poor and middle class to make decisions and adopt attitudes that will enhance their chances for success, they promote the belief that the rich and successful achieved by robbing others.
If America becomes a socialist nation it will be difficult to go back, even when the mistake is realized. The time to stop it is now, or more precisely with a decisive defeat of socialism in the next election.

U.N. Requests A Record High In Aid Funding

Texto completo: Citing wars and the effects of climate change that have produced a flood of refugees, the agency is seeking nearly $ 30 billion for humanitarian relief in 2020.
GENEVA -- The United Nations appealed on Wednesday for nearly $ 30 billion for humanitarian relief operations in 2020 to aid people whose lives are disrupted by armed conflicts, economic desperation and the effects of climate change.
As many as 168 million people may require aid in 2020, Mark Lowcock, the United Nations aid coordinator said. That would be the largest number of people in need of humanitarian relief since World War II, Mr. Lowcock said as he launched an appeal to finance relief operations next year.
Providing relief is not only more expensive than ever, but it is also more dangerous for those providing the aid. In the first nine months of this year, 171 people working at health centers and medical facilities were killed, Mr. Lowcock said, compared with 131 aid workers who were killed in all of 2018.
The request by Mr. Lowcock's agency, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, is about $ 1.5 billion more than it requested a year ago.
As a barometer of the world's humanitarian crises, the annual appeal underscored the inability of powerful nations in the deeply polarized United Nations Security Council to curb long-running conflicts or to confront climate-related disasters.
The unfolding crisis in Venezuela accounts for the sharpest increase in anticipated humanitarian aid costs, the United Nations said, most of it to be earmarked for assistance to the 4.5 million Venezuelans who have fled the country.
About half of the total aid requested for 2020 is being budgeted for just three countries afflicted by ruinous wars that have dragged on for years. Yemen remains the site of the world's most disastrous humanitarian crisis, despite some easing of the conflict in recent months. The agency estimates that 24 million people in Yemen will continue to need the assistance of aid agencies to battle acute hunger and outbreaks of disease.
Syria is another of the international trouble spots that will continue to require major investments in aid next year, according to the United Nations. After nine years of civil war, more than five million Syrian refugees have fled the country and an additional six million people have been displaced inside Syria.
The Democratic Republic of Congo is the third nation that will require major relief efforts. Armed groups that attacked health workers fighting an Ebola epidemic provide a glimpse of the violence that has driven more than five million people from their homes.

A Venezuelan exodus to escape economic desperation at home is a big reason for a record humanitarian aid request by the United Nations to donor countries.

Texto completo: Si te encantan las papas fritas, quizás deberás aguantar tu antojo en los próximos días, pues existe la posibilidad de que haya escasez de este alimento debido a que las temperaturas frías y otras malas condiciones climáticas han arruinado los cultivos de papas en Idaho, Alberta, Dakota del Norte y Minnesota , de donde sacan la mayoría de las papas, según reporta Thrillist.
El problema fue que los agricultores tuvieron que desechar muchas papas –las cuales pueden tardar hasta 100 días en crecer– debido a que se dañaron por el frío.
“La demanda de papas fritas ha sido excepcional últimamente, por lo que los suministros no pueden satisfacer la demanda”, dijo Travis Blacker, director de relaciones industriales de la Comisión de la Papa de Idaho. Debido a esto, se sospecha que el precio de las papas se disparará, especialmente para las variedades más grandes , que son las que se usan para hacer las famosas papas fritas.
Por otro lado, aunque hay muchos que piensan que podríamos estar al borde de un apocalipsis de papas fritas, hay otros expertos que aseguran que no hay nada de qué preocuparse, ya que las cadenas de restaurantes que sirven este platillo pueden encontrar otras formas de satisfacer la demanda .
“No te preocupes por las papas fritas”, dijo Frank Muir, presidente de la Comisión de Papa de Idaho, al The New York Times. “Todavía puedes salir y ordenarlas como lo haces normalmente”.
Y es que hay que recordar que los tres mayores productores de papa del mundo son China, India y Rusia, por lo que podrían surtir al mercado estadounidense en caso de que se necesitara.
Además, las compañías que ofrecen papas fritas tienen la capacidad de congelar su inventario actual por un largo período de tiempo para satisfacer la demanda de sus clientes.
Así que, aunque hay cierto peligro de que se presente una escasez de este producto, las compañías han manejado la situación bien, de manera que podemos seguir disfrutándolo… hasta el momento.

Kamala Harris quits presidential race — what it means for California

Texto completo: California Sen. Kamala Harris seemed all but destined to be a front-runner when she launched her Democratic presidential campaign before a cheering throng of 20,000 supporters in downtown Oakland last January. A prosecutor to take down Trump, a black woman in a party disproportionately made up of black women, a U.S. Senator from the country’s largest state — on paper, she looked formidable.
This was before former Vice President Joe Biden entered the race. Before Mayor Pete and Elizabeth Warren rocketed to the top tier. Before Harris proclaimed that she was “moving to Iowa” (expletive deleted) and before the campaign adopted and then discarded a handful of ill fitting slogans (“Dude gotta go.”) Before the campaign’s internal drama found its way into Politico and The New York Times, which last week headlined its story “How Kamala Harris’s campaign unraveled.”
This morning, Harris announced that she was throwing in the towel, leaving a field of 15 Democratic candidates — many of whom are still polling below her. Her “political pragmatist” label failed to resonate with the mood of her party’s electorate, and calling herself a “progressive prosecutor” served to dredge up questions about just how progressive she really was as San Francisco’s district attorney or California’s attorney general.
But according to Harris, it simply came down to money.
“I’m not a billionaire. I can’t fund my own campaign. And as the campaign has gone on, it’s become harder and harder to raise the money we need to compete,” she said in a press release this morning — a final dig at Tom Steyer, Michael Bloomberg and John Delaney, three billionaires who remain in the field.
Harris’ decision to drop out two months before the Iowa Caucus isn’t just a national story. It’s also a California one. Her Senate term extends through 2022, assuming she isn’t tapped for a vice presidential slot or potential Cabinet position in a Democratic presidential administration. It’s unclear how appealing that would be to her; what is clear is that she is ambitious and has plenty of years to try for higher office again. Here’s what else the end of her 2020 bid means for the Golden State:
Our votes, cash and endorsements now up for grabs
If polls are anything to go by, Harris’ sudden departure from the race is probably good news for Warren, senator from Massachusetts.
A recent Capitol Weekly poll of likely Democratic voters in California showed 45% of Harris supporters back Warren as their second choice. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg took another 16% and 13%, respectively.
But the race is still so “neck and neck and neck,” said Paul Mitchell of Political Data Inc., who conducted the poll, that the distribution of Harris’ relatively small share of the electorate in California isn’t likely to crown any one candidate the clear frontrunner. It could provide a bit of leverage for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has prioritized vote mobilization in California and now boasts 80 in-state staffers, as well as Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York who is skipping the early states entirely and instead plowing millions of dollars in advertising into California and other states that vote on March 3.
Where Harris had a more commanding presence in her home state was in endorsements and big money fundraising.
Despite months of lackluster polling, Harris was still the top beneficiary of large dollar donors (those who give more than $200 per year) in California this year. In 2019, according to the most recently available filings, she raised more than $11.5 million from the Golden State’s donor class.
The runner-up for California’s Democratic dollars thus far? Buttigieg.
California donors played a major role in the campaign this year precisely because “they didn’t coalesce around Harris as a favorite daughter and instead provided millions to keep other candidates viable,” said Rose Kapolczynski, a Democratic political consultant.
Harris also earned most of the state’s high profile endorsements — including Gov. Gavin Newsom, Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon and President Pro Tem Toni Atkins. Just yesterday, Newsom’s office had announced that he would jet to Iowa in mid-December to campaign on behalf of Harris; the two former San Franciscans have been described as political siblings. As for what his next move might be, the governor has not responded to requests for comment. He did tweet props to Harris:
Bob Mulholland, a Democratic National Committee delegate from Chico who had endorsed Harris, said he did not expect the freed-up endorsees to consolidate around one candidate. Untethered from Harris, there is no consensus second choice, he said. “Many will hold off to determine if anyone else is dropping out.”
So much for the California effect?
When state lawmakers decided to bump up California’s primary election to March 3, it was with the hope that the nation’s largest state would play a more decisive role in choosing presidential nominees.
March may not have been early enough to help Harris, said Corey Cook, a political scientist at St. Mary’s College.
“The thing that people didn’t understand is that with so many candidates in the field, the pre-primary was going to be so grueling that it would winnow the field a lot sooner,” he said. “My sense is that we’re going to see a few more candidates drop out before the end of the year.”
It’s not clear that an early vote from California would have helped Harris much anyway. Despite being the junior senator of the state, she was floundering in the low double digits here — only a few points higher than her polling in other states. According to a new survey that the Institute of Governmental Studies conducted for The Los Angeles Times, 61% of California’s likely Democratic primary voters felt that Harris should drop out.
That isn’t to say that Harris would have had no chance had she been able to hold out a bit longer, said Political Data’s Mitchell.
“In a 16-way race” polling in the high single digits “isn’t the end of the world,” said Mitchell. “I think it’s unfortunate for her and her backers that the money wasn’t there.”
Presidential candidates have until December 26 to remove their names from consideration on the California primary ballot.
Critics — both outside and inside the Harris operation — have blamed the campaign’s leadership for poor financial management. But Christine Pelosi, chair of the California Democratic Party Women’s Caucus, said critical coverage of the Harris campaign and its inability to raise enough money was in part the result of “sexism” and “misogynoir” (misogyny aimed at black women).
Reporters were writing “post-mortems before there was even a mortem,” she said. “The money was just absolutely insurmountable and you can’t raise it if people come to assume that you can’t raise it. It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.”
It’s not a coincidence, said Pelosi, that the six remaining candidates who have qualified for the Dec. 19 debate in Los Angeles — Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar and California’s Tom Steyer — are all white.
Thus, another sign that California’s impact on the primary process seems to have come up short. Regardless of California’s majority-minority population, the top tier of the Democratic candidates still looks an awful lot like Iowa and New Hampshire.
Harris’ California record did her no favors
Despite her final campaign slogan of putting “justice on the ballot,” Harris never quite figured out how to convey her record as a prosecutor in California.
Just as soon as she announced her bid for the White House, she began taking flack from criminal justice advocates on the left. That began with a New York Times opinion piece by the University of San Francisco law professor Lara Bazelon — and it never really let up.
In an August CNN debate, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard lit into Harris for her record prosecuting marijuana-related crimes, for her office’s failure to share exculpatory evidence in a handful of cases and for her defense of cash bail. Caught between two unenviable defenses of her past prosecutorial decisions — either she made those choices or she was not aware of what was happening in her own office — Harris did not address the criticisms directly.
Today President Donald Trump’s campaign wasted no time in posting kudos to outlier Gabbard, at the expense of Harris:
Nonetheless, Harris’ record was full of such choices that, whatever the motivation at the time, did not endear her to some Democratic voters. As CalMatters reported for the first time in September, Harris’ office decided to prosecute a mentally ill woman for assaulting police officers — after she was shot by those officers.
Her fate may reflect just how far the electorate has shifted on criminal justice issues in the decade and a half since Harris’ first campaign. Or it could reflect the fact that despite California’s liberal reputation, the strategy needed to successfully run for attorney general in California, which may require appeasing crime-minded moderates and police unions, is still very different from what’s needed to secure a Democratic presidential nomination.
A dismal day for California consulting royalty
This was a rare loss for Ace Smith and his team of Bay Area political consultants at SCRB Strategies, who have a long track record of winning state and local races in California. They’ve helped put both Govs. Jerry Brown and Newsom in Sacramento and Harris in the U.S. Senate.
The latest setback was a particularly public one. In articles in both Politico and The New York Times, Juan Rodriguez, SCRB partner and Harris’ campaign manager, was blamed by unnamed sources within the campaign for running a dysfunctional operation.
It’s also been a bad day for People Standing Strong, a California-based super PAC run by Newsom-affiliated political consultants Dan Newman and Brian Brokaw. The group was all set to begin rolling out a $1 million advertising campaign across Iowa when news of Harris’ decision broke.
“It was fairly abrupt,” said Brokaw, adding that he learned that his new ad would not be aired after all “when literally every reporter starting calling me at the same time” this morning.

Here's what Peloton had to say about the viral reaction to its 'Grace in Boston' ad

Texto completo: It was the commercial seemingly seen 'round the world this week: A Peloton ad in which a man gives his wife one of the brand's exercise bikes for Christmas — which she uses constantly, showing her gratitude a year later with a spliced-together home movie of cellphone video clips of her on the machine.
At one point, the instructor on the screen can be heard saying, “Let's go, Grace in Boston," to which the woman exclaims, “She just said my name!"
Reaction to the commercial was at once widespread and visceral, as some criticized the ad for being sexist and demeaning, as the husband gives his already-fit partner a means to lose more weight.
The online outrage Tuesday also drove down Peloton shares as much as 10 percent, and prompted calls for the company to pull the commercial, according to Bloomberg News. The company started Tuesday at $35.70 and ended the day at $33.48, according to MarketWatch. (The company's stock as of 12:30 p.m. Wednesday afternoon had fallen to $32.16.)
However, Peloton officials seemed to be standing by the controversial commercial, telling the Globe in an e-mail that they were “disappointed in how some have misinterpreted this commercial."
“We constantly hear from our members how their lives have been meaningfully and positively impacted after purchasing or being gifted a Peloton Bike or Tread, often in ways that surprise them," a statement from the company said.
“Our holiday spot was created to celebrate that fitness and wellness journey. While we're disappointed in how some have misinterpreted this commercial, we are encouraged by — and grateful for — the outpouring of support we've received from those who understand what we were trying to communicate."
A representative did not respond to questions as to why the ad was specifically set in Boston. (Peloton does have several showrooms in Eastern Massachusetts, including at the Prudential Center, and recently promoted its product at a Patriots game at Gillette Stadium.)
A Peloton representative also attached several images from customers touting their support.
In one, a woman named Heather Haworth posted a lengthy Facebook entry defending the ad: “When I see that ad, I see a woman who is lovingly gifted a Peloton bike because it is something just for her."
Haworth continued that the ad resonated with her, a working mom who tries to juggle all aspects of her life, because she sees “a professional woman with little time for herself who becomes surprised that she can find a small amount of time for herself to work out."
At the end of her post, Haworth writes: “I see a woman who, at the end of the year, is surprised and thankful for the gift that is Peloton, the community and the accomplishment that she achieved to be **healthier** both physically and mentally. I did not ever see an already slender woman who wanted to lose weight. I love this ad, because, in it, I see me. #iamthepelotonwoman"
Haworth's Facebook account appears to be private; she did not respond to a Globe inquiry early Wednesday afternoon.
Peloton also shared three e-mails to the press account defending the ad. In one, a woman named Melissa said that a Peloton bike got her sister-in-law through a rough bout of chemotherapy after being diagnosed with breast cancer, adding, “I hope when your company has future ads, they will consider showing this side of your product."
Another cheery e-mail from a woman named Ally said she perceived the ad as “a thoughtful commercial," noting, “the first time I saw it I thought, 'that was a sweetly portrayed ad.' "
“I'm sorry for any and all of the negativity that has been spread because of this holiday marketing ad. I'm sure Peloton has an awesome, hard working, and skilled team of marketers — I hope they keep their heads up!"
In the third e-mail, a man named Richard described people who were “hating the ad" as “ridiculous."
Meanwhile, other Peloton customers are also making their opinions known on social media. Jessica Tysor used many of Haworth's words in a post she uploaded, adding, “I'm so sick and tired of everyone being so offended by everything these days."
In an e-mail to the Globe, Tysor, a mom who currently lives on the Oregon coast, said that the ad and the controversy around it has led to much discussion in her Peloton moms' Facebook group.
“Honestly, the ad resonated so much with me and her post reflected so much of my own journey; especially the guilt around prioritizing my time over my [family's]," Tysor told the Globe, calling her Peloton purchase one of the best ever made, adding that her husband and oldest child also use the bike.
Mekanism, an ad agency that touts Peloton as a client on its website, did not respond to a Globe e-mail for comment. A representative who eventually picked up the phone at the agency's New York office said the firm was not taking calls in regards to the ad and advised a reporter to try back in a few days. Further questions were met with a decline to comment.

Texto completo: The 300-page report lays out Democrats' case that President Trump abused the power of his office to solicit political help from a foreign power and obstructed the inquiry into his actions.
WASHINGTON -- The House Intelligence Committee released a 300-page impeachment report on Tuesday accusing President Trump of trying to enlist Ukraine to help him in the 2020 presidential election and obstructing the congressional inquiry by trying to cover it up.
The committee released the report on the eve of a public hearing in the House Judiciary Committee as the panel begins considering whether to draft articles of impeachment that could lead to a Senate trial and Mr. Trump's removal from office.
Here are five takeaways from the report.
The president leveraged Ukraine's military aid and a White House meeting for political investigations.
The "Trump-Ukraine Impeachment Inquiry Report" was a sweeping indictment of Mr. Trump's behavior, concluding that the president orchestrated a "scheme" to pressure Ukraine to announce investigations into former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and other Democrats, while withholding nearly $ 400 million in military assistance and a White House meeting.
The report, written in narrative form, laid out the testimony of witnesses who came before the panel in public and private. It asserts that the president's actions "subverted U.S. foreign policy toward Ukraine and undermined our national security in favor of two politically motivated investigations that would help his presidential re-election campaign."
Trump 'ordered and implemented' a campaign to conceal his conduct from the public and Congress.
The report accuses Mr. Trump of what it calls an "unprecedented campaign of obstruction of this impeachment inquiry," saying he denied documents to Congress and tried to block State Department diplomats and White House officials from testifying.
The president's categorical refusal to cooperate with the investigation or comply with demands for documents violated the law, the report said. It accused the president of engaging in "a brazen effort to publicly attack and intimidate" witnesses.
"The damage to our system of checks and balances, and to the balance of power within our three branches of government, will be long-lasting and potentially irrevocable if the president's ability to stonewall Congress goes unchecked," the report concluded.
The report is a road map to the president's possible impeachment and removal from office.
The report stopped short of explicitly calling for the president's impeachment and removal from office. But Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, made it clear he viewed the document as a road map to impeachment for the House.
"The founding fathers prescribed a remedy for a chief executive who places his personal interests above those of the country: impeachment," the report said.
Mr. Schiff, in a preface to the report, warned that the clash between the two parties about Mr. Trump's actions reflects the kind of factionalism that the country's founders believed would be dangerous to the republic.
"Today, we may be witnessing a collision between the power of a remedy meant to curb presidential misconduct and the power of faction determined to defend against the use of that remedy on a president of the same party," Mr. Schiff wrote.
New evidence emerges of calls between Giuliani and others about a smear campaign on an ambassador.
The report largely recounts information already made public during testimony from administration officials. But it also indicated that Democrats have collected more raw evidence than previously known, including call records produced by AT&T and Verizon showing a series of phone calls between Mr. Trump's personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani and his associates and several government officials.
The calls came as Mr. Giuliani was executing a smear campaign against the American ambassador to Ukraine at the time, Marie L. Yovanovitch, and pressing Ukraine to begin investigations that would benefit Mr. Trump. The records show calls between Mr. Giuliani and others, including Representative Devin Nunes of California, the top Republican on the Intelligence Committee.
Speaking with reporters on Tuesday, Mr. Schiff said that the call records showed "considerable coordination among the parties, including the White House -- coordination in the smear campaign against Ambassador Yovanovitch."
Mr. Schiff declined to say whether he believed Mr. Nunes should recuse himself from the remainder of the inquiry, but suggested the records were not flattering.
"It is deeply concerning that at a time that the president of the United States was using the power of his office to dig up dirt on a political rival that there may be evidence that there were members of Congress complicit in that activity," he said.
Report prompts new phase in impeachment inquiry as Judiciary Committee considers articles of impeachment.
The release of the report largely concludes the investigation by the Intelligence Committee and moves the impeachment inquiry into a new phase led by the House Judiciary Committee, which plans to hold its first hearing on Wednesday.
That hearing will include four legal scholars for a discussion about the constitutional standards for impeachment. Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York and the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, has said the hearing will also focus on whether Mr. Trump's behavior rises to the level of those standards.
A second hearing is expected to provide a forum for Intelligence Committee lawyers to formally present their report to the Judiciary Committee members. And a third hearing could offer Mr. Trump or his lawyers the opportunity to defend himself, though the White House counsel has so far indicated that he is unlikely to take part in what they deem an unfair process.
If a majority of the House voted to approve articles of impeachment, which would be drafted by the Judiciary Committee, the president would be impeached. The proceedings would move to the Senate for a trial. Two-thirds of senators would have to vote to convict Mr. Trump to end his presidency.

Texto completo: The Norsemen (and women) are back for a new season. And the coming-of-age classic starring Matt Damon and Ben Affleck is available to stream on Starz.
What's on TV
VIKINGS 9 p.m. on History. Bjorn Ironside's ambitions and struggles as the king of Kattegat continue in a new season of "Vikings." In the two-hour-long first episode, Bjorn (Alexander Ludwig) finds difficulty in trusting his mother, Lagertha (Katheryn Winnick), while Ivar (Alex Hogh Andersen) is put to the test by the ruthless Prince Oleg (Danila Kozlovsky). Mike Hale wrote in his review for The New York Times that the series benefits from the modesty "Game of Thrones" lacks. "'Vikings' was admirably focused and engaging, its story easy to follow and its requisite elements of family soap opera and philosophizing relatively restrained," he wrote.
AMERICAN WOMAN (2019) 6 p.m. on HBO. After her teenage daughter goes missing, Deb -- a single mother in rural Pennsylvania played by Sienna Miller -- attempts to pick up the pieces. With the help of her sister, Katherine (Christina Hendricks), and her mother, Peggy (Amy Madigan), Deb raises her grandson and navigates the challenging relationships she is left with. This film, directed by Jake Scott and written by Brad Ingelsby, is a "character study" of the working class, Glenn Kenny wrote in his review for The Times, adding that "the performances are excellent, and Ingelsby's dialogue largely rings true." "American Woman" will be available for streaming on HBO Thursday.
What's streaming
GOOD WILL HUNTING (1997) Stream on Starz; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. The 1998 winner of two Academy Awards, "Good Will Hunting" has become a classic. The film's title character, Will Hunting (Matt Damon), is an unacknowledged genius -- with a legal charge against him -- working as a janitor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. When he solves a near-impossible-to-solve math problem left on a chalkboard, a professor (Stellan Skarsgard) gives him a real "Get Out of Jail Free" card on one condition: he see a therapist. Sean McGuire (Robin Williams), the only psychiatrist who can handle Will's antics, and Will's friends, played by Ben and Casey Affleck and Cole Hauser, work with him to bring out his brilliance. "The script's bare bones are familiar," Janet Maslin wrote in her review for The Times, "yet the film also has fine acting, steady momentum, a sharp eye and a very warm heart."
MALCOLM X (1992) Stream on Netflix; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. "In the film's view, a god has been recognized, then lost," Vincent Canby wrote of "Malcolm X" in his review for The Times. Based on the autobiography of Malcolm X published the year he was killed, this Spike Lee movie tackles his life, with Malcolm X (Denzel Washington) arriving in 1940s Boston from Michigan as a teenager. The telling of his life unfolds, with his evolution from a rising Nation of Islam member to the black liberation movement's spokesman. "Malcolm X" earned Lee an Oscar nomination for his depiction of this visionary.

My Danish Immigration Nightmare

Texto completo: I had become a full professor and a best-selling author. Weeks later, Denmark charged me with violating my work and residence permit.
The call came on a Friday. When it came, I thought my boss was going to congratulate me for winning a research prize just announced that morning. Instead, she told me I would be contacted shortly by the Danish police; the university had just learned I was facing criminal charges for violating my work and residence permit.
My crime: giving lectures on my academic research to the Danish Parliament and to government agencies, at their request. That year, 2017, I had given five such lectures, a task normally considered an obligation, and an honor for a professor like me. Yet each had been declared a crime because I was an immigrant from a non-European Union country.
And that is how, weeks after being promoted to full professor and having a book on the Danish best-seller list, I ended up cowering in the middle of my kitchen with my 7-year-old son, hoping that the two police officers pounding on the door of our Copenhagen apartment would not see us. I was terrified they would take me away to prison and send him to foster care.
A month before, I'd been on top of the world and ready to apply for permanent residence in Denmark, the country that had been my home for nearly eight years. There was so much I loved about the Danes, and still do; their system of research support and early childhood education for my son allowed me to do the innovative research on tax havens that led to the book and the findings I'd been invited to share with Parliament. Then suddenly, all because I had the wrong passport, I was at risk of losing my career and my life savings in a court fight.
For me, the story had a happy ending, but not so much for Denmark. When the account of my prosecution was plastered across the front pages of European newspapers, Denmark not only embarrassed itself internationally but also sabotaged its own economy and undermined its own longstanding development efforts.
Nearly everyone, from the prime minister who warned in an op-ed about overzealous immigration policy to government officials who tweeted about my case to the Danish police officer who read the charges against me over the phone, expressed regret about the absurdity of the prosecution. It was a debacle, both politically and economically, and that is the lesson of my story: Anti-immigrant, ethnonationalist policies are acts of self-destruction, not self-preservation. And nowhere is this more true than in countries like Denmark and the United States, which compete in the world economy based on brainpower and innovation.
Long before the Trump administration, the populist Danish People's Party formed a bloc in Parliament in the early 2000s and influenced a shift in the laws of a country formerly known for its warm welcome to outsiders. The party didn't want to just eliminate immigration; it sought to return Denmark to an imaginary past of racial and ethnic "purity." As the party platform states: "Denmark is not an immigrant country and never has been. Thus we will not accept transformation to a multiethnic society."
This is more or less what Mr. Trump's immigration adviser, Stephen Miller, wants for the United States, which is why it is important for Americans to understand where such policies lead.
Performative xenophobia was so popular politically that one immigration minister put a counter on the ministry's website to show the public that her regime had tightened the laws restricting foreigners over 100 times in her four-year tenure. Changing the immigration rules an average of more than twice a month for four years meant that nobody could keep up. Even the Danish universities and the minister of education apparently didn't know about the law forbidding professors from outside the European Union to give guest lectures. It didn't matter, because this legal strategy had just one purpose: to create pretexts for deporting non-Europeans, or to make them feel unwelcome enough that they would leave Denmark.
It worked like a charm, though at a huge cost, both to the targeted foreigners and to the country rejecting them. For example, the Danish state spent thousands of kroner (a krone is worth about 15 cents) prosecuting the respected Colombian economist Jimmy Martínez-Correa, a professor at the Copenhagen Business School, on the same charges leveled against me; he was acquitted 18 months later. Rachel Bullen, an Australian oboist prosecuted for the crime of playing guest sets with Danish orchestras, was not so lucky: She was convicted and left Denmark with her career in tatters; with a criminal record, she found it hard to get work even in her native country.
I don't know what became of the other non-Europeans (about a dozen) who were charged at the same time as I was; some contacted me privately, saying they were so fearful of the xenophobia whipped up in the Danish public sphere that they dare not speak to the media.
As the story of my case spread, Danish government officials tried to do damage control, taking to mass media and Twitter to say that Denmark would never want to discourage immigrants from sharing their skills and knowledge. But it was already too late: Denmark started to lose things it cared about.
Most notable, it may have contributed to the loss of the jobs and prestige that would have come with the relocation to Copenhagen of the European Medicines Agency, a European Union office that tested pharmaceuticals. The Danish government had spent months and millions of kroner wooing the agency, which had decided to move from London to the Continent after the Brexit decision. But the publicity surrounding the charges I faced may have spooked the agency's multinational staff members.
For me, the nightmare ended after eight months; Denmark changed its laws so that the charges against me were dropped. I was more fortunate than Ms. Bullen in escaping the lifetime stigma of criminal conviction; but like her, I returned to my native country determined to warn of what we stand to lose in continuing down the path set by ultranationalist policymakers.
I saw that the hatred of others is contagious and inevitably spreads to the people a country most needs to survive, whether they be farm laborers or physicians. This ultimately comes into conflict with the country's economy and its aspirations.
The humanitarian disaster of the Trump administration's treatment of migrants has already been documented in gut-wrenching detail. Less recognized, however, is the destruction such policies wreak on the society, economy and long-term development of countries that attempt to rid themselves of immigrants.
The kind of xenophobia that afflicted Denmark appeared last month, during impeachment hearings, in commentary questioning the loyalty of public servants like Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman and Fiona Hill because they are immigrants. Their contributions -- including a willingness to risk death in the name of duty -- don't matter to their critics, who saw and heard only one thing: not one of us.
On top of the staggering moral failure this represents -- alongside the Muslim travel ban and the horrors of caged Central American children -- this is just unfathomably self-defeating. Immigrants helped Americans win World War II and put Americans on the moon; immigrants built the global tech dominance of the Silicon Valley and enabled the United States to win more Nobel Prizes than any other country.
They literally made America great. Don't let anyone destroy that legacy for a poisoned dream of purity.

President Trump’s reversal on vaping the right call for public health

Texto completo: Annie Karni, Maggie Haberman, and Sheila Kaplan of the New York Times describe US president Donald Trump’s proposed ban on flavored e-cigarette products as “a swift and bold reaction to a growing public health crisis affecting teenagers” that Trump backed away from “under pressure from his political advisers and lobbyists to factor in the potential pushback from his supporters.”
Maybe they’re right about Trump’s motivations, but they’re wrong about pretty much everything else.
E-cigarettes are not a “public health crisis.” That supposed crisis is not “growing.” And to the extent that teenagers are negatively affected by e-cigarettes, the very “bold reactions” the three writers seem to favor are far more culpable than e-cigarettes themselves.
E-cigarettes are, according to all credible evidence, safer than burning sticks of tobacco — sorry, FDA, you don’t get to tell me I can’t say so.
A few cases of lung injury from black market “street vapes” have been reported, the cause (use of vitamin E in the “juice”) seems to have been identified, and that problem is already disappearing in the rear-view mirror.
Who buys “street vapes?” People who can’t buy the e-cigarette products they want legally, either because of content (cannabis) or age (the teenagers the Times authors imply they care about so much).
Banning flavored e-cigarette products wouldn’t stop teenagers, or anyone else, from getting flavored e-cigarette products. It would just send even more of them to the “street vape” market for those products.
If Trump reconsidered his proposed ban due to political pressure and the desire to be re-elected, so what? A good decision is a good decision.
President Franklin Delano Roosevelt once told a group of lobbyists, who were pushing a policy change at him, “Okay, you’ve convinced me. Now go out and bring pressure on me.”
That’s how politics works. Politicians appease voters and activist groups who can help or harm their careers. Sometimes that works out well for the public, sometimes it works out badly.
In this case it works out well — certainly for the public, and possibly for Trump. Much of the “I Vape and I Vote” demographic presumably falls outside his existing electoral “base,” and for at least some the issue matters enough to swing their votes.
Now Trump’s Democratic opponents need to decide which they value more: Their desire to run everyone’s lives at the expense of actual public health, or public health and those votes.

Texto completo: ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they’re published.
Just days after he took office in 2017, President Donald Trump set out to make good on his campaign pledge to halt illegal immigration. In a pair of executive orders, he ordered “all legally available resources” to be shifted to border detention facilities and called for hiring 10,000 new immigration officers.
The logistical challenges were daunting, but as luck would have it, Immigration and Customs Enforcement already had a partner on its payroll: McKinsey & Company, an international consulting firm brought on under the Obama administration to help engineer an “organizational transformation” in the ICE division charged with deporting migrants who are in the United States unlawfully.
ICE quickly redirected McKinsey toward helping the agency figure out how to execute the White House’s clampdown on illegal immigration.
But the money-saving recommendations the consultants came up with made some career ICE staff uncomfortable. They proposed cuts in spending on food for migrants, as well as on medical care and supervision of detainees, according to interviews with people who worked on the project for both ICE and McKinsey and 1,500 pages of documents obtained from the agency after ProPublica filed a lawsuit under the Freedom of Information Act.
McKinsey’s team also looked for ways to accelerate the deportation process, provoking worries among some ICE staff members that the recommendations risked short-circuiting due process protections for migrants fighting removal from the United States. The consultants, three people who worked on the project said, seemed focused solely on cutting costs and speeding up deportations — activities whose success could be measured in numbers — with little acknowledgment that these policies affected thousands of human beings.
In what one former official described as “heated meetings” with McKinsey consultants, agency staff members questioned whether saving pennies on food and medical care for detainees justified the potential human cost.
But the consulting firm’s sway at ICE grew to the point that McKinsey’s staff even ghostwrote a government contracting document that defined the consulting team’s own responsibilities and justified the firm’s retention, a contract extension worth $2.2 million. “Can they do that?” an ICE official wrote to a contracting officer in May 2017.
The response reflects how deeply ICE had come to rely on McKinsey’s assistance. “Well it obviously isn’t ideal to have a contractor tell us what we want to ask them to do,” the contracting officer replied. But unless someone from the government could articulate the agency’s objectives, the officer added, “what other option is there?” ICE extended the contract.
The New York Times reported last year that McKinsey ultimately did more than $20 million in consulting work for ICE, a commitment to one of the Trump administration’s most controversial endeavors that raised concerns among some of McKinsey’s employees and former partners. The firm’s global managing partner, Kevin Sneader, assured them in a 2018 email that the firm had never focused on developing, advising or implementing immigration policies. He said McKinsey “will not, under any circumstances, engage in work, anywhere in the world, that advances or assists policies that are at odds with our values.”
But the new documents and interviews reveal that the firm was deeply involved in executing policies fundamental to the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. McKinsey’s recommendations for spending cuts went too far for some career ICE employees, and a number of the proposals were never implemented.
McKinsey has faced mounting scrutiny over the past two years, as reports by The New York Times, ProPublica and others have raised questions about whether the firm has crossed ethical and legal lines in pursuit of profit. The consultancy returned millions of dollars in fees after South African authorities implicated it in a profiteering scheme. The exposure of its history advising opioid makers on ways to bolster sales induced the usually secretive firm to declare publicly that its opioid work had ended. Last month, the Times reported that McKinsey’s bankruptcy practice is the subject of a federal criminal investigation. The firm has denied wrongdoing in each case, but it apologized for missteps in South Africa.
“The scope of our work, contractually agreed to during the Obama administration, was designed to help the agency find ways to operate more effectively and cost-efficiently,” a McKinsey spokesman said of the firm’s consulting for ICE. “The focus of our work did not change as a result of these executive orders. The assertion that McKinsey’s work was ‘redirected’ because of these orders is inaccurate.”
In a statement, ICE spokesman Bryan D. Cox said McKinsey’s work “yielded measurable improvements in mission outcomes, including a notable decrease in the time to remove aliens with a final order of removal.”
McKinsey responded quickly to Trump’s executive orders on immigration. On Feb. 13, the consultants presented ICE officials a set of “initiatives to improve ICE Hiring and address the Executive Order,” according to an accompanying slide deck.
Hiring 10,000 immigration officers was an immense undertaking, and similar attempts to swiftly ramp up staffing, under the administrations of George W. Bush and Barack Obama, ended badly. They resulted in lax hiring standards, according to experts, and a subsequent spike in misconduct and corruption cases among Border Patrol officers.
To expedite the process in 2017, McKinsey proposed hiring en masse, including what the consultants called “super one-stop hiring”: ICE could rent a gymnasium or similar space and compress the recruitment, screening and hiring process into a single day. The consultants, they wrote in a slide deck, aimed “to reduce time to hire by 30-50% (hundreds of days)” — significantly improving ICE’s capability to staff the president’s immigration crackdown.
By the summer of 2017, according to contracting records and a former ICE official, the agency had begun to adopt McKinsey’s proposals to speed up hiring. (ICE has hired only a fraction of the 10,000 officers called for because of budget constraints.)
Within months, McKinsey was making significant strides toward advancing the Trump administration’s policy goals. The firm’s work showed “quantifiable benefits,” ICE officials stated in an October 2017 contracting document, “including increased total removals and reductions in time to remove a detainee.”
As some McKinsey consultants worked on the staffing challenge, others took aim at the logistical hurdles posed by an expected influx of detainees flowing from the Trump administration’s directive to enforce immigration laws more strictly.
The consulting team became so driven to save money, people involved in the project said, that consultants sometimes ignored — and even complained to agency managers about — ICE staffers who objected that McKinsey’s cost-cutting proposals risked jeopardizing the health and safety of migrants.
Cox, the ICE spokesman, denied that McKinsey’s recommendations could harm the well-being or due process rights of detainees. McKinsey’s spokesman said the firm’s work aimed to identify where detention center contractors were overcharging ICE — long a concern of watchdog agencies — and to propose remedies.
McKinsey, the firm’s presentations show, pursued “detention savings opportunities” in blunt ways. The consultants encouraged ICE to adopt a “longer-term strategy” with “operational decisions to fill low cost beds before expensive beds.” In practice, that meant shunting detainees to less expensive — and sometimes less safe — facilities, often rural county jails.
“There’s a concerted effort to try to ship folks ICE sees as long-term detainees to these low-cost facilities run by local sheriffs’ offices where conditions are abysmal,” said Eunice Cho, a senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union who focuses on issues involving the detention of immigrants. (The ACLU has brought several lawsuits against ICE, including over its detention policies, during the Trump administration.)
McKinsey also looked to cut costs by lowering standards at ICE detention facilities, according to an internal ICE email and two former agency officials. McKinsey, an ICE supervisor wrote in an email dated March 30, 2017, was “looking for ways to cut or reduce standards because they are too costly,” albeit, the supervisor added, “without sacrificing quality, safety and mission.”
The consultants found it difficult to attach a dollar figure to the standards themselves, the former ICE officials said. So they shifted their focus to trimming operating costs at several detention centers and coaching agency officials as they renegotiated contracts with companies managing some of those facilities. The renegotiated contracts saved ICE $16 million, according to Cox, the ICE spokesman, who insisted that no “degradation to service” resulted.
One of Trump’s executive orders had directed immigration agencies to concentrate resources near the southern border, and the consultants prioritized slashing costs at those facilities.
The McKinsey proposals that most troubled agency staffers — like cutting spending on food, medical care and maintenance — were not incorporated into the new contracts, one former ICE official said. Internal project emails point to cutbacks in guard staffing as the source of most cost savings.

Jane Larwick of Larwick Christmas Tree Farm puts the finishing touches on a tree used for customer photo ops. She enjoys decorating, though must make everything child-proof. “I have to attach everything to the tree because little people will come and pick everything off. That's why (we don't use) bulbs because children will take the bulbs off and they will break. Everything we do out here has to be 100 percent child-proof,” she said.
Jane Larwick puts the finishing touches on a tree used for customer photo ops.
Jane Larwick enjoys her Santa shops more than the tree farming. “Her shop is usually all her. She's got two Santa shops here, she loves that. Matter of fact I don't think she really cares if she sells Christmas trees or not. The only reason she does Christmas trees with me is so she can do her Santa shops. That's her love,” said her husband, Loran La
BRUSH PRAIRIE — On a recent weekday the week before Thanksgiving, Christmas music was already blaring over the loudspeakers at Larwick Christmas Tree Farm.
While tunes like “Joy to the World” and “Baby it's Cold Outside” played, Jane Larwick and husband, Loran, got busy getting their 20-acre Christmas tree farm ready for the impending crowds looking for the perfect — or maybe not-so-perfect — tree.
‘Sad tree'
Jane Larwick, who fancies decorating, pinpointed what she deemed to be an unsellable tree. After more than five years growing, the tree would be turned into a decorative prop for photo ops.
“This is a sad tree. I know it won't sell. It's lost its needles here. We cut it up over the years, and it's just not going to come back at all,” Larwick said. “But I can take the tree and throw (fake) snow on him, and I can decorate him, and he will be perfect.”
She and her husband, both 65, have owned the farm for 31 years. They opened the U-cut tree farm 25 years ago, they said.
Loran revved up his chain saw and cut the tree down. The two worked together to determine where to cut off the trunk, then Jane got to decorating.
“With Charlie Brown trees, you have to have imagination,” she said, decorating the tree with large pinecones she brought home from a trip to Lake Tahoe. “See, it looks kind of pretty now.”
She was referring to the popular 1965 TV special “A Charlie Brown Christmas,” in which Charlie Brown, frustrated with the holiday commercialism, decides to purchase a tiny, wilted tree to use as decoration in a Christmas play.
“The weird thing is, especially the last several years, we have people who will come and ask for a Charlie Brown tree. Everybody wants something different. So we have to be careful,” Loran said.
A long haul
For those peeved by Christmas decorations appearing in big-box stores as early as October, operating a Christmas tree farm would probably be a personal hell.
“It takes eight to 10 years to grow a tree to sell it. You're kind of in it for the long haul,” Loran said.
“Christmas for us starts the first part of November,” Jane said. “We have already ordered all of our seedlings for next year. We ordered those in March.”
The two operate the farm, which has approximately 18,000 trees in the ground, on their own — that is, until the weekends they open for business to the public. Then they wrangle in their family members, including their children, to help run the U-cut business.
“On the weekends, we have five guys and four girls (working) per day. I feed everybody. I start usually the first part of November, and I cook hamburger and ham, and roast beef and pulled pork,” Jane said as she pulled out wreaths that still needed bows. In addition to the trees, the farm sells wreaths. Jane also sells Christmas-themed knickknacks out of two sheds fashioned as “Santa shops.”
“I put bows on everything. All my bows are made. I whipped those out almost a month ago. I grab a wreath; I find what I consider to be the prettiest part of it. I'm a strange numbers person so everything I do is in fives. I do five of one color, five of another,” she said, tightening a bow.
“Her shop is usually all her. She's got two Santa shops here; she loves that. Matter of fact, I don't think she really cares if she sells Christmas trees or not. The only reason she does Christmas trees with me is so she can do her Santa shops. That's her love,” Loran said.
The wreaths sold used to be made from trimmings of trees at the farm, but the couple scaled back this year and are using wreaths from the Shelton area.
“We're cutting back all the time as we get older,” Loran said.
The business also isn't open as often as it used to be — but that's not necessarily by choice.
“We're probably going to cut it at between 1,200 to 1,500 trees (this year),” Jane said. “Unfortunately, this year, all of our advertising says we'll be closed Dec. 9.”
“We're hoping we can make it till then,” Loran said. “Last year a lot of farms closed early. There's a shortage, so what happens is, we'll get busier.”
The shortage in the Pacific Northwest, as the Columbian reported in 2018, is in large part because of the Great Recession.
The Larwicks expect to sell out of their Christmas tree stock very quickly, as more customers — including millennials who have apparently changed preference from artificial trees to real trees, according to the New York Times — flock to their U-cut farm.
“I think, it's Mom drags Dad out here and the kids and it could be muddy, and it could be wet and everybody loves to see Dad get down and cut the tree. And everybody goes ‘timber!' I think it's just people like to get out, they like to do things,” Jane said, of why people enjoy the U-cut experience. “Good Lord willin' and the river don't rise, we're going to do this as long as we possibly can.”

Number of employees: Two, Jane Larwick and her husband, Loran Larwick. They use their family as volunteers when their farm is open for customers.
Bureau of Labor Statistics job outlook: The bureau doesn't track Christmas tree farmers specifically. Employment of farmers, ranchers, and other agricultural managers is projected to show “little or no change” through 2028. “Over the past several decades, the efficiencies of large-scale crop production have led to the consolidation of acreage under fewer but larger farms,” the bureau reports. Regional data for wages of farmers isn't available, bu

Texto completo: A decision by the Federal Aviation Administration to control inspections of Boeing's 737 Max aircraft is necessary for restoring credibility to the U.S. regulatory system. Passengers, airlines and governments throughout the world must have confidence in that system in order for the iconic aerospace company to retain its standing in the industry.
Last week, FAA regulators informed Boeing executives that they will be in charge of ensuring that the 737 Max is worthy to fly. The plane has been grounded since March, following crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia that killed a total of 346 people.
“The FAA has determined that the public interest and safety in air commerce require that the FAA retain authority to issue airworthiness certificates and export certificates of airworthiness for all 737 Max airplanes,” FAA officials wrote in a letter to Boeing. “The FAA will retain such authority until the agency is confident that, at a minimum, Boeing has fully functional quality control and verification processes in place.”
In the short term, that is bad news for Boeing officials, who repeatedly have said they hope to have approval for the 737 Max by the end of the year. FAA oversight, which might mean inspections of each plane, will delay the return of the 737 Max.
But in the long run it is good news for restoring integrity to the U.S. aerospace industry and, therefore, Boeing. Following the crashes and the grounding of the plane, it was revealed that federal regulators gave the company excessive leeway in approving inspections of the aircraft. Whether or not that contributed to the crashes, it diminished the reputation of American manufacturing.
Boeing has continued producing the 737 Max, storing completed planes at airfields throughout the state. Meanwhile, the company has been working to fix the troublesome Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, which is believed to have played a role in the Indonesian and Ethiopian crashes. But the New York Times recently reported on emails from an official at Transport Canada Civil Aviation that questioned the fixes, referring to them as “a band-aid” and saying the MCAS adds “too much complexity.”
The FAA decision to retain authority over authorization of the 737 Max follows questioning from Congress regarding the issue. Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., has been among the most outspoken critics of a regulatory system that has been revealed to be too deferential to manufacturers.
Cantwell is pushing for hearings with FAA officials and is seeking legislation requiring that recommendations from the National Transportation Safety Board be implemented. Those recommendations include a thorough analysis of how pilots may respond to unexpected events when operating complex systems such as the MCAS.
Legislative changes are needed to ensure the safety and confidence of the public, both in the United States and abroad. And they are needed to help Boeing remain a reliable name in aviation.
That status is crucial to both the company and the rest of the state, with Boeing being an important economic engine and a symbol of Washington's technological expertise. Retaining that position requires that solutions be approached with caution and a focus on safety, even at the expense of expediency.
When shortcuts are taken, it creates vulnerabilities that endanger the entire system of airplane manufacturing and approval. Strict oversight from the FAA will demonstrate that the industry has learned valuabl

Clint Eastwood’s Richard Jewell highlights media malpractice

Texto completo: Some time after midnight on July 27, 1996, Richard Jewell was meandering through Centennial Olympic Park. Thousands of spectators had gathered for the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, and the 33-year-old security guard was patrolling the AT&T tower he had been told to observe. He wasn't hired to save lives, but he did.
When he pointed out a suspicious backpack to authorities, Jewell couldn’t have guessed what would happen next. While police were still evacuating bystanders, the 40-pound pipe bomb in the backpack exploded, leaving two dead and more than 100 others injured.
For two days, the man who discovered the bomb and prevented countless deaths was hailed as a hero. Then the Atlanta Journal-Constitution named Jewell as a suspect in the bombing, and three months of media smears ensued. While Jewell was under FBI investigation for being a good Samaritan, the media “portrayed him as a loser and law-enforcement wannabe who may have planted the bomb so he would look like a hero when he discovered it later,” according to the Washington Post. Overzealous reporters even camped outside his mother’s home.
The real bomber wasn’t named as a suspect for nearly two years. So in the absence of a villain, the media made one up. Already guilty in the court of public opinion, Jewell was maligned for almost three months before the Justice Department announced he was no longer a suspect.
Clint Eastwood's latest project, the upcoming film Richard Jewell, highlights this significant moment in media malpractice.iFrame ObjectThe film, which comes out next week, looks like a powerful and incredibly timely story. The case for caution is now more important than ever.
Kevin Salwen, who covered the Southeast for the Wall Street Journal in the ’90s, co-wrote a book about the Jewell ordeal called The Suspect. He told Fox that 1996 was a “fascinating year in media,” as major outlets were just beginning to publish online. "All of a sudden the pace of news really accelerates," Salwen said. "And, in many ways, it's very much a pre-social media social media story."
Since the smearing of Jewell more than two decades ago, the media hasn’t learned its lesson. Thanks to the internet and Twitter, the stakes have never been higher. Examples of private citizens smeared by the public eye are numerous.
In 2002, the New York Times boldly published the name of the anthrax killer, naming the wrong man. There was little to no recompense for Steven Hatfill, the man wrongly accused, especially after a judge ruled him a public figure.
In 2006, three members of Duke’s lacrosse team were falsely accused of rape. While the accusations were still being examined, the media had already chosen a victim and three villains. “We believe that these cases were the result of a tragic rush to accuse and a failure to verify serious allegations,” North Carolina’s attorney general, Roy A. Cooper, said at a news conference after declaring the players innocent.
In 2013, the New York Post published photos of the two Boston Marathon bombers on its front page — except, you guessed it, the men were not the bombers.
This January, newsrooms were quick to paint a student from Covington Catholic High School as a racist for a viral, out-of-context video that showed him grinning (supposedly mockingly) at a Native American man. Further video told a very different story, and the student has sued the Washington Post for libel.
Now that we have Twitter, viral stories, and an abundance of fake news, it's even more important that the media learn not to jump to conclusions. Unfortunately, though, we all love a good scapegoat.
Jewell, who died in 2007, will never get to see the film intended to brighten his name. But at least it will teach a new generation the truth about the man accused of being a killer. Jewell’s mother told Sports Illustrated that on the anniversary of the bombing, Richard would go to Centennial Park and place a rose in memory of Alice Hawthorne, the woman who was killed.
Clint Eastwood called the attacks against Jewell, "A great American tragedy."
"We shouldn't jump to conclusions right away, and we should go back to the basics of innocent until proven guilty," Eastwood said at Richard Jewell's world premiere. "That's not happening in a lot of situations nowadays. It didn't happen in his case definitely."
Now, when rumors can be spread to the entire world with just a tweet, the next Richard Jewell will have it much, much worse.
Paul Walter Hauser, who plays Jewell, told the Hollywood Reporter that this kind of character attack could happen to anyone. "What happened to Richard Jewell should be illuminated," he said, "so people can see that history is going to repeat itself if we don't take care of people in those situations."

Texto completo: A New York Times headline on Monday said that there's "An Immigrant Influx That a Wall Won’t Deter." So, yes, even during an impeachment, the national media are still trying to convince the public that every commonsense thing we know about immigration is wrong.
The story told of the thousands of people each year who overstay their travel visas, thus making them "illegal immigrants," even though they had initial permission to enter the United States and didn't sneak across the southern border.
Earlier this year, NPR similarly ran a story about visa overstays outnumbering illegal border crossings.
The point, presumably, is to complicate the immigration debate and convince readers that there is no crisis at the southern border. The real fix isn't a border wall at all! It's simply a matter of more internal enforcement and fixing some paperwork.
This is a ruse.
First, any foreign citizen who mistakenly overstays their visa for even just one day is considered an "illegal" resident. If a traveler from India has no intention of staying in the U.S. but remains here for an extra week, his status is illegal. That's not the type of person we're worried about. We're worried about the hundreds of thousands who are coming every month with the purpose of staying, and those people are making their way in by illegally crossing into the country from Mexico and then claim they are seeking asylum.
The New York Times even acknowledged this in its report. "The government reported that nearly 670,000 travelers who arrived by air or sea and were supposed to depart in the 2018 fiscal year had not left by Sept. 30, 2018," it said. "That number had dropped to nearly 415,700 by March 2019, because many people overstay by just a few months."
In contrast, the people coming in from Mexico aren't tripping into the U.S. by mistake and then hopping back once they realize the error. In nearly every case, they're flooding in and hoping it's a one-way journey.
No, walls won't stop everyone from coming into the country illegally. But every border agent I've talked to or heard from says that walls help, particularly when it comes to foreign citizens with criminal backgrounds who aren't claiming asylum but are simply trying to sneak by.
Although Democrats and the national media get angry at the suggestion that even just one illegal immigrant may be a rapist or a violent gang member, border agents at the Rio Grande Valley sector in Texas said last week that in just six days, they apprehended a Salvadoran who had a prior conviction in Indiana for sexual misconduct with a minor; a Salvadoran gang member with a previous conviction in his own country for extortion; and a Salvadoran who had a previous conviction in Los Angeles for "annoying or molesting a child under 18," which essentially means the man behaved in a sexually inappropriate way with a minor.
Sure, let's fix the problem with foreign citizens overstaying their visas. But the southern border, it seems, is a slightly more pressing issue at the moment.

Assange to Testify at Trial Over Illegal Recordings at Ecuador's Embassy

Texto completo: Recordings have emerged of private conversations that Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder, had while living in the Ecuadorean Embassy. He and a Spanish prosecutor blame the United States.
MADRID -- This much has become clear in recent weeks: When Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder, was living in Ecuador's embassy in London, someone was spying on him, recording his private conversations. The question is: Who ordered the surveillance?
Mr. Assange -- in jail in Britain and facing prosecution in the United States -- is scheduled to testify remotely later this month before a Spanish judge in a criminal case accusing a Spanish security company of eavesdropping on him illegally.
The Spanish court case has revealed a new set of secrets in the international saga of Mr. Assange, 48, showing that his claims of being spied on were not just paranoia or a publicity stunt. But as with all things related to someone who has been labeled a villain and a hero, a prophet and a crank, the revelations are subject to conflicting interpretations.
In Spain's National Court, a public prosecutor and Mr. Assange's lawyers have presented a raft of evidence that he was recorded while in the Ecuadorean Embassy, which they say violated his right to privacy. The material includes video recordings, reviewed by The New York Times, in which his conversations with visitors are audible.
The prosecutor and Mr. Assange's allies argue that the C.I.A. was behind the spying. A spokesman for the agency declined to comment.
After President Trump took office in 2017, the C.I.A. began espionage aimed at Mr. Assange, WikiLeaks and their ties to Russian intelligence, and the Justice Department began building a criminal case against him. But it remains unclear whether it was the Americans who were behind bugging the embassy.
The case adds another layer of complexity to the legal travails of Mr. Assange, who has been indicted in the United States on charges of espionage and hacking that exposed classified national security secrets. The Justice Department has asked Britain to extradite him, and British courts have begun considering the request.
His lawyers plan to introduce evidence from the Spanish case into the extradition case, arguing that it should block the British government from turning him over to the Americans. They say that the surveillance includes recordings of privileged conversations Mr. Assange had with his lawyers and doctors, and proves that he cannot receive a fair trial in the United States.
The British courts are unlikely to accept that argument, according to Amy Jeffress, a lawyer at Arnold & Porter in Washington and a former Justice Department attaché at the American Embassy in London. She said the legal standard is whether extradition would comply with Britain's Human Rights Act, which protects the right to privacy but balances it against considerations like national security and fighting crime.
Mr. Assange is scheduled to testify on Dec. 20 by videoconference from Westminster Magistrates' Court before Judge José de la Mata some 800 miles away, in Spain's National Court in Madrid. The judge is handling the investigation into UC Global, a Spanish firm that was in charge of security at the Ecuadorean Embassy during Mr. Assange's long stay there.
David Morales, who founded UC Global after many years in the Spanish military, was indicted in October, charged with privacy violation, bribery and money laundering. He denied wrongdoing, and Judge de la Mata released him pending a trial, but ordered him to surrender his passport and report regularly to the authorities.
One of Mr. Morales's early security jobs was protecting the daughters of Rafael Correa, the president of Ecuador at the time, who were living in Europe. That paved the way for a contract with Ecuador's embassy in London.
In 2017, Mr. Morales overhauled the security equipment and procedures at the embassy, replacing surveillance cameras with new ones that had microphones, according to a 61-page court filing by the public prosecutor. Mr. Assange was repeatedly assured by Ecuadorean officials that he was not being recorded.
In reality, he was. He took precautions like using a white noise device in an attempt to mask conversations, and the Spanish prosecutor says UC Global took steps to counteract them.
The company put microphones in embassy restrooms, where Mr. Assange sometimes held meetings for greater privacy, the court filing says. And it states that UC Global placed a microphone in a meeting room, hidden in a fire extinguisher, that could record up to 12 hours of sound.
Recordings were sent to the company's headquarters in Jerez de la Frontera, in southern Spain, the prosecution says -- a charge that Mr. Morales denies. When he was detained, the police also raided his home and company, and have since been decrypting emails and information from his confiscated cellphone.
The court case also relies on the testimony of some former employees of UC Global who have been granted witness protection. They said that Mr. Morales traveled to the United States once or twice a month, carrying with him hard disks containing recordings from inside the London embassy.
Mr. Morales repeatedly ordered them not to talk with Ecuadorean officials about his trips, they said.
In the court filing, the prosecution asserts that Mr. Morales returned from a security fair in Las Vegas in 2015, gathered his employees and told them that UC Global was going to work "for the dark side," which he explained as referring to the United States authorities.
He signed a contract with Las Vegas Sands, the casino and resort company of Sheldon Adelson, and the prosecution contends that Mr. Morales passed information about Mr. Assange to security officials at the company, saying it acted as a go-between with the C.I.A.
In his hearing before the Spanish judge, Mr. Morales said that any secret recording made at the London embassy was done on behalf of Ecuador's secret service and with the knowledge of the ambassador. The Ecuadorean government has flatly denied spying on Mr. Assange.
Asked by the judge why his company had set up a remote access server to allow the transfer of information gathered within the embassy, Mr. Morales said that "there was absolutely no outside access."
Mr. Morales is accused of bribing an embassy official, paying the official about $ 22,000 monthly to send positive reports about UC Global's surveillance work back to the authorities in Quito.
WikiLeaks gained worldwide attention in 2010, when it published a vast cache of classified material taken from American military computer systems, most of it about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
That year, Swedish prosecutors sought to arrest and question Mr. Assange on sexual assault accusations, which he said were fabricated as a pretext for handing him to the United States. Mr. Assange, who was in Britain at the time, surrendered to the British police, posted bail and fought extradition to Sweden.
But in 2012, fearing that he would lose that case, he sought asylum in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London, and Mr. Correa's government granted it. Mr. Assange stayed there for nearly seven years, skipping court appearances, forfeiting his bail and continuing to run WikiLeaks.
Recently, the Swedes dropped their investigation, saying that the evidence was too weak for a prosecution.
In 2016, WikiLeaks published stolen Democratic Party emails that damaged the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton. Russian spies had hacked the party's computers, according to Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, but Mr. Assange denies any link to Russian intelligence.
As Mr. Assange's relations with his Ecuadorean hosts deteriorated, President Lenín Moreno, who succeeded Mr. Correa in 2017, pressured him to leave. In April this year, Ecuador revoked Mr. Assange's asylum, and the British police arrested him. He was convicted of bail-jumping and sentenced to 50 weeks in prison.
Mr. Assange contends he is a journalist, publishing what he receives from his sources, and not responsible if they have obtained it illegally. The Obama administration reluctantly accepted that argument. The Trump administration rejects it, and charges that in addition, he aided the illegal 2010 hacking.
David D. Kirkpatrick contributed reporting from London, and Charlie Savage and Julian E. Barnes from Washington.

Texto completo: BY LINDSEY BAHR
The Associated Press
LOS ANGELES - Mark Ruffalo learned about corporate attorney Rob Bilott, who, for 20 years, battled DuPont to expose the harmful effects of the chemical PFOA, along with most of the country: In 2016 through an article in The New York Times Magazine.
A cold call from a West Virginia farmer in 1998 who believed his creek was being contaminated and his animals poisoned by DuPont runoffs began the long investigation that ended in 2017 when DuPont and Chemours Co. agreed to pay more than $600 million in a class action lawsuit on behalf of thousands.
Ruffalo was captivated and immediately set out to acquire the rights to make Nathaniel Rich's "The Lawyer Who Became DuPont's Worst Nightmare" into a legal thriller in which he'd play Bilott.
"It's a horror story that has to be told," Ruffalo said. "It's a story for our time."
The result, "Dark Waters," directed by Todd Haynes and co-starring an impressive ensemble including Anne Hathaway, Tim Robbins, Bill Camp, William Jackson Harper and Bill Pullman. Bilott also authored a book about the ordeal, "Exposure," which hit shelves in October.
DuPont said in a statement that it believes the film "misrepresents things that happened years ago, including our history, our values and science." The company also said it supports regulating the chemicals spotlighted in "Dark Waters."
Ruffalo spoke to The Associated Press about the film. Remarks have been edited for clarity and brevity.
AP: Was it difficult to get the rights?
Ruffalo: I was in the process of acquiring the rights after reading (the article), and I got a call from my friends at Participant Media who said, "Hey I think we're actually bidding against each other for this story. We love it. Would you like to join forces with us?" I'd done "Spotlight" with them and I was like, "I would like that." And then, we started to develop it. This thing happened in record time. It (usually) takes five-seven years to get a movie made.
AP: Why did you think of Todd Haynes to direct?
Ruffalo: We'd been bumping into each other for years and I'd been such a big fan of his. I thought he would do something really beautiful with this. It needs that kind of spaciousness and depth to really make it work because there's so much legalese and data that unless we're attached to this character and really understand him, no one will stay with this story. (Haynes) would figure out a way to bridge 20 years in a movie elegantly, and he would make the most gorgeous version of this movie.
AP: When did you meet Rob Billot and start to develop a relationship with him?
Ruffalo: Very early on. While we were in talks of acquiring the story, I wanted to talk to him about it. I was on the phone with him for quite some time laying out my vision for it. But I wanted to know more. I felt like the whole story wasn't really in that New York Times article. Especially concerning his relationship to (his law firm) Taft and what that must have been like and how difficult that must have been. The article really doesn't get into that.
AP: Was there anything that surprised you about him?
Ruffalo: He's passionate (but) he's not emotional. He's the opposite of what, as an actor, you'd want him to be. He's deeply righteous but he's not political. He doesn't have an ax to grind. He's a corporate defense attorney. He's the guy who would normally defend these companies. That was so remarkable to me. That's what made the story. That's what made me thought this could be a movie.
AP: When you read that initial story, did you have a late-night moment like Rob does in the movie where you're throwing out all the Teflon products?
Ruffalo: Yes. I (changed) everything. I have a water filter on the house. I've stopped buying even my favorite progressive sports brands that use PFOA in their waterproofing.
AP: What are you hoping audiences take from this?
Ruffalo: Just having the knowledge. Knowledge is power. Before you didn't know so you couldn't even make a choice. We were living with this stuff. It was all around us and we had no idea so we couldn't even decide whether it was something we wanted in our life or not. There's power in that, just being able to say, "Hey I don't want this in my life. This causes six diseases so I'm not going to cook on this anymore, I'm not going to buy these products anymore. I'm going to find the alternative."
It's like the priest molestation scandal in "Spotlight." What really made the change in the world was what people learned from what that they didn't know about before, told in a human story that they could relate to in their hearts and minds.

Texto completo: The disaster took place more than 3,000 miles away, but it felt very close to home for many Northeast Pennsylvania residents 53 years ago.
A waterlogged mountain of coal mining waste in Aberfan, Wales, slid downhill in late October 1966, destroying a school, homes and farms and killing 116 children and 28 adults.
In the immediate aftermath of the disaster at the village mine, thousands of men and women dug through the sludge in an effort to find the missing and the dead.
“The savagely tattered school books and drawings lie in the mud beside the tons of colliery waste that overwhelmed Pantglas school,” an Oct. 23, 1966, New York Times News Service story published in The Scranton Times began. “Miners claw at the black sticky mass with their shovels.”
Continual rain caused the slide and also hampered search efforts, the story reported.
The story went on to mention that residents and local officials had concerns about the mound of waste for years. And in the days after the disaster, officials here in Pennsylvania began wondering about the likelihood of something similar happening here.
“With his thoughts on the Aberfan, Wales tragedy of Oct. 21, H. Beecher Charmbury, state mines secretary, announced … that the state has 23 mine refuse and culm banks that are possible hazards in the event of a continuing hard rain or ‘other sort of act of nature,’ ” a Nov. 30, 1966, Tribune story reported. “Constant watch on the banks was ordered.”
Six of them were in Lackawanna County, the story said: Bolands Silt Bank near Powderly Breaker in Carbondale Twp., Racket Brook Refuse Bank in Carbondale, Archbald Refuse Bank in Archbald, Raymond Silt Bank in the Eynon section of Archbald, Pompey Silt Bank in Jessup and Taylor Silt Bank in Taylor. Yet another was located in Luzerne County - Bel Air Silt Bank in Duryea.
In addition to the region’s long history of coal mining, many residents can trace their heritage back to Wales. In fact, one North Scranton woman hailed from a village less than 4 miles from Aberfan and had visited her childhood home just days before the disaster.
Mr. and Mrs. Thomas E. Price, 202 Spring St., spent about 10 weeks in that part of Wales in early October, according to a Nov. 27, 1966, Scranton Times article. Mrs. Price was not identified by first name, in keeping with the practice of the newspaper at the time.
“We were sick and startled to think we had been so close to the village,” Mrs. Price told The Scranton Times. She had grown up in Treharris and said when she heard about the disaster, she thought, “I probably went to school with the grandmothers of the children who died there.”
The couple also remembered seeing the mountain of coal waste during their visit, explaining “the area’s main highway skirts a hillside overlooking Aberfan and the most outstanding object in the village was that ‘big, big black mountain,’ ” according to the newspaper article.
The couple were among thousands of locals who raised money to help the people of Aberfan. Both got involved with the local Aberfan Children’s Fund Drive. Thomas Price also helped organize benefit performances by the St. David’s Male Chorus; he served as the group’s vice president.
St. David’s was one of several groups that held fundraisers after the disaster. A committee of citizens, formed by Aberfan native Mrs. Ceinwein Hughes of Scranton and Basil Jones of Clarks Summit, collected donations from Northeast Pennsylvania residents. Several business owners, school groups and the University of Scranton’s student council also raised money and made donations.
All together, our region sent about $2,800 to Aberfan, in care of a priest in that area, according to a March 15, 1967, Scranton Tribune article.

Texto completo: One of my former mentors loved to tell the tragicomic story of how she met (and later re-met) her husband. Their first encounter took place at a party. She was tipsy, he was completely torpedoed. Wanting to impress him with her sense of humor, she told a knock-knock joke about a pony passing gas. It did not go well.
In more sober circumstances, the two ran into one another again about a month later. She was mortified, recalling their original interaction, but he had no memory of any of it. "Great!" she told him. "Consider this our first meeting, a very lucky version 2.0." After a few months, he blurrily recollected something about crass horse humor, but papered over the memory with the reality of their blissful romance.
My first encounter with Sun Vietnamese Restaurant (formerly Sun Bakery and CafÃ©) was similarly benighted. Yours may have been as well, if you visited the lurid yellow Woodfords Corner restaurant during its first several months in business.
When it opened in November 2017, Sun Bakery served a peculiar menu of breakfast sandwiches, pan-Asian food, fried chicken and pastries. Some of that confusing, artery-clogging cornucopia was inspired by the quick-service business model of the space's predecessor, Thurston's Wicked Good Burgers.
Indeed, chef/owner Truc Nguyen and her husband, owner/general manager Hai Nguyen, seemed bound by the space's history in more ways than one - they made almost no alterations to the dining room's interior, apart from adding an orchid or two and toning the fluorescent walls down to a pale, powdery hue.
It did not take the couple long to figure out they were on the wrong path. "My wife learned about doughnuts from her parents, who make them in Bar Harbor. So we tried doing that, too." Hai Nguyen said. "But we just didn't have enough people coming in for them. You have to get up way too early to make them, and it's too much work to do that and make breakfast, lunch and dinner. We knew we had to focus."
On July 1, 2018, Sun Bakery transformed into Sun Vietnamese Restaurant. Breakfast service? Gone. Doughnuts and pastries? Gone. That lingering smoggy haze from frying oil that bubbled from 3 a.m. until long past dark?
Also gone.
Suddenly, the Nguyens found time in their day to devote to labor-intensive, from-scratch dishes like slow-simmering pho broths that begin with flame-scarred aromatics like ginger, onion and garlic.
The beef version overlays lush, musky flavors from chuck, oxtails and larger bones split to release their marrow to the stock, along with warming clove and star anise. When it is time to build broth into pho ($9.50), Truc Nguyen drops in rice vermicelli, scallion, bouncy tendon meatballs and filmy shavings of raw flank steak. Hers is a fantastic pho tai bo vien - the equal to any other I have tasted in Maine.
So too, her traditional pho ga, a chicken-broth-based variety of the same soup ($9.00), made at once lighter by selectively cranking up the volume of cinnamon and coriander in the stock, and funkier as the brine and umami of fish sauce winks in and out of every steamy sip. My ideal December dinner might just be what's in this bowl at Sun Vietnamese: shreds of boneless chicken meat bobbing in and out of tangles of white noodles and torn cilantro leaves.
Those same stark white (and gluten-free) vermicelli also feature in Sun's unobjectionable soft-skinned fresh spring rolls ($4 for two), as well as its two impressive bun dishes. Layered onto chopped lettuce, cucumber, cilantro and holy basil, rice vermicelli form a nest for grilled shrimp tossed in a thick paste of ginger, garlic and hoisin sauce ($12). It's a decent dish, but one that must be eaten immediately to keep the noodles from seizing up into a stodgy mass.
On the BBQ beef bun - a nearly identical base of noodles and vegetables topped with strips of sauce-slicked top round and cleavered pieces of crisp-fried pork egg rolls ($12) - you'll find an extra dose of sweet, tangy sauce to keep this indulgent dish looser than its shrimp-based cousin. Add it immediately to your Rolodex of superpowered comfort foods.
If you're a fan of the savory scallion-and-pork filling in those egg rolls, you can also find a version of it tucked inside the deep-fried dumpling appetizer ($5.50 for eight). Here, though, the kitchen foregoes crunchy jicama and vermicelli to create an almost molten interior that balances out the dumpling's crisp, puffy skin. My dinner guest and I agreed that the '70s television show had it wrong: Eight is not enough.
Or if more sticky-sauced BBQ beef is what you're after, your best option is one of Sun's excellent beef banh mi sandwiches ($5.50) - a crusty baguette-style roll bulging with homemade daikon and carrot pickles, fresh jalapeno and cucumber.
What makes Truc Nguyen's banh mi different (and arguably better) than those of her competitors is that regardless of the fillings she uses, she never erases the sandwich's essential link to the classic, cold-cut-based original (which is also available for $5). So whether you opt for a sandwich loaded generously with beef, white ham (cha lua) or grilled chicken breast ($5), one side of your roll will always be buttered and the other slathered with pork-and-chicken-liver ptÃ©.
The feral headiness of ptÃ© extends and exaggerates the sandwich's other meaty flavors, turning every bite into a preamble to the next, when you'll attempt to create the perfect mouthful with a tiny nibble of tart daikon pickle or floral cilantro.
Two years ago, I was prepared to write off Sun. In trying to do too much, it did little well. And while today's menu still clocks in at nearly three dozen dishes, jettisoning breakfast sandwiches and sweet pastries seems to have triggered exactly the kind of reboot the restaurant required - a very lucky version 2.0.

Texto completo: That sucking sound you hear is the entirety of the past decade getting pulled into the cultural-take mill, where columnists like me chew it up, reconstitute it, and portion it out in delicious, consumable listy treats. There's nothing like the slow turn of time's odometer to inspire our deepest organizational impulses, and nothing like the end of a decade to arbitrarily inspire that most dreadful of existential questions: Where did the time go?
Spoiler: You frittered it away online. I know, it might not seem like you did, but you did. In 2010, a mere 76 percent of Americans were what you'd call Internet users (with 1.7 million of them staring smitten at themselves through the new front-facing cameras of the iPhone 4). That's up to 90 percent today, leaving the term “Internet user" about as useful as “air breather."
So suffused with networked culture is life today that if anything seems novel looking back 10 years, it's that we used to speak about the Internet in terms that suggested it was under our control — naively registering its oncoming force like a problem to get out in front of, rather than a train.
For one thing, a general surge in usership (especially via mobile devices) made 2010 a year of telling crashes — Twitter, Facebook, Foursquare (remember them?), PayPal, and upstart trouble-distributors WikiLeaks were among the many sites and services that experienced major disruptions, straining to satisfy bursts of traffic and falling offline for now-unthinkable stretches of several hours at a time. These conditions led Internet prophets to spend the year forecasting the threat of an approaching “exaflood" of data, warning whoever would listen that our only salvation would be miraculously evaporating the data (and our faith) into something called the “exacloud." But these were only the first signs of the gathering storm.
The trusty moral panic that typically accompanies a new technology (e.g. “[form of media] is rotting your brain!") seemed somehow more resonant in 2010, as Nicholas Carr expanded his 2008 essay “Is Google Making Us Stupid?" into a book trawling the thinning shallows of consciousness in the Internet age, and as questions concerning the Internet's actual-factual deleterious effects on our minds (i.e., brain rot) started filtering into the mainstream.
And this Huxley-esque discomfort was matched by a mounting Orwellian dread regarding the permanent record that our personal tech was starting to assemble on us — through our burgeoning social-media habits, our lengthening chat histories, our step-by-step location logs. “Far from giving us a new sense of control over the face we present to the world," Jeffrey Rosen wrote for The New York Times in a piece called “The Web Means the End of Forgetting," “the Internet is shackling us to everything that we have ever said, or that anyone has said about us, making the possibility of digital self-reinvention seem like an ideal from a distant era."
And even doomier feelings were beginning to swirl around the so-called Internet of Things, as the tendrils of technology started creeping into the walls of our houses, wiring our suddenly “smart" thermostats and refrigerators and sous-vide wands (how is that a thing, by the way?) — and rendering anything untouched by the network implicitly “dumb."
“The more we trust to the Internet, the more dependent we are on it," fretted a post on the Economist blog (remember blogs?!). “The more interconnected the world becomes, the more we have to lose from catastrophic failure. Terrorist attacks, hackers' vandalism and plain old disasters could wreak havoc on a world where everything is connected to a giant electronic brain."
Elsewhere, others were starting to pick up on the increasingly clear mall-ification of the once Wild West of the Web. “The delirious chaos of the open Web was an adolescent phase subsidized by industrial giants groping their way in a new world," Chris Anderson and Michael Wolff wrote in a piece for Wired. “Now they're doing what industrialists do best — finding choke points. And by the looks of it, we're loving it."
The good news is that this surge of change (and boost in usership) 10 years ago inspired an entire movement to maintain the openness of the Internet, as “net neutrality" that year graduated from techie buzzword to living legislation. The bad news — well, apart from the repeal in 2018 of that very same net neutrality — is that despite all of the detailed doomsaying and prognosticating and fear-stoking and warnings, all of these uncertainties haven't just hung around, they've reached a full boil. The pull of the Internet is stronger, its presence inescapable, its current more forceful.
What, besides a marked decrease in the appearance of Keyboard Cat, has really changed about the Internet since 2010? If anything, it seems like the Internet spent the decade flipping the script. In 2019, it's using us. Here's hoping within the next 10 years, we find a way to reboot.

Texto completo: SOON AFTER THE sex criminal Jeffrey Epstein died in August, a mysterious man met with two prominent lawyers. Towering, barrel-chested and wildbearded, he was a prodigious drinker and often wore flip-flops. He went by a pseudonym, Patrick Kessler -- a necessity, he said, given the shadowy, dangerous world that he inhabited. He told the lawyers he had something incendiary: a vast archive of Mr. Epstein's data, stored on encrypted servers overseas. He said he had years of the financier's communications and financial records -- as well as thousands of hours of footage from hidden cameras in the bedrooms of Mr. Epstein's properties. The videos, Kessler said, captured some of the world's richest, most powerful men in compromising sexual situations -- even in the act of rape. Kessler said he wanted to expose these men. If he was telling the truth, his trove could answer one of the Epstein saga's most baffling questions: How did a college dropout and high school math teacher amass what was said to be a nine-figure fortune? One persistent but unproven theory was that he ran a sprawling blackmail operation. That would explain why moguls, scientists, political leaders and a royal stayed loyal to him, in some cases even after he first went to jail. Kessler's tale was enough to hook the two lawyers, the famed litigator David Boies and his friend John Stanley Pottinger. If Kessler was authentic, his videos would arm them with immense leverage over some very important people. Mr. Boies and Mr. Pottinger discussed a plan. They could use the supposed footage in litigation or to try to reach deals with men who appeared in it, with money flowing into a charitable foundation. In encrypted chats with Kessler, Mr. Pottinger referred to a roster of potential targets as the "hot list." He described hypothetical plans in which the lawyers would pocket up to 40 percent of the settlements and could extract money from wealthy men by flipping from representing victims to representing those accused of abusing them. The possibilities were tantalizing -- and extended beyond vindicating victims. Mr. Pottinger saw a chance to supercharge his law practice. For Mr. Boies, there was a shot at redemption, after years of criticism for his work on behalf of Theranos and Harvey Weinstein. In the end, there would be no damning videos, no funds pouring into a new foundation. Mr. Boies and Mr. Pottinger would go from toasting Kessler as their "whistleblower" and "informant" to torching him as a "fraudster" and a "spy." Kessler was a liar, and he wouldn't expose any sexual abuse. But he would reveal something else: the extraordinary, at times deceitful measures elite lawyers deployed in an effort to get evidence that could be used to win lucrative settlements -- and keep misconduct hidden, allowing perpetrators to abuse again. Mr. Boies has denounced such secret deals as "rich man's justice," a way that powerful men buy their way out of legal and reputational jeopardy. This is how it works. 7 Men and a Headless Parrot The man who called himself Kessler first contacted a Florida lawyer, Bradley J. Edwards, who was representing women with claims against Mr. Epstein. It was late August, about two weeks after the financier killed himself in a jail cell while awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges. Mr. Edwards, who did not respond to interview requests, had a law firm called Edwards Pottinger, and he soon referred Kessler to his New York partner. Silverhaired and 79, Mr. Pottinger had been a senior civil-rights official in the Nixon and Ford administrations, but he also dabbled in investment banking and wrote best-selling medical thrillers. He was perhaps best known for having dated Gloria Steinem and Kathie Lee Gifford. Mr. Pottinger recalled that Mr. Edwards warned him about Kessler, saying that he was "endearing," "spooky" and "loves to drink like a fish." After an initial discussion with Kessler in Washington, Mr. Pottinger briefed Mr. Boies -- whose firm was also representing accusers in the Epstein case -- about the sensational claims. He then invited Kessler to his Manhattan apartment. Kessler admired a wall-mounted frame containing a headless stuffed parrot; on TV, the Philadelphia Eagles were mounting a comeback against the Washington Redskins. Mr. Pottinger poured Kessler a glass of WhistlePig whiskey, and the informant began to talk. In his conversations with Mr. Pottinger and, later, Mr. Boies, Kessler said his videos featured numerous powerful men who were already linked to Mr. Epstein: Ehud Barak, the former Israeli prime minister; Alan Dershowitz, a constitutional lawyer; Prince Andrew; three billionaires; and a prominent chief executive. All seven men, or their representatives, told The New York Times they never engaged in sexual activity on Mr. Epstein's properties. The Times has no reason to believe Kessler's supposed footage is real. In his apartment, Mr. Pottinger presented Kessler with a signed copy of "The Boss," his 2005 novel. "One minute you're bending the rules," blares the cover of the paperback version. "The next minute you're breaking the law." On the title page, Mr. Pottinger wrote: "Here's to the great work you are to do. Happy to be part of it." Mr. Pottinger also gave Kessler a draft contract to bring him on as a client, allowing him to use a fake name. "For reasons revealed to you, I prefer to proceed with this engagement under the name Patrick Kessler," the agreement said. Despite the enormities of the Epstein scandal, few of his accusers have gotten a sense of justice or resolution. Mr. Pottinger thought Kessler's files could change everything. This strange man was theatrical and liked his alcohol, but if there was even a chance his claims were true, they were worth pursuing. "Our clients are said to be liars and prostitutes," Mr. Pottinger later said in an interview with The Times, "and we now have someone who says, 'I can give you secret photographic proof of abuse that will completely change the entire fabric of your practice and get justice for these girls.' And you think that we wouldn't try to get that?" Legal Royalty Mr. Pottinger and Mr. Boies have known each other for years, a friendship forged on bike trips in France and Italy. In legal circles, Mr. Boies was royalty: He was the one who fought for the presidential candidate Al Gore before the Supreme Court, took on Microsoft in a landmark antitrust case and helped obtain the right for gays and lesbians to marry in California. But then Mr. Boies got involved with the blood-testing start-up Theranos. As the company was being revealed as a fraud, he tried to bully whistle-blowers into not speaking to a Wall Street Journal reporter and he was criticized for possible conflicts of interest when he joined the company's board in 2015. Two years later, Mr. Boies helped his longtime client Harvey Weinstein hire private investigators who intimidated sources and trailed reporters for The Times and The New Yorker -- even though Mr. Boies's firm had worked for The Times on other matters. (The Times fired his firm.) By 2019, Mr. Boies, 78, was representing a number of Mr. Epstein's accusers. They got his services pro bono, and he got the chance to burnish his legacy. When Mr. Pottinger contacted him about Kessler, he was intrigued. On Sept. 9, Mr. Boies greeted Kessler at the offices of his law firm, Boies Schiller Flexner, in a gleaming new skyscraper at Hudson Yards on Manhattan's West Side. Kessler unfurled a fantastic story, one he would embroider and alter in later weeks, that began with him growing up somewhere within a three-hour radius of Washington. Kessler said he had been molested as a boy by a Bible school teacher and sought solace on the internet, where he fell in with a group of victims turned hackers, who used their skills to combat pedophilia. Kessler claimed that a technology executive had introduced him to Mr. Epstein, who in 2012 hired Kessler to set up encrypted servers to preserve his extensive digital archives. With Mr. Epstein dead, Kessler boasted to the lawyers, he had unfettered access to the material. He said the volume of videos was overwhelming: more than a decade of round-the-clock footage from dozens of cameras. Kessler displayed some pixelated video stills on his phone. In one, a bearded man with his mouth open appears to be having sex with a naked woman. Kessler said the man was Mr. Barak. In another, a man with black-framed glasses is seen shirtless with a woman on his lap, her breasts exposed. Kessler said it was Mr. Dershowitz. He also said that some of the supposed videos appeared to have been edited and cataloged for the purpose of blackmail. "This was explosive information if true, for lots and lots of people," Mr. Boies said. Mr. Boies and Mr. Pottinger had decades of legal experience and considered themselves experts at assessing witnesses' credibility. While they couldn't be sure, they thought Kessler was probably legit. A Ploy to Sway an Election Within hours of the Hudson Yards meeting, Mr. Pottinger sent Kessler a series of texts over the encrypted messaging app Signal. According to excerpts viewed by The Times, Mr. Pottinger and Kessler discussed a plan to disseminate some of the informant's materials -- starting with the supposed footage of Mr. Barak. The Israeli election was barely a week away, and Mr. Barak was challenging Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The images said to be of Mr. Barak might be able to sway the election -- and fetch a high price. ("Total lie with no basis in reality," Mr. Barak said when asked about the existence of such videos.) "Can you review your visual evidence to be sure some or all is indisputably him? If so, we can make it work," Mr. Pottinger wrote. Kessler said he would do so. Mr. Pottinger sent a yellow smiley-face emoji with its tongue sticking out. "Can you share your contact that would be purchasing?" Kessler asked. "Sheldon Adelson," Mr. Pottinger said. Mr. Adelson, a billionaire casino magnate in Las Vegas, had founded one of Israel's largest newspapers, and it was an enthusiastic booster of Mr. Netanyahu. Mr. Pottinger wrote that he and Mr. Boies hoped to fly to Nevada to meet with Mr. Adelson to discuss the images. "Do you believe that adelson has the pull to insure this will hurt his bid for election?" Kessler asked the next morning. Mr. Pottinger reassured him. "There is no question that Adelson has the capacity to air the truth about EB if he wants to," he said, using Mr. Barak's initials. He said he planned to discuss the matter with Mr. Boies that evening. Mr. Boies confirmed that they discussed sharing the photo with Mr. Adelson but said the plan was never executed. Boaz Bismuth, the editor in chief of the newspaper, Israel Hayom, said that its journalists were approached by an Israeli source who pitched them supposed images of Mr. Barak, but that "we were not interested." 'Wealthy Wrongdoers' The men whom Kessler claimed to have on tape were together worth many billions. Some of their public relations teams had spent months trying to tamp down media coverage of their connections to Mr. Epstein. Imagine how much they might pay to make incriminating videos vanish. You might think that lawyers representing abuse victims would want to publicly expose such information to bolster their clients' claims. But that is not how the legal industry always works. Often, keeping things quiet is good business. One of the revelations of the #MeToo era has been that victims' lawyers often brokered secret deals in which men accused of abuse paid to keep their accusers quiet and the allegations out of the public sphere. Lawyers can pocket at least a third of such settlements, profiting off a system that masks misconduct and allows men to abuse again. Mr. Boies and Mr. Pottinger said in interviews that they were looking into creating a charity to help victims of sexual abuse. It would be bankrolled by private legal settlements with the men on the videos. Mr. Boies acknowledged that Kessler might get paid. "If we were able to use this to help our victims recover money, we would treat him generously," he said in September. He said that his firm would not get a cut of any settlements. Such agreements would have made it less likely that videos involving the men became public. "Generally what settlements are about is getting peace," Mr. Boies said. Mr. Pottinger told Kessler that the charity he was setting up would be called the Astria Foundation -- a name he later said his girlfriend came up with, in a nod to Astraea, the Greek goddess of innocence and justice. "We need to get it funded by abusers," Mr. Pottinger texted, noting in another message that "these are wealthy wrongdoers." Mr. Pottinger asked Kessler to start compiling incriminating materials on a specific group of men. "I'm way ahead of you," Kessler responded. He said he had asked his team of hackers to search the files for the three billionaires, the C.E.O. and Prince Andrew. "Yes, that's exactly how to do this," Mr. Pottinger said. "Videos for sure, but email traffic, too." "I call it our hot list," he added. An Invitation to Reporters In mid-September, Mr. Boies and Mr. Pottinger invited reporters from The Times to the Boies Schiller offices to meet Kessler. The threat of a major news organization writing about the videos -- and confirming the existence of an extensive surveillance apparatus -- could greatly enhance the lawyers' leverage over the wealthy men. Before the session, Mr. Pottinger urged Kessler to focus on certain men, like Mr. Barak, while avoiding others. Referring to the reporters, he added: "Let them drink from a fountain instead of a water hose. They and the readers will follow that better." The meeting took place on a cloudy Saturday morning. After agreeing to leave their phones and laptops outside, the reporters entered a 20th-floor conference room. Kessler was huge: more than 6 feet tall, nearly 300 pounds, balding, his temples speckled with gray. He told his story and presented images that he said were of Mr. Epstein, Mr. Barak and Mr. Dershowitz having sex with women. Barely an hour after the session ended, the Times reporters received an email from Kessler: "Are you free?" He said he wanted to meet -- alone. "Tell no one else." That afternoon, they met at Grand Sichuan, an iconic Chinese restaurant in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood. The lunch rush was over, and the trio sat at a quiet table in the back. A small group of women huddled nearby, speaking Mandarin and snipping the ends off string beans. Kessler complained that Mr. Boies and Mr. Pottinger were more interested in making money than in exposing wrongdoers. He pulled out his phone, warned the reporters not to touch it, and showed more of what he had. There was a color photo of a barechested, gray-haired man with a slight smile. Kessler said it was a billionaire. He also showed blurry, black-and-white images of a dark-haired man receiving oral sex. He said it was a prominent C.E.O. Soup dumplings and Gui Zhou chicken arrived, and Kessler kept talking. He said he had found financial ledgers on Mr. Epstein's servers that showed he had vast amounts of Bitcoin and cash in the Middle East and Bangkok, and hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of gold, silver and diamonds. He presented no proof. But it is common for whistle-blowers to be erratic and slow to produce their evidence, and The Times thought it was worth investigating Kessler's claims. The conversation continued in a conference room at a Washington hotel five days later, after a text exchange in which Kessler noted his enthusiasm for Japanese whiskey. Both parties brought bottles to the hotel, and Kessler spent nearly eight hours downing glass after glass. He veered from telling tales about the dark web to professing love for "Little House on the Prairie." He asserted that he had evidence Mr. Epstein had derived his wealth through illicit means. At one point, he showed what he said were classified C.I.A. documents. Kessler said he had no idea who the women in the videos were or how the lawyers might identify them to act on their behalf. From his perspective, he said, it seemed as if Mr. Boies and Mr. Pottinger were plotting to use his footage to demand huge sums from billionaires. He said that it looked like blackmail -- and that he could prove it. 'We Keep Everything' Was Kessler's story plausible? Did America's best-connected sexual predator accumulate incriminating videos of powerful men? Two women who spent time in Mr. Epstein's homes said the answer was yes. In an unpublished memoir, Virginia Giuffre, who accused Mr. Epstein of making her a "sex slave," wrote that she discovered a room in his New York mansion where monitors displayed real-time surveillance footage. And Maria Farmer, an artist who accused Mr. Epstein of sexually assaulting her when she worked for him in the 1990s, said that Mr. Epstein once walked her through the mansion, pointing out pin-size cameras that he said were in every room. "I said, 'Are you recording all this?"' Ms. Farmer said in an interview. "He said: 'Yes. We keep it. We keep everything."' During a 2005 search of Mr. Epstein's Palm Beach, Fla., estate, the police found two cameras hidden in clocks -- one in the garage and the other next to his desk, according to police reports. But no other cameras were found. If such a surveillance system did exist, nothing that Kessler told or showed The Times proved that he had access to it. The photos he shared were too grainy to establish anyone's identity. And many elements of his story failed to hold up under scrutiny. Kessler claimed to have been an early investor in a North Carolina coffee company, whose sticker was affixed to his laptop. But its founder said no one matching Kessler's description had ever been affiliated with the company. Kessler insisted that he invested in 2009, but the company wasn't founded until 2011. The contents of Kessler's supposed C.I.A. documents turned out to be easily findable using Google. At one point, Kessler said that one of his associates had been missing and was found dead; later, Kessler said the man was alive and in the United States. He said that his mother had died when he was young -- and that he had recently given her a hug. A photo he sent from what he said was a Washington-area hospital featured a distinctive blanket, but when The Times called local hospitals, they didn't recognize the pattern. After months of effort, The Times could not learn Kessler's identity or confirm any element of his back story. "I am very often being purposefully inconsistent," Kessler said, when pressed. The Lawyers Seek a Deal On the last Friday in September, Mr. Boies and Mr. Pottinger sat on a blue leather couch in the corner of a members-only dining room at the Harvard Club in Midtown Manhattan. Antlered animal heads and oil paintings hung from the dark wooden walls. The lawyers were there to make a deal with The Times. Tired of waiting for Kessler's motherlode, Mr. Pottinger said they planned to send a team overseas to download the material from his servers. He said he had alerted the F.B.I. and a prosecutor in the United States attorney's office in Manhattan. Mr. Boies told an editor for The Times that they would be willing to share everything, on one condition: They would have discretion over which men could be written about, and when. He explained that if compromising videos about particular men became public, that could torpedo litigation or attempts to negotiate settlements. The Times editor didn't commit. Mr. Boies and Mr. Pottinger later said those plans had hinged on verifying the videos' authenticity and on having clients with legitimate legal claims against the men. Otherwise, legal experts said, it might have crossed the line into extortion. The meeting was interrupted when Bob Weinstein, the brother of Harvey Weinstein, bounded up to the table and plopped onto the couch next to Mr. Boies. The two men spent several minutes talking, laughing and slapping each other on the back. While Mr. Boies and Mr. Weinstein chatted, Mr. Pottinger furtively displayed the black-and-white shot of a man in glasses having sex. Both lawyers said it looked like Mr. Dershowitz. A Phone Call One day in late September, Mr. Dershowitz's secretary relayed a message: Someone named Patrick Kessler wanted to speak to him about Mr. Boies. The two lawyers had a long-running feud, and Mr. Dershowitz returned the call from his apartment. He also recorded it. Kessler explained his Epstein story, and said he no longer trusted Mr. Boies and Mr. Pottinger. "The problem is that they don't want to move forward with any of these people legally," Kessler said. "They're just interested in trying to settle and take a cut." "Who are these people that you have on videotape?" Mr. Dershowitz asked. "There's a lot of people," Kessler said, naming a few powerful men. He added, "There's a long list of people that they want me to have that I don't have." "Who?" Mr. Dershowitz asked. "Did they ask about me?" "Of course they asked about you. You know that, sir." "And you don't have anything on me, right?" "I do not, no," Kessler said. "Because I never, I never had sex with anybody," Mr. Dershowitz said. Later in the call, he added: "I am completely clean. I was at Jeffrey's house. I stayed there. But I didn't have any sex with anybody." What was the purpose of Kessler's phone call? Why did he tell Mr. Dershowitz that he wasn't on the supposed surveillance tapes, contradicting what he had said and showed to Mr. Boies, Mr. Pottinger and The Times? Did the call sound a little rehearsed? Mr. Dershowitz said that he didn't know why Kessler contacted him, and that the call was the only time the two men ever spoke. When The Times showed him one of Kessler's photos, in which a bespectacled man resembling Mr. Dershowitz appears to be having sex, Mr. Dershowitz laughed and said the man wasn't him. His wife, Carolyn Cohen, peeked at the photo, too. "You don't keep your glasses on when you're doing that," she said. Encrypted Files and a Warning In October, Kessler said he was ready to produce the Epstein files. He told The Times that he had created duplicate versions of Mr. Epstein's servers. He laid out detailed plans for them to be shipped by boat to the United States and for one of his associates -- a very short Icelandic man named Steven -- to deliver them to The Times headquarters at 11 a.m. on Oct. 3. Kessler warned that he was erecting a maze of security systems. First, a Times employee would need to use a special thumb drive to access a proprietary communications system. Then Kessler's colleague would transmit a code to decrypt the files. If his instructions weren't followed precisely, Kessler said, the information would self-destruct. Specialists at The Times set up a number of "air-gapped" laptops -- disconnected from the internet -- in a windowless, padlocked meeting room. Reporters cleared their schedules to sift through thousands of hours of surveillance footage. On the day of the scheduled delivery, Kessler sent a series of frantic texts. Disaster had struck. A fire was burning. The duplicate servers were destroyed. A team member was missing. He was fleeing to Ukraine. Two hours later, Kessler was in touch with Mr. Pottinger and didn't mention any emergency. He said he hoped that the footage would help pry $ 1 billion in settlements out of their targets, and asked him to detail how the lawyers could extract the money. "Could you put together a hypothetical situation," Kessler wrote, not something "set in stone but close to what your thinking." Mr. Pottinger obliged -- and walked into what looked like a trap. He described two hypotheticals, both of which were consistent with what had been discussed with The Times at the Harvard Club. In one, which he called a "standard model" for legal settlements, Mr. Pottinger said the money would be split among his clients, the Astria Foundation, Kessler and the lawyers, who would get up to 40 percent. In the second hypothetical, Mr. Pottinger wrote, the lawyers would approach the videotaped men. The men would then hire the lawyers, ensuring that they would not get sued, and "make a contribution to a nonprofit as part of the retainer." "No client is actually involved in this structure," Mr. Pottinger said, noting that the arrangement would have to be "consistent with and subject to rules of ethics." "Thank you very much," Kessler said. Mr. Pottinger later said that the scenario would have involved him representing a victim, settling a case and then representing the man accused of abusing the victim. He said it was within legal boundaries. (He also said he had meant to type "No client lawsuit is actually involved.") Such legal arrangements are not unheard-of. Lawyers representing a former Fox News producer who had accused Bill O- 'Reilly of sexual harassment reached a settlement in which her lawyers agreed to work for Mr. O'Reilly after the dispute. But legal experts generally consider such setups to be unethical because they can create conflicts between the interests of the lawyers and their original clients. 'Loose Language' The lawyers held out hope of getting Kessler's materials. But weeks passed, and nothing arrived. At one point, Mr. Pottinger volunteered to meet Kessler anywhere -- including Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia. "I still believe he is what he purported to be," Mr. Boies wrote in an email on Nov. 7. "I have to evaluate people for my day job, and he seemed too genuine to be a fake, and I very much want him to be real." He added, "I am not unconscious of the danger of wanting to believe something too much." Ten days later, Mr. Boies arrived at The Times for an interview. It was a chilly Sunday, and Mr. Boies had just flown in from Ecuador, where he said he was doing work for the Finance Ministry. Reporters wanted to ask him if his and Mr. Pottinger's conduct with Kessler crossed ethical lines. Would they have brokered secret settlements that buried evidence of wrongdoing? Did the notion of extracting huge sums from men in exchange for keeping sex tapes hidden meet the definition of extortion? Mr. Boies said the answer to both questions was no. He said he and Mr. Pottinger operated well within the law. They only intended to pursue legal action on behalf of their clients -- in other words, that they were a long way from extortion. In any case, he said, he and Mr. Pottinger had never authenticated any of the imagery or identified any of the supposed victims, much less contacted any of the men on the "hot list." Then The Times showed Mr. Boies some of the text exchanges between Mr. Pottinger and Kessler. Mr. Boies showed a flash of anger and said it was the first time he was seeing them. By the end of the nearly four-hour interview, Mr. Boies had concluded that Kessler was probably a con man: "I think that he was a fraudster who was just trying to set things up." And he argued that Kessler had baited Mr. Pottinger into writing things that looked more nefarious than they really were. He acknowledged that Mr. Pottinger had used "loose language" in some of his messages that risked creating the impression that the lawyers were plotting to monetize evidence of abuse. Several days later, Mr. Boies returned for another interview and was more critical of Mr. Pottinger, especially the hypothetical plans that he had described to Kessler. "Having looked at all that stuff in context, I would not have said that," he said. How did Mr. Boies feel about Mr. Pottinger invoking his name in messages to Kessler? "I don't like it," he said. But Mr. Boies stopped short of blaming Mr. Pottinger for the whole mess. "I'm being cautious not to throw him under the bus more than I believe is accurate," he said. His longtime P.R. adviser, Dawn Schneider, who had been pushing for a more forceful denunciation, dropped her pen, threw up her arms and buried her head in her hands. In a separate interview, The Times asked Mr. Pottinger about his correspondence with Kessler. The lawyer said that his messages shouldn't be taken at face value because, in reality, he had been deceiving Kessler all along -- "misleading him deliberately in order to get the servers." The draft retention agreement that Mr. Pottinger had given to Kessler in September was unsigned and never meant to be honored, Mr. Pottinger said. And he never intended to sell photos of Mr. Barak to Mr. Adelson. "I just pulled it out of my behind," he said, calling it an act to impress Kessler. As for the two hypotheticals about how to get money out of the men on the list, Mr. Pottinger said, he never planned to do what he carefully articulated. "I didn't owe Patrick honesty about this," he said. Mr. Pottinger said that he had only one regret -- that "we did not get the information that this liar said he had." He added, "I'm building legal cases here. I'm trying not to engage too much in shenanigans. I wish I didn't, but this guy was very unusual."

Texto completo: Thanksgiving is over, and holiday music is beginning to fill the air.
In the NFL, that means it's the stretch run of the regular season. And in this year's version of postseason musical chairs, a lot of the seats are already taken.
The New York Times has crunched the numbers, and nine of the 12 playoff spots are all but claimed. The New Orleans Saints are the only team that has claimed one for sure, locking up the NFC South and a home playoff game with Thursday night's victory over Atlanta.

The Saints, who lost to the Rams in last season's NFC title game, distributed T-shirts to players after Thursday's victory that read: "The South Is Not Enough."
"This was objective No. 1, obviously, to win the division," New Orleans quarterback Drew Brees told reporters. "But I think you know our mind-set and the group of guys we have in there, and just kind of how we've progressed each and every year. We've got bigger fish to fry, so to speak."
Eight other teams have between a 90%-99% chance of advancing to the postseason: New England, Baltimore, San Francisco, Seattle, Buffalo, Green Bay, Kansas City and Minnesota.
That's a lot for this early in the process. Should all those teams get in, that would leave nine teams legitimately in the mix for the three remaining berths. Those teams, with their chances of making the playoffs: Houston (78%), Dallas (62%), Philadelphia (39%), Pittsburgh (38%), Indianapolis (30%), Tennessee (27%), Cleveland (21%), Oakland (20%), and the Rams (16%).
According to the chart published after the Thanksgiving Day games, Chicago is a pipe dream at 3%, and everyone else -- including the Chargers -- is at a 1% chance or less.
What that means is, more than most seasons, the NFL is a league of haves and have-nots. And that the lukewarm Cowboys (6-6) and Eagles (5-6) are fortunate to be playing in such a lousy division. Because if they were in the NFC North, South or West, they would be on a one-way trip to irrelevance. As it stands, even though the Eagles have lost their last two games and four of six, they can still claim the NFC East with a strong finish. They wouldn't even need to beat the 2-9 Miami Dolphins on Sunday to stay in the hunt, although they probably will.
Sunday's most intriguing matchup is a potential Super Bowl preview, with the 10-1 49ers playing at the 9-2 Ravens. That's a smothering defense against a new-age offense led by Baltimore quarterback Lamar Jackson, the leading MVP candidate, who ran roughshod over the Rams on Monday night.
"They do some real cool stuff, stuff that's real interesting," San Francisco coach Kyle Shanahan said of the Ravens. "I enjoy looking at how impressive it is in the scheme, but it's not going to be that fun thinking of how to stop it."
The Ravens have already beaten four playoff teams from last season -- Seattle, New England, Houston and the Rams -- by at least two touchdowns each.
The forecast for 49ers-Ravens calls for 100% chance of rain, which could affect the footing of players -- Baltimore is the No. 1 rushing team, San Francisco is ranked sixth -- and ball security. The Ravens practiced this week with wet footballs.
"I think I can recall back in Seattle, when we had some weather, they kind of had a plan for how they were going to approach that, and they did a great job, so they'll be ready to go," said Ravens offensive coordinator Greg Roman, who had that same role with the 49ers during the Jim Harbaugh years.
Another pivotal showdown is New England at Houston on Sunday night. The 10-1 Patriots have double-digit wins for an NFL-record 17 consecutive seasons and are playing the Texans in the regular season for the fifth straight year.
The Texans are 1-8 against New England, with their only victory in that series coming in early 2010. Houston coach Bill O'Brien, former offensive coordinator for the Patriots, is 0-4 against New England coach Bill Belichick.
"Obviously we've struggled against the Patriots in past years, but this is a different year," O'Brien said.
Now, he and his Texans have a chance to prove it.

Texto completo: A pink surgical mask was the most prominent feature on the slim woman's face. Her glance at me in the salon's doorway was a flicker, a firefly's light. "Mani-pedi?" she asked.
"Choose color," she commanded.
I nodded, noting she and fellow employees made a living by offering inexpensive services in volume. I was part of a system that beautified my superficial appearance but usually left a residue of shame.
The shop was crowded Monday nights, when the business advertised a $25 manicure and pedicure special. I came here as a rare treat, usually before the holidays. Polished nails told peers I didn't bite my nails when I was anxious. They also suggested success, even though I hadn't had a meaningful raise in seven years. Sometimes you go in for a mani-pedi but get so much more.
Selecting hues made me feel like I was preparing myself for a glamorous battle. Each shade carried a promise wanted as mental armor. I decided on OPI's "The Berry Thought of You," a raspberry shade that reminded me of Barbie's lipstick. The woman in the pink mask tapped the foot bath to indicate she was ready for me. I kicked off my flip-flops, and sank into the chair in a spiral of thoughts.
When it was time to walk to the manicure station in my flip-flops, I scooted across the floor tiles. Seated face-to-face with my nail technician, I noticed her pink mask was printed with Xs that formed a diamond design.
"Pay now?" she asked after rubbing my hands in lotion.
From my fanny pack, I pulled out $35 to cover the service and tip. I always paid more than 20 percent, but I still felt guilty. I am haunted by the 2015 New York Times story about nail technicians miscarrying babies and losing their fingerprints linked to trade's toxic chemicals. And yet, here I was. "I like your bag," she said of my belted purse.
"Thank you," I said, almost complimenting her mask.
But I quickly looked for something else: a silver ring on the right thumb, an imitation diamond bracelet and matching necklace. "I like your bracelet."
She met my eyes. "He gave it to me," she said. "He isn't here anymore."
"Not here anymore?"
"Up there," she said, twirling her hand toward the ceiling.
"Oh."
Her nose twitched under the mask. Her eyes watered behind her glasses. Suddenly, she grabbed tissues and disappeared behind a curtain. And then she began to wail.
Another employee in a blue mask emerged to finish painting my fingernails. Meanwhile, I could hear my nail technician taking deep breaths behind the curtain. She appeared, relaxed, sans pink mask.
"I'm sorry. I got sad," she said. "We had a restaurant. A Vietnamese restaurant. I cooked."
We made eye contact for a few seconds. She gave my hand a squeeze and then held it up to dry in front of a fan clipped to her table. My chest felt warm.
When it was time to leave, we waved. Then she covered her face, blending in with other employees whose job required distance while getting very close.

Texto completo: Re: "Our View: Holidays a good time to reach out to former Mainers" (Nov. 25):
The editorial penned by the Portland Press Herald Editorial Board about bringing back Mainers shows exactly how out of touch the liberal media in this blue state is.
I guess if you work in Portland and travel back and forth from your tony enclaves, you have little grasp on what is happening to our state.
Maine is one of the highest-taxed states in the country, and now liberal lawmakers want taxpayers to pay an income to every single person in this state. It is also a state with more poor people than wealthy. Middle-income earners bear the major brunt of well-meaning liberal policies and ideologies that are overburdening them.
Take a look at very liberal California and you will see where we are headed. It's not very inviting for young people just starting out.

Story wrong about Death with Dignity Act
The front-page Nov. 24 article "Together, a Brooksville couple left the world, provoking a debate about death and choice" raises important issues worthy of ongoing public debate. Unfortunately it is in error where it states, "It was only a few months ago that Maine passed the Death with Dignity Act, which allows physicians to administer lethal medication to terminally ill patients."
In fact, the Death with Dignity Act allows doctors to write a prescription for an expectedly lethal dose of medication to a patient who has been carefully screened by strict criteria (including life expectancy of less than six months and ruling out mental illness), and who requests it. The patient must self-administer the medication.
This is an important distinction and is central to understanding the controversy raised by the article. Control over death rightfully remains a topic of much public debate, which should be informed by correct information.

Collins working hard, but not on our behalf
FedEx lobbied in earnest for the corporate tax rate reduction that was part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, and one of the senators they lavished attention on was Susan Collins, The New York Times recently reported. FedEx's political action committee has given Sen. Collins the maximum contribution allowed for 11 years, according to the Maine Beacon.
Their efforts paid off handsomely, as Sen. Collins cast a pivotal vote to pass the tax bill, allowing FedEx to pay $0 tax in fiscal year 2018. Like most corporations that benefited from the tax bill, FedEx used its windfall to buy back its own stock and increase dividends to shareholders. "Overall business investment during Mr. Trump's tenure has now grown more slowly since the tax cuts were passed than before," the Times reported.
Collins told NBC's "Meet the Press" that the tax cut act would "actually lower the debt." Now we know that the economy will run trillion-dollar deficits for years to come, the Times reported in August, because of this giveaway to corporations and the wealthiest people in America.
Collins voted for the tax cut act even though the elimination of the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate was part of the bill. Eliminating the mandate weakened one of the underpinnings of the ACA by allowing people to opt out without penalty, ensuring that those left in the health care marketplace are older and sicker, driving up health care costs to everyone.
Remember all this when Sen. Collins tells you how hard she's working for Mainers.

GOP pays lip service to those who serve us
The Republicans pretend that they have the utmost respect for people in the military and others who put their lives on the line for this country. Their history tells another story.
Remember Valerie Plame Wilson, the CIA agent whose husband, Joseph Wilson, wrote a New York Times op-ed showing that George W. Bush had provided false information to Congress in order to convince them that war with Iraq was necessary?
After that, Karl Rove, Richard Armitage and Scooter Libby (who worked for Dick Cheney) outed Ms. Plame as a spy, which put her and other CIA agents in jeopardy. For a number of decades, the only thing the Republican leadership has cared about is getting what it wants when it wants it.
And now we see that same sort of thing happening in this impeachment inquiry. President Trump and Republican House members treated Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch as if she were a traitor. They treated Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman as if he were a Ukrainian spy.
Moreover, they cry that the president is not allowed to defend himself. But this is not a trial. It is basically a grand jury hearing, and defendants can't defend themselves during grand jury hearings. If he is actually impeached, Trump will have ample opportunity to defend himself. He will be tried before the Senate, whose members will be acting as a jury.
Until then, if he continues to tweet and interfere, he only proves the Democrats' point that he should be impeached.

Apple, Bowing to Russian Pressure, Redraws Its Map of Crimea

Texto completo: The tech giant, following Google and others, has bowed to Russian demands that its apps not show Crimea as belonging to Ukraine on digital maps seen in Russia.
MOSCOW -- Since it grabbed Crimea from Ukraine five years ago, Russia has made no headway in getting the United States or the European Union to recognize the annexed Black Sea peninsula as Russian.
But Russia's Parliament is now rejoicing at getting at least Apple to fall partly into line. When viewed from inside Russia, Apple apps show Crimea as part of the Russian Federation and separated from Ukraine by an international border.
This means that Apple has joined Google, Yandex and some other technology companies in redrawing Ukraine's borders to satisfy Moscow's territorial claims, at least for customers viewing their maps on devices inside Russia. Viewed on devices outside Russia, Crimea remains part of Ukraine.
Unlike printed maps, online cartography can shift, providing alternative realities to comfort the likely political leanings of the viewer and the policies of his or her government. This means that borders over which armies and diplomats have battled for centuries are no longer entirely static but often follow a course that exists only in the eye of the beholder.
"Our situation with Apple has now been resolved," Vasily Piskaryov, the chairman of the security and anticorruption committee of the State Duma, Russia's lower house of Parliament, said on Wednesday. "We see that everything has happened the way we wanted it."
Mr. Piskaryov told the Interfax news agency that his committee would continue to monitor Apple apps to ensure "there is no going back" to previous maps that showed Crimea as part of Ukraine or as a territory belonging to neither Russia nor Ukraine.
Leonid Levin, the head of the Duma's Information Policy Committee, told the news agency that Apple "has demonstrated a wish to preserve and develop its position on the Russia market." He added that the company's decision "to bring the state of its cartographic services into compliance with the requirements of the legislation of Russia can only be welcomed."
Ukraine protested Apple's cave-in to Russia, with its foreign minister, Vadym Prystaiko, writing on Twitter that the company should "stick to high-tech and entertainment" and stay out of politics. "Global politics is not your strong side," he said.
The Ukrainian Embassy in Washington also voiced dismay that Apple had accepted Russian claims. In a post on Twitter, the embassy said that occupation did not confer sovereignty and noted that Ukrainians were "not giving any thanks to @Apple this #Thanksgiving."
The United States and the European Union imposed sanctions on Russia over its seizure of Crimea, and both still view the peninsula as part of Ukraine.
Crimea is mainly Russian-speaking and inhabited mostly by ethnic Russians, but it was recognized by Moscow -- and all other capitals -- as belonging to Ukraine until Russia changed its mind in 2014.
After sending "little green men" -- Russian special forces in uniforms stripped of identifying insignia -- to seize Crimean government buildings, it held a referendum that endorsed the change. Russia hailed the vote as an act of democracy, but the West viewed it as window-dressing for an unacceptable military aggression.
Apple had been negotiating with Duma representatives since May over what the Russian Parliament had denounced as its "inaccurate" maps of Crimea. Apple did not respond to requests for comment on the Crimea decision.
Ukraine has struggled, with considerable success, since the 2014 annexation of Crimea to prevent the appearance of maps in foreign print publication that suggest the peninsula belongs to Russia. But it has had far less success online, where frontiers often change depending on where they are being viewed from.
And Russia is not the only country that has raised such a fuss over cartography. China has for years waged much the same battle over Taiwan, insisting that the self-governing island be shown as part of the People's Republic of China.
A growing number of American companies have in recent months tried to appease Beijing by recognizing its claims over Taiwan. Last year, the clothing retailer Gap issued an apology to China after a map on a T-shirt sold in North America did not depict Taiwan as part of China.
China has also been successful in getting Apple to tailor the iPhone ecosystem to suit Beijing's demands. Apple regularly removes apps that run afoul of Chinese laws. These sometimes include apps that connect users to gambling or pornography, but also include the apps of foreign news outlets like The New York Times and even Apple's own news app. Apple has also removed apps that would let users leapfrog the country's censorship controls.
Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, said at a conference two years ago that he disagreed with some Chinese policies but that Apple must comply with the law wherever it operates.
"Each country in the world decides their laws and their regulations, and so your choice is: Do you participate? Or do you stand on the sideline and yell at how things should be?" he said. "You get in the arena, because nothing ever changes from the sideline."

Texto completo: Feral hogs are "exploding" throughout the United States. Could we be next?
Chew on this while you’re waiting for the turkey to come out of the oven: The feral hogs are coming!
Or not. It depends on how much you fret about foreign invasions.
Feral hogs — also known as wild boars, feral swine, razorbacks, Russian or Eurasian boars or, my favorite, piney woods rooters — wandered into the news this week when my hometown Buxton Police Department posted on its Facebook page an alert to be on the lookout for “Free-Ranging Feral Hogs (or) Escaped Domestic Pigs.”
The good news: They’re not here. Yet.
The not-so-good news: They number around 6 million across 38 states and cause an estimated $1.5 billion in property damage each year.
The truly horrific news: On Sunday a passel of feral hogs attacked and killed a 59-year-old Texas woman while she walked from her car to the front door of an older couple for whom she worked as a caretaker.
“We haven’t seen any,” Buxton Police Chief Troy Cline reassured me Wednesday. “I haven’t heard or had any reports of any.”
The Facebook warning was posted by Buxton’s animal control officer, who each year passes on a U.S. Department of Agriculture notice that the feral hog population continues to expand and that it’s up to each and every one of us to sound the alarm should one waddle into our neck of the woods.
A little history: Pigs in the New World go all the way back to the 16th century and Christopher Columbus, who introduced them on his second voyage to the West Indies to ensure a stable food supply for future expeditions.
They haven’t stopped multiplying since.
From domestic hogs that escape their farms and quickly revert to wild behavior, to hunting clubs that import boars from Europe and Asia, to hybrids of the two, the feral hog population in the United States has tripled over the last 20 years. As one expert noted to the New York Times back in 2013, it’s nothing short of a “national explosion of pigs.”
The USDA posts annual distribution maps showing the hogs’ mostly northward migration. And that’s where things get interesting: Since 2004, the maps have shown feral hogs in a small cluster of counties straddling the New Hampshire-Vermont border. More on that in a minute.
Here in Maine, both the USDA and the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife stand guard against feral hogs in search of the way life should be.
Kendall Marden, a regional wildlife biologist with IF&W, said in a telephone interview Wednesday that no feral hogs have yet come to his attention. Still, he said, they are “certainly a concern in portions of the country and we want to be prepared for things, given the impact they can have.”
To that end, Maine has a “memorandum of agreement” with federal agencies and others that spells out the appropriate actions should feral hogs decide to invade. Which, with climate change and all, they might do were Maine to have a winter with little or no snow. (I know, it’s almost December and the ground is still bare. See where I’m going here?)
As for the marauders already at our doorstep, Marden referred me to Corbin Park, a little-known, secretive hunting preserve that covers 25,000 acres in central New Hampshire.
Also known as the Blue Mountain Forest Association, the 40-square-mile hunter’s paradise was founded in the late 19th century by Austin Corbin, a railroad and banking baron. Yearning for a place to hunt exotic species near his boyhood home of Newport, New Hampshire, he bought up some 60 local farms and erected a fence around the entire parcel.
Next, Corbin paid a small fortune to populate his new playground with elk, moose, buffalo, antelope, caribou, reindeer, bighorn sheep, pheasants, Himalayan mountain goats and, last but not least, wild boar.
The uber-exclusive hunting club — scant media coverage it’s attracted over the years puts the membership at just 30 — remains to this day. And while the animals are penned in, the USDA notes on its National Feral Swine Damage Management Program website that “feral swine are strong, clever, and if motivated or agitated can destroy most fences.”
Meaning Maine is cheek-to-jowl with a biological time bomb?
Not quite.
“Pigs don’t naturally disperse a lot,” Marden said. “They tend to stay in their native home ranges.”
Still, assuming they can conquer the White Mountains, those Corbin Park hogs — or any others already out there in the wild — could wreak havoc on Maine if they ever get the urge to go east.
According to the USDA, feral swine carry all sorts of harmful organisms and pathogens that are easily passed on to humans and can cause “leptospirosis, toxoplasmosis, brucellosis, tularemia, trichinellosis, swine influenza, salmonella, hepatitis and pathogenic E. coli.”
And while last weekend’s fatal attack was, according to The New York Times, only the fifth in the United States over almost two centuries, the USDA nevertheless warns, “Feral swine have been aggressive towards and even attacked farmers, golfers, hikers, and picnickers. Aggression can be increased when they associate people with food because of handouts and improper waste disposal.”
They can also cause untold damage rooting through crops and gardens and rubbing against small trees — their way of shedding parasites as they pass through someone else’s private property.
Heck, they even “have the potential to destroy artifacts and history which can never be recovered or replaced,” the USDA says.
So, what to do?
In places where feral hogs already roam, the USDA has studied strategies ranging from “harassment” (which only sends them to your neighbors’ back yard) and “ground shooting” (you’ll never get them all) to “aerial gunning” (effective but expensive) and “contraception” (oral or single injection — either way, wear your running shoes).
Meaning, should they move to Maine, there’s a battle plan in place.
Here in Buxton, Chief Cline was at first a little confused as to why I and another reporter called this week to talk about feral hogs. An equally perplexed Animal Control Officer Adele Jones explained to him that it was the Facebook post, which she’s somehow managed to put out each year until now without media detection.
But now that he knows about those dirty, not-so-little pigs, Cline was pleased to hear that the state and federal governments are both on it. In fact, should feral hogs someday march to the sea, Maine even has an action plan.
“Maybe I need to put an action plan together,” the chief said with a chuckle. “Just to be on the safe side. Then Buxton will be all set.”
On to the turkeys.

Texto completo: To the Editor:
Re "Finding the Tools to Spot, and Fight, Intolerance in Schools" (news article, Nov. 24):
Having examined this disturbing phenomenon in my "PBS News Hour" series looking at solutions to racism, let me hasten to say that intolerance is a worrisome development that is germinating in the underbelly of our democracy. And like so many other troubling challenges, it needs to be called out every bit as much as interference in our electoral processes, if not more.
Our children are our future, and while in my reporting I have found that our history -- that is, the history of all our people -- is not being taught in most schools these days, the need to combat malicious memes that are trying to fill that gap needs all the attention it can get.
Our union may never be perfect, but we owe it to our children to educate them perfectly.

Texto completo: Many people joining the newsroom are digitally savvy and helping media with a digital transition, says Theodore Kim, who runs fellowships and internships.
How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Theodore Kim, director of newsroom fellowships and internships, discussed the tech he's using.
What are your most important tech tools for doing your work and finding people to recruit?
There's lots of interest in working at The Times, and there are periods when I have to spend hours sifting through applications. Last year, our newsroom fellowship program drew some 5,000 applicants.
So I power through them with a company-owned MacBook Pro at work and my personal MacBook Pro at home. Also a necessity: a 27-inch, 4K LG monitor on my work desk, which I use to spread out multiple job applications onscreen.
The Google suite of apps is critical. I collaborate with some 70 editors over the course of our yearlong fellowship program, and we deploy just about every kind of shared document there is.
In addition, I'm a regular user of headphones during the workday. I pop in Apple AirPods for mobile calls or to listen to podcasts. I also have a pair of fancier Beats Studio 3 noise-canceling headphones that I put on when I require absolute silence or if I want to lose myself in the sounds of Miles Davis.
What surprises you about how younger interns use tech? Anything new you've never heard of?
On the whole, I think young people use much of the same tech we all do. But I often see them use it so much faster and smarter, certainly, than I do.
I'm talking about simple things like mastering keyboard shortcuts, being able to type with thumbs really fast or having the ability to sprint through on-screen menus and dialogue boxes with no hesitation. Only people born with digital devices in their hands have that kind of tech familiarity.
You've had several roles at The Times, including helping with our transition to digital. What stood out to you as the biggest differences between how we used to publish and how we do things today?
The biggest evolution is how stories move through the reporting and editing process. That cycle used to be: Reporter reports and writes. Editors edit. And voilà! It's published in print and online.
But now baked into that process is a layer of sophisticated digital thinking: What story form should we use? What headline might best capture the essence of my piece? Is my topic searchable? Do we even need to do a written story? Let's do a podcast instead.
There is now so much information in the world that all media companies, even the biggest ones, are re-evaluating what they bring to the table. It's about asking ourselves what our value proposition is. And for The Times, our value comes from doing unique, high-impact journalism that is told in ways that sync up with how people are actually consuming content.
You're a bit of a gear head. What are your favorite gadgets, and what do you do with them?
Oh, gosh. Where do I start?
I definitely fall into the category of "early adopter." Our house is an Apple Store in miniature. At home, we shuffle between two MacBooks and an iPad Pro. I'm on my second Apple Watch, fifth iPad, seventh iPhone and, I think, 10th Mac. Every drawer in our house has some kind of Apple dongle in it. With all the money we've given to Apple, I'm pretty sure we've paid for at least part of Tim Cook's private jet. Surely one of the winglets.
Beyond the Apple stuff, the gadget I use most often is the new Kindle Oasis, Amazon's 10th-generation e-reader. For my money, it matches printed paper in clarity and experience. I think I've owned the last seven generations of Kindles. They are like a fine wine in reverse: The new ones just get better and better.
We also have a smattering of Google products around our home: a Nest thermostat and a Nest security system, a Google mesh Wi-Fi network and a Google Home speaker. Our daughter, 8, and son, 3, have grown quite adept at asking the Google Home funny questions. Our son is barely potty-trained but is already astute enough to declare with the proper volume and inflection, "Hey, Google, play 'Kids Bop'!"
It's both adorable and, candidly, a little unnerving.
But our pride and joy from a home gadget perspective is our basement home theater. My wife and I love movies, but we don't get out to the theater as often as we used to because of the kids and all of our other commitments. So we invested in a 65-inch Sony OLED television. It's mesmerizing, better than all but the best movie theaters we've been to.
In addition, we installed a Sony audio system that projects theater-quality surround sound, including above the listener, as well as a 4K disc player and an Apple TV 4K. While streaming video is obviously the future, there's still nothing like the jaw-dropping, sonic quality of physical 4K discs. All of our A/V tech, meantime, is connected together with AudioQuest Cinnamon cables. (Yes, good cables really do make a difference in high-end video and audio, and I will die on this hill!)
We all look forward to family movie nights. We're probably the only family on the block that insists on watching "Hotel Transylvania 3" in Dolby Cinema-quality picture and sound. Or maybe just Dad insists on it.
You're also into digital photography. With the progress that smartphones have made in camera tech over the last several years, do you use a normal camera much these days?
I have the new iPhone 11 Pro (of course). To my eyes, it has the best camera of any phone. That's useful to me as I take many, many photos. I attended a family wedding recently and took only my iPhone, leaving my DSLR at home. The iPhone yielded pretty good results, especially in capturing 4K video.
Yet as advanced as it is, the new iPhone still doesn't beat even a low-end DSLR camera, particularly with photos involving motion. I have a full-frame Nikon DSLR camera that I often tote with me on trips or special occasions. I've used Nikons for so long that they feel like an extension of my arm.
I sometimes get looks when I take out my Nikon zoom lens, which is the size of a small Chihuahua. But we're still a few years away from phone cameras achieving the magazine-quality images of the best cameras. When that day comes, and if my purchase history is any guide, I'll be first in line to get one.

Texto completo: Puerto Rico sigue recibiendo trato de segunda clase por parte del gobierno federal.
Un informe del New York Times indica que la ayuda de la Agencia Federal para el Manejo de Emergencias (FEMA) para la recuperación de Puerto Rico y las Islas Vírgenes de Estados Unidos se estancó a dos años del paso de los huracanes Irma y María.
Datos de la agencia indican que en Puerto Rico apenas se han financiado 190 proyectos de recuperación de los 9,000 que fueron procesados . En las Islas Vírgenes se dio fondos a 218 de las 1,500 solicitudes.
Los números están por debajo de los 3,700 que se entregaron en Texas por el huracán Harvey, también de 2017. Una cantidad similar se financió en Florida.
Para muchos es una clara muestra de la manera de cómo el gobierno federal ve a los ciudadanos de los territorios que no son Estados.
“Odio hacer la distinción entre estadounidenses y no estadounidenses, pero al final de cuentas no estamos siendo tratados de la misma manera que otros estadounidenses están siendo tratados”, dijo al Times Dyma Williams, directora del hospital Gov. Juan F. Luis de St. Croix en las Islas Vírgenes.
FEMA se defiende con el argumento de que cada desastre natural es diferente en muchos aspectos.
“Comparar desastres engaña al pueblo estadounidense”, dijo Jeffrey Byard, administrador asociado de FEMA. “Cada evento tiene un conjunto único de circunstancias, y los números por sí solos no pueden y no proporcionan una imagen completa de lo que se necesita para ayudar a las comunidades a recuperarse”.
La explicación no es suficiente para funcionarios electos en Puerto Rico y en Estados Unidos .
“Desde el primer día, justo después de que María llegó a Puerto Rico, ha habido un estándar diferente sobre cómo respondió la administración a Harvey e Irma “, dijo la congresista de Nueva York Nydia M. Velázquez , quien denunció que su propia hermana no tuvo energía en la isla de Vieques durante 13 meses.
En tanto, la Casa Blanca, en cabeza de Donald Trump, siempre ha culpado a la corrupción en Puerto Rico por la lenta asistencia. Sin embargo, el Times hizo una comparación de casos de corrupción entre 2008 y 2017 y encontró que en Texas los números triplican a los de Puerto Rico.

Coup in Bolivia, bias in U.S. media

Texto completo: "Army generals appearing on television to demand the resignation and arrest of an elected civilian head of state seems like a textbook example of a coup," says Alan Macleod in a Nov. 11, 2019 article published by FAIR (Fairness & Accuracy in Reporting). "And yet that is certainly not how corporate media are presenting the weekend's events in Bolivia."
Anyone with even a limited knowledge of the relationship between the United States and Latin America can most likely recognize a familiar pattern in the Bolivian coup: a popular, democratically elected left-wing government violently overthrown by right-wing opposition with the help of the military, police forces, funding from elites — and, of course, some nudging from the superpower to the north. The ousted president, Evo Morales, the first indigenous president of Bolivia, "drew the great ire of the U.S. government, Western corporations and the corporate press, who function as the ideological shock troops against leftist governments in Latin America," Macleod says.
In typical propagandistic fashion, the mainstream media haven't covered the coup in Bolivia as a coup at all. They have not discussed how the far-right paramilitary leader Luis Fernando Camacho marched into La Paz and promised to put "God back in the presidential palace" (the hatred felt by right-wing fundamentalist Christians in Bolivia toward the indigenous population is ignored by the Western press in general, as might be expected.) They have not discussed the racist past (and present) of the right-wing self-proclaimed president Jeanine Áñez, who called Bolivia's indigenous citizens "satanic."
As a matter of fact, one can point to specific examples when the mainstream media has outright supported the coup or at least attempted to justify it. Take, for instance, CNN, which "dismissed the results of the recent election, where Bolivia gave Morales another term in office, as beset with "accusations of election fraud," presenting them as a farce where "Morales declared himself the winner." The New York Times showed their devotion to the corporate agenda in Bolivia by "presenting Morales as a power-hungry despot who had finally 'lost his grip on power,' claiming he was 'besieged by protests' and 'abandoned by allies' like the security services."
"Delegitimizing foreign elections where the 'wrong' person wins, of course, is a favorite pastime of corporate media," Macleod says.
It is worth noting that "there was no coverage at all in U.S. corporate media of the detailed new report from the independent Washington-based think tank CEPR, which claimed that the election results were 'consistent' with the win totals announced."
While in office, Morales and the Movement toward Socialism party "managed to reduce poverty by 42% and extreme poverty by 60%, cut unemployment in half and conduct a number of impressive public works programs." The success of Morales' government is a crime that the U.S. and its right-wing allies in the south cannot not leave unpunished, and so we are witnessing yet another coup, even if the media won't call it that.

Texto completo: The rate of births fell again last year, according to new government data, extending a lengthy decline as women wait until they are older to have children.
WASHINGTON -- The fertility rate in the United States fell in 2018 for the fourth straight year, extending a steep decline in births that began in 2008 with the Great Recession, the federal government said on Wednesday.
There were 59.1 births for every 1,000 women of childbearing age in the country last year, a record low, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. The rate was down by 2 percent from the previous year, and has fallen by about 15 percent since 2007.
In all, there were 3,791,712 births in the country last year, the center said in its release of final birth data for 2018.
Fertility rates are essential measures of a society's demographic balance. If they are very high, resources like housing and education can be strained by a flood of children, as happened in the postwar Baby Boom years. If they are too low, a country may find itself with too few young people to replace its work force and support its elderly, as in Russia and Japan today.
In the United States, declines in fertility have not led to drops in population, in part because immigration has helped offset them.
The country has been living through one of the longest declines in fertility in decades. Demographers are trying to determine whether it is a temporary phenomenon or a new normal, driven by deeper social change.
Fertility rates tend to drop during difficult economic times, as people put off having babies, and then rise when the economy rebounds. That is what happened during and after the Great Depression of the 1930s. But this time around, the birthrate has not recovered with the economy. A brief uptick in the rate in 2014 did not last.
"It is hard for me to believe that the birthrate just keeps going down," said Kenneth M. Johnson, a demographer at the University of New Hampshire.
Mr. Johnson estimated that if the rate had remained steady at its 2007 level, there would have been 5.7 million more births in the country since then.
The decline in 2018 was broad, sweeping through nearly all age groups, and reflected a long, gradual shift in American childbearing to later in the mother's life. The rate fell most steeply among women in their teens -- down 7.4 percent from the year before. Births to teenagers have fallen by more than 70 percent since 1991.
Women in their 20s had fewer babies last year as well. Historically, women in their late twenties usually had the highest fertility rates of all, but they were overtaken in 2016 by women in their early 30s, reflecting a trend of later childbearing throughout American society.
The only age groups that recorded increases in fertility rates in 2018 were women in their late 30s and early 40s.
"It's clear that the traditional age-fertility pattern that held for Baby Boomers and Gen X women is shifting," said William Frey, senior demographer at the Brookings Institution.
He noted that more than half of women who had children in their late 30s last year had college degrees, according to the new data -- a much larger proportion than among women who had children in their late 20s.
That could be a clue that deeper social forces are at work. A generation of millennial women appears to be delaying having children even longer than Gen X women and Baby Boomers did, to get on a firm footing professionally and financially before starting a family.
"The data suggest that people want to establish themselves before having children," said Alison Gemmill, a demographer at Johns Hopkins University. "They also want to make sure they have adequate resources to raise quality children."
Other sweeping social changes have accompanied the delay in childbearing. New data from the Census Bureau show that the median age of first marriage is now 28 for women and nearly 30 for men; in 1970, the median ages were 21 and 23, Mr. Frey said.
"This is a far cry from the 1950s, or even the 1980s and the 1990s," he said.
The fertility decline may seem alarming, Professor Gemmill said, but a lot about it is good. Teen pregnancy is way down, as are unintended pregnancies, which had long set the United States apart from other developed countries. She noted that American women generally do have children eventually, and that childlessness is waning. By her mid-40s, the typical woman has had two children, she said.
"Is it a permanent shift? We just don't know yet," Professor Gemmill said.
If it is, she said, "there might be implications for society at large, say for funding Social Security -- but I don't think we are there yet."

B.Y.U.-Idaho Halts Plan To Stop Taking Medicaid

Texto completo: Brigham Young University-Idaho will once again recognize Medicaid as health insurance, reversing a decision earlier this month that would have forced students enrolled in the free government program to buy private coverage or drop out.
In an email message sent to students Monday night, the university apologized for "the turmoil caused by our earlier decision."
The change comes after The New York Times and other news outlets reported the university's policy change, which angered students and caught local health providers off guard.
Brigham Young University-Idaho, like many others, requires all students to have health coverage. But the decision this month to stop accepting Medicaid and direct students to enroll in private insurance was unusual.
The cheapest available option for many students is a school health plan administered by Deseret Mutual Benefit Administrators, which, like the university, is owned by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
That plan limits annual benefits and doesn't cover birth control -- provisions that would violate the Affordable Care Act, but for a little-noticed Obama-era exemption for universities that fund their own health plans. It also has a $ 1,608 annual premium for an individual.
The university's new policy was set to take effect Jan. 1, the same day Idaho will expand Medicaid to cover 70,000 low-income residents, including some college students. The state expected that about 2,400 people in Madison County, where the university is, would sign up for the program.
Connor Pack, a 26-year-old student on Medicaid, said he was "so incredibly overjoyed" to learn that the school had called off the policy change. "I no longer have to worry about being able to pay," he said. Mr. Pack, who works three part-time jobs in addition to his studies, was uncertain he could afford the premium and was considering reaching out to his family for help, he said.
While Mr. Pack is grateful that the university will continue to recognize Medicaid, he said, the experience has changed how he thinks about his school.
"My faith in the school is still pretty shattered," he said. "They never did give us a true explanation for why they made this decision. There is definitely some healing that needs to happen before my trust in them is restored fully."
The university had warned that having too many students on Medicaid "would be impractical for the local medical community." But a nearby hospital and doctors in the area rejected that assertion in interviews with The Times and other media organizations. A spokesman for the county-run Madison Memorial Hospital said his facility was "able to handle any growth that the university and the community would need."
In the email Monday night, the university said it was "grateful to the health care professionals in the area who provide services to Medicaid recipients."

‘No, I’m not the writer’: Former Mattis speechwriter denies he wrote 'Anonymous' book

Texto completo: Guy Snodgrass finally rejected rumors that he was the anonymous author of a tell-all book about the Trump administration.
Snodgrass, an ex-speechwriter for former Defense Secretary James Mattis, had tiptoed around rumors that he was the author of A Warning, a book that was written by the same anonymous author of a New York Times op-ed that claimed there were high-level White House advisers who were resisting President Trump.
The former speechwriter refused to directly answer whether he authored the book during a Monday interview on Fox News and tweeted, “The swirl continues” in response to a New Republic article suggesting that he could be responsible for the book and the op-ed.
The next day, Snodgrass joined CNN's New Day and shot down rumors that he had written the book after his repeated coy responses about the tell-all. Host Alisyn Camerota pressed him to give a straight answer, asking, “There’s been lots of speculation that it is you. What is your answer? Are you the writer?”
“No, I’m not the writer,” Snodgrass replied. “I got asked that. Evidently, that news popped before I went on to a different television show yesterday. They asked me the question. I kind of batted it away. I thought it would be asked and we’d be done. To put it to rest, no, I’m not the author of A Warning. I’m not the anonymous op-ed writer.”
Snodgrass, who recently released his book Holding the Line, said he would put his name on anything he wrote. “I put my name to it because I think it’s important. Readers need the opportunity to assess who wrote the material. Who wrote the book? What is their bias? Where do they come from? What is their background? Are they an expert?”
He said he has “no idea” who wrote the book and claimed there were no consistent rumors in the administration as to who is the anonymous author.
The White House brushed off the book and called the author a “coward.”

Ukraine whistleblower insists he discussed nothing of 'substance' with Schiff staff before filing complaint

Texto completo: The alleged Ukraine whistleblower did not disclose on his complaint form that he had met with a congressional committee despite contacting a House Intelligence Committee aide on Adam Schiff’s staff before filing the complaint because nothing of "substance" was discussed.
According to documents reviewed by CBS News, the whistleblower contacted the Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson on Oct. 8 to explain the details of his prior meeting with Democratic majority staff of the House Intelligence Committee before the complaint was filed.
In his Aug. 12 complaint, the whistleblower claimed President Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to order an investigation into a corrupt Ukrainian energy company that the son of his potential political opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden, was working for.
The follow-up contact with Atkinson happened three days after it was discovered he had not informed the ICIG of his communications with the Schiff aide before he filed his complaint. His contact with Atkinson happened on the same day news broke that he previously worked with a 2020 Democratic candidate, which was later reported by the Washington Examiner to be former vice president Joe Biden.
Confirming he had contacted the committee, the whistleblower claimed that nothing significant had been discussed and that the committee aide told him to go through official channels, according to the Oct. 18 "Memorandum of Investigative Activity" that was given to House and Senate Intelligence Committee leadership by Atkinson.
The memo described the committee aide telling the alleged whistleblower to: "'Do it right, hire a lawyer, and contact the ICIG.' So that is what the COMPLAINANT did. At the time, COMPLAINANT did not even know what the ICIG was."
According to the memo. the whistleblower believed that "based on getting guidance on a procedural question, and that no substance of the actual disclosure was discussed, COMPLAINANT did not feel, based on the way the form question was worded, that it was necessary to check that box." The whistleblower left the box blank, though it was required for him to provide who else knew about the complaint, on the whistleblower disclosure form.
On Sep. 19, Schiff denied to reporters he knew anything about the whistleblower report. But Republicans were already suspicious this was not the case, the Washington Examiner reported at the time.
By Oct. 2, the New York Times reported Schiff’s spokesman Patrick Boland claimed that the California congressman "learned about the outlines" of the whistleblower’s complaint prior to the whistleblower submitting it to the ICIG and other officials.
On Oct. 13, Schiff said that he should have “been much more clear” about the contact his committee had with the whistleblower. “I was referring to the fact that when the whistleblower filed the complaint, we had not heard from the whistleblower," he said. "We wanted to bring the whistleblower in at that time, but I should have been much more clear about that.”
More recently, on Nov. 13, when pressed by Ohio Republican Rep. Jim Jordan, at the impeachment hearings if he knew who the whistleblower was, Schiff claimed to not know the person’s identity who met with his staff and filed the complaint against the president with the ICIG.
“I do not know the identity of the whistleblower, and I’m determined to make sure that identity is protected,” Schiff said.

Career CIA analyst Eric Ciaramella, 33, who now works for the National Intelligence Council under the director of national intelligence, has been named as the Ukraine whistleblower. The whistleblower's attorneys have refused to confirm or deny this, and Ciaramella himself has not responded to questions from the Washington Examiner.
Republicans in the Senate are expected to try to compel Ciaramella to testify before a Senate trial should Trump be impeached by the House of Representatives. They argue that even if Ciaramella is not the whistleblower, he is a material witness because he was Ukraine director at the White House's National Security Council during the end of the Obama administration and the beginning of the Trump administration.

The incredible wastefulness of Mike Bloomberg

Texto completo: Bloomberg's colossal waste Former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg finally entered the Democratic presidential race on Sunday. To make up for lost time, his campaign has announced $30 million in initial television advertising, a $100 million ad campaign in key battleground states and a $15-million voter-registration drive in those states. That's an enormous sum " and a colossal waste compared to how else he could spend it.
It's hard to overstate the size of the mountain the Bloomberg 2020 train is trying to climb. Political history is littered with late entrants who fell short; you have to go back to Robert F. Kennedy in 1968 to find a tardy candidacy who met with sustained success. Bloomberg's plan to largely skip the early primary contests is bold given that no Democrat has won the nomination without winning delegates in Iowa or New Hampshire. His favorability numbers among Democrats are worst-in-the-field, likely thanks to his past support for controversial policies such as 'stop and frisk.' And even if he does somehow win the nomination, there's little polling evidence that he'd be a stronger general election candidate than other Democrats.
Smarter targets for the billionaire's largesse abound. Bloomberg could, for example, reprise his 2018 political spending, when he spent $41 million on House races and $112-million overall. The former mayor's own team touted his money's effectiveness in a New York Times feature, with even outside experts agreeing that the spending probably gained Democrats several House seats. And with 2020 a far more favorable Senate map for Democrats, tens of millions from Bloomberg could go a long way toward flipping the upper chamber.
Or Bloomberg could jump into state-level races again. As with Congress, Bloomberg is aware of his spending power in state races: This year, he spent $2.5 million for pro-gun control candidates in Virginia's legislative elections, which ended with Democrats in total control of the state government for the first time in 26 years. In contests where campaign expenditures are usually in the tens or hundreds of thousands, $30 million " let alone $100 million " spread across several states would be a game-changer.
Or Bloomberg could spend his millions to back specific causes, as he has in the past with gun control. For example, if he supports impeaching the president, Bloomberg could specifically back vulnerable House incumbents who are facing anti-impeachment ad blitzes.
Let's be clear: That any American can exert this much political influence with his or her personal fortune is fundamentally undemocratic. But so long as the Supreme Court's conservative majority preserves the fiction that money is speech, the least we can ask is that those Americans fortunate enough to wield such power do so wisely for good causes. Any of the three causes " Congress, impeachment or state legislatures " would likely have a better return on investment than a long-shot presidential bid.

Texto completo: It’s like asking O.J. Simpson for advice on how to be a good member of society or Bernie Madoff for counsel on financial ethics. Why on Earth does the liberal media still expect anyone to listen to what the architects of the Iraq War have to say about the Middle East?
I found myself asking this question after former Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz took to the op-ed pages of the New York Times on Nov. 21 to lecture Americans about how terrible President Trump’s Syria policy is, and what the administration could do to turn things around. Why the Times would provide Wolfowitz — a driving force behind the Iraq War, the worst U.S. foreign policy blunder since the Vietnam War — with such a high-profile platform is a mystery. One possible explanation is that they’re so anti-Trump they’ll platform anyone willing to blast the president.
If you care to read the full piece, have at it. But the basic argument Wolfowitz makes is that the United States would be dangerously naive to walk away from Syria and create a vacuum that would inevitably be filled by nefarious actors who hate us. In his words, “Walking away from that region has a way of sucking America back in. American strategy needs to protect our critical interests but at sustainable costs.”
Wolfowitz, of course, would know plenty about sucking the U.S. into the region. He did it quite well during his time in government.
To the long-time national security bureaucrat, a solid Syria strategy apparently means sitting in place next to Syria’s oil fields and providing the Kurds with the muscle they need to strike a permanent political arrangement. That Syrian dictator Bashar Assad has largely won the war and has no incentive whatsoever to compromise his position either eludes Wolfowitz completely or is conveniently ignored for the sake of his argument.
Frankly, we should just we roll our eyes at Wolfowitz’s argument because his judgment has proved absolutely awful. He may continue to have admirers in certain corners of the Beltway, but our misadventures in Iraq and Wolfowitz’s central role in the tragic failure should have shut the door on whatever credibility he might have once had.
Sure, everybody deserves a second chance, and people make mistakes every day. But Wolfowitz’s series of mistakes couldn’t have been any bigger or more detrimental to our position in the Middle East. The public record is quite clear: On issue after issue during the lead up to the U.S. invasion of Iraq and its aftermath, Wolfowitz’s judgment was terrible. He's the last person we should take our lead from now.
Before 9/11, Wolfowitz advocated for a plan that would have not only placed northern and southern Iraq under U.S. military protection but would have also created a new governing entity called a “Free Iraq” out of whole cloth. The plan was derided by then-Secretary of State Colin Powell as ludicrous, and the idea went nowhere.
Wolfowitz was fixated on removing Saddam Hussein long before he was confirmed as the Bush administration’s number-two official in the Pentagon. The 9/11 attacks provided him with additional room to make his case.
In his recently-released memoir, The Back Channel, former Deputy Secretary of State William Burns recalls hearing about Wolfowitz’s lobbying for a pro-regime change strategy in Baghdad during a National Security Council meeting held at Camp David less than a week after the 9/11 attacks. The idea was brushed aside and viewed by even President George W. Bush at the time as a step too far.
Until it wasn’t. A year later, the Bush administration was set on pushing Saddam aside. Wolfowitz was a key Bush administration official who made the intellectual case to the American public for why the war was necessary and why it wouldn’t be as difficult as (much wiser) detractors in the State Department were saying.
On March 27, 2003, Wolfowitz testified to the House Appropriations Committee that the operation wouldn’t cost the American taxpayer very much.
"There is a lot of money to pay for this that doesn’t have to be U.S. taxpayer money, and it starts with the assets of the Iraqi people,” he told lawmakers. "We are talking about a country that can really finance its own reconstruction and relatively soon.”
That, too, turned out to be a ridiculous assessment. Operation Iraqi Freedom winded up costing the American people over $800 billion and perhaps as much as $2 trillion when taking into account veterans’ benefits and healthcare costs.
So, a question for the liberal media: Why would Paul Wolfowitz’s counsel on Syria be any better than his advice on Iraq a decade prior? Don’t expect the New York Times to come up with a good answer anytime soon.

Texto completo: A fraught moment for a newsroom that, its editor in chief says, will not do in-depth investigations of Mike Bloomberg or any other Democrats running for president.
Get ready to cover the boss's presidential campaign, with some caveats.
That is the message roughly 2,700 journalists at Bloomberg L.P., the financial data company owned in large part by Michael Bloomberg, received on Sunday morning after Mr. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City, formally announced his candidacy for president as a Democrat.
"We will write about virtually all aspects of this presidential contest in much the same way as we have done so far," John Micklethwait, Bloomberg Editorial and Research's editor in chief, said in the memo, in which he always referred to Mr. Bloomberg simply as "Mike."
"We will describe who is winning and who is losing," Mr. Micklethwait added. "We will look at policies and their consequences. We will carry polls, we will interview candidates and we will track their campaigns, including Mike's. We have already assigned a reporter to follow his campaign (just as we did when Mike was in City Hall). And in the stories we write on the presidential contest, we will make clear that our owner is now a candidate."
But, the memo said, Bloomberg's outlets, which also include Bloomberg Businessweek and several industry-specific sites, will not do in-depth investigations of Mr. Bloomberg -- or any of his Democratic rivals.
On Sunday morning, the main Bloomberg website featured an article by Mark Niquette about Mr. Bloomberg's entry into the "crowded 2020 Democratic field."
This unusual policy of avoiding in-depth investigations of the Democratic field echoes the similarly unusual way that the outlet covered Mr. Bloomberg's 12-year tenure in City Hall as well as its practices regarding rivals of Bloomberg L.P. As an internal guide instructs: "Bloomberg News doesn't originate stories about the company" or cover Mr. Bloomberg's "wealth or personal life." (But, the memo added, Bloomberg would not change its coverage of President Trump so long as he is not a direct rival of Mr. Bloomberg's.)
Mr. Micklethwait also said that several journalists in the opinion section would take leaves of absences to join Mr. Bloomberg's campaign. They include Timothy L. O'Brien, the executive editor of Bloomberg Opinion, and David Shipley, the senior executive editor. Mr. Shipley was previously an editor at The New York Times opinion section, and Mr. O'Brien, also a former Times editor and reporter, is known for his 2005 biography of President Trump. The section's unsigned editorials will go on hiatus, the memo said, and a note on the Bloomberg Opinion website said it would not accept outside op-ed articles about the campaign.
MSNBC also confirmed that Mr. O'Brien would no longer be a network contributor while he is working on the Bloomberg campaign.
The moment is fraught for one of the most prominent global newsrooms in the country, which now has to document the candidacy of its owner, one of the richest men in the world -- one who has mused about selling his holdings if he ran for president. Mr. Bloomberg said last year: "I don't want the reporters I'm paying to write a bad story about me. I don't want them to be independent."
Mr. Micklethwait acknowledged the uneasy relationship in his memo. "There is no point in trying to claim that covering this presidential campaign will be easy," he said, "for a newsroom that has built up its reputation for independence in part by not writing about ourselves (and very rarely about our direct competitors)."
Michael Grynbaum contributed reporting.

Unknown, but It Shouldn't Be

Texto completo: Lee Myung-se's "Nowhere to Hide" from 2000 is a cops-and-gangsters movie unlike anything you've seen before.
When I saw the name of the series coming up at Film at Lincoln Center -- "Relentless Invention: New Korean Cinema, 1996-2003" -- I thought that it would probably include the greatest unknown movie of the century so far. Sure enough, it does.
All right, let's stipulate that saying a movie is the "greatest unknown" this or the "most underrated" that is a problematic enterprise. Unknown by whom? Underrated compared to what?
So where do I get off singling out Lee Myung-se's crime thriller "Nowhere to Hide," which opened in New York 19 years ago?
To begin with, there's a good circumstantial case. A hit at Sundance, the recipient of buoyant reviews (including one from Elvis Mitchell in The New York Times), "Nowhere to Hide" virtually disappeared after its opening. The screenings at Lincoln Center on Nov. 25 and 30 appear to be the film's first in New York since a single showing at the Korean Cultural Center in 2004.
Lee's own fade was nearly as quick. After "Nowhere to Hide" he had an unproductive American sojourn, which led to a six-year gap between pictures. His last feature -- only his eighth -- came out in 2007, when he was 50.
Lee is not a director concerned with making an audience comfortable. His movies are not obscure or difficult, and they mostly avoid the grimness and violence associated with the new wave of South Korean cinema. But they disregard expectation. (To say that they defy it would falsely imply that Lee gave any thought to it at all.) Whether he's working in romantic comedy or horror or swordplay, Lee answers only to the visual and tonal ideas that interest him.
"Nowhere to Hide" -- his only venture into the popular Korean genre of the gangster film -- may be both his most singular and most accessible movie. It slips back and forth from high-octane chase to slow-motion slapstick ballet to noirish, rain-soaked romance, the way an old-fashioned Hollywood musical changes up song styles.
It's open about its influences, serving them up omakase-style: the John Woo course, the Sam Peckinpah course, the Wong Kar-wai palate cleanser. (The closing scene is a twofer, saluting both Carol Reed and Robert Altman.) It's a straightforward story about a cop's grinding pursuit of a murderous mobster, and it's simultaneously Lee's demonstration that he can do anything he wants at any moment and not lose his audience.
And he wastes no time demonstrating it. "Nowhere to Hide" begins with two short, utterly contrasting, equally enthralling sequences that whipsaw you into happy submission. The black-and-white opening introduces the two cop heroes, Woo (Park Joong-hoon) and Kim (Jang Dong-gun), in roiling, syncopated action that has the looks and rhythms of comic books and 1990s music videos.
Then, four minutes in, Lee changes everything. Depicting the killing that sets the plot in motion, he empties the screen, focusing on a Busan landmark, a steep urban staircase down which a lone schoolgirl hops. Rock music gives way to the plaintive Bee Gees ballad "Holiday" and the pace slows accordingly. Around the gray stairs is a wash of brilliant, almost painfully saturated color, dominated by a blanket of yellow autumn leaves. The percussive, pulpy violence of the opening is replaced by a close-up of a single blade flashing down and a bright streak of blood across a face. In a fleeting visual coup, black-suited gangsters appear on the stairs, clambering up from the bottom of the frame like two-dimensional figures in a brush painting.
And then boom, we're in yet another movie, though this time it's the one Lee more or less sticks with. Woo, who wears his cockiness like a uniform, walks into a noodle shop and throws some attitude at another customer. "Think this is a cops-and-robbers movie?" the weary proprietor asks at the very moment that "Nowhere to Hide" becomes a cops-and-robbers movie. The other customer, who happens to be the killer, disappears out the back of the shop.
At this point, the plot kicks in, and Woo, Kim and their team of latter-day Keystone Kops spend the balance of the film -- 72 ever more frustrating days, in movie time -- pursuing the gangster, Chang (Ahn Sung-ki). Chases, interrogations, stakeouts and near-misses bring them steadily, incrementally closer to the inevitable showdown.
Lee's virtuosity never flags, and it also never gets wearying. Every idea seems to come along in the right place, at the right moment -- a nighttime fight that morphs into a shadow play, with the combatants' flat black images flowing across a white wall like Balinese puppets; a rolling, slow-motion, freeze-framed melee that anticipates a signature scene four years later in Park Chan-wook's "Oldboy"; a dusty road trip ending in a barbershop standoff straight out of a western (either Hollywood or Hong Kong).
If you can negotiate the shifting tones and rhythms, Lee's guerrilla-like inventiveness will keep a nearly constant smile on your face. That "Nowhere to Hide" isn't quite like any other cop-and-gangster movie explains why you probably haven't seen it. Once you have, the genre will never feel quite the same.
Nowhere to Hide Monday and Nov. 30 at Film at Lincoln Center, Manhattan. Not rated. In Korean, with English subtitles. Running time: 1 hour and 52 minutes; filmlinc.org.

Texto completo: Coaches and female athletes alike decry unhealthy training regimens and attitudes.
To the Editor:
Re "Stop Abusing Female Athletes" (Op-Ed, Nov. 18):
Lauren Fleshman is right to call for greater scrutiny of girls' running.
I've written about high school running for decades and covered the 1998 championship event in which Ms. Fleshman competed. Five years earlier, I wrote a front-page story in The New York Times ("Girls Cross Country Taking a Heavy Toll, Study Shows") that brought national attention to the issues involving the intersection of girls' training, eating habits and adolescent growth patterns. The study in my article found that among 60,000 athletes surveyed, girls' cross-country had the highest incidence of injury of any sport.
Today, most coaches are aware of proper training methods and good nutrition. But the lure of college athletic scholarships (or even a professional contract) may cause some elite-level girls to seek unhealthy thinness as the ticket to high-stature programs. This mind-set is worsened by the internet, in which top runners are fawned over and videos and a selfie culture can distort what healthy running even among high achievers should be.
A key to stemming the "abuse" that Ms. Fleshman refers to is for parents to take a role. Parents should know what their daughters (and sons, for that matter) do at practice, and prepare healthy meals at home that support their youngsters' growth.
Girls should be taught to take pride in robust athletic bodies and excellence in the long term, with or without a college scholarship.
Marc Bloom
Princeton, N.J.
The writer, a high school cross-country coach, is the author of "Amazing Racers: The Story of America's Greatest Running Team and Its Revolutionary Coach."
To the Editor:
Lauren Fleshman is right: Coaches who create ruinous team cultures that allow or even reward disordered eating among girls should be fired. She's also wise to advocate a hall of fame for those coaches who build athletes over the long term.What she misses are the outside influences on girls that even the most conscientious and health-conscious coaches are up against.
As a high school cross-country coach who works with girls, I sense that my preaching about eating well and building strength has little effect on young women who have grown up in a culture that prizes skinniness for women. I would also like nothing more than to take my time building the running capacity of the girls I coach, so that they can blossom in college or beyond.
But patience is in short supply, and many teenage girls feel pressure to excel now -- to impress a college coach, placate an ambitious parent or move up the ladder on some silly state ranking.
Coaches aren't the only ones responsible for the mess that female athletes have to contend with. In fact, sometimes we're the ones trying to hold the line against the forces outside the gym that threaten them most.
Linda Flanagan
Summit, N.J.
To the Editor:
I am a female runner, cyclist and tennis player. I'm not a professional athlete, but I am a product of the same harmful sports system that professional female runners are speaking out against.
Though I am an athlete for the love of sport, part of the fun is trying to improve my results. Like the high school track-and-field champion Mary Cain (Video Op-Ed, nytimes.com, Nov. 7) and others, I had also been indoctrinated with the idea that to do so I should be as lean as possible and push my body as hard as possible.
Last year, when I was 32, that mind-set caught up with me. I had back surgery to remove a massive disc herniation. I may have permanent nerve damage and chronic pain for the rest of my life.
Had I been equipped with more knowledge about the needs of the female body, and a training ethos that prioritized long-term women's health and well-being, this injury could have been prevented.
Lauren Fleshman wrote that our sports system is not built for girls. If it were, it would look different and benefit everyone. This is true for professional female athletes, and everyday ones like me.
I am grateful for the bravery of America's top female runners in speaking out and hopeful for the new chapter to come.

Texto completo: Peter A. Mobilia, Jr., 70, of Windsor and formerly Hartford, passed away on Thursday, November 21, 2019 at St. Francis Hospital after a brief illness. Born in Hartford on October 18, 1949, he was a son of the late Peter A. Mobilia, Sr. and the late Mildred (Montano) Mobilia. He is survived by his brother, Dominic A. Mobilia of Bloomfield and was predeceased by his sister-in-law, Barbara F. Mobilia. Peter was a graduate of Emerson College, Boston, where he earned a Bachelor of Science in Speech degree, majoring in mass communications. He retired in 2012 as a member of the public relations staff at St. Francis Hospital and Medical Center, Hartford after a 25-year career at that institution. Previously, he spent 19 years as a radio and television broadcaster, most recently serving as chief correspondent at WPOP News Radio 14, Hartford. While at WPOP, his 1984 documentary on the 40th anniversary of the Hartford Circus Fire, "Someone Yelled Fire!," received awards from the Associated Press, United Press International and the Connecticut Society of Professional Journalists. Since then, the broadcast has been cited as a reference in at least two books on the 1944 circus fire, the worst disaster in the history of Hartford. While serving as executive news producer at KGBT-TV in Harlingen, Texas, his documentary on what was, at the time, the world's largest oil spill, "The Saga of Ixtoc Uno," received the Texas Association of Broadcasters' award for distinguished local programming in the public interest. A video tape of the broadcast was subsequently accepted for the permanent collection at the Museum of Broadcasting in New York. He also served as an adjunct professor of broadcast journalism at the University of Hartford and was a free-lance contributor to the New York Times Connecticut Weekly section. Peter was a founding board member of Fresh Start Pallet Products, a community initiative which employs economically disadvantaged Hartford residents in building furniture from discarded wooden shipping pallets.
Graveside services will be held on Wednesday, November 27th at 10:15 a.m. at Mt. Saint Benedict Cemetery (Section R), 1 Cottage Grove Road, Bloomfield. There are no calling hours. Donations in Peter's memory may be made to Saint Anthony's Guild, 144 West 32nd Street, New York, NY 10001-3202. The D'Esopo Funeral Chapel, Wethersfield has been entrusted with arrangements. To share a memory of Peter with his family, please visit www.desopofuneralchapel.com.
This is a paid death notice.

Texto completo: My Mom died Tuesday. As much as I admire her 92 years of life, I remember as a kid thinking life had cheated her at times.
Lois Evaughn Schembs was born on a farm outside of Remington, Indiana, on Jan. 28, 1927, to farmer Jesse Schembs and his wife, Floretta Casey. Mom never said they were poor, but she did tell stories of running to the outhouse in the middle of winter nights and being happy to find a Sears catalog instead of just corn cobs. She’d heat an iron in the fire and use it to warm her bed sheets, but she’d still wake up some mornings to find the water frozen in her glass next to the bed.
She was so smart as a child, she skipped second grade. Then she got scarlet fever and missed so much school, she had to repeat third grade. Good in math and English, she was salutatorian of her Class of 1945 at Remington High School, where she also played the drums.
Of course, old classmates of hers just called her "the prettiest girl in school." They say she should have been queen of the Fountain Park Chautauqua in Remington, but the judges declared it a tie and Mom lost the coin flip.
Second in her class. Second to the queen. And second-class citizen when it came to education, I thought. College was never an option for her, so she took a job in bookkeeping with Sherman White and Co., a buyer of farm goods in Goodland. That’s where she met my dad, Willy Constable, on the day he came home from World War II and stopped by in uniform to see his sister, who introduced him to my mom. He was more than 10 years older, and Mom remembers being mortified when he wore his fedora on their first date to the movie theater, as if he were an old man.
Dad proposed on their third date. Three years later, Mom accepted. But first, she and her younger sister, Dorothy, crossed the Atlantic Ocean in the steerage compartment of a steamship for a grand adventure in Ireland. That took courage. Mom came home and married my dad on March 13, 1950, on what happened to be the first day in weeks that it was too wet for farmers to work. The last-second nuptials meant Willy’s father, Bert, skipped the wedding to attend his previously scheduled town board meeting. A rainy spring extended my parent’s honeymoon.
Mom gave birth to daughters Sally and Nancy, and then me and my brother, Bill. Mom insisted that all of us kids learn to play piano and sing alongside Dad and her in the choir at the Goodland Presbyterian Church. My sisters played organ and piano for church and countless weddings. My brother became a gifted musician and keyboard player who charmed crowds with his music. As the only person in my family who never got paid to perform music, I might be the only kid in history whose mother asked him to stop taking piano lessons. We both thought that was a good idea.
Mom and Dad were key members of the South Newton High School Production Company and got all of us kids interested in theater. They took us to Christmas concerts at Purdue University. They also had good seats for Boilermaker football games, where we’d wrap our feet in plastic bread wrappers to keep warm and Mom would open her stash of homemade chocolate-chip goodies only when our team needed her "third-down cookies." Her only attempt at athletics was standing on her head on her birthdays.
Mom quizzed us on current events and political news at supper and set up an Electoral College voting system for family decisions, with everybody getting votes depending on age. A parental bloc defeated any move by the minority children, but any split opened the door for new alliances. Mom filled our home with books, music, humor and love.
An avid reader, political junkie and crossword wiz, she used to quote from New York Times stories and talk about writing her own book. "I’d call it ‘Hamburger and Sex,’" she said. "Because I know hamburger, and I need sex to make it sell."
In addition to cooking our meals and running the household, Mom was the driving force in getting all four kids to go to college. But she didn’t just inspire her own kids. She had an uncanny ability to draw people to her and consider her their second mom. People confided in her about sexual issues, drugs, abuse, alcoholism and dreams.
She lived on a farm in a conservative, heavily Republican, all-white community, but became a go-to person for anyone from outside those boundaries. She and Dad visited Jimmy Carter’s church in Plains, Georgia. Mom and her friend Ruthann were once in a photo on the front of The Indianapolis Star talking with Jesse Jackson after they made the trip to hear the civil rights leader speak. Mom donated to Barack Obama, slapped an Obama bumper sticker on her car in 2008, and probably deserves credit for making Indiana a blue state that year. No one so much as teased her.
Once we kids were out of her hair, she focused more on herself. She and her friends had frequent Lunch Bunch outings.
In her 70s, she took art classes and became an accomplished watercolor artist, winning a couple of ribbons and landing one piece in a juried art show.
She got back to her drums, too, playing snare drum in the Newton Jasper Community Band from her early 70s through her late 80s.
Lovely and elegant are words often used in descriptions of her. Always polite, Mom never swore or spoke badly about anyone. She never let us kids say the S-word, whether that meant "stupid" or "shut up."
She cared for the old ladies in the church. She cared for her parents. She cared for my dad before he died in 2003. She cared for my brother before he died in 2010. She cared for others her whole life. My thoughts about what she could have been if she had been given the chance vanished. Life didn’t cheat her of opportunities. It let her forge her own.
She had grace, smarts, love and a wonderful life. And we were lucky to be part of it.

Texto completo: HONG KONG — As the government accelerated mass detentions of Muslim minorities in northwest China, a senior official issued a secret directive giving detailed orders for how the rapidly expanding indoctrination camps holding them should be managed.
Guards should impose pervasive, round-the-clock video surveillance to prevent escapes. Inmates were to be kept isolated from the outside world and held to a strict scoring system that could determine when they might be released. And the facilities were to be shrouded in secrecy, with even employees banned from bringing in mobile phones.
“It is necessary,” the directive from two years ago said, “to strengthen the staff’s awareness of staying secret, serious political discipline and secrecy discipline.”
Now that secrecy has been shattered with the publication of the directive itself. It is one of six internal documents obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists that shed new light on China’s crackdown in the Xinjiang region, where a million or more ethnic Uighurs, Kazakhs and others have been detained in the past three years.
The disclosure of the 24 pages of documents amounts to a second significant leak from inside China’s ruling Communist Party related to the crackdown. A member of the Chinese political establishment shared a different, 403-page set of internal papers with The New York Times earlier this year, expressing hope that it would make it more difficult for party leaders, including President Xi Jinping, to escape culpability for the mass detentions.
While the source of the new documents is unknown — they were provided by Uighur overseas networks — their disclosure may amount to another sign of dissent in the party over the crackdown.
The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, an independent nonprofit based in Washington, led the inquiry into the documents, bringing together more than 75 journalists from the consortium and 17 partner organizations, including The Times, in 14 countries. Outside experts also reviewed the papers and concluded they were authentic.
“In terms of documentary evidence, we have reached a next level of disclosure,” said Adrian Zenz, a researcher who has studied the camps and a senior fellow in China studies at the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation, a human rights group in Washington. “The evidence we have now is very comprehensive, very complete. It’s kind of game over for Beijing in terms of the cover-up, the denials and the half-truths.”
The most significant of the new documents is the secret directive on how to manage the camps, which is the only document in both sets of leaked papers to describe the inner workings of these facilities. The nine-page order was issued in November 2017 by the Communist Party committee in Xinjiang that oversees legal affairs.
The papers also include four “daily bulletins” from another regional party committee that provide information about those that have been targeted for investigation and detention in camps and a court judgment sentencing a Uighur resident to 10 years in prison on charges of inciting ethnic hatred and discrimination, a vaguely defined crime.
‘Prevent Escapes’
Beijing has rejected criticism of the camps and described them as job-training centers that use humane methods to fight the spread of Islamic extremism. Internally, the government often uses language consistent with that position. The leaked directive, for example, refers to the camps as “vocational skills education and training centers” and the detainees as “students.”
But it also lays bare the punitive underpinnings of these facilities, and some of its language on guarding against escapes and other incidents is identical to that used in guidelines for prisons and other detention sites.
The orders called on guards to strictly control and monitor the activities of students. “Prevent escapes while they are at class, dining, using the toilet, washing, receiving medical care or meeting with family.”
Other instructions call for erecting guardhouses and internal partitions inside the camps to prevent inmates from moving around freely; rigorously checking any people, vehicles or goods entering, and recruiting informants to spy on other detainees.
“Evaluate and resolve students’ ideological problems and abnormal emotions at all times,” the directive said.
The document included orders for “full video surveillance coverage of dormitories and classrooms free of blind spots,” and prohibited detainees from having contact with the outside world, except in strictly monitored interactions.
The government says these sites help prevent Uighurs and other Muslims from being drawn to religious extremism by teaching them the Chinese language, job skills and how to be law-abiding citizens. In response to the earlier leak of documents, the government argued that its methods have effectively stifled extremist violence in Xinjiang.
Former detainees, though, have described the classes as numbing, harsh and ultimately futile attempts at brainwashing. And residents have been sent to internment camps for behavior that would be commonplace elsewhere: traveling abroad, showing signs of religious devotion, praying regularly or growing a long beard, or installing certain cellphone apps, such as encrypted messaging tools.
One of the leaked daily bulletins orders an investigation of people from Xinjiang who have obtained foreign citizenship or applied for visas or other documents at Chinese embassies abroad.
Another describes how 15,683 “suspicious persons” were sent to centers in southern Xinjiang on the week of June 19, 2017. The government has repeatedly refused to say how many people are being held in these camps.
Other bulletins reveal how the authorities settled on targets for detention by using databases that collect and collate information on Xinjiang residents, especially Uighurs and other Muslim minorities.
The daily bulletins and the document on camp operations were signed by Zhu Hailun, who was then the top security official in Xinjiang. He was assigned to another position in the regional legislature early this year.
Zhu, 61, appears to have been a key enforcer of the internment campaign, turning the orders of the regional party secretary, Chen Quanguo, into detailed plans. A party official who spent his career in Xinjiang, Zhu had previously served as the head of Xinjiang’s capital, Urumqi, succeeding an official who was fired in 2009 after bloody ethnic riots killed nearly 200 people, most of them Han Chinese.
‘Promote Repentance’
The directive on camp operations instructed officials to keep extensive records on detainees, and described a scoring system that measured how they behaved to determine their fate.
Inmates should be assigned to one of three zones based on how dangerous they are judged to be — general management, strict, and very strict, the document said. But detainees could be moved between the grades of control depending on their scores.
“Break down scores and manage and individually assess the students’ ideological transformation, study and training, and compliance with discipline,” the document said.
Officials were told to assign inmates to fixed positions in dormitories, classes, lineups and workshops, and to control every detail of life inside the camps, at every moment of the day, including wake-up, meals, studies and showers.
Detainees must meet “disciplinary demands” or face punishment, the directive added.
“Strengthen the management of the students’ hygiene,” it said. “Ensure that they get timely haircuts and shave, change and wash their clothes. Arrange for them to have baths once or twice a week, so that they develop good habits.”
The demands listed in the directive echoed the accounts of former detainees like Orynbek Koksebek, an ethnic Kazakh man who spent four months in an indoctrination camp in Xinjiang after being detained by the Chinese authorities in December 2017.
“There was military discipline in everything we did, how you walk, stand up straight. If you didn’t, they would slap you,” he said in an interview in the Kazakh city of Almaty earlier this year.
A key disclosure in the leaked directive is an official description of the conditions that detainees must meet to be released from the camps. Aside from achieving a good score in the point system, the document said, inmates must be categorized at the lowest threat level and have served a minimum term of one year — though interviews with former detainees indicate that camps sometimes release people sooner.
The directive also emphasized the importance of showing remorse. Discussions with detainees should “promote the repentance and confession of the students for them to understand deeply the illegal, criminal and dangerous nature of their past behavior,” it said.
A different document, among the set shared with The Times earlier this year, described how family members outside the camps are told that their behavior can also affect when a detainee is released — a implied threat aimed at silencing complaints.
Zharqynbek Otan, who was held in a camp for seven months after his arrest in January 2017 and has since fled China, said the goal of the detention was to impose loyalty to the Chinese state.
“The main purpose is to brainwash you,” he said, “so you forget your roots and everything about Islam and ethnic identity.”

Texto completo: "I care not who casts the votes of a nation, provided I can count them," a New York Times editorial quipped in 1880. The editorial was poking fun at imperialism. Nevertheless, the old quote strikes at the heart of a new debate about the Electoral College – to say nothing of recent news headlines.
Everyone seems pretty certain that one or the other political party is interfering in U.S. presidential elections.
In the midst of so much turmoil and distrust, why would some Americans want to give even more power over elections to the federal government? Yet Electoral College opponents advocate for it, seemingly without realizing what they are doing.
Make no mistake: If the Electoral College is eliminated, the powers of incumbent presidents and their administrations will be vastly increased.
Democrats who are working to end the Electoral College should stop and think about that statement again: They do not trust Donald Trump. Yet they are working to give him more power over his own reelection and the election of his successor.
The Electoral College is, at its heart, a decentralized, state-by-state presidential election process. States determine the logistics of Election Day, access to the ballot, recounts and other, similar issues. Meanwhile, the federal government must take a back seat because the Constitution gives the national government only a limited role to play at election time.
Notably, while the Constitution grants Congress some authority in elections, the executive branch is left out in the cold: Presidents have no direct power over their own reelections.
Consider how things would change if the country were to eliminate the Electoral College and move to a single, national presidential election instead. A federal government that once played a secondary role would now sit in the driver's seat. All election matters would be subject to federal control. Such changes would be necessary because of the altered nature of the election: Instead of 51 statewide election pools, in which each state and Washington, D.C., selects its own electors, American voters would all be thrown into a single national election pool.
A new federal election code and bureaucracy would be needed to ensure that voters are being treated equally, even across state lines. It is easy to imagine a new Department of Elections to oversee the administration of the federal election code and a president appointing someone to run it. Presidents who chose to run for a second term would enjoy a nice luxury: The person in charge of their reelection would also be a person beholden to them for a job as secretary of Elections.
Americans are already worried that institutions such as the FBI or the State Department are being used inappropriately. Perhaps they are, and such abuse of our institutions should be addressed. Yet how much easier would it be for an incumbent class of federal officials to legally influence election outcomes if a Department of Elections and a U.S. Election Code were in charge of every aspect of presidential elections?
How fortunate that the Founders created something different, ensuring that checks and balances exist even within our presidential election system. No incumbent has too much authority over his own reelection. He can't rig the system by pushing for federal regulations that tip the scales in his own favor.
This is a healthy state of affairs.
Electoral College opponents blast the system as outdated, archaic and unnecessary, but their criticisms reflect a misunderstanding of the Founders' objectives as they drafted our Constitution.
The Founders sought to create a constitutional structure that would allow Americans to be self-governing, despite the imperfections of human nature. They knew that people can be selfish, greedy and too ambitious. They knew that power corrupts. Their constitutional system of checks and balances – including the state-by-state presidential election process – was designed to protect against these human flaws.
Efforts to eliminate the Electoral College fly in the face of this history. They would place unchecked power in the hands of a few.
Americans deserve better.

Mark Ruffalo on playing not a superhero but a real one, 'Dark Waters'

Texto completo: For Mark Ruffalo, “Dark Waters" is more than just another film. The conspiracy thriller from director Todd Haynes (“Carol," 2015) stars Ruffalo as Rob Bilott, the former corporate defense attorney who unveiled the vast wrongdoings of chemical giant DuPont over an investigation spanning nearly 20 years. Anne Hathaway and Tim Robbins costar.
Ruffalo sought to produce the film after reading a 2016 New York Times Magazine feature about Bilott, who took the legal case of West Virginia farmer Wilbur Tennant, whose cows kept dying of a mysterious illness.
The release of “Dark Waters" on Friday comes at the tail-end of Ruffalo's own decade-long journey into clean water activism, which began in 2008 when gas companies started poking around his Catskills town for potential drilling. While the “Avengers" actor remains a vocal anti-fracking activist, he visited Capitol Hill this week to testify on the dangers of PFOA and PFAS, the so-called “forever chemicals" at the heart of the scandal in “Dark Waters."
Reached by phone on Wednesday, the 51-year-old actor discussed taking on Washington, working with Haynes, making the Academy Award-winning “Spotlight" (2015), and more.

Q. This is a story you specifically set out to tell after reading the Times piece on Rob Bilott. What made you think: I need to adapt this?
A. Well, it was one of the biggest corporate crimes in American history. And it's been decades of cover-up, and not even I knew about it — and I like to think of myself as environmentally savvy. But I also saw it as [the story of] a working-class community pushing for justice. Wilbur Tennant was one of these classic characters, an American icon. And I recognized his fight against [DuPont] as the same fight with fracking, with climate change, with Exxon. I recognized in it a much bigger story about who we are as America, and what our economic values are.

Q. Coming from The Boston Globe, I have to ask about “Spotlight." Was your role as [investigative reporter] Michael Rezendes top of mind when approaching the role of Rob Billot?
A. Those two characters are very similar to each other — they both believe in people. They both believe that when people hear the truth they will do the right thing at the end of the day. Both men are different from me in that way — I'm probably a little more cynical, but they've seen way more than I have, and they've maintained their beliefs. But I loved “Spotlight," and I felt the healing and corrective power of that film. I'm interested in those kinds of experiences as a filmmaker.

Q. You've worked with so many visionary directors in the past — Lisa Cholodenko, Martin Scorsese, David Fincher — that it comes as no surprise you'd want to work with Todd Haynes. Yet Haynes has never made anything like “Dark Waters" before.
A. It was 100 percent him as a filmmaker and the way he handles his characters and the world of his stories. One of my managers floated Todd to me early on, and I stopped on his name and said, “That's really interesting." Certainly there were other directors that were better suited at first blush . . . but he tells stories about marginalized people who are living in these oppressive systems, with creeping paranoia, and that was the story I wanted to tell. And I couldn't be happier with what he did. It's masterful. He's a goddamn masterful filmmaker.

Q. So what was it like finally working with Haynes?
A. I love him; we had such an amazing collaboration on this. He is so gentle and kind, and creates the safest space to work in. There's no one that works harder or is more prepared than he is. And his aesthetic is everywhere in the movie — [even in] what kind of food processor is in the kitchen as time goes on in the Bilott house. This story could be dry, but he balances everything without ever losing the attention of the audience, even while [focusing on] a character that's modest and reserved.

Q. “Dark Waters" consistently uses motherhood and images of new life to emphasize how damaging PFOA is to future generations. Were you thinking of your own three children [now ages 12, 14, and 18] when approaching the film?
A. Absolutely. Part of my whole journey into activism was about my children. We were living in upstate New York, and there was going to be fracking everywhere. And when I came to find out what it did to water, I said, “I don't want my kids growing up around that. I don't want that in my neighborhood." And that's what we have to center on right now — all of us. What is the next generation going to have to deal with? How do we listen to them, take their concerns to mind, and make the world a better place for them? So that was really important to me, and that was true to Rob's story as well.

Q. Are you hopeful the film and your activism surrounding it will make a difference in EPA regulations?
A. Actually, after yesterday [on Capitol Hill], I'm hopeful. I don't think there are many issues you could talk about in Washington, D.C., right now that don't divide immediately into bitter partisanship. But I do feel like this is one place where there is real bipartisan work going on. And in the [current legislation] that everyone is negotiating right at this moment, there is a very strong chance that there is going to be some regulation passed on PFOA. And that will be the first time in 50 years. I really do think testifying on the Hill helped that. The visibility this movie has brought to PFOA has given politicians the cover to be able to fight for what's right in their constituencies against such a powerful force as DuPont.

Q. You've described Rob Billot as a real-life hero, and you've noted how composed he is. Did you find it challenging to present that anger and frustration under the surface of an incredibly reserved, understated person? Or did it come naturally from your work as the Hulk?
A. It was scary, actually. It's not what audiences are trained for in a hero. As an actor, you want to go for the Hulk moment, you want to go for the big, dramatic takedown of the big-time CEO. But that's not how Rob approached [those scenes]. I asked Rob, “Is this where you just got to tear him a new one?" And he was like “No, I felt like [the CEO] didn't know, and that if I just showed him what they were doing, and who the victims were, that he would do the right thing." And that's how we played it. And [the deposition scene] is probably one of my favorite scenes in the movie as a result. If I was left to my own devices, or my instincts as an actor, I would have played it much differently.

Q. What's next?
A. I produced a limited series for HBO called “I Know This Much Is True," with Derek Cianfrance directing. It's really, really good. So we're in post-production right now, and that's where the lion's share of my time is going. And I'm excited to get back to my family, who I've been away from for a long time — I need to reconnect to them.

Trump’s shameful intervention in war-crimes cases

Texto completo: SACRAMENTO – Many Americans are at least vaguely familiar with the My Lai massacre during the Vietnam War, which is a story of the evil that ordinary men can do. In 1968, U.S. troops were reeling from surprise attacks by the Viet Cong during the Tet Offensive and they unleashed their fury on the residents of a tiny village during a search-and-destroy mission.
American troops slaughtered hundreds of elderly people, women and children, with many of them under age 4. As History.com explained, some soldiers “stabbed, clubbed, and carved ‘C (for Charlie) Company’ into the chests of their victims; and herded them into ditches and blew them to bits with grenades.” Many of the company’s soldiers reportedly participated in the atrocities, but those who weren’t involved didn’t stop it. It was shameful.
People often know the name Lt. William Calley, who was the only serviceman convicted of a crime related to those events. He was sentenced to life in prison, but President Richard Nixon ordered his sentence reduced. Calley spent three years under house arrest and then went on with his life and apologized during a speech in 2009.
Sadly, few remember the name, Hugh Thompson, the helicopter pilot who helped stop the massacre. Even fewer realize that that Army covered up the attacks for 20 months, that some war supporters smeared Thompson and others treated Calley as a hero. The Army recognized Thompson’s heroism 30 years later, when it awarded him the Soldier’s Medal. But, apparently, the disturbing lessons of that event have long been forgotten.
Earlier this month, President Donald Trump pardoned a former Army lieutenant who was convicted of ordering his troops to fire on unarmed civilians. He granted a pardon to an Army major who had been awaiting trial for killing an Afghan man. Trump reversed the demotion of another officer, who had been acquitted of alleged war crimes charges but was convicted of a lesser charge of posing with a dead Taliban fighter.
Not even the worst allegations here came close to My Lai, but there’s a reason a number of writers have raised these parallels. Pentagon brass, who urged the president not to issue these orders, fear that the president’s actions will undermine the system of military justice. Gen. Martin Dempsey, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, tweeted that it signals “that we don’t take the Law of Armed Conflict seriously.” He called it an “abdication of moral responsibility.” He’s right.
“The tragedy of pardoning (Lt. Clint) Lorance isn’t that he will be released from prison – I’ve found room for compassion there,” Patrick Swanson, Lorance’s commander in Afghanistan told the New York Times. “The tragedy is that people will hail him as a hero.” Given some common public sentiments after My Lai, that fear is well-founded. Sure enough, Trump referred in a Tweet to one of the accused men as a “U.S. military hero.”
Is it fair to say that it’s now official policy that there are no rules of war, that the military’s process of enforcing those rules is a farce and that soldiers accused of committing crimes actually are heroes? We certainly should hope not.
There are practical reasons for opposing these pardons. They endanger our troops. If there are no limits in wartime, then our nation’s enemies don’t have to follow them, either. I understand that the other side rarely plays by Marquess of Queensbury rules, but that doesn’t mean that anything goes. By winking at bad behavior, we’re likely to get more of it from those in combat, which undermines America’s often-touted moral authority.
Our country claims to be different, to be a model for the rest of the world. Maybe not so much anymore. Common Dreams argued that the president’s action conforms to “a pattern of refusing accountability for violations of international law and a litany of war crimes over recent decades.” I don’t buy that leftist narrative, but why give fodder to those who do? The pardons stain the nation’s honorable service members by saying that they can’t be held responsible for their own actions. If they do atrocious things, well, boys will be boys.
The pardons also suggest that “Trump holds a dangerous, obsolete view of warfare – one that had fallen into disrepute after the horrors of World War II,” wrote Cornell law professor Jens David Ohlin, in a Washington Post column. “His actions suggest that he believes in ‘total war,’ in which warfare is conducted not only by professional soldiers but also by entire societies, including their civilians.” Indeed.
I’m pleased that Trump seems less likely than his predecessors to insert the nation into these messy, dangerous international conflicts that endanger our troops and have little bearing on our security. But in giving a pass to those few military members accused of war crimes, the president is reinforcing the kind of dangerous attitudes that led to My Lai.

Texto completo: After two weeks of compelling testimony in the House impeachment inquiry, it's worth weighing what has emerged. Four conclusions stand out.
First, there is now overwhelming testimony and evidence that affirm the deeply troubling revelation contained in President Trump's summary of his "perfect" July 25 phone call with the newly elected president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky. Mr. Trump withheld an important Oval Office meeting and nearly $ 400 million in urgently needed military assistance from Ukraine to compel Mr. Zelensky to open, or at least announce, two investigations -- one that would seek to exonerate Russia and dishonestly implicate Ukraine in interference in the 2016 election, and another that aimed to tar former Vice President Joe Biden with false corruption charges in relation to his work on Ukraine during the Obama administration.
Both of the long-sought investigations were based on manufactured and discredited allegations, and both served only one purpose: to advantage Mr. Trump politically. It is clear that Mr. Trump abused his power to extort bogus dirt on his chief rival for personal political gain.
Some allies of the president have insisted that this is no big deal because the United States routinely leverages White House meetings and assistance to obtain concessions from foreign governments. Yet they fail to acknowledge that such leverage is properly used only to advance American policy objectives -- not to service the personal interests of any individual, including the president. Thus, when Vice President Biden threatened to hold back economic assistance unless a corrupt Ukrainian prosecutor was removed, he was acting in support of bipartisan American, European and International Monetary Fund policy to curb official corruption in Ukraine. Mr. Biden did it openly, transparently and not, as Mr. Trump has falsely claimed, to protect his son Hunter.
Second, these hearings have amply demonstrated the extraordinary caliber and character of our nonpartisan career Foreign Service officers, civil servants and uniformed military personnel. The intellect, integrity, selflessness and sense of duty displayed by each of the officials who testified -- even in the face of harsh personal attacks and efforts at witness intimidation orchestrated by the president -- are extraordinary. They reflect the commitment to country that I witnessed every day for 16 years when I was privileged to serve alongside these kinds of apolitical officers.
Yet Mr. Trump and Republicans in Congress have denigrated and demeaned these public servants, placing them in physical danger -- just because they prioritized their duty to the law and the Constitution above slavish devotion to any president. Beyond this disgrace, the president and his acolytes are assassinating the collective character of all career public servants -- disparaging them as the "Deep State," "Never-Trumpers" and un-American.
In rhetoric that recalls the darkest days of McCarthyism, Republican leaders will seemingly stop at nothing to destroy public faith in our public servants. This is the very "deconstruction of the administrative state" that Steve Bannon, the former White House chief strategist, heralded as the administration's goal. And who wins when the State Department, intelligence and law enforcement agencies and the Pentagon struggle to attract and retain top talent? Not Americans. It serves only our adversaries who want to hollow out our bureaucracy, weaken our national institutions and discredit our democratic model.
Third, it is now abundantly apparent that most Republicans in Congress have abandoned all semblance of serving the national interest. Their desperate resort to distortions, discredited conspiracy theories and blatant lies to distract from damning facts that implicate President Trump has replaced any pretense of performing their duties. From attacking the press to smearing witnesses and refusing to engage in congressional oversight responsibilities, the Republican Party has sacrificed its principles and traditions to preserve its political power -- at the expense of our country.
Our separation of powers, the guard rail of our Constitution, fails when half the legislative branch abdicates its duty to hold the executive branch accountable. The cost of this failure will endure long beyond this presidency and is already signaling that our democracy is not only diminished but also increasingly dysfunctional.
And last, as Fiona Hill ably testified on Thursday, the primary beneficiary of our domestic dysfunction and divisions is President Vladimir Putin of Russia. Republicans in Congress are spouting Russian-sponsored conspiracy theories that disparage Ukraine and obscure Russian interference in our democracy. President Trump consistently takes actions with respect to NATO, Ukraine, Syria and elsewhere that accrue to Russian rather than American interests.
While Americans spew venom at one another, Russia is working overtime to pour salt into our wounds. Using social media every day to inflame distrust, fear and hate, Russia is pitting Americans against one another by fueling extremes on both sides of every divisive issue, whether race, immigration or guns.
Mr. Putin seeks to dismantle democracy and destroy America's standing as a global leader. The only question is whether we will allow him to succeed.

President Has Broad Power To 'Micromanage' Military

Texto completo: President Trump raised eyebrows when he reversed a decision to remove a convicted sailor from the Navy SEALs. But on military matters, a president has few limits.
In an October White House photo, President Trump presented the military's ultimate symbol of heroism, the Medal of Honor, to a dog. It was a joke, a doctored photo reposted on the president's Twitter account. But even though the president didn't actually award the Medal of Honor to a dog, legal scholars agree that as commander in chief of the military, he could have.
This week, Mr. Trump reversed the decision of the commander of the Navy SEALs to remove a convicted sailor from its ranks. The move prompted many to ask what the limits on the president's authority are to intervene in the military.
Military scholars say, they are few.
He could, hypothetically, also order all the Air Force's jets painted pink, appoint his chauffeur to an elite commando force or require all officers to wear long, red ties on Fridays.
"The president's power is very broad, he can micromanage in nearly anything in the military, no matter how trivial," said Eugene Fidell, who teaches military law at Yale Law School.
On Wednesday the Navy began a process to take the Trident pin of Chief Petty Officer Edward Gallagher, ousting him from the SEALs. Less than 24 hours later, the president reversed the order in a message on Twitter, saying, "The Navy will NOT be taking away Warfighter and Navy Seal Eddie Gallagher's Trident Pin. This case was handled very badly from the beginning. Get back to business!"
The announcement caught the military off guard, sending commanders from Washington to California scrambling as the Navy searched for clarity.
The president absolutely had the power to do it, Mr. Fidell said. He even has the power to pick people off the street with no qualifications and make them SEALs, he added, though nepotism laws might prevent him from giving the title to family members.
Presidential power over the military runs deep and hits up against just two limits, he said, Congress and the Constitution.
A president cannot create policies that violate constitutional rights. For example, Mr. Fidell said, the president could not block anyone of a specific race or religion from becoming a SEAL because of equal protection and First Amendment rights. A case challenging the president's decision to bar transgender recruits from joining the military is working its way through the courts now.
A president also cannot order the military to do something that violates a law enacted by Congress, such as the law that repealed the Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy, which barred gay troops from serving openly in the military.
But those two constraints leave a broad thoroughfare, crowded with ships, fighter jets and nuclear weapons, where the president has considerable discretion.
"Think of the implications," Mr. Fidell said. "I suppose it is possible he could tell the Navy who should be a pilot. And if the guy in charge didn't like it, he could fire him."
The president's power over the military is no mistake. Founding fathers knew the executive would need broad authority in war. But the real boundaries of what a president can do as a commander in chief in the day-to-day operations of the armed forces have never been tested, experts say, because since the beginning of the republic the presidency has given the military broad deference in how it runs its affairs.
"The Constitution is a very brief document; it leaves a lot unsaid. So for centuries the president and the military have had to rely on mutual understanding," said Thomas Bruneau, who taught national security at the Naval Postgraduate School. The president makes broad strategic and political decisions about military power, he said, and the military generally makes decisions on how those decisions will be executed, and by whom.
"This level of intervention at such a low level? I've never seen it," Mr. Bruneau said.
To be sure, presidents have sometimes involved themselves in the minutiae of making war. President Lyndon B. Johnson, for example, personally approved targets for B-52 bombing runs in Operation Rolling Thunder, during the Vietnam War.
But by and large presidents have steered clear of retail personnel actions like the decision to bestow or remove the Trident pin, so the question of whether it is legal has rarely been asked.
"I suspect a lot of Navy lawyers are trying to figure that out, themselves, right now," said Geoffrey Corn, a retired Army lieutenant colonel who teaches military law at South Texas College of Law.
Congress, he said, has some authority to enact statutes specifically limiting certain executive actions. For example, it could craft a law restricting the president's authority to assign troops in certain specialized units like the SEALs or other special operations forces to qualified military commanders.
But, he said, Congress has been careful not to create too many restrictions, concerned it might impede the ability to act in times of national emergency.
"For a long time the system has worked. The military and the president don't always agree but they have a trusting relationship," Mr. Corn said. The decision to override a Navy admiral in Chief Gallagher's case, he said, "sends a message that the president doesn't trust his commanders, and could really corrode that longstanding relationship."
He agreed that it was in the president's legal authority to restore a SEAL's trident. But he said it might be good for the president to heed advice he tells first-year law students: "Just because it's legal, doesn't mean it's right."

Texto completo: In this fictional conversation, the president chats with his wife at 3 a.m. and comes up with a tremendous idea.
July 2019. The White House -- 3 a.m. Donald Trump tosses and turns.
MELANIA: What's wrong, Donald?
TRUMP: I can't sleep.
MELANIA: (Turns the lamp on.) Why, what's bothering you? You can tell me.
TRUMP: No, no. I don't want to bother you with my problems.
MELANIA: Donald, I'm your wife. You can tell me anything.
TRUMP: O.K. ... The truth is, I just can't stop thinking about corruption in Ukraine.
MELANIA: Oh, honey.
TRUMP: It's killing me. I can't eat. I can't sleep.
MELANIA: Maybe you should take a Xanax.
TRUMP: I took two. It did nothing. The thing is, Melania, it's just so difficult for some of these post-Soviet countries to set up a functioning democracy, and corruption is at the root of that. It's endemic. These poor people who lived under the yoke of Communism for so long are thirsting for genuine democracy and. ... (He wells up.)
MELANIA: What, honey? What is it? Tell me.
TRUMP: I just need a second. (Melania hands him a tissue.) Thanks, I'll be O.K. I just feel so deeply for them. They're a brave, decent, honest people. They deserve so much more than they're getting. It's such a shame. I'll tell you one thing -- I'd like to get my hands on some of those crooks! That Zlochevsky -- I don't know what I'd do to him. You know I fought in the Golden Gloves? I could've been a professional boxer. I had many offers. Many.
MELANIA: I didn't know that.
TRUMP: Oh, yeah. My fights would be over so fast, I wouldn't even break a sweat. Didn't even take a shower. Sometimes my opponent would beg me to stop: "Please, please! Don't hit me anymore!"
MELANIA: I would've liked to have seen that.
TRUMP: Unfortunately, none of it's on video.
MELANIA: Yes, that is unfortunate. But Donald, listen to me. You can't keep going on like this.
TRUMP: I know. The whole thing sickens me. Honestly, I'm nauseous. And Ukraine has so many other problems. I just want to do everything possible to help the Ukrainians. But how can I if there's rampant corruption? I can't! I can't! (He slams his hand on the nightstand.)
MELANIA: Donald, don't! You're going to drive yourself crazy. You've got too many important things to think about here. Besides, that's Ukraine. It's a foreign country thousands of miles away.
TRUMP: That doesn't mean they're not entitled to good governance, to the best that man has to offer. It doesn't matter what country, or where it is -- everyone's entitled to expect more from their leaders. But this corruption -- it's shameful. Shameful.
MELANIA: There must be something you can do. After all, you're president of the United States. You're the most powerful person in the world.
TRUMP: Yes, but this is an internal matter. I can't just tell their president what to do.
MELANIA: You know, he used to be a comedian.
TRUMP: Yeah. I'm so much funnier than he is. You've seen the rallies. How funny am I? I get tremendous laughs. And I'm doing it off the cuff. It's not "material." None of these comedians can do that. Seinfeld. Chappelle. Rock. Theirs is all written. I'm improvising. I'm raw.
MELANIA: Maybe that's something you should think about doing when you get out of office.
TRUMP: You know what, not the worst idea I ever heard. I like it. ... (Gets an idea.) Oh my God!
MELANIA: What?
TRUMP: I got it. Listen. Ukraine needs military aid to fight the Russians, and I was going to give it to them. I was going to give them so much aid, they'd be thanking me for the next 20 years. They'd rename the capital after me. I wouldn't even be able to enter the country because they'd be draped all over my car. It would be adulation like you'd never seen because of this military aid package. I'm telling you, it's bigger than the Marshall Plan. It's a beautiful package.
MELANIA: O.K. What's the idea?
TRUMP: Suppose I make the military aid contingent on them rooting out all corruption?
MELANIA: Donald! How fabulous!
TRUMP: Fabulous, right?
MELANIA: Are you sure that's legal?
TRUMP: Of course it's legal. I'm going to get rid of corruption in Ukraine! How could anyone possibly object to that? And by the way, even if someone does object, I don't care. I'm doing something great for that country.
MELANIA: It sounds great.
TRUMP: You know what? I feel better. I knew I'd eventually figure out a solution. You know what I am?
MELANIA: A genius?
TRUMP: A stable genius. A very stable genius.
MELANIA: Goodnight, honey. This might be the most perfect plan you've ever had.
TRUMP: Yes, it's perfect.
MELANIA: (Turns out the light.) I'm so proud of you.
TRUMP: So am I.

Riveting, responsible and deeply unsettling, a first-rate film like Dark Waters is a rare and welcome chapter in the dramatic fabric of how one unlikely person can make a big dent in the world of social injustice. The movie is directed by talented, terrific Todd Haynes ( Far From Heaven , Carol ) and stars gentle but two-fisted Mark Ruffalo, whose position as a driven, real-life social activist offscreen has enriched many worthy causes onscreen, from the fight against sex abuse and pedophilia in the Catholic church ( Spotlight ) to AIDS ( The Normal Heart ) .
SEE ALSO: Mild and Silly, ‘The Shed’ Is Full of Laughably Contrived Scenarios
Ruffalo plays Robert Bilott, a lawyer in Cincinnati who finds himself accidentally embroiled in a case that has nothing to do with his field of expertise but forces him to take stock of his responsibility to animals, people and serving a better world. Like Julia Roberts in Erin Brockovich , about a single mother whose brave determination brought down a power company for poisoning the water supply of a California town, he’s inexperienced but aroused to action by a letter from a farmer friend of his grandmother’s in Parkersburg, West Virginia accusing a hugely powerful industrial corporation (in this case, DuPont) of killing off his cattle by spraying the local river with toxic chemicals and dumping them into his landfill.
Against the wishes of his wife (Anne Hathaway) and his boss (a skeptical but decent Tim Robbins), Bilott travels down to West Virginia to investigate. What he finds in his home town results in a complicated case of arrogant corporate corruption and negligence that challenges the boundaries of science, law, and the complexity of the legal system, but the meticulously researched screenplay by Mario Correa and Matthew Michael Carnahan, under Haynes’ engrossing direction, prunes away the clutter and chooses all the right images to keep everyone—environmentalists, humanitarians and movie fans alike—equally mesmerized.
Haynes leaves no stone unturned as he covers every detail in the labyrinthine case, including the reactions of the divided citizens of Parkersburg, some of whom are dying from hazardous DuPont chemicals in the water supply already. They label Bilott a hero; others are alienated because their income depends on DuPont and to them, money is life. The hazardous wastes that are darkening the water, we learn, are the chemicals the DuPont Corporation uses to make Teflon.
After the case dragged on for decades, nearly bankrupting Bilott and almost destroying his health and his career, the court revealed evidence that DuPont had been aware of the cancer-causing elements in Teflon since the 1970s but did nothing about it, so if nothing else, the big questions on your mind as the troubling Dark Waters draws to an inconclusive finale may very well be: should you throw away all the Teflon in your kitchen? Will you ever be safe again from your favorite frying pan?
After 20 years in court, DuPont finally paid out 600 million dollars to settle more than 3,000 lawsuits, but the poisonous elements used in Teflon are still an elemental component in the manufacture of cookware. The importance of this film belongs to a genre distinguished by Norma Rae , Silkwood , Marie , and even All the President’s Men .
Based on an article in the New York Times and filmed on the actual locations, with an exemplary cast that includes Bill Pullman, Victor Garber and the always heartbreakingly truthful Mare Winningham, Dark Waters also features many of the original Parkersburg citizens in the case playing themselves. Added authenticity is guaranteed. This is my favorite kind of film because it teaches you something, addresses issues, and seizes attention without ever losing its grip on the elements of filmmaking.
It’s a perfect movie, and not the least of its power is due to Ruffalo’s flawless performance. No longer a hunky, leading man, he’s become a vital, mature and relevant character actor. Playing varying degrees of patience, despair, anxiety and rage, he has a smooth charm and concealed passion that is something of a physical transformation. This is acting of the highest order, in a film that must not be missed.

Texto completo: The FBI lawyer under criminal investigation for allegedly falsifying a document related to the surveillance of a Trump campaign adviser expressed negative opinions of President Trump in messages to colleagues.
Kevin Clinesmith, who was part of special counsel Robert Mueller's team, has been identified as the attorney who could face a criminal charge as part of U.S. Attorney John Durham's expansive criminal inquiry into the origins of the Russia investigation, according to the New York Times.
As part of the Justice Department watchdog's now-completed investigation into alleged surveillance abuses, Clinesmith was found to have altered an email that was used by officials as they prepared an application renewal to present before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to obtain a warrant to electronically surveil Carter Page, a onetime foreign policy adviser for the Trump campaign.
Clinesmith was an attorney with the FBI’s National Security and Cyber Law Branch and worked under FBI General Counsel James Baker and Deputy General Counsel Trisha Anderson. He had worked on the Clinton email investigation as well as the Trump-Russia probe. Clinesmith was present in the FBI's meeting with Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos in February 2017 in Chicago, Papadopoulos told lawmakers in 2018. An Australian diplomat's tip about Papadopoulos claiming the Russians had damaging information about Hillary Clinton effectively prompted the FBI's counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign, called Crossfire Hurricane, in July 2016.
Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz's investigators found Clinesmith falsely asserted he had documentation to back up a claim while in talks with the Justice Department about the factual basis for a FISA warrant application renewal. He then took an email from an official from another agency that contained multiple factual assertions, added material of his own, and gave it to a fellow FBI official who was preparing an affidavit for the Page case. Clinesmith has been described in many media reports as a “low-level attorney,” but Horowitz said he “was the primary FBI attorney assigned to [the Trump-Russia] investigation in early 2017.”
Eagerly anticipated by Trump's allies, Howoritz's report is expected to be released to the public on Dec. 9, the inspector general announced this week. They believe it will reveal an effort to undermine Trump's 2016 campaign in which the FBI misled the FISA court in its reliance on an unverified dossier compiled by British ex-spy Christopher Steele, whose research about Trump and his associates was partially funded by Clinton's 2016 campaign and the Democratic National Committee through the Perkins Coie law firm and Fusion GPS.
The Times, however, reported that the inspector general is expected to criticize top FBI officials but absolve them of abusing their power out of bias against Trump. Democrats, as well as current and former FBI officials, have additionally dismissed allegations of wrongdoing and have raised concerns that information about U.S. intelligence-gathering could be leveraged to discredit Mueller.
Horowitz previously identified Clinesmith as one of the FBI officials who conveyed a bias against Trump in instant messages. Clinesmith was kicked out of Mueller's Russia investigation team in February 2018. Two other FBI officials who were forced out of Mueller's team for similar anti-Trump messages were Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, both of whom have also left the bureau.

In a lengthy instant message exchange between Clinesmith and another FBI employee on Nov. 9, 2016, the day after Trump’s presidential victory, he lamented Trump’s win and worried about the role he played in the investigation into Trump and his campaign.
“My god damned name is all over the legal documents investigating his staff,” Clinesmith said, adding, “So, who knows if that breaks to him what he is going to do?”
A couple weeks later, on Nov. 22, 2016, he said, “Hell no,” when asked by another FBI attorney if he was “rethink[ing] [his] commitment to the Trump administration.”
“Viva le resistance,” Clinesmith added.
In a scathing July 2018 inspector general report on the FBI's Clinton emails investigation, Clinesmith was criticized at least 56 times, listed as "FBI Attorney 2." Clinesmith defended himself, claiming his messages only reflected his personal views. He asserted his opinions did not affect his work.
During a hearing that June with Horowitz, North Carolina Republican Rep. Mark Meadows named Clinesmith as being one of two unnamed lawyers criticized in the inspector general report.
The initial FISA application and three renewals targeting Page required the approval of top members of the FBI, the DOJ, and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, but they were also handled by lower-level officials. The initial warrant application was approved in October 2016, and the final renewal came in June 2017.
Under suspicion of being a Russian agent, Page became a subject of interest in the FBI's counterintelligence investigation, which was later wrapped into Mueller's investigation. Page was never charged with a crime as part of Mueller's investigation, which failed to establish criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin, and denied being an agent for Russia.
Last summer, the DOJ took the unprecedented step of releasing more than 400 redacted pages of top-secret documents on the FISA warrant obtained to wiretap Page after Trump declassified their existence.
“We found instant messages in which FBI Attorney 2 discussed political issues, including three instant message exchanges that raised concerns of potential bias,” Horowitz wrote last year.
The first exchange highlighted by Horowitz occurred on Oct. 28, 2016, just after FBI Director James Comey sent a letter to Congress announcing the reopening of the Clinton email investigation. Clinesmith messaged a total of four FBI employees expressing his frustration, telling two of them, “I mean, I never really liked the Republic anyway.”
“As I have initiated the destruction of the republic ... Would you be so kind as to have a coffee with me this afternoon?” Clinesmith asked a third FBI employee.
And Clinesmith told a fourth FBI employee, “I’m clinging to small pockets of happiness in the dark time of the Republic’s destruction.”
In his attempt to explain these texts to Horowitz in 2018, Clinesmith said he was expressing his annoyance with what he saw as the FBI treating the Clinton email investigation more harshly than the Trump-Russia investigation. He continued to say he didn’t let it impact his work.
“It’s like, in terms of, of, you know, what’s not in here too is like, you know, we, at that point we had investigation, the Russia investigation was ongoing as well. And that information was obviously kept close hold and was not released until March,” Clinesmith said. “So, you know, it, it was just kind of frustration that we weren’t handling both of them the same way with, with that level I guess.”
The second exchange detailed by the inspector general occurred on Nov. 9, 2016, in which he and another FBI official were “devastated” about Trump’s victory over Clinton the day prior, and Clinesmith said he thought the Comey letter to Congress may have helped Trump win, claiming, “We broke the momentum.”
“I am so stressed about what I could have done differently,” Clinesmith said, later adding, “It’s just hard not to feel like the FBI caused some of this. It was razor-thin in some states.”
Clinesmith also trashed Trump and the Republican Party.
“The crazies won finally. This is the Tea Party on steroids. And the GOP is going to be lost, they have to deal with an incumbent in 4 years,” he said. “We have to fight this again. Also, Pence is stupid.”
Clinesmith told Horowitz in 2018, “I wasn’t anywhere near the, the room deciding on these factors. ... It was just kind of like a discussion on how I could have either moved the process along more quickly or more efficiently at a, at a more, at an earlier time, or whatnot.”
The former FBI lawyer also attempted to explain away his third exchange on Nov. 22, 2016, in which he’d referenced “the Resistance.”
“It’s just the, the lines bled through here just in terms of, of my personal, political view in terms of, of what particular preference I have,” Clinesmith told Horowitz. “But, but that doesn’t have any, any leaning on the way that I, I maintain myself as a professional in the FBI.”

'Hidden' author books it to library

Texto completo: "There's a saying in the world that a good library has something to offend everyone," said Bette Ammon, Coeur d'Alene Public Library director, on Thursday night. "I think a great library also has something to please everyone."
Someone has been pretty offended by Coeur d'Alene's library for the last year and has shown frustration by hiding books the perpetrator considers "propaganda," according to a note left in the suggestion box.
This unique attempt at censorship amused and angered the author of one of those books, Rick Reilly. So the renowned author, who made his name as a longtime Sports Illustrated columnist, decided to travel to Coeur d'Alene on Thursday for something other than his annual summer golf trip.
"I've heard of people burning books, destroying books, stealing books from libraries," Reilly said. "I've never heard of someone hiding them, but that's kind of clever. But it still kind of makes me mad."
Ever since volunteering at a local library in the seventh grade, Reilly has had an "affinity for libraries."
When he heard his latest book, "Commander in Cheat: How Golf Explains Trump," was hidden, Reilly decided to do something about it. So he came to town and spoke to a crowded room Thursday night.
This wasn't a typical author talk though. It was closer to stand-up comedy.
He had three goals for his speech: Make people laugh, support libraries and get the book bandit to reveal him- or herself.
He succeeded on the first two counts.
He also strategically hid copies of his book next to those on narcissism, near "Becoming Hitler" and in the Children's Issues section, among other apropos places.
Ammon, the self-identified "lucky library director," introduced Reilly, who then kept her on stage.
"It's not often you get a chance to interview the most famous librarian in the world," Reilly quipped.
Ammon has been interviewed frequently since the story of the book bandit broke, including by the BBC and the New York Times. She was mentioned in Reilly's op-ed published last week in the Washington Post.
"I was surprised your publicist called me," Ammon told Reilly. "I didn't know who the hell you were."
Reilly grilled Ammon on the antics since the book hiding started, including when circulation manager Tyler McLane flew his drone through the library in search of misplaced books.
The idea worked for about 15 minutes, "until he ran into one of the stacks and broke a blade," Ammon said, sending the crowd into fits of laughter.
Ammon confirmed Steven Colbert followed through on a promise he made on his show last week and sent an "un-hideable" version of his book "Whose Boat Is This Boat?" The book arrived Thursday, and kids quickly turned it into a tent.
In his own version of an oversized story hour, Reilly told a long series of jokes at President Donald Trump's expense.
Some stories he pulled from "Commander in Cheat," which includes observations from Reilly's time on the links with Trump. But others were secondhand, he explained.
"Since the book came out, I've become the clearing house for all the Trump cheating stories," Reilly said, before telling how Trump cheated during a round with Tiger Woods.
For Reilly, Trump's cheating matters for a simple reason: "That says a lot about your soul."
Raised in a golfing family, Reilly was taught a simple principle.
"We play honestly because it's not about winning or losing," Reilly said. "It's about the integrity of the game."
He said integrity is key to democracy, too, as are libraries.
"I know how democracy works, and democracy works when voters know what they're reading, know what they're doing," Reilly said. "You can't go into a library in Beijing or Saudi Arabia or Cuba or China and read anything you want. But in America you can for free - and with nice Wi-Fi and good chairs."

Kill Electoral College, invite rigged elections

Texto completo: "I care not who casts the votes of a nation, provided I can count them," a New York Times editorial quipped in 1880. The editorial was poking fun at imperialism. Nevertheless, the old quote strikes at the heart of a new debate about the Electoral College — to say nothing of recent news headlines.
Everyone seems pretty certain that one or the other political party is interfering in U.S. presidential elections. In the midst of so much turmoil and distrust, why would some Americans want to give even more power over elections to the federal government? Yet Electoral College opponents advocate for it, seemingly without realizing what they are doing.
Make no mistake: If the Electoral College is eliminated, the powers of incumbent presidents and their administrations will be vastly increased.
Don't hand power to incumbents Democrats who are working to end the Electoral College should stop and think about that statement again: They do not trust Donald Trump. Yet they are working to give him more power over his own reelection and the election of his successor.
The Electoral College is, at its heart, a decentralized, state-by-state presidential election process. States determine the logistics of Election Day, access to the ballot, recounts and other, similar issues. Meanwhile, the federal government must take a back seat because the Constitution gives the national government only a limited role to play at election time.
Notably, while the Constitution grants Congress some authority in elections, the executive branch is left out in the cold: Presidents have no direct power over their own reelections.
Consider how things would change if the country were to eliminate the Electoral College and move to a single, national presidential election instead. A federal government that once played a secondary role would now sit in the driver's seat. All election matters would be subject to federal control. Such changes would be necessary because of the altered nature of the election: Instead of 51 statewide election pools, in which each state and Washington, D.C., selects its own electors, American voters would all be thrown into a single national election pool.
A new federal election code and bureaucracy would be needed to ensure that voters are being treated equally, even across state lines. It is easy to imagine a new Department of Elections to oversee the administration of the federal election code and a president appointing someone to run it. Presidents who chose to run for a second term would enjoy a nice luxury: The person in charge of their reelection would also be a person beholden to them for a job as secretary of Elections.
Why make it easy to rig elections? Americans are already worried that institutions such as the FBI or the State Department are being used inappropriately. Perhaps they are, and such abuse of our institutions should be addressed. Yet how much easier would it be for an incumbent class of federal officials to legally influence election outcomes if a Department of Elections and a U.S. Election Code were in charge of every aspect of presidential elections?
How fortunate that the Founders created something different, ensuring that checks and balances exist even within our presidential election system. No incumbent has too much authority over his own reelection. He can't rig the system by pushing for federal regulations that tip the scales in his own favor.
This is a healthy state of affairs.
Electoral College opponents blast the system as outdated, archaic and unnecessary, but their criticisms reflect a misunderstanding of the Founders' objectives as they drafted our Constitution.
Their constitutional system of checks and balances — including the state-by-state presidential election process — was designed to protect against these human flaws. Efforts to eliminate the Electoral College fly in the face of this history. They would place unchecked power in the hands of a few.
Americans deserve better.

We met with Pence about need for press freedom

Texto completo: The extent to which the defense of press freedom has been a bipartisan concern is suggested by the fact that as a member of Congress, Mike Pence served as the co-chair of the Freedom of the Press Caucus – along with Adam Schiff.
"If you believe in limited government, you understand that the only check on government power in real time is a free and independent press," Pence said on the floor of the House in 2005, when he was pushing for legislation to protect journalists and their sources.
Today, of course, Schiff is leading the congressional impeachment hearings against President Donald Trump, and Pence is the vice president in an administration that has waged a relentless war on the press.
Trump's attacks on the news media, while divisive and polarizing in the United States, are doing far worse damage in places around the world where authoritarian governments are jailing journalists in record number or, as was the case with Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, murdering them with impunity.
On Monday, I went to see Vice President Pence with a group of courageous journalists from Pakistan, Nicaragua, Tanzania, India and Brazil. These journalists were in the United States to receive press freedom prizes from the Committee to Protect Journalists, the organization I lead. We are honoring them for putting their lives on the line to bring us the news.
The journalists shared a variety of experiences. Neha Dixit described the onslaught of hate she has endured in India about publishing stories on sex trafficking and other sensitive issues. Patrícia Campos Mello, who has reported on alleged corruption in Brazil, said President Jair Bolsonaro has emulated Trump's rhetoric, unleashing a torrent of online death threats and harassment. Bolsonaro even went so far as to cancel the government's subscription to her publication, Folha de S.Paulo, after Trump banned The New York Times and The Washington Post from the White House.
Several of the journalists raised concern about the proliferation of laws criminalizing "fake news" and the ways these laws are used to target critical media.
Zaffar Abbas, the editor of the Dawn, one of Pakistan's top newspapers, called on Pence to stand up for journalists working in developing democracies around the world.
Meanwhile, Miguel Mora and Lucia Pineda, who were jailed in Nicaragua in reprisal for their critical reporting, thanked Pence for the support they had received from the U.S. government, which they said helped get them out of prison.
The vice president was deeply engaged by these stories and reaffirmed his commitment to press freedom. That's important, but the reality is that the impeachment inquiry is polarizing, and it's hard to imagine our political leaders coming together again to defend this critical principle.
That's why the American people should.
Regardless of how you feel about the impeachment proceedings, many Americans are glued to the news, and we want to know and understand what's transpiring in Washington. That's the role of a free press, which is facing new challenges in this country, from the decline in local news to legal action targeting journalists' sources.
This month, along with our partners at the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press and more than 40 media organizations around the country, we launched a new campaign called Protect Press Freedom. The campaign seeks to educate Americans about the threats to press freedom, celebrate the diverse journalism that keeps the public informed and mobilize citizens to stand up for freedom of the press – no matter what news is important to them.
There's another reason that we are calling on all Americans to stand firm for press freedom, and that's to bolster journalists around the world who work without the protection of the First Amendment. Their reporting not only informs their own societies but also reaches a global audience. The journalists who met with Vice President Pence told him they would like the United States to be an ally and an inspiration. He seemed to get this. Let's hope he can persuade his boss.

Texto completo: On his stand-up comedy tour, Jonathan Van Ness briefly discusses starring in Netflix's reboot of "Queer Eye."
"I talk about punctuality, my relationship with the boys a little bit. It's not a heavy part of my act," Van Ness, 32, said in an interview.
Being the "Queer Eye" grooming expert has presented new career paths, including the "Road to Beijing" comedy tour. Van Ness will perform two shows Saturday, Nov. 23, at the Dr. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts.
The tour offers "just flat out some of the most incredible opportunities and most incredible nights of my life," Van Ness says. He rhapsodizes rapidly about getting onstage to "explore my voice and my stand-up comedy style and create a night for people to come together and laugh and just be really joyful and happy, but also mad as hell, too, about our political climate."
When he gets political, he stresses, he does so in a "furious but joyful way. My style of comedy is storytelling with a lot of set-up and punchlines. It's storytelling, it's very languid. I will go off the rails sometimes."
Van Ness doesn't talk politics until the show's end, but he will have a message for the Sunshine State.
"Florida is such an important state for a presidential election, obviously," he said. "I'm excited to get there and to chat and to strategize onstage in three different outfits. Maybe we can figure out how to give all our friends a ride to the voting booths."
"Road to Beijing" signifies his interest in getting to the Olympics.
"I started figure skating right around when I got to book this tour," he says. "I was like 'If I start figure skating now, I could maybe get to the Beijing Olympics in 2022,' which is the next Winter Games. When I got a quarter of the way through the tour, I was like, 'Oh, my God, I could do gymnastics onstage and no one could leave in the middle of the show.' I'm just so happy to be doing gymnastics within my stand-up set."
He notes the next Summer Games will be next year. "I just want to go to the Olympics somehow. Maybe comedy will get me there."
In his act, Van Ness talks about his memoir, "Over the Top," a bit more since the book was released in September. He worked on it for nearly two years, and he writes about his HIV-positive status, being a sexual abuse survivor and his addictions to drugs and sex. The book's subtitle is "A Raw Journey to Self-Love," and the writing is raw.
"I felt like I needed to be very frank to gain that understanding that I was looking for," he said.
In an interview with The New York Times, he revealed having nightmares before the book's release.
"The anxiety has definitely gone away, but I'm just excited to continue to work," he said. "The book was a jumping-off point to continue my work in terms of advocacy."
Response to the book has been "overwhelmingly positive," he said. "It was a nerve-racking project, but I was eager to do it, and I'm glad I did. It shows there's a lot of suffering and misunderstanding around living with HIV still. There's a lot of work still to be done. My personal support, I feel like people were supportive and I felt a lot of love, but for people living with HIV generally, there's still so much discrimination and stigmatizing and misunderstanding that I'm still eager to work on."
He told The Times, "I want people to realize you're never too broken to be fixed."
That message is for anyone, he says. "Talking about addiction, I think there are lot of people who feel they've been damaged beyond repair," he says. "I don't think that is the case. Whether it's anxiety, depression, addiction, whatever your compulsivity is, if you have a will to heal, you are healable, you are lovable."
On tour, comedy is the main topic. He cites his series "Gay of Thrones," which recaps "Game of Thrones," in helping shape his timing, delivery, improv skills and ability to stick to a script. His approach to stand-up was influenced, he said, by "female comedians I grew up loving and watching," notably Margaret Cho, Lisa Lampanelli, Ellen DeGeneres and Janeane Garofalo.
He credits "Queer Eye" for making his career more expansive - including the "Getting Curious" podcast - and changing his life. "Queer Eye," which arrived last year, took him from full-time hairdresser to author, stand-up comedian and TV star.
"Before 'Queer Eye,' I was doing great, and I'm so grateful I still feel that way," he said. "It's opened up a lot of doors for me. It also has given me a lot more pleasure because I want to do right by this platform and by the opportunity and by my community."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump on Thursday denounced New York-led investigations into his finances amid reports that federal prosecutors in Manhattan have issued a series of subpoenas to several Trump campaign fundraisers.
Trump took to Twitter to deride what he called a "witch hunt" a day after The New York Times reported that the Southern District of New York has subpoenaed a lobbying firm and two individuals who have raised campaign dollars for Trump. The subpoenas are part of an ongoing investigation into two associates of Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, who have been charged with campaign finance violations.
The president claimed on Twitter that special counsel Robert Mueller "went over all my financials, & my taxes and found nothing." Mueller has made no such assertions and Trump's finances were not covered in the unredacted portions of Mueller's 448-page final report.
"Now the Witch Hunt continues with local New York Democrat prosecutors going over every financial deal I have ever done," Trump tweeted. "This has never happened to a President before."
Trump's description of "New York Democrat prosecutors," comes despite the Southern District of New York being run by his U.S. attorney appointee, Geoffrey S. Berman, a Republican.
Trump, who has refused to release his tax returns as traditionally done by past presidents, said he will release "my financial statement ... sometime prior to Election."
"I'm clean, and when I release my financial statement (my decision) sometime prior to Election, it will only show one thing - that I am much richer than people even thought - And that is a good thing. Jobs, Jobs, Jobs!" Trump tweeted.
The president's assertion that he would release a financial statement comes as he continues to fight in federal court to block Manhattan prosecutors and House Democrats from accessing his tax returns and other financial records.
The subpoenas issued in the campaign finance probe come following last month's arrest of Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, two naturalized U.S. citizens with ties to Ukraine, who reportedly aided Giuliani's campaign to pressure Ukrainian officials into investigating Trump's Democratic rivals. Parnas and Fruman have pleaded not guilty to violating federal campaign finance laws by allegedly donating to a Republican congressman in exchange for the lawmaker's support on their push to oust former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch from her post.
Subpoenas have been issued to Ballard Partners, a firm run by lobbyist Brian Ballard, and two individuals who raised money for the America First Action, a pro-Trump super PAC, according to sources cited by the Times. Both groups have said they are cooperating with the federal probe.

Judge Blocks 4 Executions, Thwarting Federal Plan

Texto completo: The decision essentially stymies the Trump administration's plan to resume the use of the death penalty.
WASHINGTON -- A federal judge on Wednesday halted the executions of four federal prisoners that were scheduled to begin next month, essentially stymieing the Trump administration's plan to resume the use of the death penalty.
Judge Tanya S. Chutkan of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia issued an injunction late Wednesday that said that the executions would prevent the inmates from pursuing legal challenges to the use of lethal injection.
Attorney General William P. Barr vowed to appeal the case up to the Supreme Court if necessary. "There are people who would say these kinds of delays are not fair to the victims, so we can move forward with our first group," he said Thursday in an interview with The Associated Press as he flew to Montana to meet with officials there.
In July, Mr. Barr announced that the government would resume executions of death row inmates after a hiatus of nearly two decades. In the intervening years, public support for capital punishment has waned, prompting 21 states to outlaw the practice.
"The Justice Department upholds the rule of law, and we owe it to the victims and their families to carry forward the sentence imposed by our justice system," Mr. Barr said at the time.
He said that five men who had been convicted of murdering children would be executed by lethal injection in December and January at the federal penitentiary in Terre Haute, Ind. The men were chosen, in part, because the Justice Department said that they had exhausted their appeals. More executions would follow, Mr. Barr added.
The attorney general issued a protocol to use a single drug, pentobarbital, rather than a three-drug procedure that had been used in federal executions. The particular drug cocktail had fallen out of favor because botched executions prompted a slew of lawsuits as well as discussion within the Justice Department to eliminate the federal death penalty altogether.
"By granting the preliminary injunction, the court has made clear that no execution should go forward while there are still so many unanswered questions about the government's newly announced execution method," said Shawn Nolan, one of the lawyers for the men facing federal execution.
President Trump has been a staunch supporter of the death penalty, and he has said that drug dealers should be executed. And Mr. Barr supported capital punishment when he worked in the Justice Department during the George Bush administration. "That penalty would send a message to drug dealers and gangs," Mr. Barr wrote in an op-ed article in The New York Times in 1991, when he was acting attorney general.
Four of the men who were scheduled for execution this winter joined a federal lawsuit in Washington that challenged the use of the three-drug cocktail. They asked Judge Chutkan to block their executions until their legal claims could be heard, a request that she granted.
Last month, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit blocked the execution of the fifth man, who was scheduled to die in December.
Federal prosecutors rarely seek the death penalty, but they successfully did so for Dylann S. Roof, the avowed white supremacist who shot and killed nine African-American churchgoers in 2015, and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the Boston Marathon bomber.
Since the federal government reinstated the death penalty in 1988, only three inmates have been executed: Timothy J. McVeigh, the Oklahoma City bomber, in 2001; Juan Garza, convicted of murder and drug trafficking, in 2001; and Louis Jones Jr., convicted of the rape and murder of a female soldier, in 2003.

Report Faults U.K. Hospital Failings for Infant Deaths

Texto completo: LONDON -- Dozens of babies and three mothers died at hospitals in England over four decades because of major staff failings, in what experts said could become the biggest maternity scandal in the history of Britain's National Health Service.
The problems at the facilities that make up the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust from 1979 to 2017 resulted in dozens of stillbirths as well as the deaths of newborns and women who had just given birth, an independent investigation ordered by the government in 2017 has found. It also cited more than 50 cases of injury.
The findings were summarized in an interim report first disclosed by The Independent and seen by The New York Times. It identifies hundreds of cases of repeated failings and clinical errors by doctors, midwives and hospital bosses, as well as a lack of transparency and honesty.
A senior official at the National Health Service called the findings a major and disturbing scandal. More and more people are coming forward by the day, he said, adding that the problems may well extend beyond the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital Trust.
In one case at Shrewsbury and Telford, a baby suffered a brain injury at birth because the medical staff monitored the wrong heartbeat and thus missed signs of distress, the report said. In another, the hospital failed to notify a mother that her baby's body had been returned from a post-mortem examination, and then advised her not to look at the body because it had decomposed during the delay, it said.
The report, written by a midwife, Donna Ockenden, warns that even now hospital staff members have not absorbed the lessons of their past failings.
"The number of cases we are now being requested to review seems to represent a longstanding culture at this trust that is toxic to improvement effort," the report says. "It will take time, confidence and considerable and meaningful staff effort from 'Ward to Board' to change this, and it will require strong leadership and the support and receptiveness of senior managers."
The Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital Trust said that it had not been made aware of the interim report, but that it had already made improvements to its maternity service.
"On behalf of the trust, I apologize unreservedly to the families who have been affected," said Paula Clark, the interim chief executive of the Trust.
Ms. Clark said: "I would like to reassure all families using our maternity services that we have not been waiting for Donna Ockenden's final report before working to improve our services. A lot has already been done to address the issues raised by previous cases."
The inquiry into the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital Trust was prompted by a campaign by a couple demanding answers about the death of their first child in 2009. In an interview, the mother, Rhiannon Davies, said the scope of the failings revealed in the report was "horrific" but not surprising.
"Exposing these details has been our reality for the past decade," she said, "but yet we have been treated like we are guilty of something, whereas the midwives and hospital staff have been treated like the victims."
Ms. Davies was skeptical about claims that conditions had already improved.
"They keep saying that lessons are being learned, but we keep getting confronted with the same abuses," she said. "Why should we believe that anything will change now?"
Ms. Davies's daughter died after midwives at Ludlow Hospital failed to identify signs that the newborn was in critical condition and left her alone in a crib, she said. The child was airlifted to another hospital but died six hours after birth.
The hospital also failed to classify Ms. Davies' pregnancy as high-risk, even though she had a series of serious medical problems and was in and out of the hospital for two weeks before giving birth, she said.
In their decade-long battle for an investigation into their daughter's death, Ms. Davies and her husband, Richard Stanton, had to threaten a judicial review of the hospital's investigation of the death before they were granted an inquest, she said.
In 2013, that investigation by the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman, which examines unresolved complaints against the government and the National Health Service, concluded that the child had died as a result of serious failings in care and that her death could have been avoided.
Today, more than 600 cases of possible malpractice in the maternity wards of the Shrewsbury and Telford Trust are being investigated as more families come forward. The N.H.S. is carrying out a parallel investigation into the Trust. The West Mercia Police, which has jurisdiction over the trust, said it would wait for the findings of the independent inquiry before considering any criminal proceedings.
"I feel like I've been pushing this huge boulder that could roll back and crush me at any point," Ms. Davies said, "and indeed it has, many times. But now maybe, just maybe, it has some momentum and can roll without me."

Texto completo: Americans have gone to the polls four times this month to vote in major, statewide races. In Virginia, they voted for control of the state Legislature; in Mississippi, Kentucky and Louisiana, they voted for control of the governor’s mansion. In each case, President Donald Trump tied himself to the outcome.
“Governor @MattBevin has done a wonderful job for the people of Kentucky!” Trump tweeted before Election Day. “Matt has my Complete and Total Endorsement, and always has. GET OUT and VOTE on November 5th for your GREAT Governor, @MattBevin!”
Trump sent a similar message ahead of the Virginia elections. “Virginia, with all of the massive amount of defense and other work I brought to you, and with everything planned, go out and vote Republican today,” he said.
“The people of this country aren’t buying” impeachment, Trump said at a rally in Louisiana last week. “You see it because we’re going up, and they’re going down.
“You gotta give me a big win please,” he said later. “Please.”
Trump thought voters would repudiate impeachment and vindicate him. Instead, they did the opposite. Virginia Democrats won a legislative majority for the first time since 1993, flipping historically Republican districts. Kentucky Democrats beat incumbent Gov. Matt Bevin in a state Trump won by 30 points in 2016. And Louisiana Democrats reelected Gov. John Bel Edwards in a state Trump won by the more modest but still substantial margin of 20 points. Democrats in Mississippi made significant gains even as they fell short of victory — their nominee for governor, Jim Hood, lost by 5 1/2 points, a dramatic turnaround from four years ago, when Republican Phil Bryant won in a landslide.
It’s true that Democrats didn’t run on the issue of impeachment. These races were centered on more quotidian issues like health care, transportation and education. If anything, this was the second consecutive election cycle in which health care made the difference. In Kentucky, the Democratic candidate, Andy Beshear — whose father, also as governor, implemented the Affordable Care Act in the state — promised to protect Medicaid and hammered Bevin on his plan for work requirements. Edwards ran for reelection on his implementation of the Medicaid expansion in Louisiana, which gave coverage to more than 400,000 state residents. Medicaid was a key issue in the Mississippi race as well, where an estimated 100,000 residents would be eligible for coverage under the expansion.
But just because no one ran on impeachment doesn’t mean it wasn’t in the air. Voters could have shown they were tired of Democratic investigations. They could have elevated the president’s allies. Instead, voters handed Trump an unambiguous defeat. And that is much more than just a blow to the president’s immediate political fortunes.
To start, it confirms recent polling on impeachment. A new ABC News poll shows majority support for impeachment and even removal. Fifty-one percent say that “President Trump’s actions were wrong and he should be impeached by the House and removed from office by the Senate.” And an overwhelming 70% of Americans say that the inciting offense — Trump’s attempt to coerce Ukraine into investigating a political rival — was wrong. A similarly fresh Reuters poll has lower numbers for removal (44% of Americans say they want the House to impeach and the Senate to convict) but also shows that most Americans want Congress to investigate Trump if he “committed impeachable offenses during his conversation with the president of Ukraine.”
Worried about backlash and committed to restraint, House Democrats have limited their impeachment inquiry to the Ukraine scandal. You could read these numbers and election results as vindication — proof that Democrats were right to take a narrow, focused approach to the president’s wrongdoing.
But it’s also possible that Democrats are leaving political advantage on the table — that there’s still opportunity for an even broader investigation that tackles everything from White House involvement in Ukraine and the president’s phone calls with other foreign leaders (the records of several of these, not just the one involving Ukraine, have been inappropriately placed on a classified server) to his deals with authoritarian governments in Turkey and Saudi Arabia. These wouldn’t be fishing expeditions — given the president’s refusal to divest from his businesses or separate his personal interests from those of the state, there’s good reason to suspect inappropriate behavior across a range of areas — but they would mean a longer process. Democrats couldn’t wrap up impeachment before the end of the year. They would have to let it move at its own pace, even if it stretches well into 2020. (Watergate, remember, took more than two years to unfold.)
I don’t see the downside. A long inquiry keeps impeachment out of Mitch McConnell’s hands until there’s a comprehensive case against the president. Yes, there’s the chance of a late campaign acquittal, but if the past month is any prediction, Trump will have sustained a large amount of political damage over the course of a long investigation. It would keep him off balance, especially if further investigation uncovers even more corruption. It would also allow the six Democratic presidential candidates in the Senate to campaign through the primary season instead of returning to Washington for a trial. But most important, it would show a commitment to getting to the full truth of what’s been happening in the White House under the guise of making America great again.

Texto completo: For Mark Ruffalo, “Dark Waters" is more than just another film. The conspiracy thriller from director Todd Haynes (“Carol," 2015) stars Ruffalo as Rob Bilott, the former corporate defense attorney who unveiled the vast wrongdoings of chemical giant DuPont over an investigation spanning nearly 20 years. Anne Hathaway and Tim Robbins costar.
Ruffalo sought to produce the film after reading a 2016 New York Times Magazine feature about Bilott, who took the legal case of West Virginia farmer Wilbur Tennant, whose cows kept dying of a mysterious illness.
The release of “Dark Waters" on Friday comes at the tail-end of Ruffalo's own decade-long journey into clean water activism, which began in 2008 when gas companies started poking around his Catskills town for potential drilling. While the “Avengers" actor remains a vocal anti-fracking activist, he visited Capitol Hill this week to testify on the dangers of PFOA and PFAS, the so-called “forever chemicals" at the heart of the scandal in “Dark Waters."
Reached by phone on Wednesday, the 51-year-old actor discussed taking on Washington, working with Haynes, making the Academy Award-winning “Spotlight" (2015), and more.

Q. This is a story you specifically set out to tell after reading the Times piece on Rob Bilott. What made you think: I need to adapt this?
A. Well, it was one of the biggest corporate crimes in American history. And it's been decades of cover-up, and not even I knew about it — and I like to think of myself as environmentally savvy. But I also saw it as [the story of] a working-class community pushing for justice. Wilbur Tennant was one of these classic characters, an American icon. And I recognized his fight against [DuPont] as the same fight with fracking, with climate change, with Exxon. I recognized in it a much bigger story about who we are as America, and what our economic values are.

Q. Coming from The Boston Globe, I have to ask about “Spotlight." Was your role as [investigative reporter] Michael Rezendes top of mind when approaching the role of Rob Billot?
A. Those two characters are very similar to each other — they both believe in people. They both believe that when people hear the truth they will do the right thing at the end of the day. Both men are different from me in that way — I'm probably a little more cynical, but they've seen way more than I have, and they've maintained their beliefs. But I loved “Spotlight," and I felt the healing and corrective power of that film. I'm interested in those kinds of experiences as a filmmaker.

Q. You've worked with so many visionary directors in the past — Lisa Cholodenko, Martin Scorsese, David Fincher — that it comes as no surprise you'd want to work with Todd Haynes. Yet Haynes has never made anything like “Dark Waters" before.
A. It was 100 percent him as a filmmaker and the way he handles his characters and the world of his stories. One of my managers floated Todd to me early on, and I stopped on his name and said, “That's really interesting." Certainly there were other directors that were better suited at first blush . . . but he tells stories about marginalized people who are living in these oppressive systems, with creeping paranoia, and that was the story I wanted to tell. And I couldn't be happier with what he did. It's masterful. He's a goddamn masterful filmmaker.

Q. So what was it like finally working with Haynes?
A. I love him; we had such an amazing collaboration on this. He is so gentle and kind, and creates the safest space to work in. There's no one that works harder or is more prepared than he is. And his aesthetic is everywhere in the movie — [even in] what kind of food processor is in the kitchen as time goes on in the Bilott house. This story could be dry, but he balances everything without ever losing the attention of the audience, even while [focusing on] a character that's modest and reserved.

Q. “Dark Waters" consistently uses motherhood and images of new life to emphasize how damaging PFOA is to future generations. Were you thinking of your own three children [now ages 12, 14, and 18] when approaching the film?
A. Absolutely. Part of my whole journey into activism was about my children. We were living in upstate New York, and there was going to be fracking everywhere. And when I came to find out what it did to water, I said, “I don't want my kids growing up around that. I don't want that in my neighborhood." And that's what we have to center on right now — all of us. What is the next generation going to have to deal with? How do we listen to them, take their concerns to mind, and make the world a better place for them? So that was really important to me, and that was true to Rob's story as well.

Q. Are you hopeful the film and your activism surrounding it will make a difference in EPA regulations?
A. Actually, after yesterday [on Capitol Hill], I'm hopeful. I don't think there are many issues you could talk about in Washington, D.C., right now that don't divide immediately into bitter partisanship. But I do feel like this is one place where there is real bipartisan work going on. And in the [current legislation] that everyone is negotiating right at this moment, there is a very strong chance that there is going to be some regulation passed on PFOA. And that will be the first time in 50 years. I really do think testifying on the Hill helped that. The visibility this movie has brought to PFOA has given politicians the cover to be able to fight for what's right in their constituencies against such a powerful force as DuPont.

Q. You've described Rob Billot as a real-life hero, and you've noted how composed he is. Did you find it challenging to present that anger and frustration under the surface of an incredibly reserved, understated person? Or did it come naturally from your work as the Hulk?
A. It was scary, actually. It's not what audiences are trained for in a hero. As an actor, you want to go for the Hulk moment, you want to go for the big, dramatic takedown of the big-time CEO. But that's not how Rob approached [those scenes]. I asked Rob, “Is this where you just got to tear him a new one?" And he was like “No, I felt like [the CEO] didn't know, and that if I just showed him what they were doing, and who the victims were, that he would do the right thing." And that's how we played it. And [the deposition scene] is probably one of my favorite scenes in the movie as a result. If I was left to my own devices, or my instincts as an actor, I would have played it much differently.

Q. What's next?
A. I produced a limited series for HBO called “I Know This Much Is True," with Derek Cianfrance directing. It's really, really good. So we're in post-production right now, and that's where the lion's share of my time is going. And I'm excited to get back to my family, who I've been away from for a long time — I need to reconnect to them.

Could MLB changes mean more players for independent leagues?

Texto completo: With the recent news of the proposed changes from Major League Baseball, a handful of players throughout the minor leagues could be without jobs within a year.
The independent leagues, of which there are eight across the country, could be an option for those players affected by the possible changes.
The MLB has entertained the thought of making some sweeping changes to professional baseball at the end of the 2020 season. Reports of MLB cutting ties with 42 of its minor league teams arose during October.
Over the weekend, a New York Times report released the list of teams that could lose their affiliation.
For those 42 teams that would be removed under the proposal, MLB suggests creating a "Dream League." This MLB-MiLB joint venture would resemble independent leagues in a sense. Clubs in the Dream League could fill their teams with undrafted players. The players who go undrafted would have the option of going to the Dream League or to the independent leagues.
The York Revolution, an independent team in the Atlantic League, has carried players who have professional experience from season to season. Mark Mason, York Revolution Field Manager and Director of Player Personnel, doesn't see the Atlantic League being affected in a big way if the MLB makes the changes.
"If all of this does end up happening, I think most players who do not have much experience playing professionally will go to other independent leagues," Mason said. "The Atlantic League tends to carry players who have had experience in the majors or extensive trips in the minors."
Eric Menzer, President of the York Revolution, believes independent leagues could be the right move for players, if the proposal does go through.
"If one or more currently affiliated teams lose its affiliation, that provides an interesting opportunity to come join a team in the Atlantic League or any other independent league," Menzer said.
Unlike other independent leagues, the Atlantic League does not have classifications for its roster limitations.
"We can sign any player, regardless of their age or level of experience," Mason said.
In talking with other managers from different independent leagues, Mason heard a lot of concerns on where managers would get players from.
"From a recruiting standpoint, I don't think we will face any turmoil, but other leagues could certainly face some," he said. "With other leagues dealing with younger players and having classification levels, some managers could have some difficulties finding players.
Independent Leagues like the Frontier League have specific player eligibility limitations and different classifications that each team has to abide by.
"I think that players will take advantage of the Independent Leagues if this proposal goes through and it will be interesting to see how everything plays out," Mason said.
In his current role as president of an independent team, Menzer understands that there are some challenges being independent.
"There are advantages and disadvantages of not being affiliated," he said.
Independent leagues pay their own players and the MLB doesn't. "I would say that is a disadvantage because that is something MLB does not have to deal with," Menzer said.
Being independent does give you full control of how you can run your team and decisions can be made at any time.
"We play to win so we have the ability to hire and fire our own players at any point during the season," Menzer said. "My job is to maximize the advantages and minimize the disadvantages."
On the thought of a possible expansion of current independent leagues if the proposal were to pass, Menzer believes there could be a possibility.
"I don' think you can look at the situation and say that there is anything but a possibility that there could be more independent teams in the leagues," he said. "I think that this whole situation is not going to turn out the way it's sitting right now; there is a lot of negotiation to be done."

Three Pa. ballclubs on MLB's cut list

Texto completo: Back in October, it was rumored that there could be some drastic changes coming to the world of professional baseball when reports surfaced that the MLB proposed to cut ties with 42 of its minor league teams after the 2020 season.
At the time, no minor league teams were named. That changed over the weekend when a New York Times report released the extensive list of teams that are on the chopping block, putting a face to the harsh reality that more than three dozen cities across the United States could lose their minor league team, and thousands of players could end up unemployed.
Three Pennsylvania teams are on that list to possibly lose their MLB affiliation. Those teams are the Eastern League's Erie SeaWolves, a AA affiliate of the Detroit Tigers; the New York-Penn League's State College Spikes, a single-A St. Louis Cardinals affiliate, and the Williamsport Crosscutters, a single-A affiliate of the Philadelphia Phillies.
The MLB believes the cuts are necessary to improve facilities and make the minor leagues more efficient, according to reports from the Times. But the three teams at risk in Pennsylvania arguably shouldn't have problems with their facilities.
The SeaWolves, who play out of UPMC Park in downtown Erie, installed a brand new baseball field last year along with two "state-of-the art" video boards, according to team president Greg Coleman. The stadium is also currently making $12 million worth of renovations this off-season, which includes the installation of climate-controlled batting cages.
The Spikes have played in State College since 2006. They play homes games and are tenants of Penn State's Medlar Field at Lubrano Park, which is owned by the university and shared by the Nittany Lions baseball program. The field is the newest addition to the minor league scene and has a capacity of 5,406.
The team brought in 119,120 fans in 2019 with an average of 3,219 per game, which was fourth among teams in the New York-Penn League.
The Crosscutters' stadium, BB&T Park, has played host to MLB teams for the annual Little League Classic since 2017. The game, held during the Little League World Series in Williamsport and entering its fourth year, will pit the Boston Red Sox against the Baltimore Orioles in 2020.
Is this really a 'death sentence'? The Times reported that cuts could be a "death sentence" for these teams. The loss of major-league affiliation could significantly diminish a team's value in the community and derail players' career-goals or employment opportunities.
Gov. Tom Wolf said he is hopeful that any final decisions made on this proposal will only be made after consulting with local representatives about any impacts to the local economies.
"Pennsylvania's professional baseball affiliates help provide affordable family-friendly entertainment and improve the quality of life in each of their communities," Wolf said in a statement to the York Daily Record Monday night. "I strongly urge the MLB to keep its commitments to local fans, which helps ensure future generations of fans for the sport."
Erie team 'helps keep the downtown vibrant' Erie SeaWolves President Greg Coleman said it's too early to view the proposal as anything more than preliminary conversations between the major and minor leagues.
The team was founded in 1989 and has been playing in Erie since 1995. They were previously an affiliate of the Pittsburgh Pirates from 1995 to 1998, and the Anaheim Angels from 1999 to 2000, but have been reaffiliated with the Tigers for the past 18 years.
Coleman said he doesn't anticipate the news affecting the $12 million in renovations underway at UPMC Park.
"We haven't seen the overall plan. It's a proposal," Coleman said. "We aren't going to stop work on a plan we've been executing for 5 years because of a proposal we heard about a few weeks ago."
Mayor Joe Schember said major league affiliation or not, it's important for the Erie community to have a baseball team.
Having the SeaWolves stadium located in downtown Erie, has been a positive contribution to the local economy — "it helps keep the downtown vibrant," Schember said.
"To use a baseball saying — it's very early in the first inning. And it's been an exciting first inning, but it's the first inning," Coleman said. "We've got a long way to go before it's the bottom of the ninth."
State College Spikes attract residents, visitors Spikes communications director Joe Putnam did not return a phone call seeking comment Monday. He declined comment to multiple media outlets based in State College.
The Spikes previously were an affiliate of the Pittsburgh Pirates from 2007 to 2012 but have been reaffiliated with the Cardinals for the past seven years.
Minor League Baseball and State College mayor Donald Hahn also did not respond to requests for comment.
Fritz Smith, the president and CEO for Happy Valley Adventure Bureau, said he is "very hopeful that this scenario does not come to pass." Happy Valley Adventure Bureau is a nonprofit that works to develop "economic activity and quality of life" in Centre County and State College.
"The Spikes are an important part of our community," Smith said in an emailed statement. "They offer a family friendly, affordable activity. We believe that Centre County, with a growing resident base, alongside a growing visitor base, merits having a minor league franchise."
Williamsport Crosscutters Thus far, the Williamsport Crosscutters also seem to be taking a wait-and-see approach to the reports, telling fans "nothing has or will be decided in this process for a very long time" in a statement released on social media.
"Further to that, as MLB has stated publicly, their main concerns are around facility standards and significant distance of some clubs from their affiliates (neither of which apply to the Crosscutters) so this is just a natural process of negotiation on behalf of all 160 Minor League baseball teams," reads the organization's statement.
The Crosscutters also confirmed the club will continue serving as a Phillies affiliate for the 2020 season and says meetings are planned to discuss extending that agreement.
The Erie SeaWolves are a AA affiliate of the Detroit Tigers.

Texto completo: Aside from a few lawyers, it'd be hard to find anyone to disagree that Maggy Hurchalla is the real deal: real Floridian, real environmentalist, real storyteller, real character.
As the New York Times put it in a recent profile of Hurchalla: "She is one of the few remaining voices of a generation that remembers hurricanes before they had names, the last surviving child of a mother who built the family homestead by hand. Her life has spanned much of the state's modern history, a story of growth inextricable from development."
This former Martin County commissioner, who also happens to be Janet Reno's little sister, will take the stage Saturday in Fort Myers, joined by a band of fellow eco-luminaries at a fundraiser for Calusa Waterkeeper.
But she won't be going over the details of her high-profile legal tangle with rock mining company Lake Point Restoration, which the Times characterized as a saga of "secret emails, the ownership of Florida's fresh water, and the constitutional rights to free speech and to petition the government." Nor will Hurchalla be lecturing about toxic blue-green algae, or even talking about her pioneering sister, the first woman to become U.S. attorney general — though she could certainly expound on any of those topics. Instead, Hurchalla's going to tell a story.
"They can expect not to be bored by me giving them a long list of facts about cyanobacteria. I'm not going to talk about that at all," she said with a chuckle. "Although I will talk to anybody at the drop of a hat about any subject to do with the water, I'm going to tell the story about the time my little brother and I walked all the way across the Everglades."
To be able to listen to her at the Sidney & Berne Davis Art Center will be a rare treat, says Calusa Waterkeeper Executive Director K.C. Schulberg, who's dubbed Hurchalla "the lioness of the environmental movement."
Hurchalla likes that handle. In fact, after relating how a Lake Point lawyer "told the (court) at oral arguments that I was a 'self-styled environmentalist' only pretending to be an environmentalist in order to carry out my malevolent purpose of destroying Lake Point," Hurchalla jokes, "in order to prove I am real," she says she's adopting a new, Schulberg-inspired name: Miz Lion.
Sharing the spotlight with Miz Lion Saturday will be a star-studded lineup of environmental warriors, educators and artists of various stripes. "The idea is to hit this from a different angle — the culture of water, and not just the science," Schulberg said. "That's our bread and butter, of course, but this will be about celebrating it."
Joining Hurchalla will be:
Paul Arsenault, painter and historian dedicated to environmental preservation through his artwork and messages. The Montreal native has a studio in Naples called the Arsenault Studio & Banyan Arts Gallery.
Cindy Bear, coordinator of programs and services for the Randell Research Center, which has conducted environmental education programs and research in Southwest Florida since 1983.
John Cassani, Calusa Waterkeeper who has made it his mission to inform the public about the historic significance and present and future of Florida's waterways, specifically the conditions of local estuaries, including the Caloosahatchee. For this event only, Cassani will not be speaking on scientific matter.
Wayne Daltry, a North Fort Myers growth management guru, who was director of Lee County's Smart Growth Department and spent 27 years with the Southwest Florida Regional Planning Council, including 20 as executive director.
Dave Menist, owner of Florida's Son Fishing Charter, who's worked to rally stakeholders around the environmental crisis impacting local waterways.
The evening also will include food, artwork by Arsenault and Marcus Jansen with live music by U.S. Air Force Capt. Brendan Best and musical duo Roots 2 Vines as well as recycled fashion and a silent auction. Up for bid include a number of unique lots including a fossil-hunting trip to Cassani's secret spot, boat cruises, a private screening of "Wind Across the Everglades," a carving by Seminole artist Brian Zepeda and much more, Schulberg said.
"We spend all year advocating and educating for clean water," Schulberg said. "This is a chance to have some fun and commemorate the culture as well as the science. Last year's event was truly memorable (and) this year promises to be as good, or better."

Democrats' impeachment inquiry keeps Latin alive

Texto completo: I have a complicated relationship with Latin.
Back when I was 9 going on 10, as I solemnly prepared to become an altar boy at St. Joseph's Roman Catholic Church, I memorized my part in the entire Tridentine Mass. From the marble-mouthed opening "Ad Deum qui laetificat juventutem meam" ("To God, who gives joy to my youth") to the mercifully succinct finale "Deo gratias" (Thanks be to God"), it was a phonological feat that made those three-minute French dialogues look like child's play.
I confess I had no clue what I was saying. Still, kneeling up there next to the priest, our backs turned secretively to the congregation, the Latin liturgy felt almost magical - a secret language that only we could speak while all those poor souls in the pews sat in dutiful silence.
Then, only weeks after my first service, the church decreed that Mass would henceforth be spoken in English. All that relentless memorization, all those late-night anxiety attacks that I'd forget my lines halfway through the "Confiteor" evaporated in an instant by decree of the Second Vatican Council.
Talk about a bait and switch. I swore I'd never speak Latin again.
Or so I thought.
However you may view the impeachment proceedings against President Trump, you have undoubtedly uttered the phrase "quid pro quo" at least a hundred times since it first was quoted in a Sept. 9 text message from Ambassador Gordon Sondland to a distraught U.S. diplomat William Taylor.
"The President has been crystal clear no quid pro quo's of any kind," Sondland texted, responding to Taylor's concerns that Trump wanted to swap military aid to Ukraine for dirt on the president's chief political opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden.
With that, a catchphrase was born. "Quid pro quo!" or "No quid pro quo!" That was the question.
Then suddenly, late last week, the ancient phrase got tossed into the rhetorical trash heap.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other top Democrats, derided by Republicans for having to "resort to Latin" to tarnish Trump, and worried that too many Americans don't know a "quid pro quo" from squid with parsley and garlic, quietly rebranded their quest to focus on "extortion" and "bribery."
They had good reason.
First, extortion and bribery are, in fact, what Trump was up to when he dangled military aid and a visit to the White House in front of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in exchange for promised "investigations" of the Democrats and Biden.
Second, as 33 members of the Authors Guild complained recently in an open letter to The New York Times, "Most people don't understand what (quid pro quo) means ..."
Similarly, in noting the semantic shift away from "quid pro quo" and toward "extortion" and "bribery," the Times reported last week that "Democrats were working to put a simple name to the president's alleged wrongdoing that would resonate with the public."
It's enough to make you wonder: Is Latin - from which more than half the English language is derived - indeed a dead language that no one understands? Of interest only to linguistic scholars and drunk tailgaters who scream "Carpe diem!" at the sight of a barbecue grill bursting into flames?
Or is Latin actually here, there and everywhere?
Lovers of language, lend me your ears. I give you Seth Knowles.
For the past 16 years, Knowles has taught Latin - and only Latin - at Greely High School in Cumberland. He also oversees the school's Maine Junior Classical League chapter - a group of 20 or so Greely kids who consider Latin the ultimate in 21st-century cool.
"Latin is still very much alive," said Knowles, a classics scholar who holds a bachelor's degree from Bowdoin College and a master's from the University of Georgia, in an interview Wednesday. "It never really has gone away."
Part of Latin's allure for certain adolescents, Knowles said, is that it's different. It's a little mysterious. It attracts kids who like a challenge. Kids who enjoy nothing more than to "geek out with other Latin students" at state and national conventions that are nothing short of raucous.
Greely just hosted such a gathering of about 300 Latin students from 15 Maine high schools. After academic tests and a quiz competition called "certamen" (Latin for "contests"), the day culminated in a "spirit competition" where school delegations took this year's theme - portray ancient mythical creatures - and ran with it.
"It's loud and it's boisterous," Knowles said. "All the students are there because they love the classics, they love Latin and Greek, and they want to be with other people who do, too."
Knowles' goal is to have all his students be able to read Latin, not necessarily speak it.
"If they see it out in the world, I want them to be able to recognize what they're seeing, to be able to say, 'I know what this means,' " he said.
Bless him.
So, back to "quid pro quo." Thumbs up or thumbs down?
"The meaning is incredibly vague," Knowles said. "It's 'something for something.' That's literally what it means."
Hence, Knowles' professional opinion: "'Quid pro quo' is not doing the job."
At the same time, he added, "Words like 'extortion' are much more direct and, honestly, a lot more powerful than 'quid pro quo.' "
And where did "extortion" come from?
Where else?
"'Extortion' comes from the Latin word 'extorqueo,' which means twisting something out, pulling something out of somebody," Knowles said.
As in: One day, the most powerful man in the world tried to extorqueo a bogus, politically driven investigation out of a weaker country in exchange for military arms and an invitation to the White House.
Or to paraphrase White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney: We extorqueo all the time. Get over it!
Either way, quid pro quo or no quid pro quo, let's hear it for Latin.
It's the language that keeps on living.

Texto completo: Suggestions for plants that can survive a dark apartment and the best small containers for composting kitchen waste.
This column is part of a series for the Design special report of The New York Times. Readers are invited to send questions to designadvice@nytimes.com.
My parents are downsizing and trying to push furniture on me and my siblings. I'm not talking about stodgy old brown furniture, but some sizable and boldly colored postmodern pieces they collected and love but no longer have room for. One is a massive bookcase and another a giant sofa. I don't want to scuttle these objects, but I'm scared to insert them into our minimally furnished white loft. Is there hope of integrating them?
The good news is that after a long period of disdain, your parents' postmodern furniture has finally increased in value. As to melding it with your personal aesthetic, statement pieces that command the room like works of art can look great in a reductive environment -- and even better than in a house full of the stuff (no offense to Mom and Dad).
We moved into our house 12 years ago, when bold-colored walls combined with David Hicks-inspired geometric patterns felt fresh and special. At the time, we were in revolt against the early-90s neutrals fad, but now want to dial back to that. The problem is, the catalogs are brimming with the same return-of-neutrals story, too, and we worry it will soon be exhausted. Where do we go from here?
The problem with adopting a particular "look" is that of course it will become dated. There are exceptions, like actual David Hicks interiors or masterworks by the Belgian minimalist Axel Vervoordt. But for most mortals, filling a house, all at once, with similarly styled objects gets tired fast.
It is better to add and subtract elements in different yet compatible colors and patterns over time, allowing a more personal feeling to evolve naturally. Ideally you will think of such redos as an opportunity to cull the things you don't care for anymore and layer in new things you earnestly hope are contenders for eternal use. (Limit trendy elements to small objects like pillows.)
I admire how decorators as great as Albert Hadley have furnished their own interiors by dragging the same pieces from house to house, changing backgrounds but not contents. We should all aspire to that level of personal curation.
I've been saving our kitchen scraps in a covered trash bin and taking them to the farmer's market weekly for composting, but I find the odors and fruit flies an affront. With Thanksgiving -- and an abundance of food scraps from meal preparation -- around the corner, what are my options for a nice-looking composting container with no smells or little friends?
One of the most popular solutions is the all-stainless Epica ( $ 23), which looks like a miniature trash can. What makes it lovable is the airtight lid and charcoal filter, as well as the basin formed from a single piece of metal that will not leak. It holds more than a gallon of material and can go in the dishwasher.
Somewhat cuter is the Oxo Good Grips Compost Bin ( $ 20), a squarish plastic affair that bears the company's ergo-mod aesthetic and is offered in white or black. It has most of the Epica's features, but three-fourths of the capacity. The smaller size might be an asset, though, if your counter space is tight.
Bamboozle's Stationary Composter (at the currently reduced price of $ 39) looks similar to the Oxo -- and also comes in black or white -- but is made of processed bamboo, with a natural bamboo handle, and holds a whopping 2.5 gallons.
Whichever bin you choose, be sure it has a carbon filter or airtight lid -- criteria that sadly eliminate a lot of attractive wood and ceramic options.
I've killed pretty much every plant I have ever been given, and my second-floor apartment isn't exactly bathed in sunlight. But I really like the look of houseplants and would love to pepper my shady cave with some life. How do I pick plants other than mushrooms that will thrive in a dark environment?
In general, the options for darker spaces have broad leaves (better to absorb sunlight) that are waxy (which helps them retain moisture). Sansevieria, or mother-in-law's tongue, is a classic un-killable, with a spiky upright form good for tight spaces. Aspidistra -- otherwise known as cast iron plants because of their resilience -- also have vertical leaves, but in a less compact shape.
These plants are available in several varieties, with striped or speckled leaves that range in color from green to chocolate. All are happy to sit in the dark waiting for the occasional drink.
A bushier option is the Zamioculcas, or ZZ plant, which will respond to dimness and neglect with long, arched fronds of thick, shiny leaves.
If you are looking for something taller, Dracaena fragrans, commonly referred to as the cane or corn plant, is a good bet. A mainstay of waiting rooms, it will tolerate a windowless location. Should you ignore it to the point of wilting, it will spring back to life with just a little attention.

This article is part of our November Design special section , which focuses on style, function and form in the workplace.
Objects That Pack a Punch
Mitchell "Micky" Wolfson, Jr., has amassed more than 200,000 socially potent collectibles, including a Braille copy of "Mein Kampf" and a 1938 railroad car designed by Fiat for the fascist government of Italy.
An author and philanthropist, who is particularly interested in how art and design are used for propaganda, Mr. Wolfson founded and filled two museums with his discoveries: The Wolfsonian (now a division of Florida International University), in his hometown, Miami Beach, Fla., and the Wolfsoniana in Genoa, Italy.
"Collecting is my autobiography," he recently said, on the cusp of a museum exhibition celebrating his 80th birthday, which took place on Sept. 30. "A Universe of Things: Micky Wolfson Collects" opened Nov. 15 at the Wolfsonian-FIU with more than 100 of his handpicked treasures. These include the 1930 Geneva Window in which the stained glass artist Harry Clarke represented 15 contemporary Irish writers; a Hotzi Notzi novelty Adolf Hitler pincushion; and an assortment of the racy comic books known as Tijuana bibles that were popular in the Great Depression.
"It's everything that has to do with living," Mr. Wolfson said of the assemblage. "Blasphemy, sex -- they're all part of our lives."
Thirty-seven of the show's items are also featured in "Wolfsonian-FIU: Founder's Choice," a companion book from Scala Arts Publishers (80 pp., $ 14.95). Information: wolfsonian.org -- Arlene Hirst
No Longer Grimm
A crumbling gingerbread castle, built in Hamburg, N.J., in the 1920s as an amusement park, may have finally landed its Prince Charming.
The Gingerbread Castle was originally commissioned from the architect and set designer Joseph Urban by the baked-goods magnate Frederick H. Bennett. The castle adjoined Bennett's factory, Wheatsworth Mills, famed for producing Milk-Bone dog biscuits. Urban decorated the turrets and domed interiors with simulated frosting, gumdrops, peppermint sticks, animal crackers, gingerbread men and other sweets. Among the sculptures and murals on-site were Miss Muffet's spider with glittering eyes, the Man in the Moon and Jack dangling from a beanstalk.
The attraction, which drew hundreds of thousands of people annually in its mid-20th-century heyday, was shuttered about 20 years ago. By 2012 it had made it onto Preservation New Jersey's list of most endangered historic sites.
Since 2017 Don Oriolo, a home builder in New Jersey, has been restoring the vandalized property. "It's been sitting stagnant for so many years," he said. He plans to hold public events there in a year or so.
A documentary about the castle, "Once Upon a Time in New Jersey," has been completed by the filmmakers Paul Bruker and Jeff Shelly. The project was in progress for 17 years. "I captured the castle every two or three years," Mr. Bruker said.

"She's doubting. She realizes love can be heavy," said Pierre Yovanovitch.
The French designer was at R & Company gallery in TriBeCa, talking about Miss Oops, the fictional heroine of the romance story he dreamed up for his new exhibition there. For his lovelorn character, Mr. Yovanovitch constructed an apartment inside the gallery (parlor, dining room, boudoir and bedroom) and decorated the interiors as a way to debut his new furniture collection.
The 20 or so pieces include embroidered pillows; a large solid oak dining table with dark blue patinated steel legs; mirrors and a fireplace made of nubby ceramic; and a pair of oak side chairs with gorgeous custom upholstery by Lesage, the legendary French embroidery house (prices range from $ 2,500 to $ 4,500 for pillows to $ 60,000 for the dining table).
Mr. Yovanovitch's designs, for his imaginary friends, his clients and himself, are marked by impeccable simplicity, with flourishes of whimsy (his "Papa Bear" and "Mama Bear" armchairs have fabric ears) and biomorphic shapes that can appear Flinstonian.
"I like when it's not perfect," he said. Through Jan. 4, 2020, 64 White Street. Information: r-and-company.com -- Steven Kurutz
Working Inside and Out
Walter Hood, the founder and creative director of Hood Design Studio in Oakland, Calif., is known for projects that blend landscape, urbanism and public art in equal measure. And this fall, he received two prestigious awards: a MacArthur Fellowship, and the Dorothy and Lillian Gish Prize. Mr. Hood, whose work is community-focused, said he was happy that they were "not architecture-centric; they're more focused on social issues."
He is applying a similar focus to the corporate landscape, with a three-acre park now under construction at the headquarters of the tech company Nvidia, in the Silicon Valley city of Santa Clara. Connecting two large buildings designed by the architecture firm Gensler, the park is intended, Mr. Hood said, "to bring the inside to the outside, and vice versa."
Under a steel shade structure with photovoltaic panels (a collaboration with Gensler), a lush landscape contains places for employees to work or meet at sculpted wood "rocks" rather than conventional outdoor furniture, as well as an amphitheater and two circular "treehouse" structures.
The concept of working al fresco was promoted by Jen-Hsun Huang, Nvidia's chief executive, and the result, Mr. Hood said, "is not the usual office-park greensward."
Indeed, it gives a new meaning to the notion of blue-sky thinking. -- Pilar Viladas

Texto completo: Our reporters are following all of the exchanges and fact-checking the candidates, providing context and explanation on the policy debates.
Ten candidates vying for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination took the debate stage Wednesday night in Atlanta for the fifth round of debates.
Here is how the candidates' remarks stacked up against the truth.
Representative Tulsi Gabbard was misleading about statements by Mayor Pete Buttigieg on sending troops to Mexico.
Ms. Gabbard: "I think the most recent example of your inexperience in national security and foreign policy came from your recent careless statement about how you as president would be willing to send our troops to Mexico to fight the cartels."
Mr. Buttigieg: "I was talking about U.S.-Mexico cooperation."
Mr. Buttigieg was right. At a Democratic forum this week in Los Angeles, Mr. Buttigieg was asked about President Trump's recent suggestions that the United States help Mexico wage "war" on the cartels and whether he envisioned a situation in which American troops would be stationed in Mexico "if Mexico welcomed it."
In his response, Mr. Buttigieg emphasized that Mr. Trump's approach violated Mexican sovereignty and the need for Mexican cooperation and approval in any military response.
"There is a scenario where we could have security cooperation as we do with countries around the world," Mr. Buttigieg said. "Now, I would only order American troops into conflict if there were no other choice, if American lives were on the line and if this was necessary to meet treaty obligations. But we could absolutely be in some kind of partnership role, if and only if it welcomed by our partner south of the border."
Senator Elizabeth Warren claimed that her 2 percent wealth tax on households worth more than $ 50 million would pay for a sweeping expansion of the nation's social safety net, providing free child care and college tuition.
"We can put $ 800 billion new federal dollars into all of our public schools. We can make college tuition-free for every kid. We can put $ 50 billion into historically black colleges and universities. And we can cancel student loan debt for 95 percent of the folks who have got it."
The revenue that Ms. Warren would raise from her tax proposal is a subject of intense debate and it is not clear that her wealth tax could pay for the plans she listed. According to a New York Times analysis, the total cost of Ms. Warren's plans for universal child care, increased spending on public schools, student debt cancellation and free college would be about $ 2.9 trillion over a decade. The two Berkeley economists advising her campaign, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, estimate that her wealth tax would generate $ 2.75 trillion over that period of time. If that is correct, then Ms. Warren would be close to being able to pay for those proposals. (Ms. Warren has recently revised her wealth tax proposal, and Mr. Saez and Mr. Zucman have refined their calculations but the general conclusions are the same.)
But other economists disagree, arguing that a wealth tax would spur waves of new loopholes and tax evasion efforts. Lawrence H. Summers, a Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton, and Natasha Sarin, a law and finance professor at the University of Pennsylvania, estimated that Ms. Warren's wealth tax would raise just 40 percent of what her campaign claims.
If Ms. Warren's tax proposals raise less revenue than she projects, it will be difficult to pay for her grand plans without adding to the deficit.
Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. exaggerated in saying that "Medicare for all" was a policy without sufficiently broad support among Democrats.
"The fact is that right now the vast majority of Democrats do not support 'Medicare for all.' It couldn't pass the United States Senate right now with Democrats. It couldn't pass the House."
This is exaggerated. Depending on how you measure, a majority of Democratic voters do support Medicare for all. Support among Democrats in Congress is weaker than that, but it is hard to find any measure that shows a vast majority who oppose the policy.
Public polling shows that a majority of Americans favor Medicare for all when they are asked about it. A Kaiser Family Foundation survey published Wednesday found that 53 percent of adults approve of the idea -- including more than 75 percent of Democrats.
Among elected officials, support is softer. Mr. Biden is correct that a Medicare for all bill would be unlikely to pass in the current House, despite Democratic control. A Medicare for all bill sponsored by Representative Pramila Jayapal of Washington has more than 116 sponsors out of 233 Democrats currently serving in the House, almost half the party but far short of the votes necessary to pass the legislation. In the Senate, support is a bit weaker: 15 of 45 senators who caucus with the party support Senator Bernie Sanders's Medicare for all bill.
Andrew Yang noted that the United States was one of only two countries that do not provide universal paid maternal leave. There are a few more, but none among peer nations.
"There are only two countries in the world that don't have paid family leave for new moms. The United States of America and Papua New Guinea. That is the entire list, and we need to get off this list as soon as possible."
Mostly true. Mr. Yang likely got this line from a report of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which has examined parental leave policies in 120 countries. Of that group, the United States and Papua New Guinea are the only countries without paid leave policies. But worldwide, there are a few other small countries on the list, including Tonga and Suriname, according to the World Policy Center, which tracks leave policies in more nations.
If the details aren't quite right, Mr. Yang's larger point stands. The United States is unique among large advanced nations in not requiring any paid leave to new mothers.
Mr. Buttigieg was misleading about a case involving the president and nonprofit groups.
"The president had to confess in writing, in court, to illegally diverting charitable contributions that were supposed to go to veterans."
This is misleading. In early November, Mr. Trump was ordered by a New York State judge to pay $ 2 million in damages to nonprofit groups after he was found to have violated a law by using the now-defunct Donald J. Trump Foundation as an extension of his campaign. Mr. Buttigieg's suggestion that the funds did not reach veterans groups, however, is wrong.
The foundation raised $ 2.8 million for veterans' groups during an event in Iowa in January 2016, but allowed the Trump campaign to disburse those funds. Mr. Trump admitted that this was a campaign event, though the foundation, as a charity, was prohibited from supporting candidates for political office.
Justice Saliann Scarpulla, of the State Supreme Court in Manhattan, noted in the ruling that "the funds did ultimately reach their intended destinations, i.e., charitable organizations supporting veterans" but that the foundation's officers, including Mr. Trump, breached their fiduciary responsibilities to the charity.
Senator Amy Klobuchar exaggerated the level of public support for Planned Parenthood, though it is pretty high.
"Over 70 percent of the people support Roe v. Wade. Over 90 percent of the people support funding for Planned Parenthood and making sure that women can get the health care they need."
This is exaggerated. When asked in surveys, a majority of Americans say they support some abortion rights. And many Americans support continuing funding for Planned Parenthood, the national network of women's health providers that includes many abortion clinics.
But Ms. Klobuchar's numbers are a bit higher than those in most polls that ask such questions. A Kaiser Family Foundation survey in May asked about a Trump administration policy that prevents Planned Parenthood from receiving funding for family planning services. In that survey, 69 percent of adults said that they support continued funding for Planned Parenthood, not 90 percent.
In that same survey, 65 percent said they would oppose a Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court decision that establishes a constitutional right to abortion. It is possible to find a survey in line with Ms. Klobuchar's number, but with some caveats. A survey in June from NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist Poll found more than 70 percent of respondents in support of Roe, but that group included people who said they want to "keep Roe v. Wade but add more restrictions."

Texto completo: China's legislative body criticized a court ruling overturning a ban on wearing masks, signaling that it was the final arbiter of law in Hong Kong.
BEIJING -- After months of relative restraint, China's Communist government this week took its most decisive steps to intervene in Hong Kong's political crisis, signaling a more forceful response that could further inflame tensions in the Chinese territory.
China's top legislative body, the National People's Congress, warned that it would use its authority, if necessary, to overrule the territory's judiciary. It followed a Hong Kong court's ruling on Monday overturning a contentious ban on wearing face masks, which protesters have used to shield their identities from the police.
The warning struck at the very heart of what has fueled the unrest, a concern about Beijing's encroachment on Hong Kong. The protests began in June over another legal issue: legislation allowing the extradition of criminal defendants into the opaque and notoriously injudicious judicial system of the mainland.
While the bill has since been withdrawn, Beijing has not yielded an inch from its view that the Communist Party remains the ultimate arbiter of justice. That position is especially fraught for Hong Kong, where the court system has been a defining feature of the "one country, two systems" arrangement that promises the territory significant autonomy.
"It represents a new stage in Hong Kong's protest movement," Wu Qiang, a political analyst in Beijing, said of the warning from the National People's Congress, a body that functions as a rubber stamp of the party's policy agenda. "It has reached the stage of a very direct conflict over sovereignty."
Although Chinese officials have intensified their denunciations of the protesters as extremists and even blamed the "black hands" of western nations in stoking unrest, they have until now largely left the handling of the crisis to the city's chief executive, Carrie Lam. Now, Beijing's patience appears to be wearing out.
Last week, China's top leader, Xi Jinping, toughened his tone. Mr. Xi, who has stirred internal rumblings over the handling of the protests, declared during a visit to Brazil that "the most urgent task" in Hong Kong was "to halt the violence and chaos and to restore order."
A more aggressive strategy is not without risks for Beijing. The protests have left thousands injured, caused significant material and economic damage, and resulted in the arrest of about 700 people during a siege at one campus this week. It has also rattled international confidence in Hong Kong's unique financial and political status since Britain returned sovereignty to the mainland in 1997.
The warning from the National People's Congress affirmed fears that Beijing is bent on steadily increasing its influence over the territory's affairs, abandoning its promises to preserve the city's distinct historical, political and cultural characteristics. On Tuesday, the United States Senate unanimously passed legislation that could authorize the government to impose sanctions on officials responsible for human rights abuses in the territory.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry denounced the bill, saying it "interferes in China's internal affairs" and violates the norms of international law and relations.
The Hong Kong government said the bill was "unnecessary and unwarranted" and would damage Hong Kong's relationship with the United States.
The increasingly barbaric convulsions of violence on both sides have changed the calculus in Beijing, which has been telegraphing a potentially harder line.
When a garrison of the People's Liberation Army in Hong Kong sent unarmed soldiers out of their barracks to help clean up debris from a street on Saturday, some of them wore shirts identifying them as members of a counterterrorism unit normally based on the mainland.
In August, the Chinese military sent thousands of new troops into the city as part of what it called an annual rotation. China has never confirmed the total number of mainland soldiers in the territory, raising fears that it has quietly bolstered the force.
In some ways, the protesters' use of increasingly creative makeshift weapons, including bows and arrows, slingshots and explosives, has played into China's narrative. The state media has used images from the streets as evidence of the spiraling dangers of unchecked popular protests, which are banned on the mainland.
"The violent crimes are a 'virus' threatening Hong Kong society and a common enemy that is a scourge to all humankind," The People's Daily, the chief newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, wrote in an editorial on its front page on Tuesday. "The savagery of the Hong Kong rioters has already transgressed the bottom line of human morality and civilization, and no country or civilized society would ever permit it."
That a court in Hong Kong would overturn an emergency decree by the executive branch -- something inconceivable in China -- stoked similar outpourings of outrage in China's choreographed state media.
In a statement released the morning after the ruling, a spokesman for the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Zang Tiewei, said overturning the mask ban had "seriously weakened the lawful governing power" of Hong Kong's government. He went on to say that the ruling did not comply with the Basic Law, the constitution-like document that governs relations between the territory and the central government.
The legislature has not moved to overturn the ruling -- yet. Still, it strongly indicated that the government in Beijing, not the courts, should decide matters of national security.
The court's decision "triggered totally malign consequences," the Global Times, a nationalist Chinese tabloid, said on Tuesday in an editorial welcoming the decision by the state to intervene. "It gave encouragement to the rioters and left the Hong Kong police force bewildered."
Article 158 of the Basic Law does give the Congress the authority to interpret whether Hong Kong's legal affairs comply with national law, but typically it has only acted when the courts there have sought such interpretations.
Julian G. Ku, a law professor at Hofstra University's Maurice A. Deane School of Law in New York, said in an emailed message that the statements pre-empted the normal review process. It suggested that Beijing worried that the highest judicial body, the Court of Final Appeal, could also rule against the mask ban.
"Issuing what looks like a news release before issuing an interpretation seems presumptuous and maybe a little panicky," he said.
It is exactly things like this -- a ruling by an independent court -- that protesters say they are now fighting for on the streets.
"It will completely destroy 'One Country, Two Systems' separation of powers and rule of law," Dennis Kwok, a pro-democracy lawmaker who represents Hong Kong's legal sector, said of a move by the National People's Congress. "So many Basic Law provisions are at stake here."
Whatever happens next -- whether Hong Kong's Court of Final Appeal reverses the reversal, or Beijing overrides the courts -- will be viewed as more evidence of the Communist government's push to impose greater and greater control over the city's affairs.
After all that has happened, that might be the point.
On the same day as the warning to Hong Kong's judiciary, the State Council in Beijing announced that it had approved the appointment of a new police chief in Hong Kong -- another reminder that the central government has the final say. Tang Ping-Keung, the new chief, has trained and studied extensively in the mainland, as well as at the F.B.I.'s academy in Quantico, Va.
Wei Leijie, a law professor at Xiamen University in southeastern China, said that the political crisis in Hong Kong had reached a level obliging the authorities to consider stronger measures.
"Soft things need to be hardened," he said, "and the hard things should be made more specific."

Texto completo: The Chinese Communist Party is devouring its own and cutting itself off from reality. A set of Chinese Communist Party documents was leaked to The New York Times and published last weekend. They not only reveal the rationale and implementation of the Chinese Communist Party's policies in Xinjiang, a nominally autonomous region in northwestern China. They also open a window onto how China functions today, both at the top and closer to the bottom of its party-state hierarchy. And that reveals two things about the C.C.P.: its awesome power and its fundamental weakness.
From excerpts from the documents and the reporting, we learn that Xi Jinping, the party's chairman and the country's president, reacted strongly to a trio of terrorist attacks in the spring of 2014. Previously, the party's policy toward the peoples of Xinjiang -- Uighurs and Kazakhs and other mostly Turkic-speaking, Muslim ethnic minorities -- had largely been based on the theory that economic development and improved standards of living would defuse any dissent. This idea derives from traditional Marxist thinking: The "superstructure" of ideology, theorists argued, is determined by the economic "base" of class relations. But after the attacks of 2014, Mr. Xi jettisoned this notion, and in a series of speeches concluded that material measures alone had proved insufficient to quell separatist sentiment in Xinjiang.
Henceforth, Mr. Xi announced, it would be necessary to transform the thinking of Xinjiang's Muslims through psychological means. This initiated what would become a campaign of mass indoctrination against what Mr. Xi and the C.C.P. called the "virus" of "religious extremism." In practice, the effort meant targeting everyday expressions of Islamic belief (owning a Quran, praying, avoiding alcohol and tobacco, fasting during Ramadan) and even secular aspects of non-Chinese culture (such as Uighur language and music). Mr. Xi also called for expanding surveillance through both high-tech systems and low-tech boots on the ground.
In the couple of years that followed the transfer of Chen Quanguo, previously the first party secretary in Tibet, to the same top position in Xinjiang in August 2016, some 350,000 people were arrested and prosecuted and more than one million Uighurs and Kazakhs were interned extralegally to undergo indoctrination. Some of the detainees were then transferred to factories associated with the camps, where they were made to work for low or, in some cases, no wages.
Some of the most fascinating revelations to emerge from the leaked documents concern the reaction of local Han officials tasked with enforcing Mr. Xi's campaign. Not surprisingly, officials who had lived and worked in Xinjiang for years hesitated when the party center, nearly 2,000 miles away in Beijing, called upon them to lock up thousands of their constituents for alleged thought crimes. For example, we learn in detail how Wang Yongzhi, the party boss of Yarkand, a county of some 800,000 people in southwestern Xinjiang, struggled with this mandate.
Mr. Wang should probably not be considered a hero. He did spend $ 180 million on camps and other security infrastructure in Yarkand and initially interned 20,000 people. But he ultimately released some 7,000 internees. The C.C.P., in its public denunciation of Mr. Wang, accused him of corruption. Yet according to a leaked party report and his own confession, Mr. Wang said that outsiders poorly understood local conditions. "The policies and measures taken by higher levels were at gaping odds with realities on the ground and could not be implemented in full," he wrote.
With so much of Yarkand's labor force locked up, Mr. Wang worried that its economy would decline and that he would miss his economic-growth targets, harming his chances for career advancement. Mr. Wang also seemed to suspect that prolonged mass internment would not lead Uighurs to love the C.C.P. (We know from other sources that families have been torn apart and tens of thousands of children sent to state boarding schools and orphanages.)
Mr. Wang wasn't alone in doubting. The Xinjiang papers mention that Gu Wansheng, the party secretary of neighboring Akto county, was also purged. They do not reveal if local Han-Chinese officials opposed the C.C.P.'s mass-internment policy because of pangs of conscience. But they show that officials resisted on practical grounds -- and were punished for it. In fact, astoundingly, the documents mention that more than 12,000 investigations were conducted into the behavior of Xinjiang officials suspected of inadequately pursuing Beijing's mandate.
With this, the leaked papers underscore the C.C.P.'s vast power: The party can round up hundreds of thousands of people and detain them indefinitely, while silencing other citizens and compelling obedience from officials. But they also suggest its weakness.
Not only have officials been quietly resisting policies imposed from the top -- and now, too, have leaked these incriminating documents. But in sidelining and punishing such people, the C.C.P. isn't just devouring itself: It is also declaring war on expertise and depriving itself of firsthand knowledge about local conditions in Xinjiang. Once again, as during the days of Mao, the party is cutting itself off from reality and choking off the information it needs to govern.

Emilia Clarke reveals Hollywood's other #MeToo problem

Texto completo: Emilia Clarke didn't want to be nude.
When she joined the cast of Game of Thrones, Clarke was a no-name actress who had some experience in theater and could boast a couple of TV appearances. She had landed her big break: a spot as Daenerys Targaryen on the show, which ended this year and had become famous for its gratuitous, SNL-parodied nudity.
"Oh, there's the catch," Clarke recalls thinking when she first got ahold of the script, looking at the "f--- ton of nudity" and sex scenes. Clarke told Dax Shepard on the Armchair Expert podcast this week that she would find herself crying in the bathroom because of nude scenes, but she felt like she couldn't say no.
"I have no idea what I'm doing. I have no idea what any of this is. I've never been on a film set like this before. I'd been on a film set twice before then. And now I'm on a film set completely naked with all of these people," she said, explaining that she felt "impostor syndrome."
"And I don't know what I'm meant to do and I don't know what's expected of me and I don't know what you want and I don't know what I want," she added. "Regardless of whether there had been nudity or not, I would've spent that first season thinking I'm not worthy of requiring anything."
Luckily, Clarke said she had a friend on set: co-star Jason Momoa. "He took care of me too in an environment where I didn't know I needed to be taken care of," she explained. He would tell her, "No, sweetie, this isn't okay."
Like many other young women in Hollywood, Clarke says it took a long time before she was willing to stand up for herself.
“I have had fights on set before when I am like, ‘No, sheet stays up.’ And they are like, ‘You don’t want to disappoint your Game of Thrones fans.’ And I’m like, ‘F--- you,’” she said.
Clarke says if the first season of Game of Thrones was filmed today, it would look different. But even though the show began before the #MeToo movement and the revelations that Harvey Weinstein wasn't the only one sexually coercing women under the guise of art, the tide will turn slowly — if at all.
In the New York Times feature "Harvey Weinstein Is My Monster Too," Salma Hayek described how the disgraced Hollywood producer threatened to shut down the film Frida unless Hayek displayed full-frontal nudity and appeared in a sex scene with another woman.
Actresses from Sarah Jessica Parker to Debra Messing have faced similar pressure. Last year, the Washington Post ran a feature on the many young actresses who "get pressured into ‘creepy’ nude scenes." Loan Dang, a partner at a Los Angeles-based entertainment law firm, told the Washington Post that the problem is widespread.
“It happens to everyone,” Dang said. “The actor gets pressured into doing something they don’t feel comfortable with. Everyone says, ‘You’re holding stuff up, can you make a decision?’ You’re with these people on set, you work with them, so then you think, ‘Oh God, how do I say no?’”
Many years after Clarke launched into the industry through Game of Thrones, she says, "I'm a lot more savvy about what I'm comfortable with."
Other women are demanding more support on set, according to Harper's Bazaar. But if each individual actress must wait until she's powerful enough to resist the pressure to appear in scenes with which she's not comfortable, the problem will just continue, and actresses can only hope to age out of it.
Pressure to produce sexual content is sadly common in Hollywood, and the trend likely won't improve much post-Weinstein and post-#MeToo unless more film producers stop demanding that vulnerable women strip down for viewers.
That doesn't seem likely to happen anytime soon. After all, the demand is still there.

Texto completo: Bernie Sanders attacked former Vice President Joe Biden over U.S. foreign policy and ripped him for his support of the Iraq War.
Sanders was responding to a question about whether he would negotiate a deal with the Taliban when he first took the opportunity to criticize Biden.
“One of the big differences between the vice president and myself is he supported the terrible war in Iraq, and I helped lead the opposition against it,” Sanders said. “And not only that, I voted against the very first Gulf War as well. And I think we need a foreign policy which understands who our enemies are that we don’t have to spend more money on the military than the next ten nations combined.”
The 77-year-old Vermont senator then moved on to the actual question at hand and claimed that the United States needed to “rethink the entire War on Terror.” He also said he would be willing to break a deal with the Taliban.
“I think it is time, after spending many trillions of dollars on these endless wars which have resulted in more dislocation and mass migrations and pain in that region, it is time to bring our troops home,” Sanders said. “But unlike Trump, I will not do it through a tweet at three o'clock in the morning. I will do it working with the international community, and if it’s necessary to negotiate with the Taliban, of course, we will do that.”
Sanders is polling at 16.7% nationally, according to the RealClearPolitics national average of polls.

It’s actually OK not to watch the impeachment hearings

Texto completo: Most people in the United States have not been tuning into the impeachment hearings over the past week. According to the media, that’s a problem.
New York Times writer Jennifer Weiner complained, “It seems to some members of the media, impeachment is no longer about right and wrong, legal versus illegal. It’s about watchable versus unwatchable, enthralling and fun versus dusty and dry.”
But this is only a problem if Democrats are using impeachment hearings to drum up more votes in 2020. No one really needs to pay attention until, you know, something actually happens.
Nevertheless, Weiner blames us for our poor attention spans: “Is it that President Trump, our clickbait leader, has trained us to expect daily drama, taking advantage of our natural affinity for the sizzle rather than the steak?”
Impeachment hearings will proceed this week whether or not they’re gathering viewers for Fox and MSNBC. And as it turns out, the demand that the rest of the country pay attention is really less about a fear for democracy and more about hopes of ousting Trump.
“The desire for politics to entertain was one of the things that gave us President Trump,” Weiner writes. “And now our collective need for amusement could keep him there.”
Further undermining her point, she quips that if we don’t stop everything, we may end up watching “Queen Ivanka’s birthday parade.”
Turn on the television kids! If you don’t, we might turn into a monarchy!
While Trump supporters such as Franklin Graham complain that the impeachment investigation is further “dividing our country,” the fact is, no one is really paying attention. Sports writer Clay Travis reported that more Americans have been watching football than impeachment: “Last week 23 million people watched Vikings-Cowboys on NBC’s Sunday Night Football. So far the most watched day of the Trump impeachment hearings — if you combine all the broadcast networks, ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, Fox News and MSNBC together — was 13 million people.”
It was the second day of impeachment hearings, Forbes reports, that gathered 13 million viewers. Most people would rather be watching something else, and that's OK.
Over at the Washington Post, Margaret Sullivan echoed Weiner by calling the national apathy “appalling.” Sullivan bemoans the man she met who said he didn’t know and didn’t care what was going on with the impeachment investigation. “This is the way a democracy self-destructs,” she writes.
Really, it’s the way politically fatigued Americans manage their time so they’re not paying attention to every stunt pulled by politicians in Washington. If articles of impeachment get approved by the House and the Senate agrees the accusations are so compelling that Trump ought to be removed, then it’s time for everyone to pay attention.
For now, the impeachment investigation is a partisan exercise. It's not even going to remove Trump — it's just a ploy to draw out more blue votes in 2020. The nation is split on impeachment, with about 48% supporting and 45% opposed. Democrats worry that if they can’t tip the scales so that impeachment hearings at least become a point in their favor, then how can they hope to oust Trump in the next election?
People are reacting to the narrative by ignoring it. Good for them. The hearings and their ensuing breathless coverage are not required viewing for concerned citizens. At the moment, Americans can enjoy the fact that unless they actually like watching endless hearings that they can later read about in the news, no one is forcing them to pay attention.

Amy Klobuchar dings 'bumper sticker' plans of 2020 Democratic rivals

Texto completo: ATLANTA — Amy Klobuchar took a dig at Elizabeth Warren's penchant for generous policy plans during the fifth Democratic primary debate, promising not to pitch unrealistic proposals to voters.
"I’m not going to go for things just because they sound good on a bumper sticker and then throw in a free car," the Minnesota senator, 59, said in Atlanta.
Klobuchar made the comments in response to a question about her push for paid family leave should she win her party's nomination next summer and beat President Trump in the general election.
Klobuchar, a former prosecutor, on Wednesday night said she would "love to staple free diplomas under people’s chairs," but she believed Democrats needed to be "fiscally responsible" and had to show the electorate they had "people's backs." Aside from Warren's free college platform, she also criticized the Massachusetts senator's support of "Medicare for all," which would effectively eliminate private health insurance in favor of a government program. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders holds similar positions.
Klobuchar's remarks showcase a more assertive posture she has adopted against her fellow White House hopefuls since last month's debate in Westerville, Ohio. On Wednesday, she additionally jabbed at South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg for his sharp rise in presidential politics, despite his lack of national experience compared to other women candidates on the stage.
Klobuchar, however, has come under scrutiny for family leave practices in her own office. In February, she changed a policy that required staffers who took up to 12 weeks of paid parental leave to remain employed with her for three times as many weeks once they returned to work or pay back their salary, the New York Times reported.
A Klobuchar aide told CNN at the time that the scheme has been updated in the staff handbook after it was brought to their attention.

Why the sluggish response to the homeless problem?

Texto completo: Homelessness is an emergency in California, but what state and local officials are doing about it amounts to malfeasance bordering on municipal manslaughter.
An emergency is an urgent situation requiring immediate action. If people were sleeping on the sidewalks after a natural disaster, the governor would probably call out the National Guard.
If government officials treated homelessness like the emergency it is, they would construct temporary emergency shelters in appropriate locations. They would bring in case workers to evaluate individuals and assist them through a process that gets them off the street immediately. They would make efforts to reunite people with family members where possible. They would prioritize funding for necessary mental health facilities, such as psychiatric hospitals and residential facilities for the treatment of substance abuse. They would build barracks-style and dormitory-style housing, quickly, and they would empower the police to enforce a ban on tent encampments.
They’re not doing any of those things.
Instead, they’re gazing moist-eyed into cameras and throwing taxpayer money at a corrupt plan to construct overpriced apartments built by campaign donors.
Then they tell you that if you don’t like it, you’re the problem.
This has not proved to be a political winner, as is evidenced by a new proposal from three members of the Los Angeles City Council. David Ryu, Joe Buscaino and Marqueece Harris-Dawson are proposing to grant emergency powers to Mayor Eric Garcetti to allow him to change zoning and suspend city rules that interfere with the approval of new sites for homeless housing and related facilities. They’d be happy to have the mayor take the heat from the community.
Their newly elected colleague John Lee is under tectonic pressure from the residents of Chatsworth to find another location for the homeless housing project he voted to approve just 200 feet from an elementary school. It would be surprising if Garcetti, already facing a recall effort, wants emergency powers to force voters to accept homeless housing in their neighborhoods.
People are rightfully furious that government officials who have presided over the spread of tent encampments throughout California are cynically using the crisis to push a “housing first” agenda that enriches cronies, but doesn’t address and won’t solve the problems of untreated severe mental illness, catastrophic drug addiction and in some places, rampant criminal activity.
By all accounts, the problem is getting worse despite billions of dollars spent. The New York Times reported alarming new data from San Francisco showing a 30% increase in homelessness in the city year-over-year, to 17,595 people. That number, which comes from the city’s database of homeless individuals who have used city services such as health care, is more than double the count from this year’s one-night survey conducted by volunteers sent out by the city.
If we saw pictures on the news of tent encampments like this in another country, the United States government would send aid. Our state government acts like it’s running its own country, so why not — we might as well accept foreign aid from Washington. And that might actually happen.
When President Trump was in California in September, he said his administration was looking at the problem of homelessness and he vowed, “We’ll be doing something about it.”
The first thing he did was oust Obama appointee Matthew Doherty from his post as executive director of the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness. “I believe I have been able to keep my integrity intact,” Doherty said in an email obtained by The Washington Post.
Whatever Trump is planning, it sounds like Doherty didn’t want to do it.
In October, Rep. Maxine Waters sent a letter to the Trump administration demanding to know the White House’s plans on the homelessness issue. She asked whether the government is going to try to convert existing government properties to emergency shelters, and what role the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness will have in the effort.
We still don’t know. But unless state and local officials in California develop an interest in addressing the problem with a realistic and affordable plan, a lot of fed-up Californians will welcome Trump’s efforts with open arms, and they might even show up at one of his rallies.

Texto completo: The three-day, family-friendly, annual Bluffton Book Festival is back for another year Thursday through Saturday.
The festival, whose mission is to raise literacy levels in the state and Beaufort County, benefits the Literacy Center of Beaufort County as well as the national Book Industry Charitable Foundation.
A highlight event will be held from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Saturday on Calhoun Street when New York Times bestselling children's author and illustrator James Dean will hold a speaking event for 100 ticketed guests. Dean will discuss his acclaimed "Pete the Cat" series and introduce his latest installment, "Pete the Cat and the Perfect Pizza Party."
The speaking event will be part of the larger street festival planned for Saturday, also from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., along Calhoun Street between Lawton and Green streets.
The free event will feature author readings and signings, performances, crafts, games, giveaways, food and music. The festival kicks off with four scheduled workshops between Thursday and Friday at the Lowcountry Presbyterian Church fellowship hall. The workshop schedule is:
* 9-10 a.m. Thursday: Self-editing for publication with award-winning author and editor Susan Diamond Riley.
* 10-11 a.m. Thursday: Navigating pathways to publication with Pat Conroy Literary Center executive director Jonathan Haupt.
* 2-3 p.m. Friday: Writing believable crime fiction with award-winning author and former FBI agent Dana Ridenour.
* 3-4 p.m. Friday : Ghostwriting 101 with celebrity ghostwriter Vickie MacIntyre.
The Taste of Gullah event scheduled for Thursday evening was canceled, according to the festival's website, which states that those who registered will be refunded.
​There will be a pair of Pat Conroy-inspired lectures at the Bluffton Library from 2-4:30 p.m. Thursday. The first will be led by Nancy Thode, whose lecture will be about her mother Ann Head. The festival website describes Head as "Beaufort's forgotten novelist and Pat Conroy's creative writing mentor."
In part two, author Bernie Schein will share stories from his newly released memoir, "Pat Conroy: Our Lifelong Friendship."
At 11:30 a.m. Friday at the Arts Center of Coastal Carolina, Tina Lifford, star of Oprah Winfrey's and Ava DuVernay's critically acclaimed OWN Network show "Queen Sugar," will speak about her time on the show and introduce her soon-to-be-released book "The Little Book of Big Lies."
"Also learn about the area of Louisiana (much like Mitchelville on Hilton Head Island in that it was left to ancestors of slaves), which is the inspiration for the book and television show Queen Sugar," the festival website states.
From 6-9 p.m. Friday, the festival's featured authors will wine and dine with guests at the Masquerade & Mystery Under the Moonlight dinner at Oak Terrace at Rose Hill.
The dinner will feature a three-course meal, a question-and-answer session with authors, and a book-signing period. The event calls for "southern charm attire" or to come dressed as a favorite book character. There will be prizes for the best book character costumes.

Killing Electoral College would invite Trump, future presidents to rig their reelections

Texto completo: “I care not who casts the votes of a nation, provided I can count them,” a New York Times editorial quipped in 1880. The editorial was poking fun at imperialism. Nevertheless, the old quote strikes at the heart of a new debate about the Electoral College — to say nothing of recent news headlines.
Everyone seems pretty certain that one or the other political party is interfering in U. S. presidential elections.
In the midst of so much turmoil and distrust, why would some Americans want to give even more power over elections to the federal government? Yet Electoral College opponents advocate for it, seemingly without realizing what they are doing.
Make no mistake: If the Electoral College is eliminated, the powers of incumbent presidents and their administrations will be vastly increased.
Don't hand power to incumbents
Democrats who are working to end the Electoral College should stop and think about that statement again: They do not trust Donald Trump. Yet they are working to give him more power over his own reelection and the election of his successor.
The Electoral College is, at its heart, a decentralized, state-by-state presidential election process. States determine the logistics of Election Day, access to the ballot, recounts and other, similar issues. Meanwhile, the federal government must take a back seat because the Constitution gives the national government only a limited role to play at election time.
Notably, while the Constitution grants Congress some authority in elections, the executive branch is left out in the cold: Presidents have no direct power over their own reelections.
Consider how things would change if the country were to eliminate the Electoral College and move to a single, national presidential election instead. A federal government that once played a secondary role would now sit in the driver’s seat. All election matters would be subject to federal control. Such changes would be necessary because of the altered nature of the election: Instead of 51 statewide election pools, in which each state and Washington, D. C. , selects its own electors, American voters would all be thrown into a single national election pool.
Losing their voice: Rural Americans would be serfs if we abolished Electoral College
A new federal election code and bureaucracy would be needed to ensure that voters are being treated equally, even across state lines. It is easy to imagine a new Department of Elections to oversee the administration of the federal election code and a president appointing someone to run it. Presidents who chose to run for a second term would enjoy a nice luxury: The person in charge of their reelection would also be a person beholden to them for a job as secretary of Elections.
Why make it easy to rig elections?
Americans are already worried that institutions such as the FBI or the State Department are being used inappropriately. Perhaps they are, and such abuse of our institutions should be addressed. Yet how much easier would it be for an incumbent class of federal officials to legally influence election outcomes if a Department of Elections and a U. S. Election Code were in charge of every aspect of presidential elections?
How fortunate that the Founders created something different, ensuring that checks and balances exist even within our presidential election system. No incumbent has too much authority over his own reelection. He can’t rig the system by pushing for federal regulations that tip the scales in his own favor.
An opposing view: We can't let the Founders' Electoral College, Senate trade-offs distort democracy forever
This is a healthy state of affairs.
Electoral College opponents blast the system as outdated, archaic and unnecessary, but their criticisms reflect a misunderstanding of the Founders’ objectives as they drafted our Constitution.
The Founders sought to create a constitutional structure that would allow Americans to be self-governing, despite the imperfections of human nature. They knew that people can be selfish, greedy and too ambitious. They knew that power corrupts. Their constitutional system of checks and balances — including the state-by-state presidential election process — was designed to protect against these human flaws.
Efforts to eliminate the Electoral College fly in the face of this history. They would place unchecked power in the hands of a few.
Americans deserve better.

Texto completo: These are the words fans of Hen of the Wood have been waiting to hear for more than three months: The popular Burlington restaurant is reopening Friday after closing for repairs due to an Aug. 6 fire.
Owner Eric Warnstedt confirmed the opening date Tuesday morning in a Facebook message to the Burlington Free Press. He said the Cherry Street restaurant will open for oyster hour at 4 p.m. Friday and resume its normal service and hours.
Diners won't notice any changes in the restaurant, according to Warnstedt. The August fire damaged duct work shared by Hen of the Wood and the adjacent Hotel Vermont, leading to evacuation of both businesses.
Hotel Vermont remained open while Hen of the Wood shut down so the repairs could be made. There were no injuries in the blaze.
Hen of the Wood also has a site in Waterbury that opened in 2005 and helped put Vermont cuisine on the national map.
Mark Bittman of The New York Times raved about that restaurant in a 2008 article in which he wrote, "It's difficult to think of a restaurant here in the city that can generate such feelings of satisfaction, fulfillment, culinary pleasure and near-joy as Hen of the Wood."
Warnstedt opened Hen of the Wood's Burlington restaurant in 2013. A note on the restaurant's website mentions that there was "zero damage" to the restaurant and no staff members lost pay as a result of the fire and the restaurant's temporary closure.
Hen of the Wood is holding a pre-opening party from 5-10 p.m. Thursday. Those attending need to call ahead to purchase a spot, according to Warnstedt. Admission is $65 to "eat and drink 'til your heart's content," according to the Facebook event page.

Texto completo: Readers including UNICEF, law enforcement and a child advocate respond to an article in our "Exploited" series.
To the Editor:
"Child Sex Abusers Elude Flimsy Digital Safeguards" ("Exploited" series, front page, Nov. 10) should be a wake-up call for the tech industry. It is no longer acceptable to hide behind "privacy laws" when the health, well-being and future of so many children and young people are at stake.
Now is the time for tech companies to put the safety of children first and own up to their responsibility in ending sexual exploitation and the abuse of children online. They must use their position and resources to invest in the technological solutions that identify and promptly take down abusive material, as well as work with national and international law enforcement to put in place robust reporting processes and legal accountability.
No child should be exposed to the perpetual cycle of abuse and trauma that the article describes.
Henrietta Fore

The writer is executive director of UNICEF.
To the Editor:
Your article highlights how certain decisions now being made unilaterally by top technology companies will enable despicable child pornographers to evade detection and arrest.
The internet created a new foothold for the production and trading of child pornography. Now, as sophisticated encryption capabilities are being made available to customers of messaging apps and social media companies, these vile criminals will be able to conduct business undetected.
High-profile companies like Facebook and Apple have flatly stated that they plan no accommodation for law enforcement access to encrypted communications, calling it a "back door" that should not be allowed. Court-ordered surveillance is not a back door; it is a time-honored and legitimate right of government to protect the citizenry.
Law enforcement agencies have instead turned to the private sector, where innovative workarounds to break through encryption to obtain criminal communications are being developed. We are fortunate such private industry initiatives exist.
These tools have already played a critical role in rescuing victims of sex trafficking, thwarting international terrorist attacks and keeping children safe.
The tug of war between protecting legitimate privacy and eradicating heinous criminality is certainly worthy of healthy debate. But what is not debatable is the need for leading-edge technology that can remove the canopy of encryption when children's lives are at risk.
Promoting privacy shouldn't mean that criminals are free to operate unchecked in secrecy. And such determinations should not be the sole purview of large technology companies.

The writer, a former F.B.I. assistant director for intelligence, is the founder and principal of a consultancy to companies that sell technology for investigations and intelligence gathering to the government.
To the Editor:
There are steps the government and the public can press for now to get tech companies to be more effective in shutting down child pornography.
First, it is not enough to simply pull down these images when they are reported. Tech platforms should also pass on internet provider addresses and payment information to law enforcement so more perpetrators can be found and prosecuted offline.
Second, Congress must scale back the sweeping legal immunity in Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act that prevents abuse victims from seeking justice. That would give tech companies a greater incentive to develop technologies that work for victims, not against them.
The Trump administration should stop its trade representative from including these flawed, dangerous immunities in trade agreements, to prevent this abuse from simply shifting abroad. If it is illegal offline, it should be illegal online.
Finally, we must continue to name and shame the companies for their role in this utter moral disgrace.

Texto completo: The House and Senate both passed the bill with a veto-proof majority. It compels the U.S. to penalize Chinese and Hong Kong officials responsible for abuses.
WASHINGTON -- The Senate on Tuesday passed a bill that compels the government to support Hong Kong pro-democracy activists by requiring it to impose sanctions on Chinese and Hong Kong officials responsible for human rights abuses in the territory.
The bill, if enacted into law by President Trump, would also require the State Department to annually review the special autonomous status it grants Hong Kong in trade considerations. That status is separate from the relationship with mainland China, and a revocation of the status would mean less favorable trade conditions between the United States and Hong Kong.
The Senate passed the bill, called the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, by unanimous consent, as did the House last month with its version. Because the bill, in theory, has the support of a veto-proof majority in Congress, it could be enacted into law even if Mr. Trump vetoed it. The chambers are expected to come up with a unified bill to send the president.
Mr. Trump, who rarely talks about human rights, has not spoken about the bill, nor has he made consistently strong statements in support of the Hong Kong activists.
Many of those protesters have urged American politicians to pass the bill, saying the law would give them leverage over officials in Hong Kong and China.
For nearly six months, demonstrations have convulsed Hong Kong as activists have struggled to preserve the territory's semi-autonomy from the Chinese Communist Party in Beijing. Before Britain handed over the territory to China in 1997, the countries agreed to guarantee that semi-autonomy for 50 years.
Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, said in a statement that the bill sent a "clear message to Hong Kongers" that the United States would not "stand idly by." He added, "The passage of this bill is an important step in holding accountable those Chinese and Hong Kong government officials responsible for Hong Kong's eroding autonomy and human rights violations."
Mr. Rubio led the effort to pass the bill. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, had been criticized by members of both parties for delaying a floor vote on the bill.
Joshua Wong, a pro-democracy activist in Hong Kong who helped lead the demonstrations in 2014 that came to be known as the Umbrella Movement, said that he hoped the bill would set an example. "We hope this law proves that Beijing actually needs to face pressure from the international community," he said.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry denounced the bill after the Senate vote, saying it "interferes in China's internal affairs" and "violates the basic norms of international law and international relations."
The Hong Kong government said the bill was "unnecessary and unwarranted" and would harm relations between the United States and Hong Kong.
Republican and Democratic senators decided to try to quickly pass the bill after hundreds of young protesters fought off a police siege on the campus of Hong Kong Polytechnic University. The confrontation, which began Saturday night, was the most violent episode of the nearly half-year of demonstrations, though almost all protesters at the university had fled or been arrested by the police by Tuesday.
Last week, the Hong Kong protests entered a more violent phase when activists began disrupting traffic across the city and the police tried breaching campuses, considered a last refuge of the demonstrators.
The bill is the latest sign of a strong bipartisan push in Washington to confront China and its authoritarian leader, President Xi Jinping, on a wide range of issues, including commercial practices, global infrastructure building and the detention of at least a million Muslim ethnic minority members in camps in northwest China. Because of the pro-democracy protests, Hong Kong has become a central rallying point.
Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, and Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, both flew to Hong Kong last month, while Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the Democrat from California, met recently with activists in Washington.
"We have sent a message to President Xi: Your suppression of freedom, whether in Hong Kong, in northwest China or anywhere else, will not stand," Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the top Democrat in the Senate, said on Tuesday evening. "You cannot be a great leader and you cannot be a great country when you oppose freedom, when you are so brutal to the people of Hong Kong, young and old, who are protesting."

Texto completo: Accusations of sexual abuse led to the expulsion of Mr. Morris, a former coach of the United States Olympic team.
George H. Morris, a former United States Olympic team coach who is widely considered the godfather of equestrian sport, has been permanently barred from the sport after an investigation into "sexual misconduct involving a minor," it was announced on Tuesday.
The United States Equestrian Federation provisionally barred Mr. Morris in August. The United States Center for SafeSport, the organization charged with investigating incidents of misconduct in Olympic sports, made his expulsion permanent on Tuesday, after an appeal by Mr. Morris.
"No matter how big a figure is in their sport, or how old the allegations, nobody is above accountability," Ju'Riese Colón, the chief executive of the Center for SafeSport, said in a statement. "Athletes and other sport participants must be empowered to stand up for what's right and speak out against what they know to be wrong."
The lifetime ban came after at least two people came forward to report that they had been victimized as minors during Mr. Morris's coaching career. The accusations, primarily about conduct in the 1960s and '70s set off a monthslong investigation by the Center for SafeSport.
The findings of that investigation, the details of which the center keeps confidential to protect victims, warranted a lifetime ban, Ms. Colón said. It is the center's strongest penalty and a measure that is "not taken lightly," she said. "The process is exhaustive and includes many provisions to ensure fairness so both claimants and responding parties are given ample opportunity to speak for themselves, provide evidence, seek counsel and be heard in front of another independent body."
The decision to uphold Mr. Morris's expulsion followed days of heated proceedings in which Mr. Morris, his accusers and supporters testified before an independent arbitrator in Manhattan.
The decision is now binding and cannot be appealed, according to SafeSport rules.
The initial provisional ban set off a furor in the equestrian world, where action figures of Mr. Morris are collectors' items and his books on riding are gospel. Many equestrians, including some of the sport's superstars, rushed to his defense, denigrating anonymous accusers online or describing positive training experiences with Mr. Morris in online forums and in vast private Facebook groups of his supporters.
"The victims in these matters not only suffered the abuse they first report, they often bravely survive countless attacks, even in their sport, for having the courage to speak up," Ms. Colón of SafeSport said. "Such a response is wrong on many levels, including the fact that it re-victimizes those who already suffered more than anyone should."
Mr. Morris, 81, won a silver medal in show jumping in the 1960 Rome Summer Olympics, before going on to coach the United States and Brazilian Olympic teams.
He had vowed to appeal SafeSport's initial decision. Mr. Morris did not respond to a request for comment.
"Today's ruling is the result of the Center's process, and we respect their decision," Bill Moroney, the equestrian federation's chief executive officer, said in a statement.
In the challenging landscape of investigating sexual abuse allegations, particularly those that are decades old, Mr. Morris's case stood out for its deep complications.
Only one of Mr. Morris's accusers has gone public: Jonathan Soresi, a former student and an assistant trainer to Mr. Morris, is himself a registered sex offender. In 2007, Mr. Soresi pleaded guilty to a felony count for the possession of child pornography. He was also barred by SafeSport but was reinstated last week.
"The transgressions of my past do not invalidate the reality of what happened to me," Mr. Soresi said at the time of Mr. Morris's initial ban. After Tuesday's decision, Mr. Soresi said: "There is a certain simplicity to the truth, and the truth was told here. It's my hope that that truth is healing."
The ban rocked an insular and rarefied world already reeling from revelations of sexual abuse by other luminaries. In June, Robert Gage, a California-based coach, killed himself as he fought a SafeSport suspension for sexual misconduct with several minors. A 2018 investigation by The New York Times revealed that Jimmy A. Williams, a top trainer of show-jumping prodigies who died in 1993, had abused many of the children he taught over his 50-year career.
Mr. Morris's relationships with his young students have long been whispered about on horse show grounds. However, few would speak publicly about the accusations, partly because of deference to his status as an equestrian legend, and partly out of fear of his ability to make or break careers.
"It's been tough for sure to watch and to listen sometimes; I had to just unplug from it. The saddest part is the victim-shaming, the not believing," said Anne Kursinski, a five-time Olympian who came forward last year about being abused as a minor by Mr. Williams. As an adult, Ms. Kursinski was coached by Mr. Morris in several Olympic Games, and she credits him with "putting me on the map." She has said she never witnessed abuse by Mr. Morris.
"All that he accomplished in his career, you cannot take that away from him, the medals he won, and the people he coached," Ms. Kursinski said upon hearing the news of Mr. Morris's expulsion. "But if the other is true, that's a truth as well," she added. "People coming forward and speaking up will help the next generation."

Texto completo: The Florida professor was often quoted by journalists. Now he's charged in a scheme to hide ill-gotten gains from Venezuela.
For years, Prof. Bruce Bagley was a go-to expert for journalists reporting on drug trafficking, money laundering and corruption in South America. In 2016, for instance, he was asked about two nephews of the Venezuelan president who had been charged with drug trafficking.
"The nephews are just the tip of the iceberg," Professor Bagley, who teaches international studies at the University of Miami, told Univision. "Corruption is rampant in power circles in Venezuela."
Now federal prosecutors have accused Professor Bagley, 73, of being more than an academic observer in the criminal world that he spent his career studying.
On Monday, federal prosecutors announced he had been arrested on money laundering charges for his involvement in a scheme to hide the origins of more than $ 2.5 million in proceeds from bribery and corruption in Venezuela. They said he kept about 10 percent of the money for himself as a commission.
Prosecutors did not say whether the accusations against Professor Bagley were connected to other open investigations. Neither did they provide details about the bribery scheme. The indictment says only that the corruption was "in connection with public works projects in Venezuela."
Professor Bagley, who did not respond to telephone and email messages, appeared in federal court in Miami on Monday, where a magistrate judge set a $ 300,000 bond. He was expected to post bail and be released later in the day, his lawyer, Daniel Forman, said.
Mr. Forman said that it was too early to comment on the evidence against Professor Bagley, adding that he was still getting familiar with the accusations laid out in the indictment.
Investigators in the United States have increasingly targeted Venezuelan money-laundering schemes in recent years, focusing on officials whom they suspect of graft and the people connected to them. In the last two years, United States officials have imposed numerous sanctions against Venezuelan politicians, accusing them of embezzlement, corruption and drug trafficking.
In July, American officials accused Venezuela's president, Nicolás Maduro, of being involved in a corruption scheme in which his relatives, business partners and officials siphoned off massive sums of money that had been meant to help feed starving Venezuelans.
Mr. Maduro's administration has long denied any wrongdoing, saying in the past that accusations from officials in the United States are part of an "economic war" to bring down his government.
Professor Bagley has studied organized crime in Latin America for decades and has been published frequently on the subject. He edited an academic book released in 2015 entitled "Drug Trafficking, Organized Crime, and Violence in the Americas Today." Another book he edited, on the relationship between countries and organized crime, was released in May.
He was scheduled to teach a class on drug trafficking in the Americas at the University of Miami this spring, but a spokeswoman said Professor Bagley had been placed on administrative leave after the indictment against him was made public.
Over the years, he has been quoted numerous times in media reports about drug trafficking, including in New York Times articles about the international drug trade and stories from NPR about the ongoing political crisis in Venezuela.
In addition, Professor Bagley also consulted on drug trafficking and money laundering for the United Nations, the F.B.I., the Drug Enforcement Administration and several Latin American governments, according to a professional biography published online by the University of Miami.
In 2005, Professor Bagley started a company, Bagley Consultants, in Florida, according to public records.
According to prosecutors, Professor Bagley opened a bank account in Florida under his company's name in 2016. But there was hardly any activity in the account until a year later, when he started receiving massive deposits from bank accounts in the United Arab Emirates and in Switzerland.
Those accounts ostensibly belonged to a food company and a wealth management firm but were actually controlled by a Colombian national whose money came from "the proceeds of foreign bribery and embezzlement stolen from the Venezuelan people," according to the indictment.
Professor Bagley knew the source of the money and entered into "multiple sham contracts" in order to conceal it, according to the indictment.
After each deposit, Professor Bagley would go to his bank and get a cashier's check for about 90 percent of the money, which he would then give to an unnamed individual, the indictment said. The rest of the money was wired to Professor Bagley's personal bank account.
In October 2018, the bank closed the company's account because of suspicious activity, according to the indictment. But Professor Bagley opened another account in his name that December and continued the scheme until April 2019, receiving at least 14 illegal deposits.
Though Professor Bagley lives in Florida and the supposedly laundered funds were sent to Florida banks, prosecutors said they were prosecuting the case in Manhattan because the money passed through New York City as it came from abroad.
Professor Bagley was charged with two counts of money laundering and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. He was expected to be summoned to appear in federal court in Manhattan to face the charges. If convicted, he could face up to 20 years in prison.
Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States attorney in Manhattan, said in a statement that the money Professor Bagley had laundered was "stolen from the citizens of Venezuela."
"Today's charges of money laundering and conspiracy should serve as an object lesson for Bruce Bagley, who now faces a potential tenure in federal prison," Mr. Berman said.

Working-Class Voters Are Sticking by 'Common Joe'

Texto completo: Joseph R. Biden Jr. has durable support from a multiracial coalition of working-class voters who view him as one of their own.
WEST POINT, Iowa -- They are white and nonwhite alike, prefer Facebook over Twitter, if they are on social media at all, and can be hard to find at Democratic campaign events dominated by activists from the professional class. But these blue-collar voters could go a long way toward determining who captures the Democratic presidential nomination -- and Joseph R. Biden Jr. is racing to press his advantage with that constituency.
With less than three months to go before voting begins in the 2020 primary, and on the eve of the fifth presidential primary debate, Mr. Biden faces significant challenges in the key early states of Iowa and New Hampshire, a cash crunch and several Democrats threatening his standing with centrist voters.
But his greatest compensating advantage right now is notably durable support from a multiracial coalition of working-class voters who feel a kinship with the former vice president and believe he is the Democrats' strongest general election prospect.
At fund-raisers and on campaign stops, Mr. Biden is warning his party against overlooking voters who were once a core Democratic constituency but had found some elements of President Trump's message compelling in 2016. His campaign believes the Democratic Party risks narrowing its Electoral College path in 2020, and hurting its standing on Capitol Hill, if candidates do not appeal directly to these more moderate voters in battleground states in the Midwest and Sun Belt.
And both explicitly and more subtly, Mr. Biden is portraying his chief rival, Senator Elizabeth Warren, and another top candidate, Senator Bernie Sanders, as liberals who are overly focused on expensive and theoretical government overhauls.
"Growing up in a middle-class neighborhood, the last thing I liked is people telling my family and me what we should know, what we should believe," Mr. Biden said as he criticized Ms. Warren's advocacy style, speaking at a recent CNN town hall in Iowa. "As if somehow we weren't informed, that we -- just because we didn't have money we weren't knowledgeable. I resent that."
Ms. Warren, who is running as a corruption-battling economic populist, surpassed Mr. Biden in a number of polls this fall, and she is often the favorite of white, college-educated voters -- but Mr. Biden still leads comfortably with high school-educated Democrats in many surveys. That dynamic has stymied Ms. Warren's growth after her early-autumn surge, and it has sometimes benefited Mr. Sanders, who also has strong connections to blue-collar voters.
In dozens of interviews, from parades and union rallies to black churches and political picnics, working-class Democrats who support Mr. Biden explained their views in practical terms: they know and trust the Scranton native from his long tenure as a Delaware senator and as Barack Obama's vice president, they find his incremental policy proposals realistic and they think he can win.
"I liked what him and Barack did together," said Doris Stuekerjuergen, who worked at a fireplace factory and attended an October event with Mr. Biden in this small rural community of West Point. "Hopefully he leads us back to where we were. The world we live in now is pretty scary."
The Democrat who forges a cross-racial coalition of working-class voters almost always wins the party's presidential nomination. It is a path that was disrupted only in 2008 when Mr. Obama was able to achieve what few of his predecessors had -- fuse the support of upscale whites with black Democrats.
But surveys in this race indicate a return to the longstanding tradition in Democratic primaries of voters splitting along class lines, and illuminate a key slice of Mr. Biden's base.
A recent New York Times/Siena College poll of Democratic primary voters in general election battleground states found that among white voters without a four-year degree, Mr. Biden had double the support -- 30 percent -- of Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders. But the numbers for Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren were nearly reversed among white college graduates. In Iowa, where Mr. Biden is struggling, he was still the strong favorite of voters who did not go past high school in another recent New York Times/Siena College poll of likely Democratic caucusgoers.
And in South Carolina, where the Democratic electorate is dominated by black voters and where Mr. Biden is strong across the board, a Monmouth University poll from late last month showed him receiving the support of 38 percent of voters without college degrees, well ahead of his rivals.
"He is the only candidate right now that I feel can beat Trump," said Ivie Barnwell, who stood in the shade selling her handmade sweetgrass baskets in Galivants Ferry, S.C. Around her, T-shirt-clad activists and a host of presidential candidates descended on the town for a political festival earlier this fall. "This Trump man has got to go," she said.
For some voters, Mr. Biden appeals because there are strategic assumptions at work: many black working-class Democrats believe that white America will only support a well-known white male, such as Mr. Biden, while a number of working-class white Democrats also believe he is the most acceptable nominee. Some voters cited the misogyny and racism that female candidates and candidates of color have experienced in previous races.
And then there is the crucial fact that many of these voters -- whether because of his down-to-earth persona, the tragedies he has endured or a combination of both -- simply have warm feelings for the man they often address as Joe when they see him.
"He relates well to blue-collar voters and to non-college voters," Jeff Link, a veteran Iowa Democratic strategist, said. "Those Scranton roots kind of come through."
Despite this advantage, some Democrats are skeptical that Mr. Biden, who turns 77 on Wednesday, can sustain this support.
Since he entered the race in April, Mr. Biden's poll numbers have dipped, he has suffered from a series of self-inflicted errors that raised concerns about his age, and he has absorbed ferocious attacks from Democrats and Republicans alike -- including baseless attacks on his family from Mr. Trump.
Ty Livesay, the operations manager at a mall in Conway, S.C., said he connected with Mr. Biden -- "I'm a common Joe, he's a common Joe" -- but acknowledged having doubts about Mr. Biden's strength in the primary. "Is Joe going to be able to handle it?" he asked.
Others harbor no such reservations.
"I don't care about his personal opinion, gaffes or comments he makes -- what means most to me is what type of man he is," said Pete Garrett, who works at an auto parts production company and wore an Obama campaign pin to a Biden appearance in Birmingham, Ala.
For all of his advantages with blue-collar voters in the Democratic primary, Mr. Biden so far does not appear to significantly cut into Mr. Trump's base of white working-class voters. And he is not the only Democratic candidate perceived as electable. Early polls, which are parsed by some committed voters but are not predictive at this stage, show several Democrats beating Mr. Trump in head-to-head matchups.
Still, Mr. Biden's rivals recognize the advantage he has built up with blue-collar voters and are seeking their own inroads with them.
Even as she has unveiled a lengthy roster of detailed policy plans that thrill college-educated liberals, Ms. Warren, for example, also highlights her modest Oklahoma roots, her brothers' military service and her own time as a teacher.
Mr. Sanders also enjoys a blue-collar following, polls show. While the most politically muscular element of the Democratic working-class -- the labor unions -- has largely remained on the sideline, after feeling regret over their early intervention on behalf of Hillary Clinton in 2016, Mr. Sanders has recently notched some endorsements. They include the country's biggest nurses' union and a teachers' union in Los Angeles. Senator Kamala Harris, who is struggling in the polls, was endorsed by the United Farm Workers.
Mr. Sanders in particular is sitting on voters Mr. Biden could use, especially if Ms. Warren continues to make gains with college-educated Democrats -- though she increasingly faces competition for those voters from Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind.
One union that does support Mr. Biden is the International Association of Fire Fighters. And that union's president, Harold Schaitberger, said Democrats should be wary of again losing some of the voters who sided with Mr. Trump in 2016.
Mr. Schaitberger said these voters want to feel "that they are connected with someone who wants to be president of the United States but isn't, if you will, looking down on them or preaching down to them."
Asked whether he meant those remarks as a swipe at any of Mr. Biden's opponents, Mr. Schaitberger, himself a high-school educated voter, demurred. But he noted that "there are some candidates that, you know, speak in a very high intellectual, professorial" fashion.
Ms. Warren is a former Harvard professor.
Mr. Biden has also scolded Democrats over their drift from bread-and-butter issues like wages, pensions and union rights.
"I bet some of you voted for Donald Trump because we stopped talking to you," he said at a campaign stop in Newton, Iowa, over the summer, adding, "We sort of stopped talking to our base: high school-educated Americans."
Mr. Biden's research has indicated that such voters respond particularly well when reminded of Mr. Biden's middle-class youth as a car dealer's son and that he had lost his first wife and daughter in a car accident and his elder son to brain cancer. He made his biography central to his initial advertising, linking his support for the Affordable Care Act to his searing family story.
Steve Buchmeier, a 54-year-old farmer from Kellogg, Iowa, has seen Mr. Biden's campaign ads, and he was one of the Obama-Trump voters in attendance at Mr. Biden's campaign stop in Newton.
"The U.S. isn't ready for a girl," he said as he reflected on the 2016 election, stressing that his own decisions are not influenced by gender.
This time around, Mr. Buchmeier said, he found Mr. Biden's experience as vice president impressive, though he was not committed to switching back to the Democrats in 2020.
But, he said, "this guy is on the top of my list if I do."

Texto completo: Congresswoman Ilhan Omar asked for leniency in sentencing the western New York man.
It began with a hate-filled call to Representative Ilhan Omar's Washington office in March, officials said.
"Do you work for the Muslim Brotherhood?" Patrick W. Carlineo Jr. asked a member of Ms. Omar's staff on that call, according to a criminal complaint. "Why are you working for her, she's a [expletive] terrorist. Somebody ought to put a bullet in her skull. Back in the day, our forefathers would have put a bullet in her [expletive]."
"I'll put a bullet in her [expletive] skull," the staff member also recalled Mr. Carlineo, 55, saying, according to the complaint.
On Monday, Mr. Carlineo, of Addison, N.Y., outside Buffalo, pleaded guilty to threatening to kill Ms. Omar, a Minnesota Democrat and one of the first Muslim women elected to Congress, and to possessing guns illegally.
Ms. Omar responded to Mr. Carlineo's guilty plea in Federal District Court in Rochester by urging leniency when he is sentenced.
In a letter she posted on Twitter on Tuesday, Ms. Omar addressed the judge who will sentence him, asking "for a system of compassion to be applied."
"Threatening assassination of a public official in our country is dangerous to both the individual and our republic," Ms. Omar wrote, describing the crimes that Mr. Carlineo admitted to as "grave" and adding that "threats of political violence and hate speech" were "not unique" to him.
"They are an increasing feature in our public sphere," Ms. Omar, a Somali refugee whose family received asylum in the United States when she was a teenager, added. "We will not defeat it with anger and exclusion. We will defeat it with compassion."
A member of her party's progressive wing, Ms. Omar -- the first woman to wear a hijab on the House floor -- has been denounced in some quarters, including by some Democrats, for embracing the boycott-Israel movement and criticizing supporters of the Jewish state.
She has also emerged as a frequent foil for President Trump. She was among four female freshman lawmakers who Mr. Trump said in July should "go back" to the countries they came from.
In an interview with the F.B.I. at his home about a week after he called Ms. Omar's office, Mr. Carlineo described himself as a patriot who loved Mr. Trump and hated "radical Muslims in our government," the criminal complaint says.
He also told an F.B.I. agent that he believed Ms. Omar supported Islamic militant groups, such as Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood, and that her election to Congress was illegitimate.
In the interview, the complaint says, he acknowledged calling Ms. Omar's office and said that he knew why the F.B.I., which investigated the matter with the United States Capitol Police, was interested in talking to him.
Shown an email containing the text of the call, he initially denied that the words were his, but later "went on to say that he may have said something" similar, the complaint says. (He had left his name and contact information with Ms. Omar's staff, the complaint says.)
The F.B.I. agent who signed the complaint said that Mr. Carlineo had threatened to kill Ms. Omar "while she was engaged in the performance of her official duties."
About a week later, the authorities found a loaded .45-caliber handgun, three rifles, two shotguns and hundreds of rounds of ammunition at Mr. Carlineo's home, prosecutors said. Because of a 1998 felony conviction, he was legally prohibited from owning a firearm.
Mr. Carlineo is scheduled to be sentenced on Feb. 14. He faces up to 10 years in prison. He remains free until sentencing under conditions that include a curfew and a restriction against traveling outside of western New York.
Barbara Burns, a spokeswoman for the United States Attorney's Office in Buffalo, declined to comment on Ms. Omar's sentencing request.

BYU researchers study how much assistance electric mountain bikes really give riders

Texto completo: Pedaling an electric mountain bike is a workout, not an effortless romp, requiring almost as much physical exertion as riding a standard mountain bike. But the effort feels easier on the e-bike, according to the first study out of Brigham Young University of motor-assisted mountain bikes and how they affect the physiology and attitudes of experienced cyclists.
The study suggests that e-mountain bikes might enable many riders, including newcomers, to maintain or gain fitness while transiting otherwise daunting hills, snowy trails, spins with spouses and daily commutes. The findings do raise a red flag for the unwary, however, since the speeds attainable on motor-assisted bikes can be high.
Electric bikes, known as e-bikes, are increasingly common on streets and bike paths, both in the United States and elsewhere. Equipped with a small electric motor and battery, pedal-assist e-bikes provide an extra little zap of power as you pedal, about like the nudging of a gentle tail wind. (“Throttle-assist” e-bikes power the bike even when you are not pedaling and are more akin to motorcycles than bicycles.)
E-mountain bikes, like most standard mountain bikes, differ from the versions designed for roads by sporting wide, knobby tires and other features that make them suitable for riding on dirt trails, over snow, or in similarly ungroomed conditions.
The allure of both road and mountain e-bikes is obvious. With the pedal-assist, which usually can be adjusted up or down to suit someone’s fitness and preferences, they make hills feel flatter and distances shorter. The extra boost may encourage people who are out of shape, inexperienced or entering or exiting middle age to cycle.
A few small past studies have found that riding a road e-bike also constitutes hearty exercise. In a small 2016 study in Boulder, Colorado, researchers found that commuting on an e-bike for a month increased new riders’ fitness and improved their blood-sugar control. Most of the volunteers also accumulated more time in the saddle than had been asked of them for the study, presumably because they were enjoying themselves.
But little has been known about whether e-mountain bikes likewise provide a robust workout or whether riders will like them. So, for the new study, which was published in August in JMIR Formative Research, researchers at BYU determined to find out.
They began by recruiting experienced local mountain bikers, in part because, should these riders work up a sweat on an e-mountain bike, newcomers to the sport would likewise be expected to get a meaningful workout. The researchers also were interested in the riders’ attitudes toward pedal-assisted mountain biking and whether the riders felt that e-bikes might make the activity somehow too easy.
They wound up with 33 riders, mostly men, from age 18 to 65, all of whom turned up on separate days at the trailhead for a rolling, 6-mile, single-track loop. There, they completed several questionnaires about their beliefs about e-bikes, strapped on a heart rate monitor and activity-tracking watch and rode the trail astride either a standard mountain bike or a comparable e-version. After a rest, they repeated the loop on whichever bike they had not ridden before. At the end, they filled out the questionnaires again.
It turned out that riding an e-mountain bike had confirmed some of the cyclists’ expectations and subverted others. More of the riders felt afterward that pedal assistance would make riding appealing to average people and fewer suspected that e-mountain bikes would be a passing fad.
Meanwhile, their personal, physiological responses to the riding proved to be complex. The cyclists had been swifter with pedal assist, about 4 mph faster on average, but reported that the e-riding felt less taxing, physically. At the same time, their heart rates rose to and remained at about the same level during both rides.
In other words, the pedaling assist had lessened how draining the riding felt but not how much exercise it actually provided, says Cougar Hall, an associate professor of public health at BYU, who oversaw the new study with his colleagues Benjamin Crookston and Joshua West, all of them avid mountain bikers. (The study was funded by the university, which purchased the necessary e-mountain bikes.)
That dichotomy between the perceived and actual effort involved in the riding might make e-mountain biking practical for and attractive to new riders hoping to pedal into shape or keep up with practiced trail-riding partners, he says.
“If these bikes can be a catalyst to get people outside and riding trails that they might have thought were too intimidating, that’s a victory for them and for public health,” he says.
This was a small, very short-term experiment, though, involving a single e-ride on one forested trail by accomplished mountain bikers, most of them men. Results might be different for riders who are female, inexperienced or who live in cities.
E-mountain bikes also tend to be pricey, and their top speeds, which can exceed 20 mph — at which point, the bikes’ motors are designed to switch off — may be alarming. Dial down the amount of motorized assistance if you wish to maintain a sedate pace and not outstrip riding mates, Hall says.
He also suggests that if you have never tried an e-mountain bike and are curious, check with local bike shops about rentals, demo days or the possibility of briefly testing a model or two on a nearby trail.

MLB responds to politicians taking up the fight to preserve minor league baseball structure

Texto completo: After taking heat for their minor league contraction plan from Minor League Baseball last month and more heat from Congress on Tuesday morning, Major League Baseball struck back Tuesday night.
In a feisty letter directed to “Dear Member of Congress," Dan Halem, deputy commissioner and chief labor negotiator for MLB, argued that baseball only wants to conduct overdue pruning and reshuffling of its sprawling, 160-affiliate system to improve the product.
And, said MLB, stripping 42 teams in 22 states of their big-league franchise affiliation is not as drastic as it seems because MLB will help operate a new, independent “Dream League" for many of the disenfranchised teams.
The letter attempts to shift much of the blame for contraction onto the Minor League Baseball owners who allowed the system to become bloated and fall into disrepair.
“We know for a fact that many Minor League owners — including owners in districts represented by Members of Congress who signed the letter to the Commissioner — are presently attempting to relocate their affiliates to different cities or sell them outright," said the letter from Halem.
Halem's letter came hours after US Representative Lori Trahan (D-Mass.) and US Representative David McKinley (R-W. Va.) co-authored a scorching letter to MLB commissioner Rob Manfred, Halem, and all 30 club owners about the issue.
With 60 Democrats and 46 Republicans signing on, the letter beseeched baseball to reconsider its plans for the sake of the communities that would lose teams.
The Lowell Spinners play in Trahan's district, and they are the only Red Sox affiliate on the list.
The letter also reminded MLB that Congress is responsible for baseball's antitrust exemption, an implied threat that the exemption could be reexamined if the plan is not reconsidered.
MLB did not sound particularly cowed by the threat.
“We cannot commit to you that the next PBA [Professional Baseball Agreement] will require MLB to guarantee 160 affiliates," said Halem's letter. “Even if Major League Clubs determine that they will commit to 160 affiliates, they are not willing to send their players to substandard facilities or impose on them unreasonable burdens with respect to travel and working conditions."
Halem's letter said that a majority of its owners believe there are too many minor league players and that contraction will allow MLB to compensate its minor league players better, improve the ballparks and clubhouses where they work, make them travel less, and provide them with better hotels and food.
Minor League Baseball does agree in principle that the current geographic map of teams and affiliates needs to be redrawn, and it has said that it wants to upgrade its facilities.
But on the issue of the number of players and teams, it's only the big-league owners who see excess.
“Most of the players on the rosters of rookie, short-season, and low-A teams are there to fill rosters so the Minor League teams can stage games for their fans, not because the Major League Clubs require all of those players to develop Major League talent," Halem's letter stated.
Major League Baseball and Minor League Baseball are expected to return to the bargaining table for face-to-face negotiations on a new PBA later this week in Dallas, where MLB owners are currently meeting, and then resume in San Diego next month at baseball's Winter Meetings.
The current PBA expires on Sept. 30, 2020.
The Spinners have played for their parent club, the Red Sox, for the last 24 seasons.
“The abandonment of Minor League clubs by Major League Baseball would devastate our communities, their bond purchasers, and other stakeholders affected by the potential loss of these clubs," stated the letter from Congress.
Two other New England teams play in the NY-Penn League, the Vermont Lake Monsters (Oakland ) in Burlington, Vt., and the Connecticut Tigers (Detroit) in Norwich.
MLB wants to drop some, not all, of the affected teams into a new independent “Dream League."
The Spinners are targeted for Dream League play, but in a statement attached to the letter's release, Trahan voiced enough distress to make it clear that affiliation with a “Dream League" and unattached to a big-league franchise is not a viable business plan.
“I was alarmed by news that the MLB is considering a reorganization that will wipe out the Spinners and 41 other minor league teams across the country," said Trahan. “The Spinners bring enormous pride and joy to the Greater Lowell Community and the City has invested heavily in LeLacheur Park and surrounding infrastructure, providing an affordable, fun night out for families in the region."

Texto completo: Vermont's Lake Monsters might not stick around for much longer if a Major League Baseball proposal goes through.
The Green Mountain State's minor league affiliate is on a list with 41 other teams that could be cut due to major league restructuring, according to The New York Times.
The Vermont team's parent affiliate, the Oakland A's in California, is on the opposite side of the country.
Teams could enter into a separate league including undrafted players and those who have been released. This shift could impact the market value of the minor leagues, according to the Times.
MLB is looking for changes under this restructuring including:
Better hotel accommodations, transportation.
More days off.
Less travel time.
Lake Monsters, other teams that could get cut The Lake Monsters belong to the New York-Penn League. Other teams in this league at risk of getting cut include:
Staten Island Yankees.
Williamsport Crosscutters,
Auburn Doubledays.
Batavia Muckdogs.
Connecticut Tigers.
Lowell Spinners.
Mahoning Valley Scrappers.
State College Spikes.
Reaction from the Lake Monsters In an emailed statement, Lake Monsters vice president Kyle Bostwick wrote:
"This is an idea that has materialized early in the negotiation process between MLB and MILB. This idea, along with other ideas, may or may not ever be realized, and this back and forth is part of the process. The Lake Monsters have a solid relationship with the Oakland Athletics, with strong local support, both from fans and from the corporate community. It is unfortunate that this idea is even considered, but nothing has been finalized. We are looking forward to another fantastic season of Lake Monsters baseball in 2020, and hope to be a part of this community for many years to come."
Bostwick said he and the Lake Monsters do not have further information on the topic at this point. Bostwick did provide examples of the team's local economic impact. They include:
$116,930 in donations through Lake Monsters programs in 2019.
1,000-plus hotel rooms booked over the summer each year.
More than 225 full- and part-time folk employed each year with the Lake Monsters.
More than 200 companies will use the Lake Monsters as a local advertising option.
More than 600 local groups and companies will use Centennial Field as the venue for their summertime outing.
Rep. Welch speaks out on Major League Baseball's proposal Rep. Peter Welch (D-VT) expressed support for the Lake Monsters through a Free Press email exchange with Communications Director Lincoln Peek. He described minor league teams as affordable, family-oriented entertainment options that benefit local economies.
"It would be a grave mistake for MLB to follow through on this proposal," Welch wrote. "Doing so would deal a devastating blow to the livelihood of these supportive communities. I hope this is a negotiating ploy as both sides enter negotiations on a new contract."
Welch indicated that if the proposal moves forward, he plans to work with other House members nationwide to examine "the statutory advantages afforded MLB by Congress over the years, including its anti-trust exemption."
History of the Lake Monsters Professional baseball returned to Vermont in 1994 when local businessman Ray Pecor bought the Jamestown Jammers and moved the Montreal Expos' affiliate to Burlington. Pecor's acquisition ended a five-year drought without minor league baseball in Burlington.
After a 16-year run with the Montreal/Washington Nationals franchise, Vermont's minor-league squad was picked up by the Oakland Athletics starting with the 2011 season. Vermont changed its nickname to the Lake Monsters in 2006.
The A's and the Lake Monsters are in a middle of a two-year player development contract that ends after the 2020 season.
Since 1994, 2.5 million people have attended games at Centennial Field, according to the Lake Monsters. Centennial, which opened in 1906, is one of the oldest in-use ballparks in the country.
In Expos/Lake Monsters history, 110 players have reached the big leagues. Of that count, 30 alums played this past season.

STUTTGART, Germany -- A recent flurry of American airstrikes against Islamic State fighters in southern Libya has seriously disrupted the terrorist group's efforts to reorganize and carry out attacks in one of its most important hubs outside the Middle East, military and counterterrorism officials say.
Over 10 days in late September, four strikes killed 43 militants -- or about one-third of the group's estimated 150 fighters in Libya -- including some important commanders and recruiters, according to officials at the headquarters of the Pentagon's Africa Command.
The strikes, which other officials said were carried out by Air Force MQ-9 Reaper drones based in neighboring Niger, came as the Islamic State had increased recruiting and attacks in recent months in the largely ungoverned spaces of southwest Libya. Several new camps of fighters had emerged in that area, prompting the first American strikes against ISIS in Libya this year.
"The most critical, enduring weakness for both ISIS Libya and A.Q.I.M. is recruitment," Rear Adm. Heidi Berg, the command's director of intelligence, said in an interview, referring to the Islamic State and Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, which is active in Libya.
The setbacks for ISIS in Libya come as the global terrorist group is scrambling to regain momentum after the death of its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in an American commando raid in northwestern Syria on Oct. 26 and the announcement soon after of Mr. al-Baghdadi's successor, Abu Ibrahim al-Hashemi al-Qurayshi.
Even after Mr. al-Baghdadi's death -- a major blow to the terrorist group -- top American counterterrorism officials acknowledged that the Islamic State had begun to rebound, particularly in Iraq, after an American-backed campaign there recaptured territory that made up the group's religious state, or caliphate. The group's far-flung affiliates -- in places like West Africa, Sinai and the Philippines -- have also demonstrated resiliency in their operations, officials said.
"The overall threat from radical Islamist terrorists has not abated and, in some regions, is growing," Russell Travers, the acting head of the National Counterterrorism Center, told Congress this month. "Prominent groups including ISIS and Al Qaeda are expanding into new areas and reinforcing their networks' cohesion, bolstering the overall movement's reach, resiliency and threat to U.S. interests."
He noted that "enduring conflicts in several countries including Egypt, Mali, Nigeria, Libya, Syria and Yemen continue to serve as incubators for terrorist presence."
The heightened American counterterrorism operations in southern Libya come against the backdrop of a four-year civil war being fought in the north, a fight in which Russia is now pushing far more directly to shape the outcome.
At least in southern Libya, the recent drone strikes have put ISIS on the defensive. "The group has not conducted attacks, even in its usual area of operations in the center and southwest, since the strikes," said Emily Estelle, the research manager of the American Enterprise Institute's critical threats project in Washington.
In news releases, the Africa Command cited airstrikes on Sept. 19, 24, 26 and 29 that it said killed a total of 43 militants. The command said, for instance, that the strike on Sept. 19 killed eight ISIS fighters in a compound in Murzuq, Libya, nearly 600 miles south of Tripoli, Libya's capital. Five days later, the military said it killed 11 more fighters in an airstrike in the same area.
Social media reports in Libya said that among the militants targeted in the strikes was Malik Khazmi, a major ISIS facilitator and recruiter from Bani Walid. Africa Command officials declined to confirm whether Mr. Khazmi had been among the top ISIS fighters killed.
Independent security analysts said that Mr. Khazmi had been an important ISIS recruiter and architect of its clandestine fighter networks since 2014, surfacing in pivotal combat areas like Darnah, Tripoli and Surt, before fleeing into the southern desert.
Taken together, the four missile attacks were the first American airstrikes this year in Libya against Islamic State or Qaeda fighters, after the military conducted six aerial attacks last year, most recently in November 2018.
"We need to make sure we look at ungoverned spaces where versions of ISIS can pop up," Gen. Jeffrey L. Harrigian, the commander of United States air forces in Europe and Africa, said in an interview at his headquarters at Ramstein Air Base, Germany. "We're doing good work down there, pressuring them."
Regional experts have cautioned that in the remote and politically fractured landscape of southern Libya, the line between who is a militant or terrorist or militiaman is frequently blurred, and there is the potential for these strikes to err and inflame ethnic and tribal tensions.
"The most important thing to realize is that the effect of the strikes is only temporary," Ms. Estelle said.
"The conditions that support ISIS's return are still in place due to the war and the local fallout, including social tensions and popular grievances in the southwest where ISIS already has a foothold," she added. "ISIS in Libya may be hindered for a few months, but it will rebuild repeatedly and emerge in new forms as long as Libya is in crisis."
American counterterrorism operations in southern Libya entered a new phase when a military drone strike in March 2018 killed a top recruiter and logistics specialist for Al Qaeda's branch in northwest Africa. That attack killed two militants, including one identified by American officials as Musa Abu Dawud, a high-ranking official in Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb.
Until that strike, the Pentagon had focused its counterterrorism strikes in Libya almost exclusively on Islamic State fighters and operatives farther north. Over several months in 2016, the military conducted nearly 500 airstrikes in the coastal city of Surt to destroy the Islamic State's stronghold there.
Drones remain the weapon of choice to attack the militants in Libya. The military launches its MQ-9 Reaper drones from bases in Sicily and in Niamey, Niger's capital. It is also building a new $ 110 million drone base in Agadez, Niger, which is much closer to militant hotbeds in southern Libya than the base in Niamey. The Africa Command announced earlier this month that reconnaissance flights had started from the base. But military officials said privately they were still working out the logistics of arming the aircraft with missiles.
The C.I.A. is also broadening its drone operations in the region, moving aircraft to northeastern Niger to hunt militants in southern Libya. Nigerien and American officials told The New York Times last summer that the C.I.A. had been flying drones on surveillance missions for several months from a corner of a small commercial airport in Dirkou.

Texto completo: Several current and former Iraqi officials, named in leaked spy cables, said they had not provided Tehran with sensitive information.
Several senior Iraqi officials named in a New York Times report based on leaked Iranian intelligence cables denied on Monday that they were close to Iran or that they had given sensitive information to its government.
The report, based on about 700 pages of secret Iranian intelligence cables obtained by The Intercept and shared with The Times, was published online early Monday and shed light on the extent of Tehran's reach inside Iraq's power circles.
The cables record years of effort by the Iranians to cultivate senior Iraqi politicians, some of whom were said to have passed on information and to have committed to helping the Islamic Republic. The leaked documents describe in detail Iran's efforts to obtain informants and to persuade Iraqi agents working for the Americans to switch sides.
The cables date from 2014 and 2015, when Iraq was under siege by militants from the Islamic State and Iran's help was critical to its survival.
In the Times article, the cables' descriptions of the connections to Iran of several senior Iraqi officials, including the current prime minister, Adil Abdul Mahdi, and a former prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, are detailed at length. They include direct quotes attributed to the Iraqis in reports filed to Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security, or M.O.I.S.
Some of those officials on Monday expressed private dismay, public outrage or both, at being mentioned in the article. Among them were Mr. al-Abadi, the former prime minister, and Lt. Gen. Hatem al-Maksusi, who at the time he was mentioned in the cables was commander of military intelligence in Iraq's Defense Ministry.
Mr. al-Abadi denied that he had attended a private meeting with an Iranian agent who went by the name Boroujerdi, as recounted in the cables. In a statement on Facebook, he said, "We categorically deny that such a meeting took place."
Mr. al-Abadi said: "There was no such meeting on his schedule and it is unreasonable that a figure like the prime minister would meet and coordinate with a person with an obscure and unknown rank. It is a stupid and suspicious claim."
Another Iraqi cited in the article, Bayan Jabr, a former transportation minister, criticized The Times report for not fully quoting his response to the description in the cables of his relationship with the Iranians.
The cables said Mr. Jabr had agreed to a request from Gen. Qassim Suleimani, the commander of Iran's Quds Force, to fly planeloads of weapons and others supplies through Iraqi airspace to Syria to help the regime of President Bashar al-Assad against American-backed rebels.
According to the cables, Mr. Jabr granted the request.
Mr. Jabr was quoted in the Times article as saying that the flights were carrying humanitarian supplies and religious pilgrims. His office restated that on Monday, and said the article should have noted that at the time, Mr. Jabr had not yet officially taken up the position of minister, and that the planes were "subject to periodic searches by the Americans."
Another figure mentioned in the cables, and in the Times report, Salim al-Jabouri, the speaker of Iraq's Parliament in 2014 and 2015, questioned the timing of the article and said it might have been published "to incite the street" against the government. Popular opinion in Iraq is already running heavily against the government, with protests underway throughout the country.
General al-Maksusi played down the significance of the Times report. He was depicted in the cables as putting all of Iraq's military intelligence at the service of Iran. In comments published in the Times article, he denied working for Iran but praised the country for helping Iraq fight the Islamic State. He said he had also worked closely with the United States.
On Monday, a statement put out by General al-Maksusi's office said that "military intelligence worked closely" with a committee made up of representatives of four countries after 2014 -- Russia, Iran, Syria and Iraq -- "in the fight against ISIS."
"The details mentioned in the report did not come up with something new," the statement said. "It's natural that intelligence information would be exchanged when there is an agreement on intelligence sharing."
The leaked reports were sent anonymously to The Intercept, which translated them from the Persian and shared them with The Times. The Intercept and The Times verified the authenticity of the documents but do not know who leaked them. The Intercept communicated over encrypted channels with the source, who declined to meet with a reporter. In these anonymous messages, the source said that they wanted to "let the world know what Iran is doing in my country Iraq."

Impeachment polls don't matter because the media is still telling only half the Ukraine story

Texto completo: Pretty much every poll related to President Trump and impeachment should be discounted because the national media is still only providing the public with half of the story.
A perfect example is an ABC survey that came out Monday, declaring that “an overwhelming 70% of Americans” say Trump’s “actions” with Ukraine were “wrong.”
Sorry, but you're not going to convince me that 70% of Americans can point to Ukraine on a map, let alone that they actually know anything about Trump’s “actions” toward it.
ABC’s news story on its own poll referred to “Trump’s request to a foreign leader to investigate his political rival,” but the polling question itself didn’t describe his “actions” at all.
The media narrative is that Trump, obsessing over the 2020 campaign and fearing Joe Biden, asked Ukraine’s president to “dig up dirt” on the person he may face off against in the election. To get Ukraine to commit, the story goes, Trump withheld military aid.
That’s not what happened, but isn’t that a weird scenario on its own? Why Ukraine? What would such a random place have to do with Biden?
Well, those aren’t questions the media have time to answer these days. Thank you and goodbye!
Aren’t those important things to know before determining whether Trump’s “actions” were “wrong”?
Most people don’t know that Ukraine inserted itself in the 2016 election for the explicit purpose of hurting Trump’s campaign. That’s because the media now pretends it didn’t happen, even though the New York Times broke the story at the time.
Most people don’t know that Biden was concerned about his adult son’s involvement with a shady Ukrainian energy company, inexplicably drawing $50,000 per month for a job that didn't require any specialized knowledge on his part. That’s because the media now pretends that it doesn’t matter, despite Biden admitting that it didn’t sit well with him.
When the media start thoroughly explaining Trump’s “actions” concerning Ukraine, maybe then the polls about impeachment will carry some weight.

'Meth. I'm on it.': Social media erupts over South Dakota anti-drug campaign

Texto completo: Social media users expressed confusion following the release of a $449,000 South Dakota ad campaign aimed at methamphetamine users.
"Meth. I'm on it," the tag line reads, while featuring a multiethnic group of faces both young and old. Republican South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, 47, cited the state's problems with meth addiction were "growing at an alarming rate" and touted the campaign as a way to unify the state in an effort to curb its abuse.
"This is our problem, and together, we need to get on it," Noem said in a video announcing the campaign rollout. "It is filling our jails and prisons, clogging our court systems, and stretching our drug treatment capacity while destroying people and their families."
The nearly half-million-dollar fee went to Minneapolis-based ad agency Broadhead Co. Referring to the head-turning campaign as "inclusive and empowering," South Dakota Social Services Secretary Laurie Gill praised the effort as an "aggressive approach."
"It's evident there's a need for an aggressive approach to reduce use of the devastating drug," Gill said. "This is a movement to educate South Dakotans on the signs of addiction, the treatment resources that are available, and how to implement prevention techniques in their homes and among their communities."
Not all internet users shared Gill and Noem's confidence. "Is South Dakota trying to advertise meth?" asked Human Events editor Ian Miles Cheong. Tweet"Also, JUST TO BE CLEAR, it's not a joke," said New York Times correspondent Mike Baker with a video of Noem's announcement.TweetOthers speculated about how the ad could have been produced. "Intern: 'here’s that ad campaign you wanted.' Noem: 'the one that says we’re on top of the meth problem?' Intern: 'ah'."Tweet
"The only way to explain South Dakota’s new anti-Meth ads is that everyone involved in their creation is on meth," Robby Starbuck said. TweetTweet

Daily on Healthcare, presented by SBEC: Anti-abortion, pro-Medicaid is the winning stance in deep-red Louisiana

I’ll take your Trump endorsement and I’ll raise you two major healthcare issues: Louisiana governor John Bel Edwards won reelection Saturday night over President Trump-backed Republican Eddie Rispone after campaigning on a set of accomplishments uniquely geared to running as a Democrat in a deep-red state: Unapologetic support for expanding Medicaid through Obamacare, and support for a near-total ban on abortion.
Edwards, a Catholic, in May signed a ban on abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected, about six weeks into pregnancy.
On the other hand, he enacted Medicaid expansion in Louisiana in 2016. He says that 460,000 working adults in the state now receive coverage through the expansion.
“The easiest big decision that I’ll ever make as governor,” Edwards said of expanding Medicaid in the only gubernatorial debate in October.
Edwards appealed to Democrats and others by touting his accomplishments in expanding Medicaid. His views on abortion and gun rights, however, garnered conservative support.
Rispone, in contrast, had promised to halt Medicaid enrollment upon taking office.
It would appear that Medicaid expansion is a favorable issue for Democrats, even in red states. Democrat Andy Beshear just won election in Kentucky running on a pro-Medicaid expansion platform, while Republican incumbent Matt Bevin had sought to scale back the Medicaid expansion by adding work requirements, a change that got approval from the Trump administration in 2017 (the plan has been blocked by the courts). Beshear pledged to immediately rescind the mandatory work requirement in his first week in office.
Congressional Republicans, take note: Edwards scored points on Rispone by suggesting that, by favoring a “Medicaid freeze,” Rispone didn’t care about people with pre-existing conditions. Obamacare protections for people with pre-existing medical conditions have been a major point of contention as Republican state attorneys general and the Trump administration have sought to have the courts rule that the healthcare law is unconstitutional.
“Health care is kind of the Holy Grail of politics right now,” Edwards pollster Zac McCrary told the Associated Press. “It enthuses the Democratic base. It can persuade independents.” The way Democrats talk about it matters, McCrary said: “Strengthening, protecting, improving the ACA, that’s a much better battleground than scrapping the ACA and starting from scratch.”

PLANNED PARENTHOOD WINS $2 MILLION IN LAWSUIT OVER SECRET VIDEOS: Planned Parenthood won about $2 million in a federal case Friday in San Francisco over anti-abortion activist and Center for Medical Progress founder David Daleiden, who secretly recorded Planned Parenthood employees in 2015 while posing as a biotechnology representative. The jury found that he had trespassed on private property and committed fraud in the undercover recordings.
Fellow anti-abortion rights activists claimed the verdict was in violation of Daleiden’s freedom of speech, as he had been working as an undercover journalist. The Center for Medical Progress, the anti-abortion activism group Daleiden founded, tweeted Friday: “Today’s ruling threatens First Amendment rights of all Americans. Now more than ever we ask you to join us in fighting injustice coming out of San Francisco’s Federal Court. We will appeal!”
Alexis McGill Johnson, acting president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said after the verdict: “David Daleiden and the Center for Medical Progress intentionally waged a multi-year illegal effort to manufacture a malicious campaign against Planned Parenthood.

TRUMP BACKS OFF VAPING FLAVOR BAN OVER FEARS OF LOSING VOTES: Trump will not move forward with his proposed vaping flavor ban announced in September after advisers told him it would jeopardize his chances for re-election by alienating his base and leading to job losses. The vaping industry has faced scrutiny from public health groups and anti-smoking advocates, including the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, for its hand in causing over 2,000 vaping-related lung injuries and over 40 deaths, even though the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has narrowed in on illegal vaping liquids made from THC as the cause.
FDA APPROVES FIRST TARGETED THERAPY FOR SICKLE CELL DISEASE: Novartis won approval from the Food and Drug Administration for Adakveo Friday, the first targeted therapy to prevent painful vaso-occlusive crises that come with sickle cell disease. Acting FDA Commissioner Brett P. Giroir said: "Hope has never been higher for people living with sickle cell disease and their families and supporters, with a pipeline of new treatments on the horizon, like the one being approved today, and several initiatives underway to better utilize current tools in the battle against the painful and deadly blood disorder.”

Texto completo: The New York Times is shrugging off a challenge from the CEO of FedEx following the newspaper's blistering report on a recent change in the shipping company's tax status.
"FedEx’s colorful response does not actually challenge a single fact in our story," spokesperson Danielle Rhoades Ha told the Washington Examiner. "We’re confident in the accuracy of our reporting."
The story, published Sunday, reported FedEx had reduced its yearly tax bill from more than $1 billion in 2017 to $0 the next year.
The big tax break came in large part because of the tax code recently passed by Republicans.
"The New York Times paid zero federal income tax in 2017 on earnings of $111 million, and only $30 million in 2018 — 18% of their pretax book income," FedEx CEO Frederick Smith responded.
Smith went on to challenge the journalists who published the scathing article to a debate on who has done more for the American people.
Leaders at the Times called the debate invitation a deflection and a poorly advised attention grab.
"FedEx’s invitation is clearly a stunt and an effort to distract from the findings of our story," Rhoades Ha said.

WeWork may lay off thousands

Texto completo: WeWork is preparing to cut at least 4,000 people from its workforce as it tries to stabilize itself after the company’s breakneck growth racked up heavy losses and led it to the brink of collapse, two people with knowledge of the matter said.
The cuts are expected to be announced as early as this week and will take place across WeWork’s sprawling global operation. Under the plan, the company’s core business of subletting office space would lay off 2,000 to 2,500 employees, one of the people said. An additional 1,000 employees will leave as WeWork sells or closes down noncore businesses, like a private school in Manhattan that WeWork set up. Additionally, roughly 1,000 building maintenance employees will be transferred to an outside contractor. Together, these employees would represent around a third of the 12,500 people WeWork employed at the end of June.
But one of the people said the company could shed as many as 5,000 to 6,000 employees.
The staff reductions will be included in a five-year plan to overhaul WeWork that could be presented to employees as early as Tuesday, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the layoff plans.
The layoffs represent the human cost of a remarkable reversal in WeWork’s fortunes. Under its co-founder and former chief executive, Adam Neumann, the company piled billions of dollars into an erratic expansion that included adding huge office spaces in the world’s most expensive cities, offering discounts to lure tenants and buying other businesses. WeWork, which leases office space from landlords, refurbishes it and rents it out to its customers, shelved plans for an initial public offering in late September after investors were put off by the company’s losses and had questions about its corporate governance.
SoftBank, the Japanese conglomerate that is WeWork’s largest outside shareholder, last month announced a plan to bail out the company and is now trying to stabilize the business. But it is not clear how far the plan, which rests on selling billions of dollars of new WeWork bonds to investors, has progressed. The prices of the company’s existing bonds have tumbled in recent days, a sign that investors are worried about its prospects.
WeWork last week reported that it lost $1.25 billion in the three months that ended in September, more than twice as much as the company had lost in the same period a year earlier. A corporate presentation provided to investors revealed that WeWork opened nearly half of its locations in the 12 months that ended in September. Many of these locations are losing money and are likely to be depleting WeWork’s cash, which stood at $2 billion at the end of September.
Neumann, who agreed to cede control over WeWork after stepping down from the chief executive post in September, stands to receive an exit package worth around $1 billion. As part of that, he will receive a $185 million consulting fee for four years and can sell nearly $1 billion of his shares in the company to SoftBank. The soft landing for Neumann deepened anger among employees as the layoffs loomed.
During the recent tumult at the company, employees formed a group, the WeWorkers Coalition, that, among other things, is pressing for severance packages for departing employees that it considers equitable.
Starting Dec. 9, cleaning and facilities jobs at WeWork will be outsourced to JLL, a real estate services company, or one of its partners, according to an email sent to affected staff members last week that was reviewed by The New York Times. WeWork has assured employees that every member of its cleaning and facilities teams will keep their jobs and receive the same level of pay and comparable benefits. But employees who choose not to transfer will lose their jobs and receive no severance, according to a document provided to employees that was reviewed by The Times.
The changes have unnerved many employees, according to interviews with workers and Slack messages reviewed by The Times, stirring fears that some staff members will eventually lose benefits or be forced to work different schedules.
In the Slack messages, one WeWork facilities staff member said that hearing about the outsourcing was like being informed of a death in the family. Another employee said the decision showed that management was unconcerned about the workers’ welfare and was making decisions based on what would save the company the most money.

Farhad Manjoo: We hate data collection, but that doesn’t mean we can stop it

Texto completo: We’re being watched. We know we’re being watched, and we don’t think the watchers have our best interests at heart. They try to mollify us, arguing that we’re being watched for our own good and that in fact we’re the ones in charge of the scale and scope of all the watching, but deep down most of us are confused and suspicious about this sudden state of affairs. Why are they watching us so closely? What will they do with all they learn about us? Is there any hope of stopping them? And does it even matter that we do not want to be watched — or is it of no consequence because they know we’re trapped, and so do we?
The above may sound like the ravings of a wretch imprisoned in the Panopticon, but according to a survey of more than 4,000 people conducted this summer by the Pew Research Center, it is the widespread sensibility of the day.
According to the survey, Americans in 2019 feel adrift and powerless about living under the glare of digital surveillance. Two-thirds of Americans believe that surveillance is an inevitable consequence of modern existence — it is not possible to go through daily life, they say, without companies and the government collecting data about them. More than 70% believe that most or all of what they do online is being tracked, and nearly that many believe the same is true of what they do offline . And more than 80% feel like they have very little or no control over the data being collected about them.
In some ways the numbers are unsurprising; of course people who are being watched all the time feel that they’re being watched all the time.
Yet the survey also suggests a major failing on the part of corporations and the government to mitigate our concerns about the trade-offs we’re making for digital conveniences. In the past few years, Google, Facebook and other companies that collect and keep gigantic troves of data about us have stepped up their efforts to give us control over that data. Their primary argument is that users, not the companies, are in charge of the whole game — we can affect what data is collected about us and how it’s used.
That message doesn’t seem to be getting through. Large majorities of Americans feel as we have little or no control over our search and purchase and browsing histories; that our texts and social media wandering are easily monitored; and that even our physical location may be up for grabs.
It gets worse. Not only do we feel we have no control over our data, but we’re also sure there will be few consequences for misuse.
Most Americans say they don’t trust companies to own up to mistakes in the handling of our data or to suffer any serious punishment when things go wrong. Most of us say the companies’ own privacy politicizes are meaningless.
Not that this is a paranoid view. If you consider recent history — say, the fact that Equifax was allowed to stay in business after its gargantuan 2017 breach in which it failed at its one job, collecting and maintaining Americans’ financial data — it stands to reason that punishments for wrongdoing will be light. In July, Facebook was fined $5 billion by the Federal Trade Commission for its role in the Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal — a fine that set a record but was of so little consequence to Facebook’s business that its stock price actually rose after the punishment was announced.
The Pew survey shows Americans are eager for more power over our data. Three-quarters of respondents said there should be more regulation of what companies can do with our data; the view was shared across the political spectrum.
And Americans are wary of the fundamental trade-off we’re making for technology. Data-hungry corporations insist that we’re benefiting from the surveillance state — and that our very acquiescence to the collection is a signal of our contentment. In fact, the vast majority of Americans say that the potential risks of data collection by companies and the government outweigh the benefits.
But where does all this leave us? Ordinarily a finding of widespread discontentment should spark a sense of optimism — if people hate the status quo so much and are begging for a new way forward, won’t the market or the government step in and give us something better?
But there is another, more pessimistic way to read this survey. The tech companies still enjoy enormous financial success and have seen little impact from increasing scrutiny on their businesses. This suggests none of it matters. We hate the way things are, but we’ve traded away our power to stop it, and our worries won’t change anything.
The prison is terrible. We all know it. Enjoy your stay.

Texto completo: The vegetable is central and sacred to native Hawaiian culture, and my reporting quickly made clear that writing about taro meant writing about Hawaiian sovereignty.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
Can a single vegetable determine the fate of an entire people?
I didn't realize that the stakes were so high when I started investigating the revival of taro farming in Hawaii for T: The New York Times Style Magazine. I often write about food, which people think means celebrating the delicious -- and that's true. But the most interesting stories go deeper, examining the ways that what we eat defines and unites us.
Taro, a plant with edible heart-shaped leaves and a fiber-rich corm (underground stem), is rarely seen on dining tables in the mainland United States. But in Hawaii, it is central and sacred to the native culture -- "the very essence of it," the chef and cultural practitioner Kealoha Domingo told me. 'Aina, the word for land in Hawaiian, has at its root 'ai, meaning food in general but also specifically poi, a nutritious paste made from pounding boiled taro corms, measured in thickness by the number of fingers needed to eat it. (And yes: It is delicious.)
Like the culture, which was suppressed as the islands came under increasing Western influence and control in the 19th century, the crop has dramatically declined, from an estimated 35,000 acres pre-contact to 310 acres last year, according to Department of Agriculture statistics. But in the past two decades, farmers have increasingly turned to taro to protect both the land and the Hawaiian way of life.
I grew up in Hawaii, but I'm not Hawaiian: That term belongs only to the kanaka maoli, whose ancestors lived in the islands before Captain James Cook's arrival in 1778. And although I still think of myself as a kama'aina, or child of the land, the fact that I now live in New York and write for The New York Times sometimes made it difficult to persuade locals to talk to me.
Hawaii, for all its reputation as paradise -- and perhaps because of it -- rarely makes national news, beyond reports of natural disasters or a false missile attack alert. So the people who live there may be justifiably wary of mainland reporters seeking to tell their stories. For example: In 2016, I wrote a review of New York restaurants specializing in poke, a Hawaiian dish that was still a novelty on the mainland. In keeping with the way some of the restaurants spelled poke in their names, the editors put an accent on the letter E throughout so readers would know how to pronounce it. (The accent has since been removed from the online article.) People back home rolled their eyes; I thought I'd never live it down.
Then, last year, I wrote a longer story about poke, this time accentless and focused on the history of the dish in Hawaii. I must have at least partially redeemed myself because one of the most vocal critics of the earlier piece, the chef Mark Noguchi, reached out to me on Instagram. We started talking, and he told me about the struggle to bring back Hawaiian food ways -- and about the disappearance of hundreds of varieties of taro that had once flourished in the islands.
I wanted to know more. Mr. Noguchi put me in touch with local farmers and cultural practitioners, vouching for me, and they in turn put me in touch with others. Some were still initially skeptical and concerned about what story I would tell: Was this just about taro, or did it involve the larger fight for native Hawaiian rights?
I answered honestly that I wasn't sure yet where the story would go and that I was learning from them, whereupon a few gave me reading assignments: "Land and Power in Hawaii," by George Cooper and Gavan Daws, a harrowing chronicle of failed ideals and corruption in the first decades of statehood, and "Native Planters in Old Hawaii," by E. S. Craighill Handy and Elizabeth Green Handy, an out-of-print ethnographic tract that I sadly discovered was available on Amazon for $ 400. (One farmer offered to mail me a copy.)
It soon became clear that it was impossible to write about taro without addressing Hawaiian sovereignty. As I was reporting, activists were protesting the construction of a new telescope at Mauna Kea on the Big Island, the tallest mountain in the archipelago (and, measured from the ocean floor, on earth) and home to the gods in ancient lore. Thousands blocked the access road to the summit. In early September, two of my contacts told me they were headed to the mountain because of a rumor that the National Guard was coming in to clear the road. (They didn't; the protests continue.)
The same conflict seems to be unfolding at Mauna Kea as in the taro fields: culture versus commerce, the erasure of the old to make way for the new. For the people I spoke with, returning taro to ancestral fields wasn't simply a commercial enterprise -- it was kuleana, a reciprocal responsibility, taking care of the land as the land takes care of us.

Texto completo: The racing drama with Matt Damon and Christian Bale opened strong this weekend. The new "Charlie's Angels" sputtered.
It is a lesson that Hollywood has learned time and time again, from Steve McQueen's movies to the "Fast and the Furious" franchise: Quick cars and charismatic celebrities sell tickets.
That combination worked once more this weekend for 20th Century Fox's racing drama "Ford v Ferrari," starring Matt Damon and Christian Bale. It opened to an estimated $ 31 million in domestic ticket sales Friday through Sunday, outpacing expectations. The studio had projected an opening weekend of just below $ 20 million.
Directed by James Mangold, the movie revisits the golden age of auto racing: Damon and Bale play the car designer Carroll Shelby and the driver Ken Miles working for Ford in the lead-up to a historic 1966 race. The cast also includes Tracy Letts as Henry Ford II and Jon Bernthal as Lee Iacocca.
The movie got a boost from critics going into the weekend -- it currently holds a 92 percent fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes. In his review for The New York Times, A.O. Scott wrote that "'Ford v Ferrari' is no masterpiece, but it is -- to invoke a currently simmering debate -- real cinema, the kind of solid, satisfying, nonpandering movie that can seem endangered nowadays."
Ticket buyers also seemed enthusiastic, giving the movie an A+ grade in CinemaScore exit polls. That bodes well for the film's staying power.

This weekend's other big release, "Charlie's Angels," couldn't have eaten the dust left by "Ford v Ferrari," it was so far behind.
"Charlie's Angels" opened to a paltry estimated $ 8.6 million in ticket sales Friday through Sunday, which would be a bad showing for even a non-franchise action movie. But this is especially weak for an entry into a well-established brand like "Charlie's Angels" (last seen on the big screen in 2003).
"Charlie's Angels," directed by Elizabeth Banks, is distributed by Sony Pictures. Starring Banks, Kristen Stewart, Ella Balinska and Naomi Scott, it has been marketed as a feminist update of the decades-old franchise.
The response has been middling.
"Banks has chucked the bikinis," Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The Times, "but not the foundational fairy tale that women's power is a matter of low stakes, cute outfits and sassy you-go-girl attitude." The movie currently holds a 60 percent fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes.
"Charlie's Angels" is fighting for second place with a pair of holdovers. "Midway," a World War II action movie distributed by Lionsgate that was a surprise winner last weekend, brought in an estimated $ 8.8 million this weekend according to Comscore, which compiles box office data. And the Paramount Pictures comedy "Playing With Fire," starring John Cena, sold roughly $ 8.6 million in tickets. Final counts arrive on Monday.
Further down the charts, "The Good Liar," a drama distributed by Warner Bros. and starring Ian McKellen and Helen Mirren, opened to a weak $ 5.7 million in estimated domestic sales. But Warner Bros. also saw some good news: Their supervillain movie "Joker" crossed the $ 1 billion worldwide ticket sales mark on Friday.

Texto completo: Headnote New 'Super PAC for Cory Booker airs message same day Deval Patrick announces he's entering Democratic race for president
With Sen. Cory Booker's campaign still struggling to break through in fundraising and at risk of being excluded from the Democrats' December debate, a new super PAC has emerged from the swamps of New Jersey to support Booker. Its message: We don't need more candidates; we've got Cory.
The super PAC, United We Win, was filed Thursday, the same day that former Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts announced he was entering the race. It takes aim at the increasingly public vexing in Democratic donor circles that the largest field of candidates in the party's history needs yet another candidate.
The group said it planned to spend $1 million on Facebook and Instagram ads over the course of the next month. The ads will mainly target moderate Democrats across the country, though they will also feature issue-based themes, highlighting Booker's progressive policies on issues like gun control and criminal justice reform.
Each ad will also act as a mechanism to acquire small-dollar donors, linking to a page that has a button to directly donate to Booker's campaign. Booker is "less than 15,000" individuals away from reaching the 200,000-donor threshold for the December debate, according to campaign solicitation emails. (Booker has also not met the standard in any qualifying polls; he needs four.)
The super PAC was organized by supporters of Booker in New Jersey, including members within Gov. Philip D. Murphy's political orbit. The senator from New Jersey has enjoyed immense support from his home state, with the entire Democratic congressional delegation and Murphy offering their endorsement en masse earlier this year.
"Our organization is supported by individuals who know Cory and have seen the transformative impact that has been made by his leadership and dedication to doing what's right, from Newark to Washington," said Philip Swibinski, a spokesman for United We Win.
But the super PAC also poses a challenge for Booker, who could use the additional resources but has also denounced super PACs. In February, after another super PAC, called Dream United, formed to support his nascent candidacy, his campaign told HuffPost that "Cory opposes super PACs aiming to support his or anyone's candidacy for president."
With the primary calendar having reached a new, more dire phase, however, other presidential candidates are turning to super PACs - risking liberal backlash - in efforts to prop up their candidacies. Recently, allies of former Vice President Joe Biden set up a super PAC to augment his surprisingly cash-strapped campaign.
On Thursday, Booker's campaign reiterated his opposition to all super PACs, including ones supporting his candidacy.
"Nothing has changed from what we said from the outset of this campaign," said Sabrina Singh, a spokeswoman for the Booker campaign.

Empathy is good, but what if you care too much?

Texto completo: There's a cost to caring too much.
Two prominent mental health counselors – a resilience expert at an Ivy League college and a megachurch pastor – died by suicide in September. At the 2017 U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation's Health Means Business summit, Arianna Huffington, sleep evangelist and author of "The Sleep Revolution: Transforming Your Life, One Night at a Time," said people who toil in the charitable space often have the most trouble detaching from work.
Meanwhile, Justin Phillips, a mother who lost her son to overdose, is trying to start the #chooseempathy movement. She founded Overdose Lifeline to raise awareness that addiction is not a choice and requires empathetic responses.
Dr. Judith Orloff, a psychiatrist and self-described empath, agrees society needs more empathy given the rising rates of addiction, suicide and mental illness. But she cautions those who choose to be empathic – or find it comes naturally – about the need to care for themselves first.
The New York Times best-selling author's new book, "Thriving as an Empath: 365 Days of Self-Care for Sensitive People" (Sounds True publishing), is now in stores.
Here, she talks with USA TODAY health policy reporter Jayne O'Donnell, who calls herself an "overempathizer."
Question: How do you know if you are an empath?
Dr. Judith Orloff: Ordinary empathy is the ability to feel someone else's pain as well as their joy, the ability for us to be open-hearted. It's such a beautiful trait. Being an empath, however, goes further. Empaths have extremely sensitive neurological systems and don't have the usual filters that other people have, so they feel things intensely and often are emotional sponges who take on other people's stress if they don't learn how to set boundaries and practice other self-care techniques ... Most empaths are introverts like myself, but some are extroverts who love socializing but still need to decompress afterwards to take care of themselves.
As part of my research on empaths, I developed a 20-question self-assessment test in my earlier book, "The Empath's Survival Guide," to determine if you are an empath. Some of the questions include: Have I been labeled as overly sensitive? (in a derogatory way). Do crowds drain me, and do I need a lot of alone time to replenish myself? Do I take on other people's stress or emotions? Do I replenish myself in nature? Am I super-sensitive to noise, smells and excessive talking?
Empaths have special challenges and also gifts.
Q: There's a clear need for more empathy in our country, isn't there?
Orloff: I believe empathy is the most precious trait in human nature. We need more of it in our country and in the world. Empathy is the ability to put yourself in someone else's shoes so you can see their point of view. Empathy is so powerful because it opens our hearts. It allows us to try to understand another person's position, even if we don't particularly like them or if we disagree on an issue. This gives us the best chance of successfully communicating with them and resolving differences.
Q: But there are risks in caring too much?
Orloff: Yes, I've seen many of my patients, including empaths and all sensitive people, care too much and become burned out by empathy overload – or get involved with addictions, including substances, food and sex to numb themselves out. In my psychotherapy practice, there has been an epidemic of empathic patients consulting me who are exhausted, anxious, depressed and overwhelmed by added stress in their personal lives, which is aggravated by our world's non-stop stress.
Arianna Huffington reports that over two-thirds of doctors in the U.S. say they are burned out, depressed or both! Plus the general suicide rate in our country just keeps going up. Those in the helping professions have trouble turning stress off so they also tend to experience impaired sleep and increased anxiety.

VERA CLEMENTE, WIDOW OF ROBERTO, DIES IN PUERTO RICO AT 81

Texto completo: Vera Clemente, the Pirates' matriarch and Roberto's widow, enjoyed what was surely an emotional and long-awaited reunion with her husband on Saturday.
After she had been in "delicate health" since Nov. 1, Vera Clemente died of unknown causes in her native Puerto Rico, surrounded by family and friends. She was 81.
The loss was difficult to take for many Pirates fans, especially those who had idolized Roberto and, as a result, had gotten to know his wife. It turns out empathy and philanthropy were not ideals only the baseball-playing half of the marriage carried.
Vera Clemente is survived by three sons: Roberto Clemente Jr., Luis Roberto Clemente and Roberto Enrique Clemente.
"We are deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Vera Clemente, the widow of the great Roberto Clemente and a cherished member of the Pittsburgh Pirates and Major League Baseball family," Pirates owner Bob Nutting said in a statement.
"Vera epitomized grace, dignity and strength in the wake of heartbreaking tragedy and loss. Following Roberto's passing, Vera raised their three sons into outstanding men, while also working tirelessly to ensure her and her husband's shared vision of compassion, service and love of others lived on forever.
"Vera was an amazing ambassador for the Pirates organization, our city, the game of baseball and their beloved Puerto Rico. It is with very heavy hearts that we send our condolences to Roberto Jr., Luis, Enrique and the entire Clemente family."
Vera Christina Zabala Clemente graduated first in her class from the University of Puerto Rico and made it a point, following her husband's death, to continue their dedication to helping others.
She was strong, smart, gentle and funny, the perfect ambassador for carrying on the Clemente legacy - in large part because she also helped to create it.
Roberto Clemente died in a plane crash on New Year's Eve 1972 while attempting to deliver disaster relief supplies to Nicaragua following a devastating earthquake.
"If he had died in a common way, people would still remember him," Vera Clemente told the New York Times in 1994. "But Dec. 31, it was a special day and his was a special mission. I admire him for that, as a person, as a human being. So his image I keep alive. I feel happy doing what I am doing."
In a September 2018 article that appeared on La Vida Baseball, a website dedicated to Latino baseball, Luis Clemente spoke about his mother's tireless work honoring her late husband and giving to others via the Roberto Clemente Foundation, which she chaired.
"Mom has been the pillar of the family," Luis Clemente said. "She has been the source of inspiration for us to do what we do today, through the Roberto Clemente Foundation. She basically spearheaded all of the efforts to have the legacy continue."
Vera Clemente had spent the past several days at the Auxilio Mutuo Hospital in San Juan, Puerto Rico. In their Nov. 1 announcement of Vera Clemente's health issues, the Pirates did not disclose what ailed Vera Clemente.
Within an hour of the news that Vera Clemente had died, the governor of Puerto Rico offered her condolences.
"I join the pain of the family of Mrs. Vera Cristina Zabala, widow of our star, Roberto Clemente," Wanda Vazquez Garced tweeted. "Vera worked to ensure that Clemente's legacy will last. ... Rest in peace."
Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto also took to Twitter: "Pittsburgh sends our prayers to the Clemente family, on the loss of Vera," he wrote.
The Clementes married on Nov. 14, 1964, in Carolina, Puerto Rico. In 1974, Vera Clemente helped realize one of her husband's dreams by helping to open the Roberto Clemente Sports City, a place where young Puerto Ricans could develop their skills at sports.
Roberto Clemente played for the Pirates from 1954-72 and was named World Series MVP after hitting .414 against the Baltimore Orioles in 1971. He was a .317 career hitter, finished with exactly 3,000 hits and won four batting titles. He was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame following a special election in 1973.
Major League Baseball honors Roberto Clemente every year with an award named for him and given to the player who "best exemplifies the game of baseball, sportsmanship, community involvement and the individual's contribution to his team." It was originally titled the Commissioner's Award, but MLB changed the name in 1973 to honor the 15-time All-Star following his death.
Carlos Carrasco of the Cleveland Indians won it this past season. Andrew McCutchen was the Pirates' most recent winner, in 2015. Trevor Williams was the Pirates' nominee this past season.
Every year, on Sept. 6, the Pirates and Pirates Charities celebrate Clemente Day by blanketing the community for charity events and finding various ways to give back.
The most recent Clemente Day celebration was a tough one for the Pirates, as it coincided with closer Felipe Vazquez admitting he had sexual contact with a 13-year-old girl.
After meeting with several youngsters inside the Clemente Museum in Lawrenceville, shortstop Cole Tucker talked about how the day was almost therapeutic for the Pirates.
"As pro baseball players, we have a platform to be role models for kids all over the world," Mr. Tucker said. "In light of the news that we're all kind of digesting right now, it's extremely important for us to go out and do good like this.
"It's our way of pushing forward, continuing to be good people and continuing to hold ourselves to the standard that Clemente set."
Nobody reached and maintained that standard quite as well as Vera Clemente, the matriarch of the Clemente legacy.
"I am very proud to be Roberto's son," Luis Clemente said, "but I feel extremely fortunate to be Vera's son as well."

Texto completo: The point of the impeachment process
In a civilized society, between the partisanship of warring sides ought to stand principles and rules of engagement. These principles form the moral backbone that allows a society to function effectively even in the midst of heated debate. Without these principles we just become marauding animals who squabble and fight using any means necessary to win, devolving into a failed state.
The impeachment hearings aren't about my tribe vs. your tribe, as much as the media wants to make it sound that way. It's about whether we all must live and adhere to principles in our dealing with others.
Nicholas Kristof of the New York Times offered this analogy to what's going on in Washington: Imagine, he says, that you are a police officer whose child was expelled from school. You go to talk to the principal, and he says: “I'll allow your child to return but you have to do something for me first. I'm divorcing my wife and I want you to investigate her and see if she's having an affair.” We all would recognize this solicitation as an abuse of power, and certainly our Founding Fathers did. They wrote that such bribery is forbidden and an impeachable offense.
This is what the impeachment inquiry is about. It's not a hoax. It's about the misuse of power for personal gain – a moral offense as well as being unlawful. As we listen and weigh the evidence, let us, as a moral people, side with upholding ethical principles and not just our partisan political party.

Texto completo: Olivia Colman takes the throne in Season 3 of "The Crown." And Amazon's alternative history series comes to an end.
What's Streaming
THE CROWN Stream on Netflix. After winning the Oscar for her role as Queen Anne in "The Favourite," Olivia Colman plays another British monarch in this historical drama series. Colman brings Queen Elizabeth II into middle age, taking over from Claire Foy who played the ruler in her young adulthood, as the series follows the royal family through the 1960s and '70s. Season 3 finds the Windsors grappling with the fact that Britain is no longer a far-reaching global empire, as well as dealing with the challenges of putting duty before their personal lives. The latter becomes an issue for Prince Charles (now a teenager, played by Josh O'Connor), whose family disapproves of his girlfriend, Camilla Shand (Emerald Fennell). Tobias Menzies takes over for Matt Smith as Prince Philip, while Helena Bonham Carter plays Princess Margaret, following Vanessa Kirby's run in the role.
EARTHQUAKE BIRD (2019) Stream on Netflix. This mystery thriller centers on the unlikely friendship of two expats in 1980s Tokyo: an outgoing American named Lily Bridges (Riley Keough) and the reserved Swedish translator Lucy Fly (Alicia Vikander). After Lucy is called in for police questioning regarding Lily's mysterious disappearance, the film revisits their bond in a series of flashbacks. Lucy's romantic interest Teiji, a Japanese photographer, enters the fray by joining the women on a weekend trip to Sado Island, where simmering flirtations lead to disastrous consequences. The film, which is based on a novel by Susanna Jones, "is well shot and well acted, and with its attention to novelistic detail it does more than give lip service to themes of sexuality, jealousy and the way different cultures categorize and fetishize each other," Glenn Kenny wrote in his New York Times review.
THE MAN IN THE HIGH CASTLE Stream on Amazon. Over three seasons, fans of this alternate history drama have watched Juliana Crain (Alexa Davalos) traverse all over what's left of America after the Axis Powers win World War II, embedding with the American freedom fighters along the Rocky Mountains, getting close to a Nazi family in the east and befriending government officials in the Japanese-controlled west. But by the end of Season 3, she travels across the multiverse to a different world entirely. Armed with this new ability, Juliana continues her fight for a better world in the series's final season.
What's on TV
LAST WEEK TONIGHT WITH JOHN OLIVER 11 p.m. on HBO. John Oliver has managed to make his satirical news series stand out from the pack of late-night comedy shows by offering witty and thoughtful takes on everything from the impeachment inquiry against President Trump to Japanese mascots. This season, he covered topics from home (the opioid crisis, World Wrestling Entertainment and the accuracy of voting machines) and abroad (the Hong Kong protests, Boris Johnson and the impact of commercial climbing of Mount Everest). The show usually ends its seasons with a bang, featuring guests like "Weird Al" Yankovic, Tom Hanks and Russell Crowe, so tune in for whatever Oliver has cooked up for the last show of Season 6.

Texto completo: Gary Gulman is showing us how to bring our inner selves out into the open.
If I were a comedy obsessive, I would already have known about the sneaky genius of Gary Gulman. He's got a devoted following, a winning smile, a corkscrew imagination; in 2016, when he did a six-minute bit on "Conan" about how the states got their two-letter abbreviations, it became a viral sensation, pure catnip for nerds.
But what I wouldn't have known about Gulman -- because he kept it so well hidden -- was that he'd spent the bulk of his life trying to subdue an intractable melancholy. His recent HBO special, "The Great Depresh," joins a growing family of stand-up performances about mental suffering. (See Chris Gethard's "Career Suicide" if you want another, or Hannah Gadsby's "Nanette.") Gulman is unsparing with the details: In 2017, he suffered an episode of major depression so crippling he checked himself into the hospital for electroconvulsive therapy. It meant canceling months' worth of engagements.
Today, Gulman is "in remish," as he likes to say, and he's made that depressive episode the centerpiece of his act, demystifying incapacitating gloominess with sunny and wicked abandon. What popped out wasn't any one line, though there were many. (Especially devastating: When he channels friends who question whether antidepressants are worth the potential side effects, like impotence. "Oh yes. I was having so much sex in the fetal position.") What stood out instead was a persistent theme: There was a huge gulf between the Gary Gulman almost everyone saw and the person he knew himself to be.
He describes his adolescent body, an imposing 6-foot-6, as a "man costume" belying a gentle boy who preferred to read. When a storied coach from Boston College came to his house his senior year to recruit him for football -- "you have an N.F.L. body," he told him -- Gulman had to stifle the urge to reply, "No more than 10 feet from here, I have a blankie."
After his hospitalization, he got an invitation to attend his 25th college reunion. He dreaded the prospect of going. "I was so sick of lying about how I felt to make other people feel less uncomfortable around me," he explains. "People lie at their reunions even if they're doing well."
This observation should ring true to almost any functional depressive. It's work to seem fine. If you're just well enough to drag yourself to your place of employment (your thoughts still a sound cloud of distress, but the volume on low), or if your depression takes the form more of an itchy sweater than a leaden dentist's apron (which is to say, anxiety), you are forever and always performing your okayness. Every depressed person has a clandestine self.
I know a thing or two about this. I've always wandered through the world nerves first. My anxiety can shatter stones, spook ghosts, freak out a cup of coffee. I jazz-hands my way through it.
It was thrilling enough that Gulman was calling attention to the depressive's daily charade. But the more I thought about it, the more I realized he was doing something else, and it was something quite powerful: He was calling attention to our culture's daily charade too. His act is a tacit rebuke of the lacquered fakery of our Instagrammed, brand-conscious lives.
In "The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life," the sociologist Erving Goffman made the distinction between our "front stage" behaviors -- in which we're performing for a particular audience, always conscious of being observed -- and our backstage ones, when we peel off the mask.
Today, we're front-stage in so many ways and across so many platforms that it's utterly exhausting. We perform the just-right kind of politics. (See my latest tweet about the latest outrage!) We perform our perfect vacations and Tuesday night cocktails. (Look at my Instagram, and note that you, dear follower, were not invited to those cocktails!) We perform our brilliant professional identities, networking and hustling during hours once devoted to relaxation.
Built into any front-stage setting is the expectation that we'll project happiness, confidence, success.
Depression is, by definition, a backstage emotion. It's private, idiosyncratic, isolating. Those comedians who've elected to discuss it are still giving performances, ultimately, working off careful scripts and landing their punch lines; they aren't climbing onstage and actually being depressed for us.
You could argue that comedians have long made art out of their pain. The sad clown, the angry comic -- it's basically a cliché. But the crop of comedians making these specials aren't just using their melancholy as invisible fuel for their art. It's the end product too, the material itself. They've made it audible, shareable, knowable. Visible.
Some are discussing it in non-comedy contexts. At roughly the same time Gulman's special appeared last month on television, the documentary short "Laughing Matters" appeared online, featuring nearly a dozen comics discussing their experiences with anxiety and depression. Among them are Sarah Silverman, Rainn Wilson and Wayne Brady.
Gulman's special also contains any number of scenes offstage -- in his childhood home, in his apartment, in his psychiatrist's office -- as if to show us: This is what I'm like when I'm not converting suffering into comic expression. At one point, his wife confesses she wasn't sure if he was ever going to get better.
"I think people are sick of everyone promoting their best selves," Gulman, 49, told me in a phone interview, adding that he was lucky to be among a generation of comics who could speak freely about their imperfect, struggling selves instead. That was hardly true when he was watching comedy as a kid. "I mean, comedians were always self-deprecating, but even Rodney Dangerfield's self-deprecation was so clearly a lie. He's saying he doesn't get any respect, but he's hosting an HBO show. Everyone admired him, was in awe of him."
Gulman built his act slowly, first dedicating only 15 minutes to his depression at the very end of his set. "I felt I'd given everyone enough pure jokes and entertainment to earn those 15 minutes," he explained. "And people came up to me afterward. They were just so grateful for that portion, so appreciative. It led me to believe they were thirsty for it."
And there is a thirst. When I first reached Gulman, I mentioned that his fans, old and new, must have lately turned him into their confessor, sharing with him their private worries and sorrows. I couldn't imagine the burden of being in such a position. Yet as we were chatting, I found myself doing precisely that -- peeling off my reporter's mask and sharing stories of my own, pointing out where I'd identified with him, seconding his observations.
Those undisclosed selves: They really do long to be seen and heard.

Seeing Red Over Car Rental Troubles

Texto completo: In this week's Tripped Up column, Sarah Firshein investigates multiple complaints with the rental car company Europcar.
When we first solicited reader stories of travel disasters, we immediately received four individual emails concerning Europcar, the rental car company that operates in 140 countries. Although anyone renting a car from any rental company on Earth might find themselves in the situations below, we felt that strength in numbers might be valuable here, so we packaged the disasters as a quartet and sent them to Europcar for comment.
In addition to (largely) resolving the complaints, Europcar emailed the following statement: "Europcar Mobility Group would like to thank The New York Times for bringing to its attention the various customer service issues. The company has responded directly to each of the customers concerned to resolve their queries and has taken on board where processes may need to be improved to deliver the best possible customer experience."
Dear Tripped Up,
After arriving in Calgary for the annual Calgary Stampede, Europcar jilted us by failing to honor our rental car reservation. There was only car left in the entire place, at Avis, and soon we were driving off in a red Mustang convertible that cost 2,000 Canadian dollars more than the car we reserved. Because Europcar failed to honor my reservation, shouldn't I be refunded for the difference? Ethan
Dear Ethan,
As a "Seinfeld" fan, it gave me great pleasure to email Europcar: "Why did Europcar take the reservation but not actually keep the reservation? Isn't that the whole point of a reservation?"
Like most car rental companies, though, Europcar overbooks to offset potential no-shows. Combine that with what the company cited as "high demand and some customers not returning vehicles as expected," and it's no surprise that you arrived to a nonexistent car, especially on one of Calgary's busiest weeks of the year.
Europcar's Reservation Guarantee Policy is meant to bulwark against scenarios like yours; if you are forced to rent a car elsewhere because of a lack of inventory, Europcar pledges to reimburse you. But these consumer protections are nonstandardized non-laws, leaving it up to the renter to advocate for recourse either in person, at peak exasperation, or after the fact, through a dizzying maze of emails and phone calls that go unanswered. Not exactly a winnable game.
I advocated for you and had some luck. Europcar issued you a refund of 983.29 dollars: the exact difference between the car you ostensibly rented and the red Mustang you drove away with, James Bond-style. However, the company was unwilling to refund the additional fees that amounted to the full 2,000 dollars overage.
That pain point is exactly what has prompted the Audi-owned rental car company, Silvercar (available in various cities in the United States, largely at airports), to rethink the traditional car-renting process by eliminating surprise fees and other hassles. And, as luck would have it, the company has a foothold in Denver -- should you ever be inclined to attend another rodeo, say, in the American West.
Dear Tripped Up,
In March, when I went to pick up my Europcar rental at the Puerto Vallarta airport, the agent forced me to buy $ 236.68 insurance before handing over the keys, even though my American Express card already offers collision damage waiver insurance. I showed him proof of coverage, but he held his ground. I've had no luck getting the money back. Keith
Hi Keith,
You're right: All American Express cards have Car Rental Loss and Damage Insurance, secondary collision damage waiver coverage for rental-car damage or theft, which is applicable worldwide in most countries, including Mexico.
You were also correct to assume that Amex C.D.W. coverage kicks in only when cardholders decline the insurance offered by the rental car company: exactly what you attempted.
You were also correct to show proof of coverage, because even though Amex is a multi-billion-dollar, multinational brand that's just about as recognizable as McDonald's, Europcar still requires physical documentation of C.D.W. coverage, beyond the card itself. (You can get a Letter of Coverage on the spot by calling the phone number on the back of the credit card.)
Either the Puerto Vallarta agent was trying to pull a fast one or he was genuinely confused about the policies. Regardless, Europcar has issued a refund for the extra insurance.
Dear Tripped Up,
My wife and I rented a vehicle through Europcar for a monthlong drive through South America; the rental agreement, via Priceline, came out to $ 3,312. But I believe Europcar used an inflated exchange rate, rather than the rate at the date of the credit card transaction, to convert the agreed-upon U.S.D. price to Chilean pesos. I ended up with a bill that was $ 194 higher. Barry
Dear Barry,
Because currency conversion rates vary daily, Europcar Chile sets a fixed rate based on the exchange rate on the first day of the month, plus 2 percent to account for the rate variance through the month. That's generally industry standard. Acknowledging that you might not have had full access to the terms and conditions when you booked through a third-party site, Europcar has refunded your $ 194.
Dear Tripped Up,
Our tire blew out shortly after picking up a BMW from Europcar in Rome. We were told that roadside assistance would cost 300 euros, plus the price of the tire; alternatively, I could exchange the car at the nearest Europcar location, about 16 miles north. But with a flat tire? Our Airbnb host helped us purchase and install a new tire, but I lost $ 96 in the process. Chris
Dear Chris,
Europcar confirms that its 24-hour roadside assistance for a flat tire should have been free, and that "it is not the company's policy to ask a customer to drive with a blown-out tire." (Amen to that.) In order to resolve what it has called "an honest misunderstanding," Europcar has refunded you for the cost of the replacement tire. Here's hoping that your next trip to Rome won't be such a ... Roman holiday.
The Oct. 27 edition of Tripped Up , in which a woman unsuccessfully tried to travel internationally with a passport set to expire four months, inspired all sorts of reactions from Times readers. Kate R. got right to the point: "Wouldn't it make life easier if the powers that be just put that info on their websites instead of folks having to guess? That's a problem with many government websites." Agreed!

Obama warns contenders about leaning too far left

Texto completo: Washington • Former President Barack Obama offered an unusual warning to the Democratic primary field Friday evening, cautioning the candidates not to move too far to the left in their policy proposals, even as he sought to reassure a party establishment worried about the electoral strength of their historically large primary field.
Speaking before a room of wealthy liberal donors, Obama urged Democrats to remember the long, combative slog of his primary campaign against Hillary Clinton in 2008, arguing that the 16-month battle ultimately made him a stronger general election candidate.
“For those who get stressed about robust primaries, I just have to remind you I had a very robust primary,” he told the group of several hundred donors and organizational leaders in Washington. “I’m confident that at the end of the process we will have a candidate that has been tested.”
Yet, he also raised concerns about some of the liberal ideas being promoted by some candidates, citing health care and immigration as issues where the proposals may have gone further than public opinion.
While Obama did not single out any specific primary candidate or policy proposal, he cautioned that the universe of voters that could support a Democratic candidate — Democrats, independents and moderate Republicans — are not driven by the same views reflected on “certain left-leaning Twitter feeds” or “the activist wing of our party.”
“Even as we push the envelope and we are bold in our vision, we also have to be rooted in reality,” Obama said. “The average American doesn’t think we have to completely tear down the system and remake it.”
The comments marked an extraordinary entrance into the primary contest by the former president, who has been careful to avoid even the appearance of influencing the direction of the race.
His remarks offered an implicit critique of Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, who have urged voters to embrace “political revolution” and “big, structural change,” as well as proposals once widely considered to be left to the liberal fringes of the party, including court packing and decriminalizing illegal border crossings.
Even as Obama has attempted to stay out of the race, the primary candidates have engaged in a heated discussion over his legacy, debating whether to stick with Obama’s architecture for health care policy or to pursue a single-payer system and offering flashes of direct criticism over his record on immigration. At the same time, former Vice President Joe Biden has made his strong support for Obama and his accomplishments a hallmark of his candidacy.
Acknowledging that candidates must “push past” his achievements, Obama urged his party’s candidates not to push too far, as he urged them to adopt a message that would allow them to compete in all corners of country.
“I don’t think we should be deluded into thinking that the resistance to certain approaches to things is simply because voters haven’t heard a bold enough proposal and if they hear something as bold as possible then immediately that’s going to activate them,” he said.
The fact that Obama offered his reassurances at the annual meeting of the Democracy Alliance — a club of wealthy liberals who donate hundreds of thousands of dollars a year to recommended political organizations — only underscored the intended audience of his message. In recent weeks, establishment-aligned Democrats, top donors and some strategists have expressed fears that the party lacks a strong enough candidate to defeat President Donald Trump.
They question whether Biden has the ability to compete in a multistate primary campaign, fret about Sanders’ and Warren’s viability in the general election and remain skeptical that Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, can broaden his appeal beyond white voters.
Their concerns have prompted the late emergence of two experienced candidates, Deval Patrick, the former governor of Massachusetts and a close friend of Obama, and Michael R. Bloomberg, both of whom entered the field after nine candidates had already dropped out.
Those worries are not necessarily shared by voters in early states, where surveys show that most Democrats have gravitated to a shortlist of four candidates and feel the field remains too large.
“If you talk to the voters they don’t feel the need for another candidate,” said Kathy Sullivan, the former chairwoman of the Democratic Party in New Hampshire. “We haven’t been sitting around in New Hampshire saying we need a hero to come and rescue us.”
Since leaving office nearly three years ago, Obama has mostly remained out of the public fray.
While he has headlined fundraising events for Democratic committees, the former president has kept a low profile in the presidential race, meeting privately with most of the Democratic candidates but telling friends and political allies that neither he nor his wife, Michelle, have plans to endorse anyone and do not see it as their place to steer the party’s future.
Obama has expressed interest, at different times, in rising stars like former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas and Buttigieg. Obama had issued a warm statement about Biden’s entry into the primary but had declined to endorse him or anyone else.
During his nearly hourlong remarks on Friday, Obama offered only one clear endorsement, though not exactly the one many Democratic donors in the room wanted to hear.
Obama was interviewed by Stacey Abrams, who drew national attention during her unsuccessful run for governor of Georgia last year and is widely considered to be on the shortlist for the vice presidency — no matter which candidate ultimately wins the nomination.
“I love me some Stacey Abrams,” he said.

Texto completo: "...my sobriety isn't a limitation. Sobriety isn't even a "have to" - it's a superpower." - New York Times bestselling author, researcher and professor Brené Brown
Hot buttered rum. Hot toddies. Mulled wine. Shots of Makers Mark.
Those traditional holiday cocktails - and the shots - make up many of my memorable Ghosts of Christmas Pasts.
But not any more.
For the past year and a half, I've quietly followed the Sober Curious movement, which has been gaining favor in recent years and focuses on eliminating alcohol for health, sleep and wellness reasons.
Sober Curious stems from journalist Ruby Warrington's book "Sober Curious: The Blissful Sleep, Greater Focus, Limitless Presence, and Deep Connection Awaiting Us All on the Other Side of Alcohol."
This is not a 12-step process to sobriety.
Nor a recovery method for alcoholics.
Instead, it's about recognizing the dominating role alcohol plays in our lives, acting on that understanding, and destigmatizing sobriety.
In my case, it means going from drinking wine on a regular basis to now having one glass maybe once every two or three months.
"There's this idea that you're either a problem drinker or an alcoholic, or a normal drinker who has no issues with alcohol," Warrington is quoted as saying in The Guardian.
"More and more we're seeing there are shades of grey when it comes to dependence on alcohol.''
Laura McKowen, author of a book coming out in January "We Are the Luckiest: The Surprising Magic of a Sober Life", writes about her recovery and sobriety at www.lauramckowen.com.
When it comes to the question of whether or not to quit booze, McKowen is quoted in media reports as saying "The normal question is, 'Is this bad enough for me to have to change? The question we should be asking is, 'Is this good enough for me to stay the same?' And the real question underneath it all is, 'Am I free?'."
If you are someone who thinks your life would be better without alcohol, please know that the decision to not drink at all or to drink significantly less is now being celebrated more and more.
Handcrafted mocktails are becoming more common. Sober social
networks (that aren't AA) are growing.
Dry January is here to stay. There are alcohol-free bars in cities like New York, Austin, London with names like Getaway, Listen Bar, Redemption Bar and Sans Bar.
Celebrities like Elizabeth Vargas, Dax Shepard, Samuel L. Jackson and Brené Brown have opened up about their recovery journeys and sobriety.
Currently, there are 42,300 posts on Instagram with the hashtag #sobercurious.
That's right, sobriety is becoming more accepted.
Yet, here I am, still oddly embarrassed to tell people I am not drinking as I awkwardly decline a host's repeated offers for a glass of sauvignon blanc.
I've even tried to hide the fact that I'm popping open a bottle of Topo Chico when everyone else is downing prosecco at gatherings.
Why? Because all too often there is an uncomfortable silence when you tell an imbibing group that you are not imbibing.
There's still a stigma of saying you're sober that isn't there for other health choices like going gluten or dairy free.
People want to know if there was a dramatic turning point or grim blackout story that made me cut way back on drinking.
There isn't.
You don't have to hit rock bottom to break up with booze.
For me the reason was this: Alcohol's risks far outweighed the buzz.
Maybe during the upcoming spirits-marinated holidays, I'd do better if I answered the ubiquitous "Why aren't you drinking?" inquiry by quoting McKowen:
"Each 'no' to drinking is a big "yes" to life."

Will lawmakers ever take back authority on immigration? OP-ED

Texto completo: Republican lawmakers seem to be having self-esteem issues.
The legislature, after all, is an equal branch of government with constitutionally granted powers. Lately, nearly all of those powers have been siphoned off by the president and his team of unelected bureaucrats. Yet, again and again, GOP lawmakers meekly submit to this constitutional castration.
To wit: Congress' power of the purse? Gone. Regardless of how much money Congress appropriates for, say, a border wall or military aid to Ukraine, President Trump has made clear that he'll ignore the number and pencil in his own.
Congress' power to regulate commerce with foreign nations? Hijacked by a president who cites bogus "national security" rationales to impose tariffs whenever he likes.
Congress' duty to "advise and consent" on major appointments? Cabinet and other senior government posts that require Senate confirmation have been atypically littered with "acting" officials instead. In fact, while immigration is ostensibly the president's signature issue, Trump hasn't had a single Senate-confirmed director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement since he took office. And though Democratic lawmakers may complain, nothing will change as long as Republicans control the Senate.
Which brings me to the most significant power Trump has stripped from Congress: its lawmaking authority. This is best illustrated by the administration's actions basically rewriting immigration law wholesale, with nary a peep from GOP legislators.
Sure, on some immigration matters, Congress has relinquished its responsibilities, effectively giving Trump the ability to contort immigration policy as he sees fit.
Consider the "dreamers," the young immigrants brought here as children who know no other country than the United States. They have long been in a legal limbo. Congress could resolve that limbo swiftly and easily by granting the dreamers permanent legal status and a pathway to citizenship. This would have the support of majorities of voters from both parties, and the Democratic-controlled House has already passed such legislation.
Meanwhile, lawmakers in the GOP-controlled Senate wrung their hands and watched helplessly from the sidelines as Trump announced his decision to kill the Obama-era program that protects the dreamers from deportation. Based on a hearing this week, the Supreme Court appears poised to uphold the president's decision. Yet, despite claiming to care about the issue, Republicans remain unwilling to act.
Similarly, Congress long ago gave the president authority to set the annual cap on refugee admissions. Not surprisingly, if disappointingly, the Trump administration has used that authority to ratchet the ceiling down to a record low of 18,000. For context, during President Barack Obama's last year of office, the ceiling was 110,000.
But there are other areas of immigration law on which Congress has acted, definitively and clearly, with legislative language that leaves little room for maneuvering by the executive. The Trump administration has flouted these laws anyway.
Take asylum law.
"Refugees" and "asylum seekers" both refer to immigrants fleeing violence or persecution, but, technically, "refugees" apply for sanctuary while still abroad, and asylum seekers apply while in the country of their destination. Unlike with refugee admissions, there are no legal caps on the number of people who may qualify for and receive asylum. The law does not allow the executive branch to set them, either.
But the Trump administration has effectively set its own limits.
Last year, for instance, the Trump administration tried to ban people from applying for asylum if they crossed between ports of entry - as most asylum seekers are now forced to do, because the administration has severely throttled (or "metered") the number of people who may apply through a given port of entry per day.
This "asylum ban" was blocked by the courts - because Congress has explicitly said asylum seekers can apply whether or not they entered the United States "at a designated port of arrival."
"The law is crystal, crystal clear on this," says Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, policy counsel at the American Immigration Council.
With virtually no pushback from Republicans in Congress, Trump administration then implemented a sort of asylum ban 2.0. This one disqualifies asylum seekers who passed through another country on their way to the United States without first applying for asylum there. A separate legal challenge - one among many - is now working its way through the courts.
A host of other changes designed to serve as a backdoor limit on asylee admissions have also been announced in recent weeks.
The Trump administration keeps scolding desperate immigrants to shape up and "follow the law." When will cowardly members of Congress insist that the president do the same?

Apple Bans Vaping Apps Amid a 'Youth Epidemic'

Texto completo: A respiratory condition linked to vaping has caused more than 40 deaths and over 2,000 illnesses, according to United States health authorities.
Apple removed 181 vaping apps from its online store on Friday, following the lead of federal, state and local regulators, which in recent months have cracked down on e-cigarette products.
The prohibition affects apps that help people find vape stores or flavors, allow them to control their vape pens, or gain access to games, news or social networks that promote vaping.
Apple's vaping app ban is the second significant step the iPhone maker has taken to distance itself from e-cigarettes. The company updated its App Store rules in June to ban new vaping apps, and the move announced on Friday removed the apps it had approved before that decision. The company said it had never allowed apps that sold vaping products.
In a statement, Apple cited the rise of lung injuries and deaths linked to vaping. Health experts have recently called "the spread of these devices a public health crisis and a youth epidemic," the company said. "We agree."
Cases of vaping-related illnesses have been rising, with more than 40 deaths and more than 2,000 illnesses, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The C.D.C. has urged people to avoid vaping anything because the cause of illnesses remains unclear.
Apple's vaping app ban reflects its hands-on approach to the App Store, which distributes about 1.8 million apps to iPhones, iPads and other Apple devices.
Apple requires its employees to manually review each app that applies to the store, encompassing about 100,000 apps a week. They reject about 40 percent. In a weekly meeting, a small team of top executives debate tricky cases of whether a given app belongs on Apple devices.
That approach has led to nuanced rules, an App Store with less fraud than other app marketplaces and criticism that Apple abuses its control of the marketplace.
In June, Apple added vaping to its ban on apps that encouraged the use of tobacco, illegal drugs or "excessive amounts of alcohol." But Apple still allows cannabis-related apps, as long as they are restricted to adults and certain states and don't offer sales or explicitly encourage recreational use.
Apple prohibits dozens of other categories of apps; the restrictions include the typical prohibitions on nudity, hate speech and physical harm. There is also a broad ban on apps that are "offensive, insensitive, upsetting, intended to disgust, in exceptionally poor taste or just plain creepy," as well as more nuanced bans on things as diverse as prank-call apps and apps that show maimed animals.
Google's app store for Android devices is more permissive, and a search on Friday yielded dozens of vaping-related apps.
Apple's strict approach has drawn criticism. Last year, Apple began removing or restricting apps that helped people limit the time they and their children spent on iPhones, shortly after Apple released a competing tool. After The New York Times reported on Apple's moves in April, Apple backed off on the policy.
Apple has also removed a number of apps at the behest of government officials in China, including those from news organizations like The Times and Quartz and an app that helped Hong Kong protesters track the police.
Apple users who have already downloaded vaping apps will be able to continue using them, though the apps will probably lose abilities as Apple continues to update iPhone software.
Apple said many of the vaping apps it had removed were from stores showing off their vaping products, though users couldn't buy anything in the apps. Some other apps that were banned helped adjust temperature and color, Apple said, though they weren't necessary for the vaping device to function.
Because of spikes in the use of e-cigarettes among minors, the Food and Drug Administration is expected to announce measures soon that could involve banning most flavored e-cigarettes, including mint.
Prohibiting menthol was mentioned earlier, but the vaping and tobacco industries have intensively lobbied the White House and lawmakers against such a broad ban, given that traditional menthol cigarettes remain on the market.
Juul Labs, the nation's largest seller of e-cigarettes, recently said it would discontinue sales of mint-flavored pods, after the latest national surveys showed that teenagers cited fruit and mint as their favorites.
Restrictions on e-cigarette products are also gaining momentum at the state and local level. San Francisco, where Juul is based, will ban sales of e-cigarettes entirely in 2020 after voters this month overwhelmingly rejected a measure that would have allowed sales to continue in the city under stricter controls.
Apple's ban was supported by the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. "By taking e-cigarette related apps off the App Store, Apple will help reduce youth exposure to e-cigarette marketing and discourage youth use of these products," said Matthew L. Myers, the president of the campaign.
News of Apple's decision was first reported by Axios.

Ends Sunday: When it opened off-Broadway in 2013, Ike Holter's play was described by the New York Times as an "impassioned evocation of the sparks that ignited the gay rights movement." Set in the Stonewall Inn, a now-iconic bar, in 1969, the play depicts gay men, lesbians and self-identified drag queens coming together to protest unfair treatment at the hands of the police. But, it turns out, they don't all agree on what went down. Mixed Precipitation's production of the fact-based play by Holter, a South High School graduate, is an area premiere.

Trump accuses intelligence inspector general of seeking 'publicity for himself'

Texto completo: President Trump accused Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson of seeking "publicity for himself" in his handling of a whistleblower complaint that spurred impeachment proceedings.
The public rebuke of Atkinson comes days after it was reported the president discussed firing the government watchdog due to concerns about loyalty.
"The IG brought it directly to Congress. Let's get some publicity for himself," Trump said during an appearance Friday on the new Dan Bongino Show, referring to Atkinson's decision to inform Congress of the complaint's existence.
Trump argued that if Atkinson had seen the transcript of his July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky he would have had second thoughts about the complaint focused on that conversation, which raised concerns about Trump abusing his office to elicit foreign help for the 2020 election.
"When he sees the call he would have been — he should have said, 'Well, there's no case here,'" Trump said.

Atkinson received the complaint from a CIA analyst, whose identity has not yet been confirmed, in August and deemed it to be urgent and credible. He forwarded the complaint to acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, who did not give Atkinson permission to share it with Congress after seeking guidance from the White House and Justice Department, but did allow him to notify them of its existence.
Following a clash over access with Democratic lawmakers, led by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, the complaint was declassified on Sept. 25, the same day the transcript of the Trump-Zelensky call was released, and it was made available to the public the next day.
Trump claims his call with Zelensky was "perfect" and shows he said nothing wrong. But Democrats are now building their impeachment case not only using the transcript, which shows Trump urged Zelensky to investigate his political rivals, but also with witnesses who have testified about how the administration may have been leveraging security aid and a White House meeting to pressure Ukraine.
The president has demanded Atkinson, whose office asserts he "processed and reviewed the complaint in accordance with the law," be among the witnesses called to testify.
Trump condemned Atkinson in public last month, tweeting, "Why does the ICIG allow this scam to continue?" But his criticism of Atkinson on Friday was more pointed and comes three days after the New York Times reported Trump began privately discussing firing Atkinson beginning as early as September.
It is unclear whether Trump has seriously considered removing Atkinson or was merely venting, but the president was said to view the watchdog as being disloyal. In the past, Trump has publicly griped about officials, including former FBI Director James Comey and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, before forcing them out.

Texto completo: Usuarios en redes sociales como Twitter han llamado a un boicot al canal de televisión VH1 luego de que la empresa anunciara que Emma Coronel, esposa del convicto narcotraficante Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán Loera, aparecerá en un episodio de la segunda temporada del “ reality show” “Cartel Crew “.
“VH1 tiene que ser boicoteado por tratar de darle glamur a estupideces como carteles de la droga / distribuidores de burdeles matones y criminales. Nosotros no necesitamos este tipo de mierda”, dijo en un tuit Esther Ramos.
VH1 has to be boycotted by glamorizing stupidities like drug cartels/dealers brothels thugs and criminals. we don't need this type of CRAP https://t.co/QxxfG0H1YH

Otros disgustados por la presencia de la exreina de belleza en el episodio de este próximo 18 de noviembre criticaron el hecho de que con el destaque de la esposa del exlíder del Cartel de Sinaloa se “glorifica” al narco.
“¿Por qué diablos están glorificando a la esposa de El Chapo? Cientos de personas han sufrido por esta familia y su cartel. Pero, oye, ¿a quién le importa la moral cuando tienes que producir ‘shows’ de mierda para hacer dinero, cierto?”.
@MTV @VH1 @Viacom Why the hell are you glorifying El Chapo’s wife? Thousands of people have suffered because of this family and cartel. But hey, who care about morals when you have to produce crap shows to make some money, right?
— Esther Ramos (@MBMBaMino) November 13, 2019
Why is @VH1 putting el chapo wife on tv? I mean, I know *why* (ratings and money) but what the fuck?! after the recent murders related to cartel and innocents being killed, it's really tone deaf. time to flush the state of media at this point

Las críticas no se han limitado a usuarios que no son figuras públicas. El escritor especializado en temas criminales y de narcos, Don Winslow, con éxitos de ventas del New York Times, catalogó de “asquerosa” la decisión del canal.
“Esto es realmente asqueroso”, compartió en un tuit el autor en el que etiquetó al servicio de televisión por suscripción.
Por su parte, el periodista mexicano Ioan Grillo retuitió el mensaje de Winslow al que agregó que es una “decisión enferma y terrible de VH1”, ya que el cartel ha creado una “catástrofe humanitaria en México ”.
This is a sick and terrible decision by VH1 to have El Chapo's wife Emma Coronel on its reality show "Cartel Crew." There is a humanitarian catastrophe in Mexico from cartel violence. This is not a glamorous reality show. Where are images of mass graves?https://t.co/MaLGUquIIM

El Chapo cumple una sentencia de cadena perpetua más 30 años tras ser declarado culpable el 12 de febrero pasado en la corte federal de Brooklyn, en Nueva York . El mexicano fue hallado culpable de los 10 cargos en su contra por parte de un jurado de 12 miembros que deliberó por seis días e incluso pidió copia de varios testimonios y aclaraciones específicas al juez sobre detalles de la evidencia.
Durante, aproximadamente, tres meses de juicio en la sala del juez Brian Cogan, 14 de los antiguos colaboradores de Guzmán, y otros 42 testigos de la Fiscalía hablaron sobre los crimenes del acusado.
Algunos de los cargos que pesaban contra el narco eran: participación en una empresa criminal continua, conspiración internacional para manufacturar y distribuir cocaína, heroína, metanfetamina y marihuana, y uso de armas de fuego.
Actualmente, Guzmán Loera permanece en la prisión de máxima seguridad en Florence, Colorado, mejor conocida como ADX o como el “Alcatraz de las Rocosas”.

An edgy argument in the form of a play; get ready to join in [Corrected 11/16/2019]

Texto completo: 'The Niceties' ***
When the student newspaper at Northwestern University apologized -- or caved -- this week in response to the anger of some of the students it had covered at a public protest, graduates of the Medill School of Journalism unleashed a torrent of complaint.
Many of the vociferous complainants were baby boomers. The staffers of the paper and the students who did not like its methods of reporting are, of course, mostly millennials.
So as America staggers through this particularly tribal era of its history, the less-than-civil conflict between boomers and millennials, especially the over-educated, over-caffeinated and over-Twittered segment of these two generations, is turning into a dumb-and-dumber thing with a lack of tolerance on both sides.
Meanwhile, just a few miles up the road from Evanston, I was watching representatives of the same two generations react in completely different ways to Eleanor Burgess' "The Niceties," an incendiary 2018 play at Writers Theatre in Glencoe about a college professor (feminist, white, boomer) locked in near-mortal conflict with an undergraduate student (politicized, African American, millennial). Marti Lyons directs Ayanna Bria Bakari as Zoe and Mary Beth Fisher, in a role strikingly similar to the one she originated in Rebecca Gilman's "Spinning into Butter," as Janine.
In essence here, Janine argues for a pluralistic, liberal interpretation of American exceptionalism: This nation's development of a robust constitutional democracy, with a so singular an emphasis on personal freedom, inevitably led to progressive improvement, including the eradication of slavery, its original sin. Zoe, meanwhile, argues that the ideals of the American Revolution were rotten at their core, being so economically dependent on enslaving fellow humans, an inconvenient truth that actually made the revolution both possible and immoral.
Zoe sees race as integral to American history; Janine expresses a weariness at seeing everything through a racial lens and regards that filter as depressing to the commonweal and unhelpful for ambitious young African Americans lucky enough to be at Ivy League schools. Zoe says that to pretend everything in American history is not bound up with race is to participate in a damaging lie. If you have read the New York Times' recent series, and also the critique thereof in Commentary magazine, you will know the debate. And that is what you will be hearing for two hours: in some ways, Zoe and Janine aren't so much characters as arguments.
If that sounds like a familiar set-up, well, sure. You might say "The Niceties" is the progressive revenge for "Oleanna," the David Mamet play (OK, boomer) that once was in almost every theater in the country and now is regarded as too offensive (or too incendiary) by a broad swath of the progressive theatrical establishment ever to produce again. Most of the arty left has come to hate the Mamet play because they regard it as a fake debate play where the writer has stacked the deck and favors the male college professor over his female student (they have a point). The right -- and maybe a few centrist white boomers -- will be similarly infuriated with "The Niceties," also a debate play except no fair judge would say that the college professor is treated with the same sympathy as her student. Touche.
Thus, at the performance I saw on Tuesday night, I watched a couple of millennials react with approval every time Zoe opened her mouth. After intermission, the boomer in front of them started doing the same with Janet. And, since I was staring at the audience, it is necessary to note that quite a few seats were empty after intermission, presumably vacated by sympathizers with one of Janice's lines: "If you make it too difficult to be a good person, you make it surprisingly easy to be a bad person."
Both of the performers in Lyons' production are strong: Bakari has real richness in the role of Zoe and, given that Fisher is experienced when it comes to play smart-but-clueless academics, she's on very solid ground. Lyons' direction is taut and potent; you will be much involved throughout.
Like "Oleanna," "The Niceties" reveals the power of a student to take down a professor, especially if the student has a recording device in her pocket and an eloquence when it comes to articulating a grievance. It's not always easy to believe that Janine would be so injudicious of phrase, given the history, just as Zoe's resistance to benign practical advice seems a self-defeating act from so smart a young woman. But then the play is a device and it relies upon the destruction of a relationship in a couple of office-hour conversations gone terribly wrong.
It is also an Ivy League-y kind of play that comes with a remove from people of both generations and on either side of this debate -- if those people are more worried about schools, kids and surviving economically in a tough time than legislating the value systems of historiography.
But to its credit, "The Niceties" absolutely make you think about the question of the American moment: Is this intergenerational/interracial/interideological civil conflict, a rift so severe as to come with its own language, ideology and mockery, going to calm down once the country recovers from its current nightmare?

In bowing before Trump, Nikki Haley sacrifices Tillerson, Kelly

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - She had it all: A great personal story as a first-generation American, a likable personality, a solid political record, an uncommon ability to hit the ground running with ease and competence, and a golden opportunity that made her a household name and earned her an international reputation.
Then she wrote a book - and blew it.
Nikki Haley, former South Carolina governor - and more recently the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations - sandblasted her carefully crafted facade and, in a transparent act of virtue signaling, stabbed two of her former colleagues and fellow Cabinet members between the shoulder blades. Her return to the public stage can best be described as a goddess ex machina, whereby she descended from the upper realms to dispense wisdom and hurl thunderbolts into the hearts of any who would deny her.
Indeed, for the past several days, Haley and her just-released memoir, "With All Due Respect: Defending America With Grit and Grace," have been the talk of the town. News shows have homed in on a single allegation that seems to have been designed to produce TV teasers about "shocking revelations" - that Rex Tillerson, former secretary of state, and John Kelly, former White House chief of staff, had tried to undermine President Trump and asked Haley to help.
More to the political point, Haley essentially launched her next act - possibly as Donald Trump's vice-presidential running mate (with all due respect to Mike Pence), or as a 2024 presidential candidate. Like clockwork, the president tweeted kudos and encouraged followers to buy the book.
Whatever her ultimate motive, Haley clearly decided that stepping on Tillerson and Kelly was in her political interest. There can have been no other reason to drag these two honorable, accomplished men through the mud for, by her own account, trying to mitigate some of Trump's more-destructive impulses.
Rather than sign on, Haley claims to have been offended by this conspiracy of good intentions. In her book and in several recent television appearances, her halo blindingly bright, Haley has said that Kelly and Tillerson thought they were aiming to "save the country" by attempting end runs around Trump.
They wouldn't have been the only ones, according to last year's anonymous op-ed in The New York Times, in which the author similarly claimed that White House staffers and officials have been trying to save the country by working within which can change in a flash.
The resurfacing of these claims - and the anonymous author's new book - could help explain why good men and women continue to enter this decidedly dysfunctional White House. Being inside the White House may be a better position from which to manage the beast within.
It's a pickle. Do you ignore an immature president and take turns plugging the hole in the dike? (Hey, Haley, we could use some help over here!) Or, do you do everything in your power to avoid actions that might cause the dike to crumble? One thing you don't do, obviously, is confide in an unscrupulous, self-serving, future presidential candidate.
Haley's loyalty to Trump at the expense of Tillerson and Kelly is both a hat-tip to Trump's base and a curtsy to the president. She plainly made a political calculation that people would find "her truth" courageous and that flattery aimed at Trump would not be wasted. "To undermine a president is really a very dangerous thing, and it goes against the Constitution and it goes against what the American people want," Haley intoned during a CBS News interview.
This would be true if said president weren't almost daily threatening to destroy order in the civilized world and didn't behave as though he were checking off the characteristics of narcissistic personality disorder. But there's an inherent irony in banking one's future on preaching loyalty through disloyalty. To what end does such a revelation, if true, warrant such tongue-wagging?
Alas, it seems that Haley bought her own myth and sold it cheap. Through her preening virtue, she has revealed herself to be more Lucy from "Peanuts" than Erin Brockovich - a cartoonish fussbudget stumping for blue ribbons and bows rather than a whistleblower acting in the service of the greater good. Sad.

Texto completo: An animated Santa origin story hits Netflix. And a boxing documentary airs on Showtime.
What's Streaming
KLAUS (2019) Stream on Netflix. The abrupt drop in temperatures across the Eastern United States this week may make this animated Santa origin story uncomfortably relatable, as it is set on an island above the Arctic Circle. The movie centers on Jesper, a mailman voiced by Jason Schwartzman who partners with a hermitlike toymaker named Klaus (J.K. Simmons) to deliver trinkets to children on the island. It is the first feature directed by Sergio Pablos, an animator and screenwriter whose decades-long history working with Disney informs this movie's look. "It all moves along so amiably, and offers such consistently delightful visuals, that the conventional plot points, up to and including an inevitable 'but I can explain' bit, are entirely digestible," Glenn Kenny wrote in his review for The New York Times. "These clichés inhibit 'Klaus' from achieving instant-classic status, but the film is winning enough that it's worth a place in a family Christmas-movie library (not that, as a Netflix offering, it will take up any physical space)."
SNOOPY IN SPACE Stream on Apple TV Plus. For a secular alternative to "Klaus," consider this new animated series with characters from Charles M. Schulz's "Peanuts" comics. Charlie Brown enthusiasts will be glad to hear that, while this story involves space travel and is delivered via Apple's shiny new streaming service, the series sticks to the familiar animation style and jazzy score.
IT COMES AT NIGHT (2017) Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. The 31-year-old director Trey Edward Shults is back in theaters this week with "Waves," an intense family drama set in contemporary Florida. His previous movie, "It Comes at Night," also dealt with family matters -- though it did so in a less recognizable world. The movie centers on a mother and father (played by Carmen Ejogo and Joel Edgerton) who, along with their teenage son (Kelvin Harrison Jr.), hole up in a country house amid an apocalyptic epidemic. The drama ramps up after the arrival of another family. "What happens is both shocking and, in retrospect, brutally inevitable," A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The Times. "'It Comes at Night' is pretty terrifying to sit through, but it may be even scarier after it's over, when you sift through what you've seen and try to piece together what it may have meant."
What's on TV
PARIAH: THE LIVES AND DEATHS OF SONNY LISTON 9 p.m. on Showtime. After the 1962 boxing match in which Sonny Liston defeated Floyd Patterson to become the heavyweight champion of the world, Liston was asked whether or not beating Patterson was as easy as he had expected. "No," The Times quoted Liston as having said. "I thought it would be easier." He was rubbing it in: The victory had come after only two minutes and six seconds of boxing. The famously mysterious fighter's career and eventual premature death are the subjects of this documentary series.

Texto completo: Readers react to the testimony of two senior officials involved in the Ukraine inquiry.
To the Editor:
Re "Envoys Reveal Scope of Trump Ukraine Push" (front page, Nov. 14):
The testimonies of William B. Taylor Jr., the top United States diplomat in Ukraine, and George P. Kent, the State Department's top official on Ukraine policy, in the impeachment hearings of Donald Trump were sobering, credible and revelatory.
President Trump's self-serving political machinations undermined the foreign policy of the United States. That policy, in essence, said to Ukraine, "We stand with you in defense of your freedom and democracy and against Russian aggression, now and always." It is policy that is vital not only to the national security of Ukraine but to ours and to that of all liberal democracies as well.
And weakening that policy is a gift to Vladimir V. Putin in his quest to overcome the humiliation of the collapse of the Soviet Union.
President Trump withheld congressionally appropriated military aid to Ukraine as Ukrainian soldiers were dying on the battlefield. He wanted to coerce the newly elected president of Ukraine to publicly announce an investigation into the 2016 election and the Bidens, as former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. launched his 2020 campaign to defeat Mr. Trump.
Leveraging military aid in exchange for foreign interference in an election is casebook extortion. It is unpatriotic; it is indefensible; and it is wrong. It clearly demonstrated that Donald Trump placed his personal and political interests above those of the country.
And if that does not constitute an impeachable offense, nothing will.

To the Editor:
I've been in the cross hairs of a powerful bully more than once in my life. Watching Republicans "questioning" George P. Kent and William B. Taylor Jr. left me feeling just as I did when those past bullies were bearing down on me. It was their signature dominance display -- that used by any powerful bully intent on abusing his or her power.
This country's task is not only to rid the presidency of Donald Trump; it is also to vote these Republicans out of office. The party is beyond redemption.
Patty Quinn
Philadelphia
To the Editor:
Donald Trump's interactions with Ukraine, and his defense, clearly fit a well-practiced format. He latches onto already discredited charges against the target of his wrath, and then breathes new life into the flimsy charges using the power of the bully pulpit.
Actually uncovering evidence of wrongdoing doesn't seem to be important; fueling innuendo by getting others to publicly announce an "investigation" of some sort seems to be what he's after.
I'll give President Trump credit for being a genius at the art of the smear, as well as a world-class huckster who lives a life of quid pro quo.

To the Editor:
Re "A Return of Old Washington in Defiance of a Raucous Era" (front page, Nov. 14):
Staid, credible and sympathetic, George P. Kent and William B. Taylor Jr. give hope to the half of America that has felt involuntarily expatriated since January 2017. In a just world, they would give hope to both halves of America.
To be in the presence once more of literate, patriotic, emotionally mature professionals was a badly needed balm. If Mr. Kent and Ambassador Taylor are representative of the so-called deep state, this country may yet survive the assault on its values laid out in painful detail.
I rejoice that citizens like them eschew glitzier, more remunerative employment to serve the country, and I long for the day when someone of their ilk again sits behind the Oval Office desk. May these proceedings hasten that day.
David D. Turner
New York
To the Editor:
In the first day of the public impeachment hearings, the opening statement by Devin Nunes, the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, was so vitriolic, cynical and insulting that I almost turned off the TV.
His closing "welcome" to the two witnesses, whom he congratulated for what he called passing their "star chamber audition" held in the basement by the Democrats, was in more than poor taste. It was an insult to the committee, the Constitution and, of course, the witnesses, who did not audition for a part but rather were subpoenaed by Congress for their testimony. Witnesses who, by the way, had better things to do than to take the bait.
Republicans and those who support their flimsy defense of the president should be ashamed. If President Trump can be defended, surely they can make a more civil, reasoned argument.

Volodymyr Zelensky, the interview that got away

Texto completo: The phrase 'quid pro quo' is usually translated as 'something for something.' In the case of President Trump's communications with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, it appears that the 'quo' was supposed to have been a declaration of Zelensky's commitment to undertake investigations into the 2016 election and Joe Biden. The New York Times has reported that a public announcement was set to be made on my CNN program. So I think I owe readers my best understanding of what actually happened.
Ever since Zelensky was elected president in April, my team and I have been interested in having him appear on the show. He is a fascinating political figure, a total outsider who swept into power. I had visited Ukraine several times and interviewed the previous president of the country three times, so I was familiar with the place and had good contacts.
We began the process of establishing connections with the new administration, which was cordial and efficient throughout. Heads of state often find it useful to give interviews around the time of the annual U.N. General Assembly in September, and that was our target.
About a week before the main U.N.-gathering, another major conference was taking place in Kyiv, an annual event that brings together Ukrainian elites with Western politicians, diplomats, intellectuals and journalists. Since I was scheduled to participate, I queried as to whether I could meet with Zelensky to secure the televised interview and get him comfortable with me. His office readily agreed.
On Sept. 13, I met with Zelensky in Kyiv, on the sidelines of the conference. He came across as smart, energetic and with a much sharper feel for politics than you might expect from a neophyte. It was a brief conversation, but we did discuss most of the big issues he faced " Ukraine's relations with Russia and the United States, economic reform and corruption. We also talked about whether he wanted to do the interview in English " which he speaks well " or Ukrainian. I left with the sense that all was well. Zelensky had perhaps seemed a bit distracted, but I assumed that this was because of the many challenges he faced.
It's a testament to Zelensky's skill that he did not let on in any way the immense pressure he was under. As we now know, for months the Trump White House had been mounting an intense campaign to force him to publicly announce the election-related investigations. He had tried to resist and put them off in various ways, but ultimately decided he would have to give in, according to the Times. His team apparently concluded that since he was planning an interview with me anyway, that would be the forum in which he would make the announcement, though neither he nor any of his team ever gave us any inkling that this was their plan. However, after my meeting with him in Kyiv, my team began to discuss potential logistics of the interview with his team " time and place.
But I had not realized how much the ground had already begun to shift before our meeting. On Sept. 5, The Post published an editorial revealing that it had been 'reliably told' that Trump was trying to force Zelensky to investigate Biden. On Sept. 9, four days before my visit to Kyiv, House Democrats initiated an investigation into the allegations. That same day, the intelligence community inspector general notified the House and Senate intelligence committees of the whistleblower complaint. The next day, Sept. 10, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D- Calif.) sent a letter to acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire demanding that he turn over the complaint. That is also the day Trump announced he had fired John Bolton as national security adviser. And then, on Sept. 11, aid to Ukraine was unfrozen with no conditions.
Imagine Zelensky's dilemma. By the time I met with him in Kyiv, he knew the aid had been released, but the backstory had not yet broken into public view. Ukrainian officials I spoke to about the release of the aid were delighted but a little surprised and unsure as to what had happened. Zelensky and his team were probably trying to figure out whether they should still do the interview.
A few days later, on Sept. 18 and 19, The Post broke the story wide open. The interview was called off. We are, of course, still trying to get it.

Tobacco Flavor Bans Multiply, But for Some Blacks, Menthol Continues to Divide

Texto completo: As states and communities rush to ban the sale of flavored tobacco products linked to vaping, Carol McGruder races from town to town, urging officials to include what she calls "the mother lode of all flavors": menthol.
McGruder, co-chair of the African American Tobacco Control Leadership Council, has tried for years to warn lawmakers that menthol attracts new smokers, especially African Americans. Now that more officials are willing to listen, she wants them to prohibit menthol cigarettes and cigarillos, not just ecigarette flavors, to reduce smoking among Blacks.
McGruder and other tobacco control researchers are using the youth vaping epidemic - and the vaping-related illnesses sweeping the country - as an opportunity to take on menthol cigarettes, even though they are not related to the illnesses.
"We started to see that vaping is something that we could leverage in order to deal with this whole menthol issue," said Valerie Yerger, an associate professor of health policy at the University of CaliforniaSan Francisco.
Menthol is a substance found in mint plants that creates a cooling sensation and masks tobacco flavor in both e-cigarettes and cigarettes. Those properties make menthol more appealing to first-time smokers and vapers, even as they pose the same health threats as non-menthol products and may be harder to quit.
Nearly nine out of 10 African American smokers prefer mentholated cigarettes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
But even as tobacco control activists see opportunity, some African Americans, including smokers, fear discrimination. They predict that banning menthol will lead to a surge in illicit sales of cigarettes and result in additional policing in communities that already face tension with law enforcement.
Joseph Paul, director of political and civic affairs at City of Refuge Los Angeles, a church with about 17,000 members in Gardena, Calif., spoke at a board of supervisors meeting in September against a proposed flavor ban in Los Angeles County that was adopted a week later.
If officials truly wanted to end youth vaping, he later told California Healthline, the ordinance should have targeted only vape flavors and exempted adult smokers and their menthol cigarettes.
"Menthol cigarettes are very popular in the Black community, my people smoke menthol cigarettes," he said.
The Los Angeles County ban prohibits sales but not possession of flavored e-cigarette products, menthol cigarettes and chewing tobacco in the unincorporated area of the county, inhabited by about 1 million people. Shops have until April to clear their shelves of flavored tobacco products.
Paul warned that people will start selling menthol cigarettes illegally: "It's supply and demand." That will make the community more vulnerable to police harassment, he said.
In New York City, when officials proposed a ban on menthol cigarettes earlier this year, which has yet to be acted upon, the Rev. Al Sharpton made a similar argument against the measure: Banning menthol would lead to greater tensions with police in Black communities.
"I think there is an Eric Garner concern here," the civil right rights activist told The New York Times in July, referring to the well-known case of a 43year old Black man who died in a chokehold in 2014 while being arrested by New York City police on suspicion of selling single cigarettes.
The flavor bans that are currently sweeping the country have more to do with e-cigarettes than menthol cigarettes.
That's because a mysterious vaping-related illness has sickened more than 1,880 people nationwide and led to at least 37 deaths. In California, at least 150 residents have fallen ill and at least three have died, according to the California Department of Public Health.
Most of those illnesses have been associated with vaping cannabis products, and yet politicians' urge to adopt flavored tobacco bans continues.
In July 2016, Chicago became the first major U.S. city to ban menthol cigarette sales, but it limited the prohibition to within 500 feet of schools.
Of the more than 200 communities in the country that restrict or ban the sale of flavored tobacco, fewer than 60 include restrictions on menthol cigarettes, according to the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids.
Aspen, Colo., will ban all flavored nicotine products, including menthol cigarettes, effective Jan. 1. A few communities in Minnesota already have such bans in place. In California, close to 50 communities restrict or ban flavored tobacco products; of those, more than 30 include restrictions on menthol cigarettes. Notably, San Francisco banned menthol cigarettes along with all flavored tobacco products in 2018, before banning all vapes and e-cigarettes earlier this year.
At the national level, the Food and Drug Administration banned the sale of flavors in combustible cigarettes in 2009, but exempted menthol. Last November, the agency proposed a ban on menthol-flavored combustible cigarettes, calling their use among youths "especially troubling," but it has not yet taken action.
Then the Trump administration said in September it would soon ban all flavored e-cigarette products, but it may now be backing away from banning mint and menthol.
Menthol, which was first added to cigarettes in the 1920s, is as old-school as it gets when it comes to flavored tobacco, yet it hasn't prompted action in the way that vape flavors such as cotton candy and strawberry-melon have. That's because vaping was embraced by a specific population: affluent White teens, Yerger said.
Big Tobacco aggressively pushed menthol cigarettes on Black youths in the 1950s and 60s, and now some people consider Kools and Newports part of Black culture, McGruder said.
McGruder and others point out that the tobacco industry has supported and funded civil rights groups and causes, forming relationships with prominent Black leaders such as Sharpton. Big Tobacco acknowledged that it has contributed to Sharpton's organization, the National Action Network, and similar groups.
McGruder said it's difficult for the African American community to contradict respected male civil rights and religious leaders, so when they argue that menthol bans will lead to criminalization, the community listens.
But Bobby Sheffield, a pastor and vice president of the Riverside County Black Chamber of Commerce, said the criminalization argument is a scare tactic.
"We're not trying to have anyone incarcerated because they have this product in their possession," Sheffield said. His organization, which represents local businesses, started campaigning this year for menthol bans in California's Inland Empire, including the cities of Riverside, San Bernardino and Perris.
Some smokers understand the need to keep tobacco out of the hands of children, but they don't think it's fair to include menthol cigarettes.
"It's stupid. Now they're trying to act like menthol cigarettes are the problem. These have been around for a long time," said April Macklin of Sacramento, who smokes Benson & Hedges menthols. She smoked when she was younger, quit, and started again three years ago.
The city of Sacramento will ban the sale of flavored tobacco, including menthol cigarettes, effective Jan. 1.
Macklin, 53, said she might just quit because she won't smoke anything other than menthol. But even with a ban in place, she doubts menthol cigarettes will be gone for good. "I'm sure people will figure something out," she said.

Texto completo: Jewish Candidates Win Across Region
IN PHILADELPHIA COUNTY and its four surrounding counties - Delaware, Chester, Montgomery and Bucks - a handful of Jewish politicians and judges were either elected or re-elected to public office.
In Bucks County, Judge Jordan Yeager, a Democrat, was elected to the Court of Common Pleas. Linda Bobrin, a Democrat and an attorney, won her race to be the register of wills in Bucks County.
In Montgomery County, Judge Melissa Schwartz Sterling, a Democrat, was elected to the Court of Common Pleas. Lori Schreiber, a Democrat, was elected as the clerk of courts, and Karen GeldSanchez, also a Democrat, won re-election as county controller.
In Philadelphia County, Democrat Allan Domb was re-elected to City Council, and Judge Anne E. Lazarus held her seat on the Superior Court. Judge Joshua Roberts was elected to the Philadelphia Common Pleas Court.
In Chester County, Democrat Marian Moskowitz, a first-time candidate, won a seat on the Board of Commissioners, and Deb Ryan became the first Democratic district attorney in the county's history.
In Delaware County, Stephanie Klein was part of a Democratic sweep of the Court of Common Pleas.
Abramson Senior Care Services Receive "Best" Designations
Two of Abramson Senior Care's services recently received "Best" designations from U.S. News and World Report and Newsweek.
Abramson's short-term rehabilitation locations, Birnhak Transitional Care at Lankenau Medical Center and Birnhak Transitional Care at Horsham, were both named "Best Short-Term Rehab" by U.S. News.
To determine the short-term rehabilitation rankings, U.S. News looks at the care provided to patients staying at a facility for less than 100 days and analyzes a number of quality measures, including staffing, outcomes, resident complaints and processes of care. Nationally, 13,683 facilities received one of three Short-Term Ratings, with 2,250 of those homes earning a High-Performing Rating.
"We are truly fortunate to have hard-working, dedicated employees committed to our mission and a community of Board Trustees, volunteers, and donors to provide guidance and support," said Carol A. Irvine, Abramson Senior Care president and CEO.
Gratz College to Host Alice Hoffman, Jane Eisner at One Book Event
New York Times bestselling author Alice Hoffman will headline the One Book, One Jewish Community kickoff event Nov. 17 at Gratz College.
Gratz selected Hoffman's latest book, "The World That We Knew," as its "one book" for 2019-2020. The author of more than 30 novels, Hoffman will be interviewed by Jane Eisner of Columbia University, a former editor-in-chief of The Forward and a former columnist for The Philadelphia Inquirer.
This event is open to the public, and Hoffman will be available to sign books after the interview.
"This book touches the heart of what we do at Gratz," said Lori Cohen, director of Adult Jewish Learning at Gratz.

Texto completo: There’s a palpable difference between the two factions of the movement to impeach President Trump. House Democrats are determined to reduce his chances of reelection by playing up the nuggets of evidence that hurt him politically. Many in the media are focusing on details that portray Trump's personal character in a bad light. (There is some overlap.)
We saw the difference as the impeachment hearings began on Nov. 13. Democrats made an effort to be orderly and focused on spelling out their case against Trump. The media was looking for tales to bolster the narrative of Trump as a uniquely bad person and corrupt president.

Democrats were stern and calm, starting with Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff. This is why House Speaker Nancy Pelosi made Schiff the master of impeachment and took it away from Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, a somewhat comic figure she feared wouldn’t be able to keep the hearings in order. It was a wise decision.

The press seized on an anecdote disclosed by William Taylor, the acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. An aide had told him of overhearing a phone conversation between Trump and Gordon Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union. It occurred on July 27, the day after the president had spoken by phone to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Trump asked Sondland about “investigations” of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter that he asked Zelensky to pursue. Sondland said the Ukrainians were “ready to move forward,” though they apparently never followed through. And according to Taylor, Sondland told the aide that Trump “cares more about the investigations” of the Bidens than about Ukraine.

This was a “bombshell,” some claimed. But was it? The Washington Post and New York Times featured it across the top of their front pages as if it was. Republicans said it was a secondhand story, thus hearsay. Trump said he had no recollection of the call. “I know nothing about that,” he said.

Sondland, whose lawyer said he would discuss the matter when he testifies before the impeachment committee on Nov. 20, is now a crucial witness. The question is whether he emerges as a John Dean figure. Dean, President Richard Nixon’s White House counsel, testified against him in impeachment hearings in 1974, and his revelations were an important factor in causing Nixon to resign.
Democrats and the media no doubt relish a Dean-like performance. But even if Sondland’s testimony is harmful to Trump, he isn’t nearly as close to the president as Dean was to Nixon. Still, if he confirms the phone call, the gist of the conversation, and his comment to Taylor’s aide, it could be a blow to Trump’s reelection prospects.
The fact that it was Taylor, a West Point graduate and Vietnam veteran, who repeated his aide’s story was significant. He was a strong and seemingly earnest witness. He gave it an air of believability.
The story was fresh, which made it newsworthy. Taylor said he heard of it only five days earlier. The media jumped on it as further evidence of Trump’s pressuring Ukraine to investigate the role the Bidens may, or may not, have played in the country. Military aid to Ukraine was also delayed, at least temporarily.
In giving the slim, uncorroborated story such spectacular billing, the media appears not to have learned any lessons from its overplaying of the Russian collusion issue. They stuck with the narrative that the case for collusion between Trump and Russians in the 2016 election was tightening. But it wasn’t. Special counsel Robert Muller’s investigation found no collusion.
In rebutting the Democratic case for impeachment on Trump’s interference with Ukraine, Republicans emphasize two points. The first is that any threat to halt military aid to Ukraine unless the Bidens were investigated fell apart when the aid was renewed — and they hadn’t investigated the Bidens.

The second point, stressed by GOP House member Jim Jordan, is that Trump did nothing wrong at all in the Ukrainian matter. The delay in approving the aid, which the Ukrainians initially failed to notice, was designed to allow time to assess whether Zelensky is a legitimate reformer, according to Jordan. And the aid was released when he passed that test.

It is the fondest wish of both Democrats and the media that the impeachment hearings cause maximum harm, even if they don't follow the same strategy.

A late-starting presidential campaign may not be hopeless

Texto completo: Michael Bloomberg has just delivered his latest delicious hint about running for president. Eric Holder is fresh from taking credit for the new Democratic legislative majorities in Virginia, making known that he might be interested, too. Former Gov. Deval Patrick is now reported to discern demand for another presidential candidate from Massachusetts.
So this might be a good time to look at some of the patterns in former Democratic presidential nomination contests that might help late entrants.
The first is that opinion sometimes flows very rapidly, sweeping everything in its path, like lava down a volcano, like mud after the collapse of a dam, like the tide ebbing in the Bay of Fundy.
One example goes back to 1984 when Walter Mondale won the Iowa caucuses with 49% in a field of only (only!) eight candidates. It was a fine performance, but all the attention went to Gary Hart, who, with his “new Democrat ideas,” ran second with 16%.
Hart swept New Hampshire 37% to 28%, winning states like Florida and Massachusetts. Only Mondale’s appeal to blue-collar whites — a splinter group among today’s Democrats — helped him recover in Michigan, Illinois, and New York and win the nomination.
Opinion flowed even more inexorably 20 years later. Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, with his unambiguous anti-Iraq War message, attracted huge crowds and led the polls in 2003. On the eve of the caucuses, Des Moines was swarming with "Deaniacs" in their orange stocking caps. But opinion was flowing away from Dean to the long-lagging John Kerry, who beat Dean 38% to 32%. After that, opinion just kept flowing. Kerry lost Vermont, the Carolinas, and Oklahoma but won the rest of the states.
Some years, Democratic opinion doesn’t move much. The same demographic divisions prevailed in the close 2008 and 2016 races. Hillary Clinton got enough support from “beer Democrats” to lead Barack Obama in votes and delegates in primaries, but his support from blacks and “wine Democrats” got him enough caucus wins and superdelegates for the 2008 nomination.
In 2016, the tables turned. Clinton lost “beer Democrats” to Bernie Sanders but won big enough majorities from blacks, Hispanics, and “wine Democrats” to take the nomination. This year, the hold of any candidate on these groups seems weak enough that a late entrant might dare hope that opinion may flow lava-like to them.
Moreover — and this is my second point — “wine Democrats” may be numerous enough now to be analyzed as two demographic segments. Elizabeth Warren's and Bernie Sanders's big-government promises have attracted many white college graduates. But polling suggests they are “jug wine” folks — I refer to teachers and social workers with grad school degrees entitling them to public employee union wage increases and millennial thirty-somethings still hoping to find themselves.
That may leave the “champagne Democrats” up for grabs. In 2016, Sanders got more votes than Clinton from whites, but she handily carried the highest income communities — Manhattan and Greenwich, Connecticut; New Trier Township in suburban Chicago; Lincoln and Lexington, Massachusetts; Grosse Pointe and Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. Sanders’s bland approval of 70% tax rates probably hurt him there, and Elizabeth Warren’s wealth tax may hurt her even more. This leaves an obvious possible opening for a newcomer.
The third opening for late entrants could be black voters. Current polling shows Joe Biden, Barack Obama’s vice president, leading among blacks. But Holder, as Obama’s self-described “wingman,” has a claim on that credential. He or Patrick might enthuse the many black voters whom Cory Booker and Kamala Harris have failed to stir.
More important perhaps is the fact that black voters, with their above-average religious ties, currently say they’re “less liberal” than most white Democrats on many cultural issues, including supposed racial issues. As Columbia undergraduate (and rap performer) Coleman Hughes and New York Times blogger (and veteran political reporter) Thomas Edsall both report, younger blacks are more concerned about jobs than climate change and believe that individual behavior more than societal racism is holding many blacks back. Reparations are not their thing, and they’re the demographic group least supportive of same-sex marriage and transgender rights.
Traditionally, blacks have voted almost unanimously for one candidate, a rational strategy for voters who see themselves as part of a group subject to systematic discrimination and disrespect. But there’s evidence — Bernie Sanders holding Hillary Clinton to 65% of black votes in Michigan in 2016 and recent polls showing young black men significantly less Democratic than their elders — suggesting that such unanimity may be outmoded, as blacks’ incomes surge upward and overt discrimination becomes less and less common.
So a late-starting presidential campaign may not be hopeless — maybe not even for Hillary Clinton.

Scott Hapgood case: 4 things we don’t know

Texto completo: Scott Hapgood, the 44-year-old UBS banker from Darien, has been accused of killing Anguillan hotel worker Kenny Mitchel.
Mitchel showed up at the Hapgood’s hotel room with a knife, demanding money, according to the Hapgood family’s account of the incident.
A fight ensued, and Mitchel died about an hour later. Hapgood was charged with manslaughter.
Hapgood, who returned to the United States after making bail in Anguilla, refused this month to return to the Caribbean Island for his latest court appearance and is now considered a fugitive.
Here are four things that remain unknown about the Hapgood case.
1. Will the U.S. protect Hapgood from extradition?
One day after Hapgood’s missed hearing, an arrest warrant was being sought in Anguilla and he was labeled a “fugitive.”
Hapgood has reportedly been threatened since returning to Connecticut, and the family said his life would be in danger it he returned to face authorities in Anguilla.
His defense team notified officials on the Caribbean island the night before that they advised their client to not return, Anguillan Attorney General Dwight Horsford said.
“The letter further stated that this advice rested on concerns for their client’s safety and the fairness of the judicial process in Anguilla,” Horsford wrote in a statement released Tuesday. “Both concerns are totally groundless.”
Anguilla, as a territory of Great Britain, is subject to an extradition treaty between the U.S, as the Washington Post reported, but it is not known yet if politicians will intervene to prevent Hapgood’s extradition.
In October, Hapgood’s wife, Kallie, appeared on Fox & Friends to ask President Donald Trump to intervene on her husband’s behalf.
“I’ve seen Trump help Americans around the globe and we really need his help,” Kallie Hapgood said on the show.
Trump responded on Twitter: “Something looks and sounds very wrong. I know Anguilla will want to see this case be properly and justly resolved!”
Sen. Richard Blumenthal was among about 100 people who gathered last month, rallying support for Hapgood outside of Darien Town Hall and, last week, Blumenthal and other federal lawmakers — including Sens. Chris Murphy and Lindsey Graham, and U.S. Rep. Jim Himes — sent a letter to Secretary of State Michael Pompeo to express their concerns for Hapgood’s “safety and fair treatment.”
2. Why did hotel workers wait 45 minutes to call police?
According to the Hapgood family’s account, Mitchel and Hapgood fought in the family’s hotel room. Hapgood, once a football player in Darien, subdued and restrained the 27-year-old hotel worker.
It took 45 minutes for police to arrive.
Mitchel was later taken to the hospital where he was pronounced dead, but the reason for the delay is unknown.
Photos ostensibly taken immediately after the scuffle, shared by the Hapgood family, show the Connecticut banker with cuts and abrasions to his face.
3. Did Hapgood’s children give a statement to police?
Kallie Hapgood said she was not present when Mitchel came to the door, but that two of her children were present for the entire fight.
Hapgood was arrested and charged with manslaughter, which makes the children the only witnesses to the fight.
Were they interviewed by police? Hapgood did retain the services of an attorney on the Caribbean island, and it’s possible that his three children, being minors, were shielded from police interviews.
If they did provide statements to police, what they recalled has not been made public.
4. Did Hapgood and Mitchel cross paths before the fight?
Toxicology reports obtained by The New York Times showed that Mitchel had a significant amount of cocaine in his bloodstream, more than what is commonly considered a lethal dose.
That resulted in a revised autopsy report, suggesting Mitchel might have died from cocaine misuse instead of the trauma sustained during the fight as was initially reported by Anguillan medical officials.
Mitchel came to the Hapgoods’ hotel room wearing a hotel uniform, saying he was there to fix a broken sink, according to the family.
He then allegedly pulled a knife and demanded money.
Hapgood has said no sink was broken in their hotel room, so what drew Mitchel to the Hapgoods’ room is unknown.
Mitchel was a hotel employee, and it is unknown how Hapgood may have come to his attention before the incident.
Media reports suggested that the Hapgoods were one of only a few guests at the resort at the time.

Gen X was first to blame it all on boomers

Texto completo: Looking at history, the young and old have rarely respected each other.
Socrates kvetched about kids' "disrespect for elders," as did the Old Testament. You wouldn't have to command children to "honor thy father and thy mother" if it came naturally.
But today, a shocking new tactic has been deployed in the timeless war between generations. As baby boomers impugn millennials' addiction to avocado toast or Gen Z's worries about staggering college debt, the youth dismiss it with a casual retort: "OK, boomer."
The phrase has popped up on social media for months, but this week it hit the big-time with long dissertations in The New York Times and the Washington Post.
"There's not much I can personally do to undo political corruption or fix Congress," 18-year-old college student Nina Kasman said. "It's mostly old white men boomers who don't represent the majority of generations."
To her credit, Kasman is making coin on the issue, selling "OK, boomer" merch on the internet.
Those "old white men" aren't taking it lying down. A New York radio host claimed that "'boomer' is the n-word of ageism. Being hip and flip does not make bigotry OK, nor is a derisive epithet acceptable because it is new."
The 60-year-old's tweet went viral and earned approximately eleventy billion responses of "OK, boomer."
Blaming the post-WWII generation for all the world's ills is nothing new. Gen Xers like myself pioneered the technique in the '90s only to watch millennials and Gen Zers co-opt it for their own cohorts.
They're even using the same arguments. We're the first generation to have a lower quality of life than the generation before, college is too expensive and the climate is going to kill us. Yadda, yadda, yadda.
It stings a bit to see my generation skipped over, but we haven't yet had the chance to lead. Every president since Clinton has been a boomer, as are the main contenders for the Democratic primary. Actually, Bernie is pre-boomer, born before Pearl Harbor was bombed and socialism was discredited.
Of course, defining an entire generation by their caricatures is always overbroad. Plenty of hippie-era college kids voted for Nixon, just as many Gen Xers didn't wear three layers of flannel and listen to grunge. (I preferred shoegaze.) The mass culture these groups spawned, however, helps define them in aggregate.
After the Greatest Generation survived the Great Depression and returned from a bloody world war, they sought a quiet sanctuary in suburbia, sparing their kids such pain. The boomers decided such a life was boring and inauthentic, and tried to replace it with a Summer of Love to usher in the Age of Aquarius. It didn't go so well.
Gen X was sold the boomers' failed utopia throughout our youth but never bought it. Our childhood was infused with the wreckage wrought by hippies and yuppies. Draft dodgers and dead rock stars were lifted up as idols while our kiddie shows toggled between LSD trips and eco-apocalypse.
We watched the failure of the War on Poverty — not to mention our broken homes. It didn't make us cynical as much as skeptical; institutions were expected to fail more than they succeeded, and we acted accordingly.
So, when these millennial and Gen-Z whippersnappers blame everything on the olds, remember that Gen X was there first. You don't get to right all the wrongs until we've had our chance to fix things. Or just screw it up in a new way.
Once your kids have the chance to mutter "OK, X-er" at our policies, then you can have your shot. In the meantime, get off our lawns.

Texto completo: The coveted Cortaca Jug will boldly go where it has never gone before.
Neither Jim Butterfield Stadium nor SUNY Cortland Stadium will host the annual game between Ithaca College and SUNY Cortland this season.
The Division III football rivals with campuses about 20 miles apart in central New York are hitting the road this year to play at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.
Kickoff is 1 p.m. Saturday.
Here are 10 things to know about the Cortaca Jug:
It'll be a record The largest crowd to see a Division III football game is 37,355. That happened Sept. 23, 2017, when Minnesota rivals St. Thomas and St. John's played at Target Field, home of the Minnesota Twins.
As of about two weeks ago, more than 42,500 tickets had been sold for the Cortaca Jug, Ithaca College Athletic Director Susan Bassett said.
"We've probably expanded a lot of peoples' imagination at this point," Bassett said. "For Division III to have this kind of showcase and this type of interest, everyone thinks it's all about professional sports and Division I sports, but this really sets the bar for interest in Division III athletics."
Doing the math Ithaca and Cortland have been playing for the Jug since 1959, with the Bombers holding a 37-24 lead in Jug games.
But their first football game came in 1930, a 12-0 Cortland victory.
They played 16 times before the first Cortaca Jug. Ithaca leads the overall series, 41-33-3.
The teams played twice in 1988, the Red Dragons winning the Cortaca Jug game, 21-20. Three weeks later they met in an NCAA quarterfinal and the Bombers won, 24-17.
It's more than football Ithaca will be sending 16 buses to New Jersey, many carrying student spectators as well as others who participate in the event.
The Bombers' choir will sing the national anthem, cheer teams will accompany both teams, Ithaca's West African Drumming and Dance Ensemble will perform and students from IC's school of sports management will organize pre-game events
"It's beyond this being a football game," Bassett said. "There are multiple ways people are involved. It's multi-faceted and comprehensive."
Media interest Cortland AD Mike Urtz said he's done interviews with the New York Times and Forbes Magazine in the lead up to the game.
"Our campus is getting unbelievable exposure," he said. "This is probably my fourth interview. When you look at the free marketing and free branding for both institutions, it's been incredible."
Local talent Ithaca is in Section 4 boundaries and Cortland is just outside, and both teams' rosters include players from nearby.
The Bombers' top receiving threat is Owego graduate Will Gladney, a senior who leads the team with 60 receptions, 811 yards and 12 touchdowns.
On the defensive side, Greene graduate John Hadac, a senior lineman, has a team-best 61/2 sacks among his 41 tackles and one forced fumble.
Junior defensive back Khiry Brown, an Ithaca High graduate, has 28 tackles, two interceptions and five pass break-ups.
For Cortland, senior linebacker Dylan Studer, a Chenango Forks graduate, has 21 tackles.
Others from Section 4 are freshman quarterback Joe Mack (Dryden), sophomore linebacker Trey Floyd (Tioga), freshman offensive lineman Dylan Houseknecht (Odessa-Montour), sophomore offensive lineman Daquan Griffin (Ithaca) and junior receiver Ky'Sawn Veale (Norwich).
Cortland's head coach is Dan MacNeill, a Walton graduate.
Downstate interest Bassett and Urtz said a major reason ticket sales have been so brisk is the large number of downstate graduates from both schools.
"The alumni gatherings to watch the game down in the city, they were getting larger and larger," Urtz said. "Within the last two years, there were two bar/restaurants in New York City somewhere, one of them hosted Cortland and the other hosted Ithaca and they were across the street and they each had more than 1,000 people just to watch the game. I knew we were going to have a pretty good draw."
Tickets They're still available, plenty of them. If you're looking to go and you're a fan of perusing online ticket sites such as stubhub or ticketmaster, you can find tickets for as low as $20 or as expensive as $500.
Might happen again Bassett said given the interest this year's game has drawn, she wouldn't be surprised if the Cortaca Jug returned to the NYC area in the future.
"We look at this as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity," Bassett said. "At some point is it possible our campus leadership would say, 'Let's do this every four years and we'll alternate who the host team is.' I just have no idea. We haven't gotten that far yet. We're so focused on this experience.
"If you had a couple years to plan, I think this would be so much easier for everybody, but this is all coming together nicely."
What can you bring If you're heading to the game, here's what you can bring:
Clear bags that are 12-by-6-by-12 inches or less in size (one bag per person); small purses/handbags (clutch-type bags) that are 41/2-by-61/2 or less in size (one per person); food of any kind that is contained in a clear plastic bag; plastic bottles of water or soft drinks that are 20 ounces or less; cameras with a lens that is 6 inches or less in length; jackets, blankets or other items, which will be patted down or searched; official national flags that can reasonably be hand held by a single person.
What can't you bring Don't bring these items:
Seat cushions of any size except those for medical needs; glass bottles, cans, coolers of any kind, thermoses or ice chests; alcohol of any kind; banners of any size; flags that are not the official flag of a country; umbrellas, strollers, laser pointers and balls of any kind; video cameras or still photography cameras with a lens longer than six inches; selfie sticks; weapons or any item that may be used as a projectile or one that is deemed dangerous by stadium management; any animal aside from service animals; any item deemed inappropriate by stadium management.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg has shot to the top of the field in Iowa, according to a poll released Tuesday.
The Monmouth University poll found that Buttigieg is the favored candidate of 22% of respondents in the first in the nation nominating contest. Former Vice President Joe Biden was next with 19%, but within the 4.6 percentage point margin of error. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren was at 18% and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders at 13%. All other Democratic presidential candidates received single-digit support in the survey.
But the survey results suggest that the race is still fluid; less than one-third of respondents said they are firmly set on their choice.
Buttigieg's support has grown since Monmouth's August survey, where he was at 8%. Biden, meanwhile, has ticked down since the summer, when he was the pick of 26% of Monmouth respondents.
The results are based on 451 Iowans likely to participate in the state's Democratic caucus.
Pundits have said Buttigieg is positioned to contend in Iowa, a mostly white Midwestern state. They have cautioned his continuing struggle in South Carolina, a state with a larger African American population, might be more noteworthy.
Buttigieg has had a sometimes bumpy relationship with African Americans in South Bend, most recently thrust into the spotlight when a white police officer shot a black man wielding a knife in the summer.
Still, Buttigieg has been surging in Iowa since his breakout performance at the October Democratic debate. The Iowa State University/Civiqs poll released Oct. 24 showed him in second place to Warren, and the New York Times/Siena College poll released Nov. 1 placed him third behind Warren and Sanders.
Perhaps showing the volatility of the race, both of those polls had Biden trailing in fourth place.
Buttigieg also is making up ground in New Hampshire, though pundits say he will have a harder time winning that New England state in the backyards of Biden, Warren and Sanders.
Buttigieg has recently performed well in early state polling. A Quinnipiac poll in New Hampshire had the Democratic hopeful holding his own with 15% of support, against Biden at 20%, Warren at 16% and Sanders at 14%. Sanders won that primary in 2016.
A recent USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll conducted nationally also found Buttigieg within striking distance of Biden, Warren and Sanders.
South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg has shot to the top of the field in Iowa, according to a poll released Tuesday.

Empathy is good, but what if you care too much?

Texto completo: There's a cost to caring too much.
Two prominent mental health counselors – a resilience expert at an Ivy League college and a megachurch pastor – died by suicide in September. At the 2017 U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation's Health Means Business summit, Arianna Huffington, sleep evangelist and author of "The Sleep Revolution: Transforming Your Life, One Night at a Time," said people who toil in the charitable space often have the most trouble detaching from work and, well, going to bed.
Meanwhile, Justin Phillips, a mother who lost her son to a drug overdose, is trying to start the #chooseempathy movement. She founded Overdose Lifeline to raise awareness that addiction is not a choice and requires empathetic responses.
Dr. Judith Orloff, a psychiatrist and self-described empath, agrees society needs more empathy given the rising rates of addiction, suicide and mental illness, among other challenges. But she cautions those who choose to be empathic – or find it comes naturally – about the need to care for themselves first. The New York Times best-selling author's new book, "Thriving as an Empath: 365 Days of Self-Care for Sensitive People" (Sounds True publishing), is now in stores. Here, she talks with USA TODAY health policy reporter Jayne O'Donnell, who calls herself an "overempathizer."
Question: How do you know if you are an empath? What are the character traits?
Dr. Judith Orloff: Ordinary empathy is the ability to feel someone else's pain as well as their joy, the ability for us to be open-hearted. It's such a beautiful trait. Being an empath, however, goes further. Empaths have extremely sensitive neurological systems and don't have the usual filters that other people have, so they feel things intensely and often are emotional sponges who take on other people's stress if they don't learn how to set boundaries and practice other self-care techniques ... Most empaths are introverts like myself, but some are extroverts who love socializing but still need to decompress afterwards to take care of themselves.
As part of my research on empaths, I developed a 20-question self-assessment test in my earlier book, "The Empath's Survival Guide," to determine if you are an empath. Some of the questions include: Have I been labeled as overly sensitive? (in a derogatory way). Do crowds drain me, and do I need a lot of alone time to replenish myself? Do I take on other people's stress or emotions? Do I replenish myself in nature? Am I super-sensitive to noise, smells and excessive talking?
Empaths have many special challenges and also many gifts.
Q: There's a clear need for more empathy in our country, isn't there?
Orloff: I believe empathy is the most precious trait in human nature. We need more of it in our country and in the world. Empathy is the ability to put yourself in someone else's shoes so you can see their point of view. Empathy is so powerful because it opens our hearts. It allows us to try to understand another person's position, even if we don't particularly like them or if we disagree on an issue. This gives us the best chance of successfully communicating with them and resolving differences.
Q: But there are risks in caring too much, aren't there?
Orloff: Yes, I've seen many of my patients, including empaths and all sensitive people, care too much and become burned out by empathy overload – or get involved with addictions, including substances, food and sex to numb themselves out. In my psychotherapy practice, there has been an epidemic of empathic patients consulting me who are exhausted, anxious, depressed and overwhelmed by added stress in their personal lives, which is aggravated by our world's non-stop stress.
Arianna Huffington reports that over two-thirds of doctors in the U.S. say they are burned out, depressed or both! Plus the general suicide rate in our country just keeps going up. Those in the helping professions have trouble turning stress off so they also tend to experience impaired sleep and increased anxiety.
Q: What are the most effective ways for empaths to establish boundaries?
Orloff: Taking adequate alone time is essential to decompress. When my empath patients go nonstop in their jobs or as parents – without periodically slowing down – they risk chronic exhaustion, anxiety and overwhelm. Scheduling mini-breaks in your life to take a few deep breaths, spending some quiet time without phone calls, demands or over-stimulation, taking a walk or meditating for even a few minutes will break the momentum of stress and prevent sensory overload. Also I teach all my patients that "no is a complete sentence."
Q: Shouldn't we all try to be better listeners and responders to those going through hard times?
Orloff: Being a caring listener is one of the great empathic gifts we can give others. But we don't have to listen for hours on end to be effective. Giving someone your caring attention for five to 10 minutes can be very potent, as opposed to getting hooked into repetitive two-hour phone conversations that wear you out. "I love you and I will be thinking of you" is a wonderful thing to say after responding to the person for a limited time. Also, I recommend having short check-ins with the person. A technique I suggest in "Thriving as an Empath" is the "3 Minute Phone Call." This is when you tell the person you're available for this period of time and you want to support them.
As an empathic person, you adore giving, but what I hope my book will provide you with are strategies to give in healthy ways – but also practice self-care so you can be a balanced, happy person.

Plague Diagnosis in China Prompts National Warning

Texto completo: Two cases of the fatal and highly infectious illness, which is related to bubonic plague, were found in Beijing, prompting fears of an outbreak.
BEIJING -- Two people in China were diagnosed with plague, setting off a panic on Tuesday about the potential spread of the highly infectious and fatal disease and prompting China's government to warn citizens to take precautions to protect themselves.
Beijing officials said the two infected people came from Inner Mongolia, a sparsely populated region of northern China. They sought treatment on Tuesday in a hospital in Beijing's Chaoyang District, where they were diagnosed with pneumonic plague, according to the government office of the district.
The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention said on Weibo, the microblogging site, that there was no need for Beijing residents to panic and that the risks of further transmission are "extremely low." The authorities quickly isolated the patients, conducted epidemiological investigations on the people who could have been exposed and disinfected all the relevant sites, the CDC said. They have also strengthened monitoring of patients with fever, it added.
Pneumonic plague is one of three types of infectious disease known as plague caused by the same bacterium, Yersinia pestis. Patients diagnosed with pneumonic plague, which causes high fevers and shortness of breath, sometimes first contract the closely related and more well-known disease, bubonic plague.
Fears are mounting in China over a possible outbreak of the disease, once known as the Black Death, which killed tens of millions of people in medieval Europe, and spread through Asia and Africa.
Last month, the authorities in China said they would strengthen quarantine measures to prevent plague from entering the country after Madagascar was struck by a fast-spreading outbreak of the disease. It is unclear when the cases were first detected in China but residents are asking why the authorities took so long to diagnose and disclose the problem.
Li Jifeng, a doctor at Beijing Chaoyang Hospital where the two people sought treatment, wrote on WeChat, a social media platform, that the patients sought treatment on Nov. 3. That post, which has since been deleted, was published by CN-Healthcare, a website that covers health care news in China. Dr. Li could not be reached for comment and Beijing Chaoyang Hospital declined to comment.
Dr. Li wrote that the patient she saw was a middle-aged man, who had a fever and complained of breathing difficulties for 10 days. He sought treatment at a hospital in Inner Mongolia but his condition did not improve. His wife also developed a fever and respiratory problems.
"After so many years of specialist training, I'm familiar with the diagnosis and treatment of most respiratory diseases," wrote Dr. Li. "But this time, I looked and looked at it. I couldn't guess what pathogen caused this pneumonia. I only knew it was rare."
On why the authorities took so long to make the announcement, Dr. Li wrote that signs of any infectious disease need to be repeatedly verified and investigated, and such announcements cannot be "transmitted casually."
The police quarantined the emergency room in the Chaoyang Hospital on Monday night, the news outlet Caixin reported, citing residents.
On Tuesday, Chinese censors instructed online news aggregators in China to "block and control" online discussion related to news about the plague, according to a directive seen by The New York Times.
Skeptical Chinese internet users have charged the government with being slow to disclose news about the disease, which is transmitted between humans and kills even faster than the more-common bubonic form. China has a history of covering up and being slow to announce infectious outbreaks, prompting many people to call for transparency this time.
"The plague is not the most terrifying part," one user wrote on Weibo. "What's even scarier is the information not being made public."
If left untreated, pneumonic plague is always fatal, according to the World Health Organization. But recovery rates are high if detected and treated with antibiotics, within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms, the agency said.
Another user on Weibo called on the government to disclose how the patients arrived in Beijing from Inner Mongolia. If the patients traveled on their own using public transportation they could have spread the disease to many people.
"How many people have they encountered potentially?" the user wrote. "Only 2 kilometers away from Chaoyang Hospital. I'm shaking and trembling."
According to China's health commission, six people have died in the country from the plague since 2014. The most recent case was recorded earlier this year.
Officials have warned people to avoid traveling to infected areas and contact with rodents.
Elsie Chen and Zoe Mou contributed research.

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
One secret to reporting that you don't hear much about is the role of dumb luck.
In July, I began to report an article about touch and consent in yoga. The idea was to learn more about the egregious conduct of Krishna Pattabhi Jois, the guru who made Ashtanga and vinyasa yoga popular before his death in 2009 at 93.
But I also wanted to look at the contemporary yoga world. As a devoted yogi myself, I know the yoga studio remains a place where some teachers, even well-intentioned ones, think they have permission to touch you with impunity just because you have walked in the door and unrolled a mat.
Under the guise of adjustments -- the term for using hands to help a student get into a pose or to show support -- some teachers are (often unwittingly) triggering confusion, anxiety and even real emotional trauma for students.
I hoped to tap into the conversation that is just starting to take place among yogis about what is and isn't acceptable and what changes they wish for.
Since my reporting was also going to be featured in an episode of "The Weekly," I knew I would need visually interesting alternatives to just making dozens of calls from my desk.

The hands-on teaching practices of some of yoga's most celebrated gurus raise questions about consent.
I proposed that we attend a class at a yoga festival, where we could avail ourselves of a large pool of students and teachers.
Poking around the internet, I quickly spotted the Asheville Yoga Festival in North Carolina. The mid-July timing was perfect for our production schedule. The southeastern location would add geographic diversity to my reporting.
On the festival's schedule, I saw a four-hour workshop called "Inversions and Adjustments." Adjustments were becoming a focal point of my story, and the workshop would be led by a well-known teacher named Jonny Kest. It was a no-brainer.
I had never taken a class taught by Mr. Kest before, but I had practiced at his studio in Birmingham, Mich., half a dozen times over the years when visiting relatives in Michigan. And while I knew he had a hard-core following who liked his hands-on approach to teaching, I didn't really know what that meant.
As I took part in his workshop -- with a producer, camerawoman and sound engineer from "The Weekly" looking on -- I quickly learned. Mr. Kest was demonstrating the most hands-on adjustments I had ever seen.
One that particularly raised my eyebrow was performed on a woman doing a pose commonly known as "Triangle." Mr. Kest lunged one leg around the woman's leg and wrapped an arm around her from behind, placing his palm between her collar bone and breast.
"You want to be careful of the spots that you want to stay away from," he said and then moved his hand a few inches.
I almost couldn't believe what I was witnessing, and I certainly couldn't believe a camera from The New York Times's television show was recording it. But I wasn't sure how it would translate to a viewer. Without context, someone unfamiliar with yoga could think that this is a standard way for a yoga teacher to touch a student, which it was not.
But before the yoga session ended, something took place that was unlike anything I have experienced in my 20 years as a reporter: My story came to life right in front of my eyes, right in front of my notebook, right in front of the television camera for "The Weekly."
Mr. Kest demonstrated another adjustment. This one involved him placing a woman's behind on his lap, spreading her legs apart and wrapping them around his waist.
After he showed how to do this, he asked the class participants to practice the adjustment with a partner. That's when Catherine Derrow, a yoga teacher from Columbus, Ohio, approached Mr. Kest and quietly told him that she would be upset if a teacher touched her in such a way, especially without telling her what he was going to do and asking her permission. "I would be very surprised," she said.
Mr. Kest encouraged Ms. Derrow to share her concerns with the whole class. She did so and what ensued was a spirited conversation among Mr. Kest and many students in the class about their preferred ways of being asked for consent before being adjusted in yoga classes. "I don't do any of that," Mr. Kest told them.
After the workshop concluded, I met with Jamila Wignot, my producer, and we asked each other several times, dumbstruck, "Did that actually just happen?"
Some yoga teachers like to say the most important part of your practice is simply showing up on the mat. In this case, that was true for journalism, too.

Texto completo: A Russian doping scandal could force organizers of next year's continental soccer championship to bar Russia's team and move matches scheduled for St. Petersburg.
KATOWICE, Poland -- Buried on page 49 of a dry procedural document published by the World Anti-Doping Agency last year is a paragraph that threatens to be a major headache for the organizers of next summer's European soccer championship.
The monthlong tournament, Europe's quadrennial continental championship, is set to be a celebration of soccer on the continent, played for the first time in multiple countries, with games spread from Dublin and Glasgow in the west to Bucharest and Baku in the east. But because of a little-discussed rules change by WADA, the event -- already a far trickier logistical exercise than any previous tournament -- could be forced into changing its hosting requirements because of the continuing fallout of a Russian doping scandal.
The European Championship is expected to be the first major international event that will be affected by penalties the World Anti-Doping Agency now looks almost certain to impose on Russia after its investigators unearthed evidence that Russian authorities manipulated thousands of athlete records in an effort to cover up positive drug tests.
As well as seeing its teams and athletes being barred from international sports competitions, Russia would -- under tougher WADA penalties -- be forbidden from hosting events run by organizations bound by the rules of the global antidoping regulator. That group includes UEFA, European soccer's governing body, and that has put in doubt both the participation of Russia's national team, which qualified for the tournament in October, and the role of St. Petersburg, which is scheduled to serve as the host city for three group-stage games and a quarterfinal.
Twelve European cities are scheduled to host games in the tournament, with the final and both semifinals set to be played in London.
The problem for UEFA is that under Section 11 of WADA's compliance code, organizers of international sporting events must "assess whether it is legally and practically possible to withdraw that right and reassign the event to another country."
WADA's executive body is set to meet to make a final decision about Russia's potential punishment at a meeting on Dec. 9. If a ban on Russia and its athletes is confirmed, Russia would have 21 days to file an appeal to sports' top court, the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne, Switzerland. CAS would have the final say, and its determination is likely to be made months before Euro 2020 kicks off in June, according to several European sports officials familiar with the matter.
A spokesman for UEFA declined to comment on the status of Russia or St. Petersburg in relation to the European Championship, but other officials at the organization confirmed UEFA is monitoring events.
Yuri Ganus, the head of Russia's antidoping agency, has called a possible ban on Russia and its athletes "the biggest crisis" since a state-supported cheating scandal was first exposed in 2015. Ganus, who leads the Russian antidoping agency, said last month that he expected WADA to issue Russia a ban of at least three years, which also means it will be unable to send a team to next summer's Tokyo Olympics.
Jonathan Taylor, the British lawyer responsible for the committee that will recommend what action should be taken against Russia, updated WADA's executive board on the investigation during meetings in Poland this week. In September, when details emerged that Russia had manipulated the data it supplied to WADA investigators, Taylor told The New York Times that Russian officials there would need to "pull a rabbit out of the hat" to provide a credible explanation for discrepancies in the data.
Since then, little has changed, and senior Russian officials have sparred over the country's guilt. While Ganus said he was sure that information from an athlete database stored at the Moscow laboratory at the center of the cheating scandal had been changed, the country's sports minister was quoted in Russian news media reports saying that wasn't true.
The 2015 cheating scandal loomed over preparations for the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics, and exposed fissures between the antidoping community and the global sports movement. The International Olympic Committee voted against WADA's recommendation to bar Russia from those Games and instead allowed individual sports federations to decide whether Russian athletes could participate in their events.
That chaos prompted WADA to change its compliance rules, and to take the decision-making power away from the I.O.C. and the dozens of sports federations that signed up to abide by WADA's rules. Under the new guidelines, all signatories must comply with the penalties imposed by WADA.
Russia's responses to 31 questions sent by WADA's investigators have so far not changed investigators' opinion that the changes to the database they uncovered were deliberate. That does not mean Russia hasn't tried. Officials who have seen Russia's response said this week that in addition to answering the questions, the Russian authorities also created what was described as a comic book and a film to try to make their case.
For UEFA, the preparations for Euro 2020 continue. The plans most likely will come into sharper focus on Nov. 30, when a draw to place the 24 qualified teams into four-team pools is held.

The Upshot: Challenges of red economies (like Provo) are different from blue economies (like San Francisco)

Texto completo: At a quick glance, red and blue metropolitan areas are performing equally well on average in the most watched indicators of labor market health.
Employment growth in the year ending in the first quarter of 2019 was 1.4% in both Democratic-leaning and Republican-leaning metro areas, and the unemployment rate in both types of places is roughly equivalent.
Silicon Valley (blue) is booming. So is Provo, Utah (red).
But below the surface, red and blue local economies are worlds apart on enduring, fundamental measures that determine their future prospects and their biggest economic challenges.
The correlations between deeper economic measures and how the contrasting metro areas voted in 2016 are striking.
In bluer metros, more residents have college degrees: The 10 large metros with the highest educational attainment each voted for Hillary Clinton by at least a 10-point margin. Median household incomes are higher in bluer metros even after adjusting for the cost of living, which is higher in bluer metros as well. (Metro area is a better measure for a local labor market than a neighborhood, city, county or state.)
And bluer metros have a more favorable job mix for the future, with fewer manufacturing jobs, a higher share of harder-to-automate “nonroutine” jobs, and a higher share of jobs in occupations projected to grow faster.
These measures — education, household income, cost of living, non-routine jobs and projected job growth — are highly correlated with one another, and with voting Democratic.
Other economic measures are less strongly correlated with partisanship but still show a pattern. Bluer metros have less year-to-year volatility of job growth. In part that’s because goods-related sectors like manufacturing and mining are more volatile and are clustered in Republican-leaning areas.
(Overall, red America did a bit better in 2018, as manufacturing and other goods-producing sectors led job growth, while blue America has seen slightly bigger gains in 2019.)
Home values have risen more in bluer metros than in redder ones. And blue metros have a higher prime-age employment-population ratio, even though the unemployment rate varies little by partisanship. That’s because red metros have a higher share of prime-age adults who are not in the labor force and therefore aren’t counted in the unemployment rate.
But there are a few places that vote differently than you’d expect from their local economic fundamentals. Colorado Springs, Colorado, and the Provo-Orem area, for instance, have education levels and an occupation mix more typical of blue metros but voted for Donald Trump in 2016 by a wide margin. On the flip side, Stockton, California, and El Paso, Texas, look more like red metros economically but voted for Clinton.
Why do some metros vote differently than their economics might suggest they would? Race, ethnicity and religion. Metros that vote Democratic despite having lower education and a job mix more typical of redder metros tend to have large Hispanic populations, including many in inland California and on the Texas border. Metros that vote more Republican despite having higher education and a blue-metro job mix tend to be whiter. (Colorado Springs also has a large evangelical population, and Provo-Orem a large Mormon one.)
Although most economic fundamentals look better in bluer metros, national economic confidence is higher among Republicans. And people who are upbeat about the national economy tend to be upbeat about their local economy. But once you account for personal political views, local economic confidence is higher in blue metros than in red metros. That means Republicans in blue metros have the highest levels of local economic confidence.
Moreover, redder metros have their own advantages, especially for people in certain economic situations. The lower cost of living in redder metros is a big advantage for retirees and others not in the labor market.
Also, income inequality — and all the social and political challenges that come with it — tends to be lower in redder metros. And while cost-of-living-adjusted household incomes are higher in bluer metros, cost-of-living-adjusted salaries for a given occupation are typically higher in redder metros.
There’s a reason for this difference: Bluer metros tend to have higher-paying occupations and fewer prime-age adults out of the labor force, which increases household incomes. But if you move from a bluer to a redder metro and find a job in the same occupation, you’re likely to get an increase in salary after taking living costs into account.
The economic challenges of blue metros — unaffordability and inequality — are different from those of red metros, which face lower living standards and greater risks of job loss. Even if the economy takes a back seat in the 2020 election to health care, immigration and Trump’s record, these economic differences won’t be far from the surface. And if national economic conditions soften, these differences will become more reason for partisan disagreement on urgent policy priorities.
Where will recent trends take us? These economic fundamentals — household income, cost of living, educational attainment, nonroutine job share and projected job growth — were all more indicative of how a place would vote in 2016 than they had been in 2012.
If the places that moved left between 2012 and 2016 continue getting bluer — and the places that swung Obama-to-Trump keep getting redder — the local economies of red and blue America will keep growing further apart.

PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS SEEMS TO HAVE ONLY TWO THEMES

Texto completo: Have you noticed that there are only two overarching themes in current presidential politics?
The first is how Donald Trump is increasingly seen as despicable and immoral by much of the nation. Trump makes the Watergate-era dishonesty of Richard Nixon seem quaint. Day after day, we are aghast at Trump's cult-like hold on supporters despite being revealed as a straight-out liar by some of America's most decorated military heroes and credentialed civil servants.
The other theme concerns Democrats and a seemingly existential conflict between the far left and the center left. It is most often seen in coverage of the Democratic presidential candidates, but it runs through pretty much everything.
What is so galling about this intramural Democratic warfare is that it is both destructive and waged as if there really were giant policy divisions between the sides differences important enough to risk aiding Trump's re-election. Remember that this is a man who, if he wins again, will fundamentally alter our democratic institutions, if he hasn't already.
In truth, those on the left agree much more than they disagree.
They agree that climate change is real and actionable, that scientific expertise matters and that a bold and immediate response is crucial.
They agree that huge wealth disparities are immoral and result partly from dark money in politics, and they agree they can be attacked through more progressive tax policies and pro-consumer financial regulations.
They agree that health care is a human right and that government programs can play an important role, just as the advent of Medicare did in protecting the health and dignity of retirees many decades ago.
They agree that the white supremacy movement is a profound threat and that race relations remain a monumental issue and a source of national shame.
They agree that firearms, especially assault and automatic weapons, should be regulated.
They agree that immigrants helped build the nation and that today we need a controlled and compassionate approach to immigration policy.
They agree that people of color and members of LGBT communities are no less American than the whites of European descent whose ancestors arrived a century or more ago.
They agree that women should have equal rights throughout society in contrast to the right, whose leader, Trump, routinely demeans women and has bragged about groping them.
They agree that government mostly employs patriotic public servants, many of whom could earn more in the private sector. They think many of these brave souls have shown public courage and selflessness during the impeachment process.
They see government not as a "swamp" but as a vehicle to improve and protect the lives of ordinary Americans in the historical spirit of presidents such as FDR and LBJ.
Given all that agreement, why is the focus always on differences that suggest an unremitting Democratic brawl?
Some of this is exacerbated by the candidates vying for president, as each attempts to define her or his own brand by diminishing the political brands of others.
And part of the problem is a predictable appetite by the media to draw contrasts. Political tension creates a spectacle, and spectacles drive readership and ratings.
But I wonder if others are as weary as I am of how we all have contributed to a culture that seems to suggest as much disagreement among Democrats as there is with Trump and his distinctive brand of phony, know-nothing populism.
The truth is, there is a vast difference between Trump's "vision" for America and that of all Democrats, especially in contrast to the relatively minor differences separating Democrats themselves.
But you wouldn't know it from the tenor of today's politics of intra-party conflict.
Political pragmatists such as me get criticized for pointing out that regardless of Medicarefor- all and free-tuition campaign promises, there still will be a divided Congress where most Republicans plus many Democrats from moderate districts will reject initiatives they regard as radical, regardless of whatever passions for those policies run through political rallies in the boroughs of New York City.
Recently, the New York Times published four columns grouped by the common theme of "How to Beat Trump in 2020." Each was well-written, albeit predictable.
In "Focus on the Corruption," the writer suggested exploiting the chaos Trump creates to distract us from his failures as president. The emphasis should not be on how Trump is a bad person, but how he has failed the country.
"Electrify the Base" was a call to arms to excite young voters by offering a "bold alternative vision for what America can be."
"Win the Internet" called for the Democrats to focus on combating Trump online by harnessing "the right blend of righteous progressive outrage," complete with "indignation and alarmism." Those emotions, wrote the author, are effective online.
Finally, there was "Seize the Center," an analysis recognizing that the Electoral College results in north-central states from Pennsylvania to Iowa including Wisconsin will likely dictate the outcome of the election. Yet the writer lamented that centrist Democrats "face a pool of primary voters eager, even determined, to back a liberal candidate who stands well to the left of the general electorate."
A day after the Times columns ran, the co-editor of The American Prospect, a far-left magazine, was finding fault. Wrote Robert Kuttner: "How about the column pointing out the unmistakable fact that middle-class and working-class voters have been taking it on the chin for four decades; that economic ideas long dismissed as too radical by Times editorial writers and columnists now enjoy majority support?" And so on.
Yes, I see his point. Because, you know, to win a presidential election you need to thread a needle in the Electoral College in swing states, so it makes so much sense to grouse that the smart, left-leaning opinion writers at the New York Times are insufficiently radical.
My thought? Embrace all four suggestions by writers in the Times as complementary and move on. CREDIT: By Paul Fanlund

Texto completo: Concerned by municipal election results
Be careful what you wish for, Savannah voters. Yes, we have a new city council. And a runoff coming up. Every one should keep in mind that running a city is a business, not just a charitable institution. We need people who understand business and social issues. Savannah needs help from all of us.
Of late, I have sensed a great deal of animosity. I do not want a city run by just men or just women. I want an all inclusive city, with all races, religions and ethnicities to blend.

Support Younger-Onset Alzheimer's Disease Act
Some facts about Alzheimer's disease remain the same. Alzheimer's disease is still the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. It is still the most expensive disease in the United States, and it is still the only cause of death in the top 10 that has no treatment or cure.
Some facts about Alzheimer's disease are changing. There are now more than 5.7 million people living with Alzheimer's and that number continues to rise. Someone is diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease every 65 seconds, and that number (65) is falling. The number of people who are living with Younger-Onset Alzheimer's (aged 60 and younger) is now 200,000 and growing.
Because of their young age, people living with Younger-Onset Alzheimer's are not eligible for support and service programs available to older Americans through the Older American's Act(OAA). The Younger-Onset Alzheimer's Disease Act of 2019 (H.R. 1903 / S. 901) will give these citizens access to nutritional programs, respite services for family caregivers and other services to enhance quality of life through reauthorization of the OAA.
I want to thank Congressman Buddy Carter for his leadership and support in helping get H.R. 1903 passed through the House. The Senate must now follow the House action and pass this important bill.
Please join me in asking Sens. David Purdue and Johnny Isakson to call for the Senate to schedule a vote on the Younger-Onset Alzheimer's Disease Act of 2019 (S.901).

Democrats should be ashamed of actions
Presidents lie. Many, if not all, engage in quid pro quos. Many were unfaithful and behaved boorishly. President Barack Obama lied about Benghazi, used the IRS to intimidate and gave pallets of money for worthless Iranian promises. Also, think Lyndon Johnson and Bill Clinton.
Presidents reflect who we are, as a people, at any given time. We choose them because either the alternative is worse or because we believe they can resolve pressing problems.
We all knew Donald Trump had a foul mouth, ran an unorthodox campaign and lived the life of a playboy. Hillary Clinton was the alternative and we rejected her but she and the radicals in her party were unwilling to accept their defeat. Meanwhile, the press and media had invested a lot in predicting she would win and they, too, chose to reject the will of the people.
I do not expect Trump haters to be objective, nor will they recognize Trump's many accomplishments against every kind of pushback because, like Obama, they want to transform America. Consequently, they began their plan to impeach Trump the day he took office, and as we will soon learn laid the foundation during his campaign.
The gulag effort by Rep. Adam Schiff and his ilk is not only despicably un-American but dangerous. To impeach and entrap Trump, they have disregarded the legal due process foundation on which our nation's justice system rests.
Most likely, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will accede to Trump's impeachment and, in all likelihood, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's Senate will reject The House's decision so Democrats seem content to engage in a useless and costly effort in order to batter Trump so he will lose the 2020 election.
Obviously, they want to overturn an election, the vote of 62 million Americans through a legislative process that is totally political. For shame.

Columnist misses mark with racism rant
Another day, another Washington Post column in the local newspaper. Apparently, according to columnist Esther Cepeda in her piece published Nov. 8 and headlined "Time to learn to be anti-racists," there are two kinds of people in America: People "of color" and white people. We all know who causes all of the problems in this country - according to this columnist - and it ain't people "of color".
White racists are bad, of course, but white "progressives" who claim to be "allies" of black and brown people can be worse. According to her, they are "clueless" and unwittingly perpetuate racism "on a daily basis" because they spend more energy convincing other people that they aren't racist than they spend on reducing racism. What's a white "progressive" to do? You can't win, apparently. As for me, personally, I can go for days without worrying about the people "of color" and how I cause all of their problems. I'm "clueless" that way, I suppose.
I subscribe to the digital edition of the Savannah Morning News. I scan the local "news," which tends to be anything that won't frighten the tourists, but any national or international articles are always left-wing AP, Washington Post or New York Times reprints. I expect this, since Chatham County is Democrat country, but I do tire of the constant left-wing "virtue-signaling" in the Opinion section.

Texto completo: Here we go again investing all kinds of hope and hype in the public impeachment hearings scheduled to start Wednesday before the House Intelligence Committee. You would think after the letdowns of the Brett Kavanaugh and Robert Mueller hearings, that we in the media would know better - that TV hearings don't change the culture in a flash as some media histories have been telling us for decades.
Yes, public impeachment hearings are a very big moment in our nation's life. I'll be in front of several screens for every second of the hearings and surely way too engaged for the good of my mental health. But that said, here's a modest proposal: Let's not get caught up in the false promise of a magical, transformative, media moment and forget the real, daily, gritty, grind-it-out, journalistic work it takes to get rid of someone elected to high office who proves dangerously unworthy of it.
In a column last year about my sense of deflation following Judge Kavanaugh's Supreme Court hearing, I wrote about what I called the mighty media version of our national past. Since the late 1960s, many media analysts and some media studies professors have been oversimplifying our social history in part to inflate the importance of their field. They attribute major political and social change almost exclusively to media moments when, in fact, there are many forces responsible for such changes.
Some of the key post-World War moments of this narrative: The Army-McCarthy TV hearings and Edward R. Murrow's CBS "See It Now" report on Sen. Joseph McCarthy in 1954; Walter Cronkite's 1968 repudiation of the Vietnam War on CBS; the Watergate hearings on PBS in 1973; and the Clarence Thomas Supreme Court confirmation hearings on all the major broadcast networks and CNN in 1991.
In focusing all of our historical attention on a couple of TV moments, we overlook events like that of Sen. Margaret Chase Smith, Republican from Maine, delivering a withering denunciation of the tactics used by McCarthy and other members of her party in a speech titled "A Declaration of Conscience" on the floor of the Senate in 1950. Or that of Vermont Sen. Ralph Flanders, another Republican, who also denounced McCarthy four years later. Such important political moments are lost in narratives that overemphasize the role of media in watershed historical moments.
The Senate Watergate hearings on PBS in 1973 are being invoked regularly in connection with this week's hearings, and there are some solid reasons for the that. They played a role in the resignation of President Richard Nixon, who defied the Constitution and came under fire for using the power of his office to undermine a political opponent, just as President Trump is alleged to have done in withholding aid to Ukraine in an effort to get the president of that country to try to find dirt on Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.
The Watergate hearings, which began in May 1973, were hugely important. I watched the live hearings during the day and sometimes the reruns at night on PBS as an out-of-work graduate with a freshly minted degree. They gave me the foundation of a political education I didn't get in school.
But President Nixon didn't resign until August 1974 - a year later. The TV hearings didn't bring him down; the grinding, steady work of The Washington Post led by Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein did, along with some courageous members of Congress, who signaled their willingness to vote for impeachment across party lines.
We have that kind of great, grinding, day-in-and-day-out reporting and analysis today from the Washington Post and New York Times, plus platforms like Rachel Maddow's nightly show on MSNBC. That's the kind of relentless work that could ultimately spell the end of President Donald Trump.
And yet, belief in the almighty power of TV hearings remains so strong that former PBS show host Bill Moyers took our a full page ad in The New York Times on Friday urging PBS to not only carry the hearings live (as PBS is doing) but rerun them in prime time just like in 1973. Except the fragmented media landscape of TV could hardly be more different from it was in 1973.
In our digital media ecosystem, live TV hearings still matter. But they aren't what they were in a predigital world. In fact, they never where what they are regularly remembered as being today.
So, by all means, watch the impeachment hearings. Don't miss a moment if you can help it. But don't sit down in front of the screen expecting to be saved.

Buttigieg's support skyrockets among Iowa caucusgoers

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg has shot to the top of the field in Iowa, according to a poll released Tuesday.
The Monmouth University poll found that Buttigieg is the favored candidate of 22% of respondents in the first in the nation nominating contest. Former Vice President Joe Biden was next with 19%, but within the 4.6 percentage point margin of error. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren was at 18% and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders at 13%. All other Democratic presidential candidates received single-digit support in the survey.
But the survey results suggest that the race is still fluid; less than one-third of respondents said they are firmly set on their choice.
Buttigieg's support has grown since Monmouth's August survey, where he was at 8%. Biden, meanwhile, has ticked down since the summer, when he was the pick of 26% of Monmouth respondents.
The results are based on 451 Iowans likely to participate in the state's Democratic caucus.
Pundits have said Buttigieg is positioned to contend in Iowa, a mostly white Midwestern state. They have cautioned his continuing struggle in South Carolina, a state with a larger African American population, might be more noteworthy.
Buttigieg has had a sometimes bumpy relationship with African Americans in South Bend, most recently thrust into the spotlight when a white police officer shot a black man wielding a knife in the summer.
Still, Buttigieg has been surging in Iowa since his breakout performance at the October Democratic debate. The Iowa State University/Civiqs poll released Oct. 24 showed him in second place to Warren, and the New York Times/Siena College poll released Nov. 1 placed him third behind Warren and Sanders.
Perhaps showing the volatility of the race, both of those polls had Biden trailing in fourth place.
Buttigieg also is making up ground in New Hampshire, though pundits say he will have a harder time winning that New England state in the backyards of Biden, Warren and Sanders.
A Quinnipiac poll in New Hampshire had the Democratic hopeful holding his own with 15% of support, against Biden at 20%, Warren at 16% and Sanders at 14%. Sanders won that primary in 2016.
A recent USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll conducted nationally also found Buttigieg within striking distance of Biden, Warren and Sanders.

Assaults Linked To Hate Crimes Were Up in 2018, According to F.B.I.

Texto completo: The bureau's annual report showed a significant upswing in violence against Latinos.
Personal attacks motivated by bias or prejudice reached a 16-year high in 2018, the F.B.I. said Tuesday, with a significant upswing in violence against Latinos outpacing a drop in assaults targeting Muslims and Arab-Americans.
Over all, the number of hate crimes of all kinds reported in the United States remained fairly flat last year after a three-year increase, according to an annual F.B.I. report. But while crimes against property were down, physical assaults against people were up, accounting for 61 percent of the 7,120 incidents classified as hate crimes by law enforcement officials nationwide.
State and local police forces are not required to report hate crimes to the F.B.I., but the bureau has made a significant effort in recent years to increase awareness and response rates. Still, many cities and some entire states failed to collect or report the data last year, limiting the conclusions that can be drawn from the F.B.I. report.
In addition, experts say that more than half of all victims of hate crimes never file a complaint with the authorities in the first place.
Even so, the F.B.I. said there were 4,571 reported hate crimes against people in 2018, many of them in America's largest cities, involving victims from a wide range of ethnic and religious backgrounds.
"The trends show more violence, more interpersonal violence, and I think that's probably reliable," said James Nolan, a former F.B.I. crime analyst who helped oversee the National Hate Crime Data Collection Program from 1995-2000.
The F.B.I. defines a hate crime as a "criminal offense against a person or property, motivated in whole or in part by an offender's bias against a race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity, gender, or gender identity." Victims of hate crimes can include institutions, religious organizations and government entities as well as individuals.
Here are the biggest takeaways from the report.
Vandalism is down, but assaults are up.
The 4,571 attacks against people tallied by the bureau for 2018 included aggravated assaults, which were up 4 percent; simple assaults, up 15 percent; and intimidation, up 13 percent.
These trends happened despite a national decline in violent crime in general, and coincided with a 19 percent drop in bias-driven property crimes.
The data points toward a change from young people committing vandalism and other property crimes toward more deliberate attacks on people, said Brian Levin, the director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino, who produced an independent analysis of the F.B.I.'s figures
"We're seeing a shift from the more casual offender with more shallow prejudices to a bit more of an older assailant who acts alone," Mr. Levin said. "There's a diversifying base of groups that are being targeted. We're getting back to more violence."
As immigration heats up, Latinos face more violence.
Immigration has replaced terrorism as a top concern in the United States, according to national surveys. That shift appears to be reflected in the hate-crime data, which shows fewer attacks against Muslims and Arab-Americans in recent years, but more against Latinos.
The F.B.I. said 485 hate crimes against Latinos were reported in 2018, up from 430 in 2017. It said 270 crimes were reported against Muslims and Arab-Americans, the fewest since 2014.
But the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a civil rights group with chapters across the country, said it had recorded 1,664 hate crimes against Muslims in 2018.
Robert McCaw, the group's director of governmental affairs, said that while awareness and reporting of hate crimes have improved, daily acts of bullying or discriminations in schools, workplaces and in public are not included in the F.B.I.'s analysis, which focused on violent crimes.
"We don't know the full scope of anti-Muslim hate crimes and other hate crimes," he said.
Hate crimes against Latinos were at their highest level since 2010, when the unemployment rate and border crossings from Mexico were both peaking. Some advocates placed the blame for the recent rise on President Trump.
"There's a direct correlation between the hate speech and fear-mongering coming from President Trump and the right wing of the Republican Party with the increase in attacks against Latinos," said Domingo Garcia, the national president of the League of United Latin American Citizens.
Mr. Garcia said that immigration had replaced terrorism as the new "bogeyman" for the American right and predicted that the rise in hate crimes would not stop until the hateful rhetoric against Latinos had ended.
Hate crimes have increased in America's largest cities.
Although nationwide F.B.I. data for all of 2019 won't be available until next November, the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism examined hate-crime reports so far this year in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago and found that all three cities -- plus the nation's capital -- appear to be headed for decade highs.
Hate crimes against Asian-Americans, African-Americans and Muslims are down in New York, the center said, but reports of anti-Semitic hate crimes are driving the overall total up.
Of the 364 hate crimes reported in New York through Nov. 3, the center said, 148 targeted Jewish people. There were 295 hate crimes reported in the city over the comparable period in 2018.
"The surge of attacks on the Jewish community, in large cities like New York and in smaller cities like Pittsburgh and Poway, really has no precedent," said Jonathan Greenblatt, chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League, referring to deadly shootings at a synagogue in Pittsburgh last year and one near San Diego in April.
"The severity of these incidents seems to be increasing in both their aggressiveness and physicality," he added.
In Los Angeles, 249 hate crimes were reported in the first nine months of 2019, up from 217 in the same period last year. And Chicago had 77 reported hate crimes through early November, compared with 78 for the whole of 2018.
Most places reported zero hate crimes to the F.B.I.
The great majority -- 87 percent -- of the 16,039 law enforcement agencies that sent data to the F.B.I. for 2018 said no hate crimes were reported in their jurisdiction during the year. Twenty-five cities with populations of more than 150,000 people reported no hate crimes, including Plano and Laredo, Tex.; Newark; St. Petersburg, Fla.; and Madison, Wis.
No hate crimes were reported by any law enforcement agency in Alabama or Wyoming.
Mr. Nolan, the former F.B.I. analyst, said he and his colleagues had sought to improve the accuracy of hate crime data, but with little success. "It was all lip service; it was never funded," he said.
Compiling crime statistics is not one of the bureau's major priorities, Mr. Nolan said, though the former director, James Comey, tried to elevate the task when he was director, saying in 2014 about tracking hate crimes: "It is not something we can ignore or sweep under the rug."
Mr. Nolan said the spottiness of the data doesn't invalidate attempts to determine which types of hate crimes are on the rise, though. "All crimes are underreported; it doesn't make them useless that they're underreported," he said. "You have to be savvy enough to look at the trend lines and see the trends. It tells you something about what's going on."

Texto completo: Many cuisines brought by immigrants to the United States have long been pigeonholed as cheap and plentiful, part of a high-volume, low-margin business.
Efforts to serve more intricate dishes using better ingredients in more elegant surroundings face steep obstacles. The increased expense requires higher menu prices. Consumers often balk, and ambitious Chinese chefs, for instance, prevented from showing the complexity and power of their cuisine, decide instead to work at more lucrative sushi bars.
It's tempting to think of malbec from the Mendoza region of Argentina as the cheap Chinese food of wine. People will happily accept it so long as malbec is inexpensive and cheerful. But they rebel if it aims higher.
In the United States, the wine is popular and ubiquitous. People ask for malbec as if it were a brand name. Corner bars reliably stock it. These wines, most people assume, will be inexpensive. Generally, they are right.
But what if the vines were situated on rocky hillsides at higher altitudes, where the yields stay low naturally, rather than in the fertile flatlands where the yields are generous? What if they were meticulously tended by hand rather than by machine? What if the grapes were fermented in small lots, so that each section of the vineyard could be treated individually rather than homogenized in huge vats?
The result would be very different wines. One would be a wine intended to express the characteristics of a place, provided, in the considered judgment of the grower, that the place had a character worth expressing.
The other would be a generous, fruity wine that might well be enjoyable but innocuous, with little depth, character or sense of place.
The high-altitude wine would most likely cost more. But the difference in price would go toward a more distinctive wine. Whether it is worth the higher price is the sort of decision wine consumers must make all the time.
Here at Wine School we regularly ponder the differences between wines and the reasons for their pricing. We know that higher prices do not always buy better wines.
Sometimes prices are derived from perceived status: Wines from Napa Valley can charge more because Napa adds value not attributed to wines from, say, Lake County. Or a celebrity lends a name, and the price rises as marketers seek to capitalize on the glitz. Occasionally the price is a direct result of a basic economic law, like supply and demand.
But pricing can sometimes be tied directly to the means of production. Mass-produced wines that take advantage of the economies of scale will often be cheaper than those that are the products of laborious farming and careful craft.
For the last month in Wine School we have been drinking Mendoza malbecs. As usual, I recommended three bottles. Readers seek out the wines or equivalent bottles, drink them and report their reactions.
The three were Zuccardi Mendoza Paraje Altamira Concreto Malbec 2017 ( $ 28); Catena Alta Mendoza Malbec Historic Rows 2015 ( $ 35) and Altos Las Hormigas Mendoza Appellation Gualtallary Malbec 2016 ( $ 38).
The idea was to get wines a cut or two above the mass-market malbecs in an effort to examine wines intended to be more expressive of place.
"I could easily have chosen less expensive bottles," I wrote, introducing the three bottles. "But I wanted to be certain that we would be trying wines produced from a more imaginative, labor-intensive point of view."
Some readers voiced their displeasure.
Tracie Barnes of Denver took issue with my declaration that I could have found cheaper bottles. "Then, why not do so?" she asked.
Rather than try the bottles I recommended, F. Lehoucq of North Carolina instead praised a $ 12 Altos Las Hormigas. (I can attest that it's a good value, but a different sort of wine.) And Mr. XYZ of New York said simply, "If that isn't sophistry and silliness, I don't know what is."
I don't take issue with anybody who sets limits on what they will spend on wine. That's a personal decision. But the idea of Wine School is to learn about all sorts of wines, to discern differences, to develop confidence in our own preferences and to take all of that into account when making buying decisions.
This sometimes means spending a little more money than might be comfortable because some wines legitimately cost more. If we refuse to do this, we are left to focus on only a small segment of wine's possibilities.
Consider the decisions that wine producers make all the time. Must Beaujolais be only a pleasant, refreshing knock-back wine? Don't underestimate the pleasure in wines like that. We need vins de soif, or thirst quenchers.
But what if Beaujolais could be more expressive than that? What if chenin blanc from California could be more than a cheap component for inexpensive blended wines? What if garnacha could do more in Spain than make alcoholic fruit bombs?
We need winemakers to ask these questions, and to find answers. If they did not, we would have far fewer interesting wines in the world. So let's not be so quick to doubt either the potential of Mendoza malbec or the sincerity of those who are seeking to demonstrate it in their wines.
A relentless desire to test the limits of malbec drove producers in the 1990s from the flat, loamy clay vineyards of the Luján de Cuyo region near the city of Mendoza to higher elevations in the Uco Valley in search of stonier sites and cooler temperatures.
The Zuccardi comes from the Paraje Altamira area in the southern part of the Uco Valley while the Altos Las Hormigas comes from Gualtallary, farther north in the Uco. The grapes for the Catena come partly from Luján de Cuyo and partly from the Uco, including its Adrianna Vineyard, a pioneering high-altitude site at almost 5,000 feet in Tupungato.
I found each of these wines far more interesting than the typical inexpensive jammy malbec. The Zuccardi was dark and plummy, with an aromatic note of leafiness. On the palate, it was earthy and focused, with a touch of unsweetened licorice. I thought it was lovely.
The Altos Las Hormigas had flavors more of red fruit. It was also earthy and dry, yet deep and rich. The Catena Alta was the most tannic of the three, and the most reticent despite being older. It, too, was plummy and earthy.
One thing they all had in common: On the day after I originally opened the bottles, they each got better, deeper and more detailed. The Zuccardi developed mineral flavors, as did the Altos Las Hormigas. The Catena developed complexity and the tannins softened.
What does that mean? None of these were simple wines. They each showed an ability to evolve, in the glass, in the bottle and, I'd wager, in the cellar if you left them to age a few more years. You would not see that in ordinary, inexpensive malbecs.
I was not the only one to notice this improvement in the bottle.
VSB of San Francisco drank a bottle of Zorzal 2016 Eggo (it's aged in concrete eggs) from the Tupungato area, and said the contrast between the wine on the first day and the next was striking. Dan Barron of New York noticed a similar evolution in the Catena Alta.
Acknowledging potential in the wines is not the same as liking them. Not everybody did. Martin Schappeit of Forest, Va., enjoyed both the Zuccardi and the Catena Alta, but Mr. Barron found both not entirely to his taste. Martina Mirandola Mullen of New York found the Catena Alta delicious but maybe not something she would choose to drink again.
Ferguson of Princeton, N.J., acknowledged stereotypes of malbec.
"My husband's preconceived notion of malbecs is that it is the type of wine drunk by the fathers at the swim club with whom we avoid talking politics," she said. They tried the Altos Las Hormigas nonetheless and enjoyed it, but she wondered whether it was worth the money.
That's a legitimate question to ask about any wine, especially after sampling it.
My own feeling is that the potential of Mendoza malbec, as these wines demonstrated, goes far beyond cheap and cheerful. The prices of these wines, $ 28 to $ 38, are not all that much compared with those of equivalent bottles from California. They just need to be approached with an open mind.

Texto completo: Un joven de Tailandia, adicto a los videojuegos fue hallado muerto luego de jugar durante varios días. El chico, identificado como Piyawat Harikun de 17 años, jugó sin descanso; lo encontró su familia frente a la pantalla.
De acuerdo al diario The New York Times, Jaranwit Piyawat , padre del joven, declaró que cuando entró a su habitación lo llamó por su nombre; sin embargo, al no obtener respuesta, descubrió que estaba muerto. “Lo llamé por su nombre y le dije: ‘Despierta, despierta’, pero él no respondió. Pude ver que estaba muerto”, confesó Piyawat, quien es oficial de la fuerza aérea.
El padre declaró que trató de advertir a su hijo sobre los riesgos de las largas horas de juego, pero “ya era demasiado tarde”. Jaranwit relató que trató de revivir a su hijo, pero no tuvo éxito. Por su parte, los médicos examinaron el cuerpo del muchacho y determinaron que falleció por un derrame cerebral provocado por las largas horas delante de la pantalla.
“Traté de advertirle sobre sus implacables largas horas jugando y prometió reducirlo, pero ya era demasiado tarde. Ya había muerto antes de tener la oportunidad de cambiar”, señaló Piyawat. Además, dijo que espera que la muerte de su hijo sea un llamado de atención para otros adictos al juego.
“Mi hijo era inteligente y siempre fue excelente en la escuela, pero tenía un gran problema con la adicción a los juegos. Deben ser más estrictos con las horas de juego de sus hijos, de lo contrario podrían terminar como mi hijo”, finalizó el desconsolado padre de familia. La Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS) catalogó la adicción a los juegos de video como trastorno mental. Y el Servicio Nacional de Salud de Reino Unido (NHS), fundó la primera clínica para combatir este problema en chicos de 13 a 25 años y ofrece terapias presenciales o en línea.

Texto completo: La compañía Tribune Publishing anunció este martes el cierre del periódico Hoy, que servía a la comunidad hispanohablante del área de Chicago.
El semanario dejará de circular el 13 de diciembre. También se acabará su sitio web.
El periódico fue lanzado en 2003 como reemplazo del semanario Éxito y fue diario por varios años. En 2017 pasó a ser semanario después de un par de años circulando tres días a la semana. Actualmente operaba con cerca de media docena de empleados.
Relacionado: Suspenden operación del New York Times en Español
La publicación era la última de la marca Hoy que quedaba en funcionamiento. Hoy nació en Nueva York en 1998, y se expandió a Chicago y Los Ángeles al ser adquirido por Tribune Co. en 2000 .
Impremedia, propietaria de El Diario y La Opinión, adquirió Hoy Nueva York en 2007, cuando era un diario de distribución gratuita. El medio cerró en 2009.
En agosto pasado, el semanario Hoy Los Ángeles fue cerrado por Los Angeles Times para dar paso a Los Angeles Times en Español, que solamente opera de manera digital.
Tribune Publishing ofreció a los empleados de Hoy Chicago vincularse a plazas abiertas en el Chicago Tribune.
El sindicato del Chicago Tribune lamentó el cierre de Hoy.
“Estamos profundamente decepcionados de que Tribune Publishing esté cerrando Hoy, que ha ido más allá de los estereotipos y ha proporcionado noticias significativas al vasto cuerpo de hispanohablantes en nuestra región. Esto es perjudicial para nuestros periodistas, nuestros lectores y nuestra empresa”, escribió el sindicato en su cuenta de Twitter.
We're deeply disappointed that Tribune Publishing is shutting down Hoy, which has gone beyond stereotypes and provided meaningful news to the vast body of Spanish-speakers in our region. This is a disservice to our journalists, our readers and our company.

Texto completo: A tell-all book by an anonymous author about Donald Trump's presidency is not even out yet and is already setting records, according to the book's publisher.
The book, titled "A Warning," is set to be released on Nov. 19. The publisher, Twelve Books, said the author's identity will remain a secret and that the book picks up "where those first words of warning left off" in the explosive op-ed in the New York Times penned last year by the purported senior Trump administration official.
"Twelve is proud to announce that to-date, 'A Warning' has garnered more preorders than any other nonfiction book at any imprint in the history of Hachette Book Group," Paul Samuelson, Twelve's publicity director, wrote in a statement.
Twelve is an imprint of Grand Central Publishing/Hachette Book Group. The book will be published in English, French, German, Bulgarian, Lithuanian, Dutch and Arabic.
Samuelson said that to meet demand, the publisher has gone to print three times, and there are 500,000 copies ready to go into circulation.
“We are very proud to publish this historic book that is already breaking records before its release," Twelve’s publisher Sean Desmond said in a statement. "I think readers will find 'A Warning' to be a fascinating, detailed account. ”
The author is described as a senior official in the Trump administration.
The Washington Post, which obtained an early copy, says the book "paints a chilling portrait of the president as cruel, inept and a danger to the nation he was elected to lead," and depicts him "making misogynistic and racist comments behind the scenes. "
The writer also says Trump is unfit for office and that colleagues considered mass resignations and the 25th Amendment to try and remove him.
White House officials are pushing back against the book's claims, emphasizing the fact that the author has chosen to remain in the shadows.
"The coward who wrote this book didn’t put their name on it because it is nothing but lies," said White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham. "Real authors reach out to their subjects to get things fact checked – but this person is in hiding, making that very basic part of being a real writer impossible. "
The Department of Justice sent a letter to the publishers, claiming the author may be violating "one or more nondisclosure agreements. "
The publisher and the author's agents are rejecting the argument and defended the official, calling the move an attempt to “intimidate" them.
Twelve combated the DOJ's letter last week, saying they are "not party to any nondisclosure agreements with the U. S. government that would require any pre-publication review of this book” and reiterated that they “made a commitment of confidentiality to Anonymous and we intend to honor that commitment. "

Resumen: It's absurd and infuriating to lump these women together. Why don't polls ask if 'most men' running for president are unlikable? Plenty of them are.

Texto completo: Cue the misogyny. Again.
The latest example comes from a poll of registered voters in six states expected to play outsize roles in the 2020 presidential race. Nearly four in 10 (38%) of these potentially pivotal voters agreed with this overtly sexist statement: “Sometimes, it feels like most women who run for president just aren’t that likable. ”
The very statement — posited in a recent New York Times-Siena College poll — is at once infuriating and comical, blatantly sexist and rather preposterous. This is, after all, the first time in U. S. history that one might reasonably ask any question involving most women. And while it is not the first time one might credibly ask whether the plethora of men who run for president are likable, the mere thought of that question is, well, not thought of.
Pollsters have long tried to assess whether voters felt comfortable with candidates. Gallup first asked whether each candidate was likable in 1976. Many polls have asked whom you’d prefer to grab a beer with. But those questions addressed each individual candidate (male and, when there was one, female) and didn’t conjoin — much less ridicule — a minority of them.
These women have little in common
This presidential election, which comes during the centennial of women’s voting rights, has drawn a record number of women seeking a major-party nomination (now five, after Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York ended her campaign). Yet we have one question —framed in the negative — that lumps them all together.
As Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics, told me, “This is the thing that plagues and haunts women: Are they likable enough?”
Why would more than 1,400 of the 3,766 registered voters in the poll bite on a question like this? Why would they agree, either strongly or somewhat, that most women presidential candidates are unlikable?
“I’m not sure if it’s just these candidates, just these women, or a deep-seated resentment,” said Meghann Crawford, a pollster for Siena College.
Let’s contemplate that. How well, exactly, do the respondents know most of the women? What traits do they think Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and self-help guru Marianne Williamson share? What could possibly make most of them unlikable? What, really, do they have in common?
And what of the dozen men who are vying for the Democratic nomination? What about the four men competing for the GOP nomination, including Donald Trump? Are most of them unlikable? Are any of them? The poll didn't ask.
It has long been a given that women in politics and elsewhere (read: everywhere) are held to different standards than men, particularly when they seek or attain power. They not only have to be overqualified, they also have to be assertive (not aggressive), smart (not haughty) and serious (but not too much). They also should be nurturing (but not smothering), empathetic (but not tearful) and able to laugh (but not cackle) at themselves (and at the sexist jokes that undoubtedly will come their way). Oh, and they shouldn’t be too ambitious (read: like the men who set the standards).
If they are too (fill in the blank), they definitely will be unlikable.
Republicans are tougher on women
But to whom? Who are these judgmental folks? The group most likely to agree that most women presidential candidates are unlikable is Republicans, at 53%. Among Democrats, who nominated a woman once and have the chance to do so again, 26% said most women who run for president are unlikable.
The next largest group of women-dislikers is people with a high school education or less, at 47%, followed by white people who either didn’t attend or didn’t graduate from a four-year college, at 44%. By contrast, 28% of all college graduates and white college graduates agreed that most women presidential candidates are unlikable.
Saving the free market: Elizabeth Warren is a friend to capitalists, at least those who see revolution coming
Notably, women are tougher on other women than men are: 43% of women — versus one-third of men — said most of the women who run for president are unlikable.
One woman, Elysha Savarese of Florida, told The Times that female presidential candidates are “super unlikable. ”Savarese said Warren, the top-polling woman, has body language that is “off-putting. ”
“She’s very cold,” said Savarese, 26. “She’s basically a Hillary Clinton clone. ”
Which is fitting. Apparently, there is only one presidential candidate in all of American history to whom we can compare Warren. It is not other Massachusetts senators, like John or Teddy Kennedy, Calvin Coolidge or John Kerry. It is not another academic like Woodrow Wilson, or a law professor like William Howard Taft. It’s not eggheads like Adlai Stevenson or Barack Obama. No, Warren either is or is not the new Clinton, the one woman a major party has nominated to the highest office in the land.
Losing corporate America: Anti-Trump businesswomen are nervous about Warren, and the Democratic debate didn't help
Let’s be clear: When we compare Warren to Clinton, we’re not comparing their policies, which are relatively dissimilar. We’re comparing their personas. Or, rather, stereotypes of women’s personas. Are they shrill? Are they nasty? Do they grate on you? Do they remind you of your first wife or your mother-in-law (to mention other stereotypically unlikable women)?
Clinton was a lightning rod whom a lot of people liked to dislike. She won the most votes anyway.
Imagine, then, what other women might do.
If only most of them were likable.

Texto completo: Charles Rogers was an energetic star with an infectious smile and breathtaking talent, but it was never enough to squash the turbulence in his life.
That's how Rogers — the former Michigan State football All-American and Detroit Lions wide receiver — was being remembered after the Saginaw native died Monday morning following a recent hospital stay.
He was 38.
Rogers' mother, Cathy, was with her son at a Florida hospital when he died but had no further comment when contacted by the Free Press. She told the New York Times he died of liver failure.
Rogers' former teammates and coaches said he also had been battling cancer.
Born May 23, 1981, Rogers starred at Saginaw High, where he won a state football championship in 1999, and was an All-American at Michigan State before he was taken by the Lions as the No. 2 overall pick of the 2003 NFL draft.
He is considered one of the biggest busts in NFL history.
"How I will remember him is different than how everybody else will remember him," Matt Millen, the former Detroit Lions general manager, said Monday. "How I'll remember him is a great kid with a good heart with a lot of skills, that mismanaged some things."
Rogers' career never took off as he struggled with drug issues. The 6-foot-3, 220-pounder had just 36 catches for 440 yards with four touchdowns in 15 games before he left the league in 2005.
The five-star high school recruit played for Bobby Williams at MSU from 2000 to 2002. He finished with 2,821 yards on 135 catches with 27 touchdowns in two seasons before entering the draft. He won the Biletnikoff Award in 2002 as the nation's best wide receiver.
"He had the total package as a premier wide receiver with size, speed and range, topped with an awesome competitive spirit, yet he was humble off the field," Don Treadwell, Rogers' position coach at MSU, said in a statement. "It was a privilege to have coached him."
Former MSU quarterback Ryan Van Dyke said he had heard late last week that Rogers was not doing well. The two played together for two years in East Lansing.
"I was just talking about him yesterday," said Van Dyke, who was at MSU from 1998 to 2001. "Just a child-like spirit, always positive, always with a smile on his face. Even though the star was bright on him, the spotlight, he never failed to include people. He wasn't your diva-centric receiver, was not like that."
Van Dyke remembered visiting Saginaw to see Rogers, Jeremiah McLaurin and Stuart Schweigert while they were in high school to try and recruit them to join him with the Spartans. MSU was losing Plaxico Burress, and Van Dyke believed Rogers "was my guy" to replace Burress as his top target.
"When I was talking to (Rogers) probably last year, I was on the phone with him a few times, and we were just catching up and stuff. I was really just trying to gauge where he was at," Van Dyke said.. "And he was like, 'Man, you were my guy.' And I was like, really? Because I had got hurt when Jeff (Smoker) came in and did a good job. And (Rogers) was like, 'Yeah, I came to Michigan State to play with you.' I was like, wow. He said, 'Yeah, you threw me my first touchdown pass.' He's telling ME that, you know?
"It should be me being like, 'Man, I threw it to Charles Rogers.' He never failed to recognize everyone. He was very conscientious of everyone. It's just sad."
Talented but troubled Rogers signed a $39.5 million rookie contract with the Lions in 2003 that included a guaranteed signing bonus of $14.4 million. He caught two touchdown passes in his first career game, but caught only two more TD passes the rest of his career.
He suffered two broken collarbones in his first two NFL seasons, battled addiction to pain killers as he tried to rehab and was suspended four games by the NFL in 2005 for violating its policy on substances of abuse.
Asked if Rogers ever came to grips with flaming out of the NFL, Durrett said: "I don't think so, personally. I didn't never really — I talked to him off and on, but I don't think so."
After his career ended, Rogers fell into obscurity.
Rogers was arrested six times between September 2008 to October 2012, on charges ranging from assault and battery and probation violations to DUI, open container violations and marijuana possession.
In 2012, he was arrested for threatening his mother after he said she "stole" $100,000 from him. According to a police report, he threatened to "blow her mouth out" and said he was willing to do "the time" for it. The only time he served for the threat and a handful of other misdemeanor charges was a short stint in a rehab facility.
"I have a problem with that," he said, regretfully, in 2017. "I said some things, I was hot."
In 2017, the Lansing State Journal found Rogers in Fort Myers, Florida, where he was working at Uptown Motors, an auto repair shop. He said he smoked marijuana every day. He said he was trying to turn his life around.
"It's terrible," Van Dyke said. "I reached out to him, and we were talking for a little while, and then it just kind of fell off and I couldn't get a hold of him. Everybody's got their own way of dealing with things. I wish I could have done more. I feel kind of guilty."
Fond memories Rogers' life never came easy. He fathered two children while in high school and suffered a punctured lung after getting stabbed.
But he also became a star at Saginaw under Durrett. He was a state champion sprinter, standout basketball player and a rare talent on the football field.
Durrett calls him the best athlete to hail from the city, which produced the likes of Draymond Green and LaMarr Woodley. Track coach DeEddie Sanders agreed with that sentiment in 2017. So did Woodley.
"I'll tell you, he was — and I'm including Flint, too, since I coached at Flint Northern all those years — he's the best athlete I ever seen. I mean, honestly," Durrett said Monday. "We're talking about basketball, football and track together. He could have had a scholarship in all three sports. That's how good. ... I haven't seen nobody that fast that could do it all. He was just a blessed athlete that could do it all."
Woodley, who went on to play linebacker at Michigan and spent eight years in the NFL, was a freshman at Saginaw when Rogers was a senior. They were teammates for one season, but Woodley said he was Rogers' fan more than his friend.
He said he will never forget the stands being filled with college coaches, and the day Rogers' number was retired. He thought of him as a role model.
"I will always be a fan of Charles Rogers," Woodley said in 2017. "That will never change. The things he showed me, positively and negatively, had an effect on my life. I made it because Charles Rogers motivated me."
Rogers said in 2017 that he has eight children — four boys and four girls.
Funeral arrangements were not immediately known.
"The Spartan football family is deeply saddened to learn the news of Charles Rogers passing away," MSU coach Mark Dantonio said in a statement. " ... I was here as an assistant coach during Charles' first year on campus in 2000, and as a defense, we had to go against him in practice every day. He stopped by the football building a few years ago and was really excited and honored to see his All-America plaque and Biletnikoff Award on display in the lobby.
"We send our condolences to his family, friends and former teammates during this difficult time."
The Lions also released a statement: "We are deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Charles Rogers. From Saginaw, to East Lansing, to Detroit, Charles' connection to the state of Michigan and its football community was felt by many during the course of his life. We extend our heartfelt sympathies and condolences to his friends and family during this difficult time."
Cody Tucker of the Lansing State Journal contributed to this report.
Charles Rogers finished with 2,821 yards on 135 catches with 27 touchdowns in two seasons at Michigan State before entering the draft. He won the Biletnikoff Award in 2002 as the nation's best wide receiver.

Google to Store and Assess Health Data of Millions

Texto completo: The tech company's deal with Ascension is part of a push to use artificial intelligence to aid health services.
In a sign of Google's major ambitions in the health care industry, the search giant is working with the country's second-largest hospital system to store and analyze the data of millions of patients in an effort to improve medical services, the two organizations announced on Monday.
The partnership between Google and the medical system, Ascension, could have huge reach. Ascension operates 150 hospitals in 20 states and the District of Columbia. Under the arrangement, the data of all Ascension patients could eventually be uploaded to Google's cloud computing platform.
It is legal for health systems to share patients' medical information with business partners like electronic medical record companies. Even so, many patients may not trust Google, which has paid multiple fines for violating privacy laws, with their personal medical details.
Google mentioned the arrangement in an earnings call in July, but provided few details. More about the arrangement was announced on Monday, after The Wall Street Journal published an article about it.
Already, the two organizations are testing software that allows medical providers to search a patient's electronic health record by specific data categories and create graphs of the information, like blood test results over time, according to internal documents obtained by The New York Times. The aim is to give medical professionals better access to patient data, to improve patient care and, ultimately, to try to glean insights from the data to help treatment.
Google is teaming up with Ascension, a nonprofit, as American consumer tech giants like Amazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft jockey to gain a bigger share of the huge health care market. Apple has expanded into virtual medical research using its iPhone and Apple Watch. Microsoft has introduced cloud-based tools to help health systems share medical data. Last year, Amazon joined JPMorgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway in a venture to try to improve care and reduce costs for their employees in the United States.
Google's health efforts include a push to use artificial intelligence to read electronic health records and then try to predict or more quickly identify medical conditions.
The company's efforts require machines to learn by analyzing a vast array of health records collected by hospitals and other medical institutions. Under the Ascension partnership, dozens of Google employees may have access to patient data like name, birth date, race, illnesses and treatments, according to the internal documents. These include employees who work on Medical Brain, the company's health A.I. team.
At least a few Ascension employees in the project have raised concerns that Google employees downloaded patient data, according to the internal documents. They have also raised concerns about whether all of the Google software involved in processing Ascension patient data complies with a federal privacy law. That law, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, restricts how doctors, health systems and their business associations may handle identifiable patient data.
In its announcement on Monday, Ascension said the deal complied with the law and followed the organization's "strict requirements for data handling." In a follow-up email, the health system said that its patient data was stored in a private space within Google's cloud platform and that Google could not use it for any purpose other than providing tools for Ascension medical providers.
Tariq Shaukat, the president of Google Cloud, said in the statement that by working with groups like Ascension, "we hope to transform the delivery of health care."
Ascension did not respond to questions about how many patient records had already been transferred to Google Cloud.
Google's handling of health care data is a touchy subject. Through its advertising business, Google already knows a vast amount about consumers -- including what people are interested in, where they are located, and what they watch on YouTube or search for on Google.
When Google announced plans this month to acquire Fitbit, a maker of activity tracking devices, for $ 2.1 billion, the company pre-emptively said it would not use health data gleaned from the trackers in its advertising business.
In 2017, a British government watchdog agency ruled that the Royal Free National Health Service Foundation Trust, a major health provider, had violated a data protection law when it transferred medical records to DeepMind, an A.I. lab in London owned by Google's parent company, without sufficiently informing patients.
DeepMind further outraged privacy groups in 2018 when it announced plans to transfer the unit that processed the medical records to Google, after saying that it would not link patient data to Google accounts. DeepMind's health team officially joined Google in September. In absorbing DeepMind's health unit, Google said, it was building "an A.I.-powered assistant for nurses and doctors."
In June, Google, the University of Chicago Medical Center and the University of Chicago were sued in a potential class-action lawsuit accusing the hospital of sharing hundreds of thousands of patients' records with the technology giant without properly stripping the records of identifiable date stamps or doctors' notes.
In a research paper published last year, the company said it had used electronic health record data of patients -- including diagnoses, procedures and medications at the University of Chicago Medical Center -- from 2009 to 2016. The paper states that the records were "de-identified," except that "dates of service were maintained."
The lawsuit said the inclusion of dates was a violation of HIPAA, in part because Google could combine them with other information it already knew, like location data from smartphones, to establish the identity of the patients in the medical records.
A Google spokesman said in a statement that it complied with the law, which allows medical institutions to disclose patients' personal health information for research purposes as long as the records have been stripped of identifying details like names, Social Security numbers and contact information.
A Google spokesman said at the time that it had followed HIPAA. Google has filed to have the lawsuit dismissed.
The University of Chicago and the medical center have denied the accusations.

FORMER PLANNED PARENTHOOD PRESIDENT OPENS UP: Dr. Leana Wen learned she had been fired from Planned Parenthood when most other people did: when she received a New York Times alert about the ouster, she revealed in a podcast over the weekend.
Wen was speaking with Kevin Xu on the Model Majority Podcast that aired Sunday, where she described the whole experience around the firing as “traumatic,” and said she had not been able to accomplish her mission as president.
“I saw my mission at Planned Parenthood as repositioning the organization to be a mainstream health organization rather than be seen as a stridently progressive and political organization,” she said.

Wen was attacked by all sides after the firing, which also came at a time that was difficult personally for her. Only a few weeks earlier, she learned she had a miscarriage.
But in the days and weeks that followed, she said, she wanted to refrain from personal attacks and instead focus her public statements on the general philosophical differences that had emerged within the organization.
Her lessons, she said, came from Elijah Cummings, the recently deceased Democratic congressman from Baltimore. Cummings was a mentor to Wen, who had led the Baltimore health department before heading to Planned Parenthood.
“He often talked about how we cannot control a lot about our lives, but there are things that are in our control. And those things include how we choose to live the life that we have, and how we must always let our conscience guide our conduct,” she said.
Wen’s son Eli is named after Cummings because she said she wanted to raise him to grow up to be a “fighter against injustices but who always did so with authenticity and who really is the model of the person who has the biggest heart of anyone that we know.”
She also announced on the podcast that she’s expecting her second child, a girl, in March.

TRUMP TO MEET WITH VAPING INDUSTRY AS THE ADMINISTRATION WEIGHS A FLAVOR BAN: President Trump announced Monday that he will meet with vaping industry representatives, medical professionals, and state leaders to discuss ways to abate the teen vaping “dilemma.” He wrote: “Children’s health & safety, together with jobs, will be a focus!”
WHAT’S THE DIAGNOSIS, DOC? PSYCHIATRISTS WANT TO TESTIFY IN IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS: A group of psychiatrists and neurologists are looking to testify before Congress in impeachment hearings to weigh in on Trump’s fitness for office. "We think that hearing about mental health aspects in the context of the impeachment hearings is critical, partly because, for the past 2.5 years we have been very deeply concerned about mental instability of the president, and pretty much all that we have said has borne out to be true," said Dr. Bandy Lee, a Yale School of Medicine psychiatrist who speaks for the group.
Usually, mental health professionals are hesitant to diagnose people without examining them personally, and it goes against the rules of some psychological associations. Still, Lee and others in her group feel it’s high time that physicians speak out about what they see as mental instability and dangerousness. They say they have enough material to raise alarms from Trump’s public appearances, Twitter activity, interviews, and Robert Mueller’s 448–page report. They won't specifically recommend how to remove Trump's powers. "Those things are up to politicians to decide. That's not our domain," Lee said. "But our medical assessment is that those dangers need to be removed one way or another."
CEO OF KAISER PERMANENTE DEAD AT 60: Bernard J. Tyson, the CEO of health care provider Kaiser Permanente, died in his sleep Sunday at age 60. Before becoming CEO of the health care giant in 2013, Tyson had worked at the Oakland-based company for nearly three decades. The company currently oversees health plans for over 12 million customers, mostly in California.
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT: CDC NAMED VITAMIN E ACETATE AS THE PRIME SUSPECT IN VAPING ILLNESS: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday that vitamin E acetate, a thickener in THC vaping liquids, could be the cause of 2,051 lung injury cases and 39 deaths nationwide.

Wealth Matters: A new generation of the Huntsman family stakes out a new path for charitable giving

Texto completo: html> This week, the Huntsman family — one of the most philanthropic in the United States — made a $150 million gift to the University of Utah to establish the Huntsman Mental Health Institute.
The gift was a continuation of the large-scale charitable giving by the family’s patriarch, billionaire industrialist Jon Huntsman Sr., who died last year, and his wife, Karen. Jon Huntsman was one of the most philanthropic men of his generation. He was among the first to give away over $1 billion in his lifetime — long before Warren Buffett and Bill Gates created the Giving Pledge to induce billionaires to commit to donating at least half of their fortune to charity.
This week’s donation continues the family’s legacy of giving to health-related charities in Utah, but it also signals a subtle shift in their philanthropy, reflecting a new generation’s priorities.
Jon Huntsman gave hundreds of millions of dollars to cancer research, including $650 million to the University of Utah, where the cancer research center is named for his family. His son, Peter R. Huntsman, who has now assumed leadership of the family’s charitable arms, said the family would continue to donate to cancer research, but is also adding mental health research and care.
“It reminds me about where cancer was 30 years ago when my father got involved,” Peter Huntsman said. “Men didn’t talk about prostate cancer because it was emasculating, and women didn’t talk about breast cancer. The workplace now rallies around you if you have cancer. But you wouldn’t come into work and say, ‘I have a real problem with bipolar disorder.’”
All parents hope their children are going to know how to handle money, and families in a position to leave an inheritance want to make sure that their money isn’t squandered or doesn’t cause problems in their children’s lives.
But when it comes to a charitable bequest — money that is sitting in a private foundation or a public charity like a donor-advised fund and must be given away — transferring those family values can be trickier. If the children don’t want to give to the same organizations as their parents, is that all right? Parents may try to make sure that particular areas or institutions are earmarked for donations, but are their children obligated to follow their lead? Is it better if parents let their children give as they wish or should children try to follow their parents’ lead?
“The question is what is the purpose of our wealth,” said Alexandre Monnier, the head of the Hawthorn Institute for Family Success, a new advice offering within Hawthorn, the ultra-high-net-worth arm of PNC Family Wealth. “It’s easy to look back and ask what are some of the values you’re inheriting from the past that you’re carrying forward. But also what are some of the values you want to strike from the records?”
In the case of the Huntsman family, with two charitable arms under the control of the next generation, change was inevitable.
Jon Huntsman’s philanthropy started early. As he recounted in a 2013 interview, he began giving to charity before he had much money to give.
He started when he was making $320 a week as a naval officer in the late 1950s. By the time he had made his first $1 million, he said, he had given a quarter of it to charity.
As he began to accumulate wealth, he said, he began to narrow his charitable giving. Cancer became his focus when he survived a bout in 1992. “My wife and I determined that it was better to select a fewer number of charitable organizations and make a bigger difference,” he said.
Peter Huntsman said he and his siblings had adopted that strategy.
“My father preferred a rifled approach and not a shotgun approach,” he said. “The first time we met as a family after his passing, we talked about whether we wanted a shotgun or rifled approach.”
Peter Huntsman, who is one of nine siblings and is also the chief executive of the company his father created, said the family decided to continue with the focused, or rifled, approach to giving that their father and mother had practiced. But they broadened out the health category to mental health.
Personal reasons motivated Jon Huntsman, and now, his children. Jon Huntsman survived multiple bouts of cancer, and several members of his family died of it. His son Peter said mental health issues had affected the broader family.
“Our commitment to cancer will continue for the next generation at least,” Peter Huntsman said. “With mental health, there were enough experiences in our own family that if we didn’t have the name or the wealth, we wouldn’t have gotten nearly the care we got.”
He said a study showing that Utah ranked last for adult mental health care among the states and the District of Columbia accelerated the family’s donation to a mental health cause. He would consider the $150 million gift a success if people in Utah and the surrounding states began to look to the Huntsman Mental Health Institute for care, the way they do with the cancer center.
“When we think about mental health longer term, we will have succeeded if a single mother in rural Nevada or Idaho has a teenage child they’re worried about and they come to us,” he said. “The real result will be: Is the world going to be any different for that single parent? Or is real psychiatric health the domain of the rich and powerful? If that’s the case, then we’ve really lost the battle.”
While he has taken the lead among his eight surviving siblings, Peter Huntsman said they were very much involved. Their opinions on philanthropy also sometimes differ from their father’s approach.
Monnier said the next generation must determine its path: “Do we want to do what dad did or do we want to do our own thing?”
The risk in just following parents’ lead, he said, is that family members won’t be engaged and will feel as if they’re being controlled from the grave, as it were.
After the 1988 earthquake in Armenia, for example, Jon Huntsman said he was moved by what he saw on television and began donating to aid groups there. He eventually gave more than $50 million to help rebuild the country’s infrastructure. He also gave scholarships to bring Armenian students to the United States to study.
“I don’t know what took hold of me or why I gave,” he said in 2013. “It just got to my heart.”
But Peter Huntsman said the family could have spent the money given to Armenian relief more efficiently. “When dad went for the first time, he was over there meeting with the Armenian prime minister,” he said. “He didn’t know the difference between an Armenian and Romanian, but that was entrepreneurial philanthropy.”
“Sometimes it would have incredibly positive results,” he added. “Sometimes he should have stepped back and said if we had a process in place maybe we would have gotten more bang for our buck. But those things don’t happen with emotion.”
Peter Huntsman said he was making sure there were proper processes in place. The siblings, for example, are seeking advice from the foundation’s board of directors, something his father didn’t do. “It was his money and he made the decisions,” Peter said. “When he passed, the foundation and board came to life.”
Yet the family foundation was set up with flexibility built in. The second generation was able to donate to mental health because the mandates included donating to causes in the Western United States and helping the needy — in addition to continuing to finance cancer research.
The mandates can also be changed with a vote of the board, Peter Huntsman said. “I hope the day comes when we cure cancer and divert it all over to mental health.”

National Enquirer documentary ‘Scandalous’ is flawed, but fun to watch

Texto completo: Much like the publication it covers, the documentary “Scandalous: The Untold Story of the National Enquirer” offers plenty of salacious, gossipy tidbits more concerned with attracting eyeballs than uncovering actual truth. It’s well made and entertaining, but it’s also a celebration of unethical journalism that feels shallow in the end.
Director Mark Landsman jumps right into the backstory of the Enquirer, using former employees to flesh out the details and share plenty of dirt. Veteran Watergate reporter Carl Bernstein and current New York Times White House correspondent Maggie Haberman serve as the adults in the room, occasionally appearing on screen to sternly remind viewers about the importance of ethics in the news business. (Haberman was a curious choice, given that she’s often criticized by the left for her soft-focus approach to covering Donald Trump and his family, while the president has accused her of being a “Hillary flunky.”)
In 1952, Generoso Pope Jr. purchased the New York Evening Enquirer, a struggling Sunday afternoon broadsheet. The film alleges that Pope, whose father founded New York’s Italian language paper Il Progresso, used mob money to do so. Driven to increase circulation by any means possible, Pope transformed the Enquirer into a tabloid that focused on covering murder and mayhem in gory photographic detail.
His tactics worked, as circulation rose from 17,000 copies a week to 1 million by 1966. But Pope, who changed the paper’s name to the National Enquirer in 1957, had grander ambitions. He wanted to place the Enquirer at the checkout of every grocery store in the country. In order to pull off such a revolutionary move, he swapped the blood and guts for UFOs, conspiracy theories, cute dog photos and celebrity gossip.
The first half of “Scandalous” wallows in the Enquirer’s ’70s and ’80s heyday as the country’s biggest-selling newspaper. The former employees — all curiously filmed like aging Hollywood royalty in ornate rooms ripped from the pages of Architectural Digest — spin a series of journalistic war stories with warm, those-were-the-days nostalgia.
Pope, we learn, was an odd and demanding taskmaster who wouldn’t look his reporters in the eyes and wasn’t afraid to fire them at a moment’s notice. At the same time, his deep pockets and slippery morals meant his staff freely paid off sources and flew private jets to wherever the next scandal would take them. Pope also didn’t like seeing the newsroom empty out each Friday after that week’s edition was put to bed, so he started offering a fully catered banquet each Friday night with an open, and well stocked, bar. (There’s ample evidence on social media that there are people who firmly believe all media operates like this to this day.)
It’s fun hearing the lengths to which staffers went to land scoops like the Enquirer’s infamous photo of Elvis Presley in his coffin. How such scoops actually benefited anyone or made the world a better place isn’t really discussed. And for all the bragging the reporters do about their deep sources, the film ignores the times when the Enquirer got it wrong, like in 1981 when Carol Burnett won a $1.6 million judgment against the tabloid for incorrectly reporting that she was drunk at a party.
“Scandalous” does, however, detail how the paper extorted celebrities like Bob Hope and Bill Cosby into exclusive interviews by promising to withhold stories about the stars’ behind-the-scenes sex scandals. It also explores the tabloid’s dip into the world of politics after it helped torpedo Gary Hart’s 1988 presidential campaign by publishing photos of Hart with his alleged mistress Donna Rice in his lap.
From that point, the Enquirer considered anyone in the public eye fair game and we hear stories about the tabloid’s tireless coverage of events like the O.J. Simpson trial and aftermath. Major national daily newspapers had five or six reporters on O.J.; the Enquirer had 20.
Pope’s 1988 death brought sweeping changes to the Enquirer. The unlimited expense accounts and fat reporter paychecks began to dry up and the conservative-leaning paper took a deep dive into the far right after media mogul and Trump friend David Pecker purchased it in 1999.
In the final scenes of “Scandalous,” former employees bemoan Pecker’s transformation of what they call a traditionally apolitical publication into an unofficial wing of the Trump election campaign. For the first time in its history, the tabloid endorsed a presidential candidate — Donald Trump — and filled its pages with pro-Trump and anti-Clinton pieces. A scandal surrounding Pecker’s alleged catch-and-kill tactics of buying exclusive rights to stories that might damage Trump and then never running them ends with Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, pleading guilty to breaking campaign finance laws and shareholders of the Enquirer’s parent company forcing the sale of the tabloid due to its reporting practices.
In an intriguing coda, the film ends by questioning the tabloid’s surprisingly high $100 million sale price and suggesting the world hasn’t heard the last of the National Enquirer quite yet.

Texto completo: A missing World War II submarine was found off the coast of Japan after explorers discovered a 75-year-old error in the coordinates of where the sub was, the expedition team said.
The USS Grayback sank in February 1944 after Japanese forces attacked it as the sub was on a mission in the East China Sea. The sub had sunk 21,594 tons of shipping on its final mission alone, and overall, the submarine is credited with sinking 14 ships at 63,835 tons, according to the Navy.
Ocean explorer Tim Taylor, who founded the Lost 52 Project that aims to unearth lost US WWII submarines, and his team made the Grayback discovery about 1,400 feet below the surface southwest of Okinawa in June. The Navy recently confirmed the team's findings, Taylor's group said Sunday.
To find the sub, Taylor employed Yutaka Iwasaki, a systems engineer who studied the original Japanese military documents and discovered that the Navy's translation of the coordinates was wrong.
"It was off by one digit," Taylor told the Washington Post. "That changed the location by more than 100 miles. "
Along with the new coordinates, the team used underwater drones and advanced imaging technology to aid in the expedition. Yet, pinpointing the sub's location proved challenging and the team almost gave up.
French sub found: Missing for more than 50 years, wreckage of submarine is finally found
"It was amazing, the team had resigned to the fact that we're headed back to port and would not complete the total search area this year," Taylor said in a statement. A drone had a technical issue, and the team had only a bit of data left to review.
"You could feel everyone shuffling and getting ready to shift gears to secure the ship for getting underway. The next thing we see in the last quarter of the last line of data is the USS Grayback roll across the monitor," he added.
The Grayback discovery marks the fifth for Taylor and his Lost 52 Project. Eighty U. S. sailors were on the submarine at the time of its sinking, the group said.
"The confirmation of the site as a U. S. Navy sunken military craft ensures it is protected from disturbance, safeguarding the final resting place of our sailors," Robert S. Neyland, the head of the Naval History and Heritage Command’s Underwater Archaeology Branch, said in a statement.
The discovery also brought closure for those who lost relatives on the ship.
John Bihn's uncle, John Patrick King, was one of the sailors on the Grayback. Bihn said when he heard the news of its discovery, he was "dumbfounded. "
"I just could not believe it," he told The New York Times. "I wish my parents were alive to see this, because it would certainly make them very happy. "

Texto completo: NEW YORK - "What is a musical?"
I heard the perpetual question raised again a few days ago, and not innocently or idly. A showbiz veteran was concerned about the prospects for "Tina: The Tina Turner Musical," which opened Thursday at the Lunt-Fontanne Theater.
How would it be different from a rock concert? she wondered. Would a life story like Turner's fit into the form? And why, she asked finally, "would anyone want to see that?"
These are great questions, which is not surprising because the person asking them was Tina Turner herself. Now happily retired, and turning 80 this month, she discussed her initial misgivings in an article she recently wrote for Rolling Stone about the making of the $16.5 million bio-jukebox musical that now bears her name. Apparently, she got over her doubts; is it unfriendly to say that, having seen the show, I'm still working on mine?
And make no mistake, I see Turner - the greatest rock queen ever to drag herself onto her own damn throne - as a friend, at least in the sense that millions of others do, as someone to admire and even protect. If hers has been the story of triumph rescued from the disaster of childhood neglect and horrendous spousal abuse, ours has been the good fortune to see that redemption rendered in real time as music and spectacle.
So Turner's last question is the easiest to answer: I'd hazard that almost anyone who'd ever heard or seen her might want to experience her tale told onstage.
It's a good tale, in theory, cut to the pattern of classic drama. Two elemental forces - hurricane-voiced Anna Mae Bullock and typhoon-tempered Ike Turner - are pitted in a struggle that nearly destroys both. But while Ike, for his sins, winds up a pariah and eventually dies of an overdose, Anna, rechristened Tina by her Svengali-like husband, rises from the depths, to greater glory solo than she ever achieved under his boot.
More important, as far as pure entertainment is concerned, this story comes with songs that can thrill an audience when rendered as Turner sang them; at this, the musical "Tina," directed by Phyllida Lloyd, happily succeeds. In a performance that is part possession, part workout and part wig, Adrienne Warren rocks the rafters and dissolves your doubts about anyone daring to step into the diva's high heels.
But as to Turner's other questions, I'm afraid I share her initial skepticism.
To rip the Band-Aid off quickly, the book (by Katori Hall, with Frank Ketelaar and Kees Prins) is so thin it's see-through. You can't really blame Hall, whose earlier work (including "The Mountaintop" and "Our Lady of Kibeho") is complex and layered. No, this is a problem built into the biographical jukebox genre, whose songs leave the narrative only enough time for turning points and climaxes. Cherry-picked lives look ludicrous.
Shuffling and reassembling events to smooth the arc may improve the shape, but at the cost of accuracy; the 1993 Turner biopic "What's Love Got to Do With It" was almost as much fiction as fact. This stage musical, for which Turner and her second husband, Erwin Bach, are credited as executive producers, is truer but blurrier. It rushes so hard that Warren, who appears in almost every scene, has to swap emotions even faster than costumes. She sometimes seems more rattled than ravaged.
The problem is exacerbated by another jukebox tic: songs bent into improbable shapes to serve a story they weren't designed for. When Ike (Daniel J. Watts) proposes to Tina seemingly out of the blue, she responds by singing "You Better Be Good to Me," from her 1984 comeback album. By 1984, she was divorced and had the guts to back up the lyric's threat - but the scene is set in 1962, when she didn't.
Such gaps in logic can be bridged if you spend enough time thinking about them; perhaps it's meant as irony that Tina sings the joyous "River Deep, Mountain High" - about a love that "gets stronger every day" - just after getting a black eye from Ike.
But having to do that kind of mental work yanks you out of the story. So when the song "Private Dancer" turns up to illustrate the moment when Tina, at her nadir, is working as a maid to make ends meet, I had to ignore the lyrics, about a prostitute who will "do what you want me to do," and just enjoy Warren's husky, pungent way with the tune. The same was true when "We Don't Need Another Hero," the apocalyptic anthem from the "Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome" soundtrack, was conscripted for a cremation.
Is it a surprise that a show with 41 credited songwriters cannot sustain a coherent point of view on a main character who sings in 25 of the 27 numbers? Ike, with just a few musical and narrative gestures, is better articulated, and Watts is terrific delivering his gleaming menace.
But Lloyd, in much of her staging, does not serve the book scenes well. The pace is too hectic except when it unaccountably grinds to a halt, which is an odd problem in a show that was already running in London for more than a year before being remounted for Broadway. And perhaps it's only to be expected from the director of "Mamma Mia!" - the show that jump-started the jukebox genre - that the tone is generally coarse and obvious.
Still, whenever you begin to despair of its story, "Tina" (and, with it, Lloyd's sense of buoyancy) roars back in purely non-narrative ways. Suddenly, Bruno Poet's lights bump way up. Mark Thompson's costume designs provide the icons we want: the gold shimmy dress with tiers of fringe, the Alaia red leather mini zipped up the front. And Anthony van Laast's choreography, perhaps too slick in the early scenes, when Tina and the (terrific) Ikettes would not have been so smooth, turns deliciously satisfying in the later ones, when the star owns her body at last.
But what I've just described is a rock concert - which is what "Tina" essentially turns into. It's a blast if that's what you came for. If you meant to see a true union of song and story, though, you won't get it here. Because that, to answer Turner's first question, would be a real musical.

Biden's Iraq pivot: Revisionist nonsense?

Texto completo: Former vice president Joe Biden said in a recent interview he agrees with Jim Mattis that the Obama administration's decision to withdraw troops from Iraq was a mistake, but that as vice president he tried to keep "a residual force" stationed there. This is revisionist nonsense. Just a few months ago, at the July Democratic presidential debate, Biden boasted that "one of the proudest moments of my life was to stand there in Al-Faw Palace and tell everyone that ... all our combat troops are coming home." In September, he declared, "We were right to get the combat troops out." But now he agrees it was a mistake?
The fact is, at the time Biden expressed zero regrets about the complete U.S. withdrawal, which he was in charge of executing. The New York Times reports that in December 2011 Biden was "ebullient" as he presided over the departure ceremony for the last American forces, calling President Barack Obama from Baghdad to tell him "All I've said about this job, I take it back. Thank you for giving me the chance to end this goddamn war."
Of course, he did not actually end the "goddamn war," he unleashed a humanitarian and national security catastrophe. Biden's withdrawal created a vacuum that allowed the Islamic State - which had been reduced to just 700 fighters - to regroup, reconstitute itself and build a murderous caliphate the size of Great Britain. The terrorists enslaved and raped thousands of Yazidi girls and carried out gruesome executions across Iraq and Syria. And they spread their murderous tentacles across the globe, carrying out 143 attacks in 29 countries that killed over 2,000 people and injured many thousands more.
Biden has criticized President Trump for withdrawing from Syria against the advice of our military commanders. Yet Biden did not listen to our military commanders when it came to the Iraq withdrawal. The Times reports that Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, the U.S. commander in Iraq, proposed keeping as many as 24,000 troops in Iraq. According to Biden national security adviser Colin H. Kahl, Austin was told by the White House "you've got to be kidding." So Austin presented Obama and Biden with options for 19,000, 16,000 and 10,000 troops - and told them the lowest number was "unwise." But Biden "aggressively pushed for a smaller force," and Obama agreed. Then, during negotiations with the Iraqis, the administration cut the offer in half to just 5,000 - an offer the Iraqis rejected.
In his interview with the Wall Street Journal, Biden blamed George W. Bush for the U.S. withdrawal, noting that he had negotiated a status of forces agreement that required an end to the U.S. military presence by 2011. Please. Does anyone really believe that if Bush were still in office in 2011, he would have pulled out all U.S. forces? Of course not.
The reason Obama and Biden were unable to get an agreement to extend the U.S. troop presence is because they made it crystal clear to the Iraqis that America was headed for the exits. Iraqis watched as Obama and Biden rejected numbers well above 10,000, only grudgingly agreed to even that number and then cut that number to 5,000. If you were an Iraqi, would this have given you confidence in America's long-term commitment?
Iran and its political allies inside Iraq were pressing for a U.S. withdrawal, and threatening politicians who supported extending the American military presence. For Iraqi leaders, 24,000 American troops might have been worth the political risk, and maybe even 10,000 would have been worth it. But an offer of just 5,000 troops from an administration that was determined to go to zero as quickly as possible was not. If America was leaving, and Iran was staying, why risk siding with the Americans?
In 2013, as the Islamic State was gaining steam, Biden said that he and Obama felt "happy and ... fulfilled" with the decision to withdraw from Iraq. A year later, they would be forced to send U.S. forces back to Iraq to deal with the debacle they had unleashed.
Biden supported the Iraq invasion but then opposed the Bush surge, which crushed the Islamic State and won the war. Then he supported a premature withdrawal that allowed the terrorists to regroup and was celebrating that decision as recently as four months ago - but now says he regrets it. That's quite a record for a man running on his record of experience and judgment.

Texto completo: "There is a profound disconnect between the state-level polling on the horse race and what we're seeing in the national polling. I don't know whether Joe Biden is up by 17 points nationally or if he's only up a couple of points in Wisconsin, but both can't be true."
Ken Goldstein
Political scientist who conducts his own polls
With a year to go before the 2020 election, some national polls show Donald Trump facing daunting, double-digit deficits in his re-election bid.
But the polling in Wisconsin and other swing states paints a far more competitive picture.
Can both be right?
The gap between Trump's worst national polls and his best battleground polls is so big it simply doesn't add up.
But it also reflects something very real about the political landscape: that nationwide surveys don't always capture what's happening in the handful of states most likely to determine the Electoral College winner.
Wisconsin is a prime example. It is at the top of the list of pivotal battlegrounds in the eyes of most analysts, suggesting that public opinion here shouldn't deviate all that much from what it is nationally. Yet Trump has performed consistently better in Wisconsin than he has in nationwide polls.
The president is averaging in the low 40s in job approval in national surveys.
But in Wisconsin, he is at 46% approval in a Marquette Law School poll released two weeks ago, 47% in a New York Times/Siena poll released Monday, 44% in a Fox News poll released last month, and 42% in a poll just released by the Kaiser Family Foundation and Cook Political Report. Trump's average job approval in those four surveys is 45%, far from stellar but not crippling to his re-election prospects either.
"I think the battleground polls are more meaningful" than the national polls, said Diane Feldman, a longtime Democratic pollster who has conducted many surveys in Wisconsin.
The seeming disconnect between national surveys and battleground surveys was highlighted this week when the New York Times published polls showing Trump either tied, narrowly behind or narrowly ahead of his best-known Democratic rivals in the key states of Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Florida, Arizona and North Carolina.
Takeaway: In the states that matter most, the race is up for grabs.
A day later, a nationwide Washington Post-ABC News poll showed Trump trailing Joe Biden by 17 points, Elizabeth Warren by 15 and Bernie Sanders by 14.
Takeaway: Trump is in dire, dire straits.
"There is a profound disconnect between the state-level polling on the horse race and what we're seeing in the national polling. I don't know whether Joe Biden is up by 17 points nationally or if he's only up a couple of points in Wisconsin, but both can't be true," said political scientist Ken Goldstein, who conducts his own polls in Wisconsin and elsewhere.
Part of the explanation involves different pollsters using different methodologies and capturing different cross-sections of voters with different partisan leanings. Feldman said sometimes national polls oversample the populous coasts, which would skew a survey toward Democrats.
Part of the explanation involves the normal variations in polling that always produce occasional outliers.
But that still leaves the fact that, as the 2016 election showed, the Electoral College picture can deviate from the picture of the nation as a whole. Three years ago, Trump won the decisive battlegrounds of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania by under 1 point while losing the national vote by 2 points. If that pattern holds, Democrats might have to win the popular vote by 3 points or more in 2020 to carry the key state battlegrounds they need to win the Electoral College.
Polling since Trump took office reinforces that point.
"In Wisconsin, our (Trump) approval number has been consistently about 3 points higher than his national average," said Charles Franklin, who conducts the Marquette poll. Trump has averaged a little under 46% approval in Wisconsin over the past year in Marquette's polling.
As a result of this gap, anyone focused on the polling in battleground Wisconsin is probably going to get a more competitive picture of the electoral fight than he or she would get from national surveys, where Trump is typically getting approval ratings of 41% to 44% — or, in the case of the Washington-Post-ABC poll, 39%.
"The news this week was unequivocally bad for the White House if you were looking at national polls and unequivocally bad for the Democrats if you were looking at state polls," said Goldstein, a political science professor with the University of San Francisco and before that, the University of Wisconsin-Madison. (The White House also got bad news with the GOP's election setbacks Tuesday, losing legislative control in Virginia and a contest for governor in Kentucky).
"Battleground states are battlegrounds precisely because they're close. We should expect Wisconsin and probably Pennsylvania and North Carolina or Florida and Arizona to be pretty close states," Franklin said.
There have been variations in both the state and national polls. Nationally, an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll shows Trump trailing Biden by 9 points, while Trump's deficit in the Washington Post survey is almost twice as large.
In Wisconsin, a Fox News poll released in early October had Biden leading Trump in Wisconsin by 9 points. The recent Marquette poll had Biden leading by 6. The New York Times/Siena poll had Biden leading by 3.
While the New York Times poll puts Trump's approval here at 47% and Marquette puts it at 46%, the new Kaiser survey puts it at 42%. One thing that could explain these differences is that in the Marquette poll, the mix of Republican and Democratic voters was close to even; in the Kaiser survey, the sample was more Democratic-leaning in its makeup.
But in the case of the state's most frequent poll (by Marquette), Trump's ratings have been remarkably consistent. The president's approval ratings in the last six Marquette polls dating back to October 2018 are: 46, 47, 44, 46, 45 and 46%. Those numbers have deviated even less than you would expect simply from random statistical variation.
Franklin said his numbers are very consistent with the possibility that Trump's true level of approval among all registered voters in Wisconsin hasn't changed at all over the past year.
What do Trump's job ratings in Wisconsin suggest about his prospects of winning the state again?
If you believe that a president's approval rating is highly predictive of the incumbent's share of the vote, that would suggest Trump is at a significant disadvantage in this state right now.
"Every president running for reelection over the last 60 years has received on Election Day a percentage of the popular vote within a point of their job approval number," ABC news analyst Matthew Dowd, a strategist for President George W. Bush who now considers himself an independent, wrote this week.
But some experts believe Trump can and will "overperform" his approval rating, as he over-performed his popularity rating in 2016.
Why? Because so many of his own supporters have such mixed feelings about him personally that it holds down his overall approval rating among people who are happy with key aspects of his performance — such as the economy — and will end up voting for him anyway. Others who dislike Trump may end up disliking the Democratic nominee even more, which happened in 2016.
"He has a vote that goes beyond the voters that approve of him," Feldman said.
Trump's flat approval ratings make it incumbent upon him to drive up the "negatives" of the Democratic nominee, said Ed Goeas, a GOP pollster.
"It's going to be driven by how high the negatives of his opponent are," said Goeas, who doesn't think Trump's approval number is as good a guide to his re-election performance as it has been for past presidents.
"His approval overall is kind of a worst-case scenario for him," he said.
Franklin said the Wisconsin polling suggests "the president's job approval has been consistently net negative, but not enormously so. He has been behind Biden in the (last two Marquette polls) but quite competitive with the other Democrats."
The Marquette pollster said, "it would be wrong to see the state as anything other than close," with Trump still facing an "uphill" battle due to his negative ratings.
"Everyone's obsession with Wisconsin isn't just hype. It's truly competitive," Goldstein said. "Trump is very much in a gray area, where he would be in trouble if this were a pure referendum (on him) but has a chance because it's going to be a choice."
Feldman, the Democratic pollster, said "We are maybe looking at a situation that is more similar to 2016 than (Democrats) would like it to be," meaning a very narrowly decided contest.
If that is true, then after all this time, Wisconsin would be right back where it was in the last election — on a knife's edge.
"There is a profound disconnect between the state-level polling on the horse race and what we're seeing in the national polling. I don't know whether Joe Biden is up by 17 points nationally or if he's only up a couple of points in Wisconsin, but both can't be true."

Texto completo: If you are looking for the perfect gift for your most stylish friend, several new books are bound to please. While the words "icon" or "legendary" get thrown around loosely, these books all feature true masters of style in different genres: men's and women's fashion, music and art. Whether it's getting a rare peek behind the making of Chanel's haute couture collection or slice-of-life images of New York street style, there's something guaranteed to delight and inspire any reader. \
"Bowie: An Illustrated Life"
By María Hesse and Fran Ruiz
One of the most innovative artists of the 20th century, David Bowie created work that crossed genres and shattered boundaries. This inventive biography told through María Hesse's hip illustrations and text by Fran Ruiz explores his life from his working-class childhood as David Jones to his transformation to David Bowie and eventual superstardom to the final recording sessions before his death from cancer in 2016. Told from Bowie's viewpoint, readers follow along his personal and professional life and meet many of the famous musicians he interacted with, including Iggy Pop, Brian Eno, Freddie Mercury and others. $21.95

"Chanel: The Making of a Collection"
By Laetitia Cenac, Illustrated by Jean-Philippe Delhome
Rarely can mere mortals glimpse how a fashion collection comes together from idea to fruition, but the new book about the House of Chanel by fashion writer Laetitia Cenac pulls back the curtains. This 240-page book contains hundreds of color illustrations by famed artist Jean-Philippe Delhomme detailing Karl Lagerfeld's Spring 2019 collection -- Lagerfeld's last before his death. The book also highlights the work of the artisans who create the fashion house's distinct style, the embroiderers, flower-makers, shoemakers and many others. Cenac weaves in the history of the iconic house with its contemporary collections. $35

"I've Seen the Future and I'm Not Going: The Art Scene and Downtown New York in the 1980s"
By Peter McGough
In his memoir, artist Peter McGough tells of that almost-mythical time in New York's pregentrified Lower East Side in the 1980s, when he fell into the East Village's art scene, getting to know artists like Andy Warhol, Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat, and frequenting mythic locations like Studio 54 and the Chelsea Hotel.
When McGough first moved to New York in 1980, he met and fell in love with another artist, David McDermott, and has collaborated with him ever since. McDermott and McGough became as well-known for their work in painting and photography as much as their lifestyle, which embraced a Victorian aesthetic in all they did, including wearing top hats and detachable collars and living in a converted townhouse lit only by candlelight.
Their paintings were backdated to various decades, depending on the subject, adding a highly conceptual element to the work, and their photography was produced in historical processes such as cyanotype, gum bichromate and salt prints, leading the duo to became hugely successful, and showing in three Whitney Biennials. Told with humor, McGough looks back at their professional and romantic partnership and struggles. $29.95

"Hunks & Heroes: Jim Moore Four Decades of Fashion at GQ"
By Jim Moore
Few editors have had such an influence on men's fashion as Jim Moore, GQ magazine's famed creative director at large. For nearly 40 years, Moore shaped modern men's fashion, discovering new designers, highlighting trends and giving fashion advice and critiques. The book contains 250 of Moore's legendary fashion photographs that showcase in an eye-popping manner the magazine's most memorable covers, many in a double gatefold. It's not simply a look book of cool covers and celebrities but also includes Moore's commentary and shows the evolution of men's style through the decades. Classic covers include a 1980s "American Gigolo"-era Richard Gere and Kanye West, who does the forward for the 352-page book. $75

"Bill Cunningham: On the Street: Five Decades of Iconic Photography"
By The New York Times
From the 1970s until his death in 2016, New York Times photographer Bill Cunningham captured New York street style almost daily. A new book by the newspaper chronicles through his eyes not only how fashion changed over nearly 50 years, but also how people and culture changed. The book focuses heavily on style -- it includes essays and contributions from Anna Wintour, Guy Trebay and others -- but also on important moments, such as the 1980s New York transit strike, the rise of casual Fridays and President Barack Obama's inauguration. The 384-page book contains famous Cunningham photographs that ran in The New York Times and many never-seen-before images of how he captured life. $65

Mini Maker Faire serves as community show and tell

Texto completo: Innovators, engineers, hobbyists, tinkerers, and anyone else who falls under the rubric of "inventor," will meet for a community-wide show and tell. The occasion is the "Pensacola Mini Maker Faire Presented by UWF Hal Marcus College of Science and Engineering," from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., Nov. 16, at Downtown's Museum Plaza and Pensacola Historic Village. Admission is free but a ticket is required through pensacolamakerfaire.com.
"We have makers of all kinds...from a second grade magician, Universe Glitch, right up to Jane McGonigal, a New York Times Best-Selling author," said Michelle Sarra, who co-directed the Faire. "You can learn how to make a cosplay costume, a pinata, brew beer, blacksmith, print in 3D, build a Baja Car or try virtual welding."
The Mini Maker Faire is a UWF event under license from Make Co., the founders of Make: Magazine. Its editors started the faire in the San Francisco Bay area in 2006, and it has since mushroomed into a global network of like events. The Hal Marcus College of Science and Engineering applied to stage one in Pensacola and was awarded a one-day "Mini Maker Faire."
"We (HMCSE) wanted to expand our collaborative experiences/successes into the local and regional community, and Maker Faire is the perfect platform to showcase how (art, science, music) can synergistically work together to become powerful makers," said Joe Picenza, assistant professor, Mechanical Engineering at HMCSE.
The faire wears that synergy on its sleeve, drawing participation from the likes of First City Art Center, West Florida Public Library, Pensacola MESS Hall, Pensacola Museum of Art, The Marketing Bar, and Pensacon. In all, the faire attracted 94 applicants, nearly double what was expected.
A big attraction for the inaugural faire is Jane McGonigal, a game designer and a charismatic guru for the industry who will speak from 1-2:30 p.m. at the Museum of Commerce, 201 E. Zaragoza St.
"We wanted a keynote speaker who shared our vision of cross-domain collaborations, and specifically those with tangible results meant to inspire others," said Picenza. "We believe this appealed to McGonigal's work in game design, where she enables individuals with different backgrounds and skill sets to tackle common real-world challenges through gaming."
Besides McGonigal the faire is bringing other makers from around the nation. For example, "Be the Hamster," from Orlando, invites passersby to create a snow cone by running inside a giant wheel in the guise of an exercising rodent. From Huntsville, Alabama, is a display of high-voltage "Musical Tesla Coils" named for the father of modern technology, Nikola Tesla. "The Flaming Royal Trumpets," based in Rochester, New York, is a series of kinetic propane effects. The wirelessly-triggered pyrotechnics will serve as a preview for the Mini Maker Faire during Gallery Night, 5:30-7:30 p.m., Nov. 15, at the Museum of Commerce.
Local entries represent a gamut of civic creativity. Experience experimental sound sculpture, PSC's virtual welding lab and tiny house demonstration, skateboard making, the crafty outfit Bare Hand Collective, The 309 Punk House Project, ax throwing, 350 Pensacola, inflatable architecture, a solar car, rockets, many facets of 3D printing, and plenty of robots including Nadia, the gymnast-inspired humanoid by the Institute for Human and Machine Cognition.
Offering an interactive experience is the Gulf Coast Quilt Trail, a series of barn quilts stationed beyond the periphery of the Faire.
"We signed up for the Maker Faire to educate the community on the phenomena of Barn Quilt Trails," explained Heather Ensley, president of the Pensacola Quilters Guild. "It is currently the largest grass roots public art movement in the country."
Despite its name, a barn quilt is a wooden or aluminum square painted with a geometric pattern characteristic of a stitched quilt. These sanctioned markers serve as bespoke rural tags. It originated in Ohio in 2001 and other barn quilts followed, inspiring a "trail." The movement spread to the South but the quilts had yet to reach the Gulf Coast until the Guild secured a $5,000 grant to commission one during the Great Gulfcoast Arts Festival. This subsequent barn quilt trail is a repeat performance.
"So as part of the Maker Faire we are going to demonstrate these unique art supplies and host a scavenger hunt of the pop-up quilt trail," she said.
There's also beer on tap via local brewers of all levels. The more-established Pensacola Bay Brewery is offering tours of its nearby digs. A Little Madness Brewing will sample its latest pours while Alga Beer Co., a new start-up, will pair its brews with crafty tap handles, an art form all to its own.
Some makers are fairly new. Chris Ryan just started his line of custom epoxy resin signs six months ago out of his garage. He picked up carpentry from his father and his mother is an artist.
"As an adult I took an interest in fine woodworking and thanks to the internet, learned the skills necessary to build the things I wanted," Ryan explained. "My main goal for participating in the maker faire is to inspire others down the path of making."

What polls don't tell you about Trump's standing in Wisconsin

Texto completo: With a year to go before the 2020 election, some national polls show Donald Trump facing daunting, double-digit deficits in his re-election bid.
But the polling in Wisconsin and other swing states paints a far more competitive picture.
Can both be right?
The gap between Trump's worst national polls and his best battleground polls is so big it simply doesn't add up.
But it also reflects something very real about the political landscape: that nationwide surveys don't always capture what's happening in the handful of states most likely to determine the Electoral College winner.
Wisconsin is a prime example. It is at the top of the list of pivotal battlegrounds in the eyes of most analysts, suggesting that public opinion here shouldn't deviate all that much from what it is nationally. Yet Trump has performed consistently better in Wisconsin than he has in nationwide polls.
The president is averaging in the low 40s in job approval in national surveys.
But in Wisconsin, he is at 46% approval in a Marquette Law School poll released two weeks ago, 47% in a New York Times/Siena poll released Monday, 44% in a Fox News poll released last month, and 42% in a poll just released by the Kaiser Family Foundation and Cook Political Report. Trump's average job approval in those four surveys is 45%, far from stellar but not crippling to his re-election prospects either.
"I think the battleground polls are more meaningful" than the national polls, said Diane Feldman, a longtime Democratic pollster who has conducted many surveys in Wisconsin.
The seeming disconnect between national surveys and battleground surveys was highlighted this week when the New York Times published polls showing Trump either tied, narrowly behind or narrowly ahead of his best-known Democratic rivals in the key states of Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Florida, Arizona and North Carolina.
Takeaway: In the states that matter most, the race is up for grabs.
A day later, a nationwide Washington Post-ABC News poll showed Trump trailing Joe Biden by 17 points, Elizabeth Warren by 15 and Bernie Sanders by 14.
Takeaway: Trump is in dire, dire straits.
"There is a profound disconnect between the state-level polling on the horse race and what we're seeing in the national polling. I don't know whether Joe Biden is up by 17 points nationally or if he's only up a couple of points in Wisconsin, but both can't be true," said political scientist Ken Goldstein, who conducts his own polls in Wisconsin and elsewhere.
Part of the explanation involves different pollsters using different methodologies and capturing different cross-sections of voters with different partisan leanings. Feldman said sometimes national polls oversample the populous coasts, which would skew a survey toward Democrats.
Part of the explanation involves the normal variations in polling that always produce occasional outliers.
But that still leaves the fact that, as the 2016 election showed, the Electoral College picture can deviate from the picture of the nation as a whole. Three years ago, Trump won the decisive battlegrounds of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania by under 1 point while losing the national vote by 2 points.
If that pattern holds, Democrats might have to win the popular vote by 3 points or more in 2020 to carry the key state battlegrounds they need to win the Electoral College.
Polling since Trump took office reinforces that point.
"In Wisconsin, our (Trump) approval number has been consistently about 3 points higher than his national average," said Charles Franklin, who conducts the Marquette poll. Trump has averaged a little under 46% approval in Wisconsin over the past year in Marquette's polling.
As a result of this gap, anyone focused on the polling in battleground Wisconsin is probably going to get a more competitive picture of the electoral fight than he or she would get from national surveys, where Trump is typically getting approval ratings of 41% to 44% — or, in the case of the Washington-Post-ABC poll, 39%.
"The news this week was unequivocally bad for the White House if you were looking at national polls and unequivocally bad for the Democrats if you were looking at state polls," said Goldstein, a political science professor with the University of San Francisco and before that, the University of Wisconsin-Madison. (The White House also got bad news with the GOP's election setbacks Tuesday, losing legislative control in Virginia and a contest for governor in Kentucky).
"Battleground states are battlegrounds precisely because they're close. We should expect Wisconsin and probably Pennsylvania and North Carolina or Florida and Arizona to be pretty close states," Franklin said.
There have been variations in both the state and national polls. Nationally, an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll shows Trump trailing Biden by 9 points, while Trump's deficit in the Washington Post survey is almost twice as large.
In Wisconsin, a Fox News poll released in early October had Biden leading Trump in Wisconsin by 9 points. The recent Marquette poll had Biden leading by 6. The New York Times/Siena poll had Biden leading by 3.
While the New York Times poll puts Trump's approval here at 47% and Marquette puts it at 46%, the new Kaiser survey puts it at 42%. One thing that could explain these differences is that in the Marquette poll, the mix of Republican and Democratic voters was close to even; in the Kaiser survey, the sample was more Democratic-leaning in its makeup.
But in the case of the state's most frequent poll (by Marquette), Trump's ratings have been remarkably consistent. The president's approval ratings in the last six Marquette polls dating back to October 2018 are: 46, 47, 44, 46, 45 and 46%. Those numbers have deviated even less than you would expect simply from random statistical variation.
Franklin said his numbers are very consistent with the possibility that Trump's true level of approval among all registered voters in Wisconsin hasn't changed at all over the past year.
What do Trump's job ratings in Wisconsin suggest about his prospects of winning the state again?
If you believe that a president's approval rating is highly predictive of the incumbent's share of the vote, that would suggest Trump is at a significant disadvantage in this state right now.
"Every president running for reelection over the last 60 years has received on Election Day a percentage of the popular vote within a point of their job approval number," ABC news analyst Matthew Dowd, a strategist for President George W. Bush who now considers himself an independent, wrote this week.
But some experts believe Trump can and will "overperform" his approval rating, as he over-performed his popularity rating in 2016.
Why? Because so many of his own supporters have such mixed feelings about him personally that it holds down his overall approval rating among people who are happy with key aspects of his performance — such as the economy — and will end up voting for him anyway. Others who dislike Trump may end up disliking the Democratic nominee even more, which happened in 2016.
"He has a vote that goes beyond the voters that approve of him," Feldman said.
Trump's flat approval ratings make it incumbent upon him to drive up the "negatives" of the Democratic nominee, said Ed Goeas, a GOP pollster.
"It's going to be driven by how high the negatives of his opponent are," said Goeas, who doesn't think Trump's approval number is as good a guide to his re-election performance as it has been for past presidents.
"His approval overall is kind of a worst-case scenario for him," he said.
Franklin said the Wisconsin polling suggests "the president's job approval has been consistently net negative, but not enormously so. He has been behind Biden in the (last two Marquette polls) but quite competitive with the other Democrats."
The Marquette pollster said, "it would be wrong to see the state as anything other than close," with Trump still facing an "uphill" battle due to his negative ratings.
"Everyone's obsession with Wisconsin isn't just hype. It's truly competitive," Goldstein said. "Trump is very much in a gray area, where he would be in trouble if this were a pure referendum (on him) but has a chance because it's going to be a choice."
Feldman, the Democratic pollster, said "We are maybe looking at a situation that is more similar to 2016 than (Democrats) would like it to be," meaning a very narrowly decided contest.
If that is true, then after all this time, Wisconsin would be right back where it was in the last election — on a knife's edge.

Texto completo: Sean Brock, the James Beard Award-winning author of "Heritage" follows up his nationally acclaimed debut book with a decidedly enthusiastic probe into the nurturing and connecting qualities of his favorite cuisine with "South: Essential Recipes and New Explorations."
With an immutable passion for preserving and restoring heirloom ingredients, Brock offers up 125 recipes in "South," with chapters that include everything from "Snacks and Dishes to Share" to "Grains," "Vegetables and Sides" and even a section titled "Pantry," complete with recipes and tips for preserving and canning — not to mention two full pages on "How To Make Vinegar."
Brock was the founding chef of the award-winning Husk restaurants and is now the chef and owner of Audrey, a distinctly unique dining destination set to open in east Nashville next year.
Brock has been recognized with the James Beard Award for Best Chef Southeast in 2010 and was a finalist for Outstanding Chef in 2013, 2014, and 2015. He has appeared on the TV series "Chef's Table" and "The Mind of a Chef," for which he was nominated for an Emmy.
Raised in rural Virginia, Brock now lives in Nashville.
You made a national name for yourself crafting the heritage cuisine of the award-winning Husk restaurants in Charleston and Greenville, South Carolina, Savannah, Georgia, and Nashville. Tell me about your decision to shift gears and settle in Nashville as you start a new chapter of your life and career.
After my son was born, I had a health scare the last couple of years. I realized that I have to take better care of myself. I was working way too much and I worried way too much. I was operating eight restaurants in five cities. Finally, I had to say "goodbye" to that chapter and start a new path.
Your first book, "Heritage," won the James Beard Award for Best American Cookbook and the IACP Julia Child First Book Award, and was called "the blue ribbon chef cookbook of the year" by the New York Times. Were you surprised by its huge success, and would you say that this achievement that helped change your career path?
I can hardly fathom that I ever even got a book deal — and that there would be so much interest in what I was doing with food.
Writing a book is really scary. With my first book, I knew I had one shot to get it out there the way I wanted. There is a gap of about a year between writing a book and getting it published — and a lot can happen in between. Once it's out there, it's out there. All I could do was cross my fingers and hope people would get into it. I remember holding it in my hands after it first came out, and seeing others holding it in their hands. That's when it became real to me.
Winning the James Beard Award was such a stretch that I could have never even imagined it. I remember that day and what a whirlwind of excitement it was.
I think that book came out at a perfect time in America because I began to realize people were really, really interested in Southern food. As a place, it has many cuisines, not just one. It has a strong historical aspect that affects its present and future.
You have said that you believe Southern cuisine ranks among the best in the world. Please tell me about "South," and your motivations for writing it. What message do you want this book to convey?
It's about how we all can contribute to our own food history. The way I see it, place has its own ingredients and its own cultural influences and natural geography. That's how cuisine is shaped — restoring the old so we can now have the new. We look to many cultures much older than ours and how they handled their ingredients. It's important that we can all contribute something to our own culinary history.
You grew up in the Appalachian Mountains of Virginia, and attended cooking school in Charleston while you were still a teenager. What influenced your early culinary interests at such a young age?
I grew up living with my grandmother for a while. I was around 11 to 14 years old at that time, and those were such formative years. I loved eating at her table and being in her garden. It gave me a different perspective about food, and I just fell in love with it.
I started working in (restaurant) kitchens at age 15. Food Network had just started on TV, and that was where I began to see that side of food preparation as a more serious craft.
Thanks to my grandmother, I learned the power of food to nurture and comfort, and I never wanted to do anything else.

Texto completo: Is mixing these brands a brilliant idea? Or is it like putting Burger King inside McDonald's?
So the dust has settled on the sale of the stores once known as Barneys New York. The final shopping has begun at their soon-to-be-vacated locations, and the social media mourning is in full swing. Saks has emerged as a caretaker of the retail self of a former rival, licensed to Saks's parent company by Authentic Brands Group, which bought Barneys' intellectual property.
Now the drumroll has begun for a new concept: Barneys-at-Saks. It is a ... something ... that will possibly be on the fifth floor of the Saks department store in New York, and will possibly be about 50,000 square feet, and will possibly be, well, no one is exactly sure. I've been a customer at both -- Saks for its accessible elegance, Barneys for its more rarefied cool -- for much of my adult shopping life, and days after the news broke, I'm still trying to understand what this new hybrid could be.
During the bankruptcy auction, Marc Metrick, the chief executive of Saks, and Tracy Margolies, the chief merchant, sent a letter to the company's partners that gives a little hint: "We are working to best understand what customers love about the brand and how we can bring that forward as we evolve it into a new interpretation that is relevant for today's luxury consumer."
But what exactly will that new interpretation be? Isn't shopping in a Barneys at Saks sort of like browsing a Nike section at an Adidas shop or grabbing a Whopper at the home of the Big Mac? It's confusing to the taste buds and redundant in the Darwinian order of things.
To be fair, the license for the name apparently didn't cost Saks too much -- the company expects to devote only "minimal financial resources," according to the letter. So perhaps for Saks, the optics of becoming the big retail whale, swallowing its rival whole, may be worth the confusion. Saks might also believe that Barneys is that rare mercantile unicorn: a store that transcends the goods it sells.
They are betting, in effect, on the anthropomorphism of retail.
That's the premise, anyway, of this unexpected move by A.B.G., the company that owns the Barneys brand. A.B.G. is presuming that in today's multiplatform world, a brand name and what it stands for is the most valuable form of commodity. Products are fungible and of secondary consideration, and A.B.G. has proof of concept for this strategy in the form of celebrities such as Marilyn Monroe, Muhammad Ali and Elvis Presley, among other branded people, like Judith Leiber and Vince Camuto, whose trademarks A.B.G. also owns and licenses.
This may be true for individuals, who endure through voice and image in photos and films. That lasting record preserves the meaning of their names even as they are slapped on mugs sold at Walmart. And this may make sense for a designer brand with its own creative archive. But a store is a different matter.
Especially a store that does not itself make anything, but simply selects -- or in today's parlance, "curates." That sort of store, which is to say, the Barneys sort of store, is above all given meaning not just through its physical presence, its décor and the products it stocks, but also through the people it attracts. So it has been from the Greek agora through Zola's "The Ladies Paradise": the gathering place of the group. It is this constantly evolving give-and-take between animating principles that makes a store a destination.
When other retail pairings have worked -- Topshop at Nordstrom, Maria Luisa at Printemps in Paris -- it is because they represent two entirely different points of view, each with its own clubhouse. Even if A.B.G. might keep a Barneys store in Boston or open one in Greenwich, Conn., as rumor has it, it won't be the same without the Madison Avenue flagship.
Shorn of its once idiosyncratic temples to cool and separated by generations from the man who gave his name to the store (there really was a Barney, and his grandson Gene at least tried to be the embodiment of the cool the brand was selling) and absent a recognizable brand semiology like Bloomingdale's Big Brown Bag, Barneys becomes just a word. And a memory.
Arguably, the generation for whom the store was most resonant -- those who came of age in the "Sex and the City" era, when Barneys was shorthand for New York's most impenetrably chic inner circle -- are already past target-consumer age. And for those who are the targets, Gens Y and Z, Barneys means very little. It's just another passé department store, like Bonwit Teller or B. Altman, where their parents or grandparents used to shop.
It is possible that Saks can change that, by imbuing its Barneys with totally different products and a palpable attitude. Barneys could become, for example, an incubator for new designers, which it sort of was back in the day. It is possible this could signal a whole new stage in retail relationships. A.B.G.'s chief executive told Women's Wear Daily that other luxury retailers have already made inquiries. Just imagine it: Barneys at Lane Crawford! Barneys at Tsum! Barneys at Selfridges!
And it is possible that in the time it takes Barneys at Saks to materialize, former Barneys shoppers will nurture their nostalgia instead of moving on and will ultimately migrate to Barneys at Saks because they still want those particular branded French fries, rather than the other type of branded fries.
But it is also possible that at some point they will just shrug their shoulders and acknowledge they come from the same potatoes. And that the next era of retail really requires cooking up something entirely different.

Texto completo: past 7 myths that belong in the past by Jen Gunter, M.d. As an Ob-gyn, I've personally encountered many fertility myths in my office or online -- some of them even during my training. Why do they persist? Sex education, particularly about the physiology of reproduction, is typically incomplete and subpar. And when we do talk about fertility and reproduction, we don't talk about it directly -- euphemisms for the uterus, menstruation, the vagina and the vulva are still common, and when you can't use a word, the implication is that the body part is shameful. And, of course, many myths persist simply because they're alluringly fantastical, and we're inclined to believe these tall tales over the stodgy facts. Here are seven fertility myths that need to be forgotten.
1 Phases of the moon affect menstruation
This is not an uncommon belief -- some women even refer to menstruation as their "moon time." The confusion is understandable: The 29.5-day lunar cycle (from new moon to new moon) is very close to the average 28-day menstrual cycle. But studies show no connection between the moon and menses. Moreover, it is hard to envision how a moon-menstruation connection would be biologically beneficial to human reproduction. 2 reproductive hormones need to be 'in balance'
This is a common modern myth in gynecology exam rooms all across North America -- and it results in a lot of unnecessary testing of hormone levels. The truth is that, for women of reproductive age, the hormone levels for FSH, LH, estrogen and progesterone change not only day to day, but also often hour to hour. When a woman has certain symptoms -- for example, an irregular menstrual cycle or infertility -- hormone testing may be recommended to make a diagnosis. Butin these situations, doctors will look at individual levels in conjunction with symptoms, rather than comparing levels with some mythical "balance." Being "in balance" may sound natural, like a person who is "in tune" with her body. But it is simply not a factual statement, or even a good analogy, for what happens biologically. 3 Lying prone after sex increases chances of becoming pregnant
"How long should I lie flat after sex?" is one of the most common questions asked of OB-GYNs. The myth is that sperm will rush back out of your body once you're standing up because of the effects of gravity. But most sperm with any chance of fertilization have gone past the point of no return almost immediately. There are no studies that establish a correlation between the length of postcoital recumbent time and subsequent pregnancy rates -- but there is a large study that examined pregnancy rates after insemination in a doctor's office. That study concluded there was no difference in pregnancy rates between people who spent 15 minutes lying flat versus those who got up and moved around as soon as the procedure was completed. 4 Women were never meant to go through menopause
The myth is that menopause isn't natural because for most of history women did not live long enough to experience it -- a misconception born both of a mischaracterization of life expectancy and of the way that society has historically tied a woman's worth to her reproductive capacity. Although it's true that for centuries the average life expectancy for women was less than 50 years, it's not as if women were dying en masse at 50, having lived long enough to satisfy evolution. In fact, if you exclude infant and childhood mortality (which were largely due to a lack of basic medical care, sanitation and immunizations), the life expectancy of women, even before 1900, rises sharply. Women in the 17th century who survived the traditionally perilous gantlet of childbirth had an average life expectancy of 60 years. For that matter, the life expectancy for men was never much longer -- yet for some reason society has never needed an explanation for the age-related decline in reproductive function in men. 5 The female orgasm can't just be for pleasure -- it must be related to improving the chance of pregnancy
The bulk of the evidence tells us that female orgasm does not affect conception one way or the other. If it did, orgasms would most likely almost always occur with penile penetration; but the reality is that they occur only 25 percent to 33 percent of the time. For orgasm to affect sperm transport -- and hence conception -- it would also have to occur immediately before or during the male orgasm, which, well, is uncommon. In reality, many women achieve orgasm once or more before their male partner does -- or after, or not at all. 6 The human papillomavirus vaccine is associated with premature ovarian failure
Myths and fears about vaccinations have been around almost as long as vaccines have, and fertility-related myths are no exception. This myth was propagated by six cases of premature ovarian failure that were described in the HPV vaccine literature, in what is known as a case series. But this is not proof -- although it did prompt a number of provocative headlines that gave birth to this myth. Fortunately, a much larger study, involving more than 199,000 women, tells us that there is no association between HPV vaccination and premature ovarian failure. 7 Men stay fertile forever
It's a common myth that all men can reproduce until their 80s. And it's true that we see some celebrities in their 50s, 60s and even their 70s announcing their new fatherhood (almost always with a much younger female partner). But both sexes experience an age-related decline in fertility. For women, the decline begins in their 30s, and by their mid-40s, pregnancies without reproductive assistance are rare. For the aging male, erectile dysfunction increases with age, and the quality of seminal fluid and sperm also declines. Men over 51 (notably, this is also the average age of menopause for women) experience a significant decrease in success with infertility therapies. It is true that men don't experience the same absolute reproductive cutoff that women do, but every discussion about age and fertility should also include men. Jen Gunter, M.D., an OB-GYN, is a regular contributor to The New York Times, the host of the web docuseries "Jensplaining" and the author of "The Vagina Bible."

St. Petersburg has had more pedestrians killed this year than homicides. This troubling trend is also reflected in national statistics: 2018 saw the highest number of pedestrians and bicyclists killed in the United States since 1990. While encouraging more walkers and bikers is commendable and creates a more sustainable transportation system, their safety is paramount. This is a community issue more than a law enforcement issue, and better safety will require more vigilance by drivers, walkers and bikers alike.

From January to October in 2018, seven pedestrians were killed in fatal crashes while walking on the streets of St. Petersburg. Whats more frightening is that double that number14 pedestrians  already have been killed in the city this year. The Tampa Bay area has long been known as one of the countrys most dangerous places to be a pedestrian or a bicyclist. Pedestrian fatalities in Hillsborough and Pinellas counties still make up a large portion of total traffic crash deaths. In the first six months of this year, crashes involving pedestrians only made up about 2.6 percent of all vehicle-involved crashes in Pinellas and Hillsborough, but pedestrian fatalities made up 32 percent of all deaths from car crashes. Less than 1 percent of all traffic crashes resulted in deaths, while almost 9 percent of all pedestrian crashes resulted in death.

Nationally, the numbers arent any better. An average of 17 pedestrians and two bicyclists were killed in crashes every day in America in 2018, reports The New York Times. The number of pedestrians killed rose by 3.4 percent to 6,283 walkers last year, even though the number of traffic deaths went down. Thats what is so worrisome about these numbers. Pedestrian and bicyclist fatalities are rising as other traffic crash-related deaths decline.

St. Petersburg is not unaware. In May, the City Council approved a 20-year Complete Streets program that would add more crosswalks, bike lanes and other safety methods to streets around the city. The city has already added wide bike lanes to major thoroughfares, like those on Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Street N between 4th and 30th Avenues N, which has been controversial. At the same time, the St. Petersburg Police Department recently received a contract for almost $80,000 to conduct specialized traffic enforcement focused on bicyclist and pedestrian safety from October to May. It will take multiple approaches to keep pedestrians and bicyclists safer.

As cities such as St. Petersburg continue to create neighborhoods and urban cores that encourage walking and biking, the design of public spaces and the approach of law enforcement should continue to evolve. Pedestrian deaths have to go down. The vigilance of drivers has to go up.

President Rules Out Complete Rollback of Tariffs on China as Talks Continue

Texto completo: The president indicated he has not yet decided which tariffs he might eliminate as part of an initial trade agreement.
WASHINGTON -- President Trump on Friday said he had not yet agreed to roll back any of the tariffs he had imposed on China and that, if a deal is reached, he would not eliminate all of the levies he's placed on $ 360 billion worth of goods.
His comments came after a day of White House infighting as the administration debates how many concessions to make in order to reach a trade pact that would help resolve a yearlong fight between the world's largest economies.
Officials from the United States and China have agreed that, if an initial deal is reached, it would eliminate some of the tariffs that the two countries have placed on each others' goods.
American officials have discussed rolling back levies on more than $ 100 billion of Chinese food, clothing, lawn mowers and other products that were imposed on Sept. 1, according to people briefed on the discussions. That would still leave tariffs on at least $ 250 billion of Chinese imports in place, as well as the potential for another round of tariffs in December.
The Chinese government indicated Thursday that both sides had committed to removing some tariffs as part of any deal. But not everyone inside the White House is on board with that plan. Some of Mr. Trump's more hawkish advisers have urged him to avoid removing any levies as part of a "Phase 1" trade deal unless China commits to significant concessions that have so far proved elusive.
On Friday, Mr. Trump signaled that, while China wants all the tariffs removed, he was unwilling to do away with them entirely.
"They'd like to have a roll back -- I have not agreed to anything," Mr. Trump told reporters before departing the White House.
"China would like to get somewhat of a rollback, not a complete rollback, because they know I won't do it," he said.
Stocks, which started the day lower, dipped more after the president's comments. But the S&P 500 was down a scant 0.1 percent. It was the latest in a series of muted sessions, in which small gains have nonetheless pushed the market to record highs.
Analysts have speculated that America's tariffs could be phased out over time as China meets certain benchmarks, opens its markets to foreign firms, purchases billions of dollars of agricultural product from the United States and demonstrates that it is following through on commitments to respect American intellectual property.
White House advisers are considering different strategies for rolling off existing tariffs, according to people briefed on their plans. One option is to roll more tariffs off initially, but set up a mechanism to have them snap back into place if China doesn't keep its commitments to respect American intellectual property, open its markets to foreign firms and purchase billions of dollars of agricultural product from the United States. Another strategy would involve rolling off fewer tariffs up front and more after time as China meets certain commitments.
Mr. Trump's more moderate advisers have warned him that the tariffs, which are inflicting pain on farmers and manufacturers, could hurt him politically as he heads into re-election. But his more hawkish advisers are pressing him to keep the levies in place until China agrees to make more significant changes to its economic practices, such as ending state subsidies to Chinese companies.
American officials on Thursday said that China's announcement that the two sides had reached an agreement to roll back tariffs if a phase 1 deal is reached were correct. And Larry Kudlow, the chairman of the White House's National Economic Council, told Bloomberg News that "if there's a Phase 1 trade deal, there are going to be tariff agreements and concessions."
Later in the day, Peter Navarro, one of Mr. Trump's trade advisers, said that it was too soon to say that tariffs would be rolled back and that the president had not made a decision. In a further sign of internal dissension, Mr. Navarro sent an email to members of the media on Friday in which he lamented that initial reports about a tariff rollback were triggered by "propagandists within the Chinese government."
"This claim was simply false," Mr. Navarro said. "There was no such agreement."
China has made clear it will not agree to a trade deal without some lifting of tariffs. But any easing of levies would open Mr. Trump to criticism from his political opponents, particularly if the United States does not receive major concessions in return. Right now, the trade deal under discussion would require Beijing to buy more farm goods, open certain markets and do more to protect American technology and intellectual property. But it would not resolve some of the bigger concerns about China's economic practices, including its ongoing subsidization of industries, which allows Chinese companies to grow quickly and sell their products more cheaply.
On Friday, Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic minority leader from New York and a longtime China critic, urged the president to keep the pressure on China.
"President Trump shouldn't be giving in to China unless we get something big in return," Mr. Schumer said on Twitter.
It is still unclear when and where a deal might be inked.
White House officials had been targeting the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit scheduled for later this month in Chile as a venue where Mr. Trump and President Xi Jinping of China could meet and close the deal. That plan was derailed last week when the Chilean government canceled the summit amid political unrest in the country.
Mr. Trump said that if a signing ceremony with Mr. Xi takes place, he would like it to be held in the United States. He suggested that Iowa or somewhere in "farm country" would be preferable.
"It will be in our country," Mr. Trump said.
Still, the president said that an agreement was not a sure thing and insisted, as he had before, that China was more interested in a deal than he was.
"I never like to talk about things before we have them," Mr. Trump said.

Texto completo: In a letter, workers asked executives to treat those who will lose their jobs humanely while giving people who remain more say in decisions.
In the latest sign of worker activism in tech companies and start-ups, a group of employees at the struggling office-space giant WeWork are calling on management to treat workers humanely as the company prepares to lay off thousands, and to give workers a say in corporate decisions and policies.
Alluding to the controversies that have dogged the company and its co-founder Adam Neumann, the workers said in a letter to management that they were seeking to restore values they say top executives disregarded. Under an exit package worth around $ 1 billion, Mr. Neumann agreed last month to give up control of WeWork.
"We don't want to be defined by the scandals, the corruption, and the greed exhibited by the company's leadership," the group, which calls itself the WeWorkers Coalition, wrote. "We want to leave behind a legacy that represents the true character and intentions of WeWork employees."
WeWork leases office space, refurbishes it and then rents it out to customers. As it has expanded across the world at breakneck speed, the company's costs have far exceeded its revenue. The company is now trying to shut down or sell noncore businesses, withdraw from unprofitable markets and cut its work force, which totaled more than 12,500 employees at the end of June.
Facing a cash crunch, WeWork secured a multibillion-dollar bailout last month from SoftBank, the Japanese conglomerate, which is its largest outside investor. Marcelo Claure, a SoftBank executive who was appointed WeWork's executive chairman, is overseeing the restructuring. Earlier, in September, WeWork withdrew an initial public offering after investors balked at buying shares in a company with huge losses and weak corporate governance.
In their letter to management, which was delivered Tuesday, employees refer to the financial hardship many of them will soon face as a result of the restructuring and demand that those who are laid off receive severance pay, continued health benefits and compensation for devalued stock options.
More than 150 WeWork employees have signed the letter, and more than 500 have joined a channel on Slack, the corporate messaging system, that the group set up last weekend. Alan Friedman, a WeWork software engineer who helped organize the coalition, said the group included engineers, architects, customer support representatives, cleaning staff and other employees.
In a statement, a spokeswoman for the company, Erin Clark, said Mr. Claure "cares deeply about our employees and treating those who are laid off as part of the restructuring fairly, with dignity and respect." She said he welcomed "feedback" from employees.
On Thursday evening, Mr. Claure responded to the group with an email that indicated he took their concerns seriously, but with little elaboration, and did not acknowledge the workers' request for a meeting.
The letter also asks WeWork to be open about the fate of cleaners and other facilities employees who were recently informed that the company planned to transfer them and the work they do to an outside contractor.
The letter writers reserved particular animus for Mr. Neumann, noting that the $ 46 million annual consulting fee SoftBank awarded him for four years is higher than the compensation of all but a small number of public company chief executives in the United States last year.
"We are not asking for this level of graft," the workers wrote. "We are asking to be treated with humanity and dignity so we can continue living life while searching to make a living elsewhere."
A representative for Mr. Neumann declined to comment.
Mr. Friedman said the idea for the coalition came about in late October, as he and several fellow engineers sought to combat a feeling of powerlessness. This smaller group, known as the committee, then enlisted others through messaging apps.
In interviews, workers involved in the coalition said they had believed in the company's mission of creating a community for office workers, only to become disillusioned by the antics of Mr. Neumann and his inner circle.
"The initial thing of 'making a life, not a living,' 'community,' 'better together' -- the terms WeWork pushed as marketing also seeped into this company's culture in a very real way," said Kevin Hsieh, a software engineer involved in the group. "There is a looming sense of betrayal and frustration that that wasn't necessarily followed everywhere."
Mr. Friedman said his first hint that the company's leadership might not be practicing the values it preached came at a company "summer camp" retreat in the English countryside in 2018. He recalled that most rank-and-file workers roughed it in small tents on a fairground, which became a muddy mess in the rain. Mr. Neumann stayed in a large luxury tent.
"It was like a physical manifestation of the power imbalance," Mr. Friedman said.
He said his concerns about the discrepancy between Mr. Neumann's words and actions were solidified in recent months, amid reports that the company had spent $ 60 million buying a private jet and that Mr. Neumann had bought multiple mansions.
In the letter, workers say their concerns go beyond the coming layoffs. The coalition wants more input into how the company is managed because "we've seen what can happen when leadership makes decisions while employees have no voice," though it doesn't elaborate on its preferred way of influencing management.
The group says it also wants to ensure that the company responds appropriately to accusations of sexual misconduct, increases diversity and eliminates the requirement that employees resolve claims against the company through arbitration rather than in court.
Last week, a former WeWork employee filed a complaint against the company and Mr. Neumann contending that she had been discriminated against for becoming pregnant and taking maternity leave. The complaint, filed by Medina Bardhi, who worked as Mr. Neumann's chief of staff, said he had referred to her maternity leave as a "vacation" or "retirement." The company has said it will defend itself against the complaint.
In their willingness to make collective demands, the workers appear to echo the actions of employees at several tech companies, including Microsoft, Amazon and Google, where 20,000 employees walked off the job last fall to protest the company's handling of sexual harassment. After the protests, Google agreed to end forced arbitration for employee disputes.
Members of the WeWorkers Coalition say they received advice from workers at the crowdfunding site Kickstarter, who have been trying to unionize. But in line with workers at other companies, like Google, they say it may be more practical for them to engage in collective action without first trying to create a union.
Some workers in other industries have won concessions from employers facing financial distress by organizing, including workers at Toys "R" Us, which filed for bankruptcy in 2017. Two private equity funds that owned the retailer agreed last year to establish a $ 20 million fund for laid-off employees.
At a meeting with employees in Manhattan last month, Mr. Claure, the SoftBank executive overseeing WeWork, said he would focus on profits over growth.
On Friday, WeWork released a presentation about how its business is doing. Locations open more than two years had an operating profit margin of 21 percent for the first six months of the year, excluding certain expenses. But many of its locations had been open for less than a year, and those were barely profitable or losing money.
The company also confirmed its plans to get out of some businesses and lay off workers, without saying how many.
The WeWorkers Coalition has seized on the treatment of the company's cleaning staff as an example of how the company's actions have diverged from its idealistic rhetoric.
In an email to staff members last Friday, a WeWork executive said workers whose jobs were moved to an outside company would have the same level of pay and comparable benefits as they do now. The announcement has unnerved employees who fear they will eventually be laid off, lose benefits or be forced to work different schedules, according to an interview with one of the affected workers and screenshots of Slack messages reviewed by The New York Times.
Mr. Hsieh said that, for many employees, the fact that even the cleaners received equity showed that WeWork had "great values." But the decision to outsource the cleaning staff, he said, showed how hollow that commitment was.
WeWork has a history of disputes with its cleaning staff, who clashed with Mr. Neumann over pay and other issues in 2015.
It's unclear how many cleaners would be affected by the new outsourcing arrangement. On the East Coast, many of those workers are already employed by an outside company.

Texto completo: Annea Lockwood, influenced by ecofeminism, will be celebrated at 80 with a Composer Portrait concert at Columbia University.
"Go to a river," begins the text score for Annea Lockwood's "Water Meditations," from 1973. One version of the piece continues: "Stay there all day. Let the sounds change you and follow these changes."
It's not the typical instruction one expects from a musical score, but it is characteristic of Ms. Lockwood, who for decades has studied how sound can have visceral and profound effects on attentive, listening bodies.
A composer of audacious experimental works on the border of musical performance and conceptual art -- including the exploratory prepared-piano piece "Ear-Walking Woman," the impassioned vocal lament "I Give You Back" and "Piano Burning," for which she is most recognized -- Ms. Lockwood turned 80 in July, and she is being celebrated on Thursday with a Composer Portrait concert at the Miller Theater at Columbia University. Featuring a premiere by the piano-percussion quartet Yarn/Wire, the event is a tribute to Ms. Lockwood's devotion to collaboration and her reverence for sound's potential to move people, particularly in a time of environmental crisis.
Ms. Lockwood's ears were tuned early by the surroundings of her native home in Canterbury, New Zealand, particularly the sounds of wild, undammed rivers like the Waimakariri.
"I've always thought of rivers as alive, as live phenomena," she said by phone from her current home, in Westchester County, N.Y. "It became very clear to me that rivers create their sound by the way they interact with the materials in their banks through friction."
Living in England by the mid-1960s, she began assembling a "River Archive," soliciting recordings from around the globe. She began corresponding with the like-minded composer Pauline Oliveros, who not only contributed a recording of a Massachusetts creek, but also helped Ms. Lockwood secure a teaching position at Hunter College, which brought her to New York in 1973.
Like Oliveros, who died in 2016, Ms. Lockwood's sonic attention to the body and environment has been interwoven with her life as a feminist. Through the 1970s, Ms. Lockwood taught courses on women and music, participated in consciousness-raising groups, and immersed herself in writers like the ecofeminist Susan Griffin, who suggested that the impulses to dominate nature and women grew from the same patriarchal root.
Out of this period came "Womens Work," a 1974-76 score collection edited by Ms. Lockwood and the pioneering Fluxus artist Alison Knowles, and recently reissued by Primary Information. The multidisciplinary collection includes scores like Beth Anderson's "Valid for Life," a trio for large drums and strung instruments struck with "huge velvet beaters," and Ms. Lockwood's intense "Piano Burning": "set piano upright in an open space with lid closed. spill a very little lighter fluid here and light."
Her obsession with rivers continued. "A Sound Map of the Hudson River" was installed at the Hudson River Museum in Yonkers in 1982, and featured 15 field recordings, from the bubbling and crackling source in the Adirondacks down to the ocean. Her "Sound Map" took on new political undertones when it was released as an album in 1989, the same year as the Exxon Valdez oil spill.
"With bringing rivers into an urban environment through sound, I've long hoped to convey the experience of that sound as a nourishing form of energy," she said then. "And perhaps indirectly, over time, the experience becomes real, concrete, immediate, close up. Perhaps that person will slowly be able to empathize or understand more, even take steps politically and socially to preserve the phenomenon. My process is really indirect but it is direct."
Her work continues to have political reverberations, even unintended ones. In 2016, she created "bayou-borne (for Pauline)," dedicated to Oliveros. The graphic score is a map, depicting six bayous that converge in Oliveros's hometown, Houston. Weeks before the September 2017 premiere, Hurricane Harvey struck.
"It affected the players' sense of how to move downstream together, and affected my sense of the nature of the piece," Ms. Lockwood said. "It's inevitable the piece turns darker as it progresses."
Her new piece for Yarn/Wire, "Into the Vanishing Point," originated as a reflection on the climate crisis. Late last year, Ms. Lockwood read a New York Times Magazine article chronicling the quiet catastrophe of rapidly disappearing insect species.
"I literally stopped in my tracks," she recalled. "I stopped walking. I couldn't continue walking. It's such a shattering window into what's happening."
"Into the Vanishing Point" is not at all programmatic. It doesn't depict the crisis so much as chart the raw, emotional response to it. Ms. Lockwood avoids didacticism, believing that the immediacy of her work makes its own case directly to the body.
"It's really a lament; it's a work of mourning," she said. While the Yarn/Wire percussionist Russell Greenberg described it as a piece about loss, the question of what it means to lose something varies considerably from performer to performer, so the resulting sound is far from predictable.
Rehearsals have been highly collaborative, and Ms. Lockwood considers the piece to have been co-composed with Yarn/Wire. Early on, she visited the group's studio in Ridgewood, Queens, to experiment with potential sounds.
"I asked each player to come up with a vocabulary of sounds at the threshold -- really at the threshold -- of hearing," she said. The work takes the form of a structured improvisation, which begins with barely audible sounds but does reach peaks of intensity, using such materials as fishing line, a dog whistle and the inner tube of a tire.
Ms. Lockwood has kept busy with other collaborative projects, such as "Wild Energy," an outdoor installation created in 2014 with the sound designer Bob Bielecki and now installed at the Caramoor Center for Music and the Arts in Westchester County. The work features environmental sounds typically outside the range of human hearing, like the reverberations of an earthquake or the clicking of a water-stressed tree, transposed into audibility.

"If you open yourself to these sounds with an awareness that these sounds are coursing through your body, changing you," she said, "then your body and the sound merge and that is actually a channel of visceral connection."
For Ms. Lockwood, the urgency of such work, of using environmental sound to awaken a consciousness of our connection to our bodies and the world around us, is clear: "We are not separate, at all. And the more we recognize that, the less harm we will do, I feel. The more we'll be drawn away from exploitation, toward conservation."

Russia officials sending mercenaries to Libya

Texto completo: TRIPOLI, Libya - The casualties at the Aziziya field hospital south of Tripoli used to arrive with gaping wounds and shattered limbs, victims of the haphazard artillery fire that has defined battles among Libyan militias. But now medics say they are seeing something new: narrow holes in a head or a torso left by bullets that kill instantly and never exit the body.
It is the work, Libyan fighters say, of Russian mercenaries, including skilled snipers. The lack of an exit wound is a signature of the ammunition used by the same Russian mercenaries elsewhere.
The snipers are among about 200 Russian fighters who have arrived in Libya in the last six weeks, part of a broad campaign by the Kremlin to reassert its influence across the Middle East and Africa.
After four years of behind-the-scenes financial and tactical support for a would-be Libyan strongman, Russia is now pushing far more directly to shape the outcome of Libya's messy civil war. It has introduced advanced Sukhoi jets, coordinated missile strikes, and precision-guided artillery, as well as the snipers - the same playbook that made Moscow a kingmaker in the Syrian civil war.
"It is exactly the same as Syria," said Fathi Bashagha, interior minister of the provisional unity government in the capital, Tripoli.
Whatever its effect on the outcome, the Russian intervention has already given Moscow a de facto veto over any resolution of the conflict.
The Russians have intervened on behalf of militia leader Khalifa Hifter, who is based in eastern Libya and is also backed by the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and, at times, France. His backers have embraced him as their best hope to check the influence of political Islam, crack down on militants and restore an authoritarian order.
Hifter has been at war for more than five years with a coalition of militias from western Libya who back the authorities in Tripoli. The Tripoli government was set up by the United Nations in 2015 and is officially supported by the United States and other Western powers. But in practical terms, Turkey is its only patron.
The new intervention of private Russian mercenaries, who are closely tied to the Kremlin, is just one of the parallels with the Syrian civil war.
The Russian snipers belong to the Wagner Group, the Kremlin-linked private company that also led Russia's intervention in Syria, according to three senior Libyan officials and five Western diplomats closely tracking the war.
In both conflicts, rival regional powers are arming local clients. And, as in Syria, the local partners who had teamed up with the United States to fight the Islamic State group are now complaining of abandonment and betrayal.
The United Nations, which has tried and failed to broker peace in both countries, has watched as its eight-year arms embargo on Libya is becoming "a cynical joke," as the U.N. special envoy recently put it.
Officials of the Tripoli government say Russia is now bringing in more mercenaries by the week.
"It is very clear that Russia is going all in on this conflict," said Gen. Osama al-Juwaili, the top commander of the forces aligned with the Tripoli government. He complained that the West was doing nothing to protect that government from the foreign powers determined to push Hifter into power.
"Why all this pain?" he said sardonically. "Just stop this now and assign the guy to rule us."
Russia had previously stayed in the background while the United Arab Emirates and Egypt took the leading roles in military support for Hifter. But by September, his assault on Tripoli seemed to have stalled and Russia apparently saw an opportunity.
Given the amateurish nature of the ground fighting, some diplomats said, the arrival of 200 Russian professionals could have an outsized impact.
A spokesman for Hifter's forces did not respond to a request for comment.

Texto completo: Lancaster has been hailed as America’s “refugee capital” by the BBC. It was named a “welcoming city” by a national organization earlier this fall.
And its varied, international cuisine has been touted in the New York Times.
That global spirit will be celebrated next summer as a group of local organizations plan a new multicultural event for Lancaster County.
The One World Festival, which will offer food, music, dance, art and children’s activities representing a variety of countries and cultures, will be held outdoors at Millersville University on Aug. 2.
The event, organized by a committee of representatives from eight local cultural organizations, will be free and open to the public.
“The strength of our community lies in the diversity of our residents,” says Sam Bressi, president and CEO of the Lancaster County Community Foundation, the presenting sponsor for the event.
The foundation “has been working really hard to look at our programs through the lens of diversity and inclusion,” Bressi says. “The idea of bringing all the cultures together, adding to the value and cuisine and excitement and dynamism of Lancaster, really fits with our mission.”
“I truly believe that the One World festival will be a great testament to how people from different backgrounds can come together in unison, to create something beautiful and of significance,” says Deepa Balepur, who represents the Indian Organization of Lancaster County on the committee.
The festival committee is reaching out to other local cultural groups and nonprofits to get involved in the festival, is seeking sponsors and vendors and eventually will be recruiting volunteers to help run the festival.
Festival origins
Balepur says the idea for the festival came in September 2018, when festivals celebrating three different cultures — Indian, Hispanic and African — were held on the same day in Lancaster.
Balepur recalls reaching out to representatives of the other two organizations to explore organizing one big festival, showcasing many of Lancaster County’s diverse cultures at the same time.
They formed a planning committee and invited other groups representing local Jewish, Greek, Italian, German and Irish organizations to join.
She notes Penn Medicine Lancaster General Health has also signed on as a major sponsor of the event.
“This whole idea of multiculturalism ... is a choice that you make,” Balebur says.
“We’re interested in having groups foster a better community for everybody’s sake,” says festival committee member Tom Daniels, president of the Lancaster Irish American Society. “And we just want to be a part of that.”
Daniels says his organization will showcase Irish music, dancing and food at the festival.
Jaime Zabala, founder and president of the local Latin American Alliance, says his organization will be represented at the festival through food, music, art and children’s activities.
“As I got involved in the One World Festival,” Zabala says, “I thought that it’s basically an extension of what (the alliance) has been doing” in celebrating Latin American culture. “It’s a way we can find unity, in spite of our diversity, that we can see and experience.”
Terry Carrilio, a member of Congregation Shaarai Shomayim, is temporarily serving on the committee in place of Rabbi Jack Paskoff, who is on a sabbatical.
“In terms of the Jewish people,” Carrilio says, “we’ve been strangers in every land in the world for most of our history, so we know what it’s like to be both very different and more integrated. It’s also part of the world view of Jews to do a thing called ‘repairing the world,’ which means (getting) people to be more unified.”
“The idea (for the festival) was extraordinarily attractive to me,” says committee member Dr. Nikitas Zervanos of the Hellenic Cultural Society, representing the Greek-American community. He says his community will provide food, music and Greek dancing at the event.
“And we hope to enlighten people about when (Greeks) first came to Lancaster, and try to also inform the greater Lancaster community how immigrants enrich this community of ours,” Zervanos says.
Peter Byrne represents both the German organization Lancaster Liederkranz and the Lancaster Italian Cultural Society on the committee. He says Liederkranz will provide music and dancing, and that the Italian society plans to showcase food and Italian history.
African food and culture also will be part of the festival, through the Rafiki Africa organization founded by committee member Dorothy Dulo.
Getting involved
The festival will generate an international recipe book, its own song and a fund to be managed by the Lancaster County Community Foundation.
Daniels has written lyrics to a song, “Give Me Your Hand,” the music for which is being provided by a local composer. It will serve as a theme song for the festival.
In addition, committee member Gabrielle Hackman of the Irish American Society has been collecting recipes from a variety of local cultures and is putting them together — along with histories of local cultures and of the individual recipes — in a book that will be sold at the festival.
Any proceeds from the festival will go into a One World Lancaster Fund that is being set up through the Lancaster County Community Foundation, Balepur says.
“That fund has really been set up to promote diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives within Lancaster County,” she says.
Balepur notes the planning committee has been in place “to jump start the process” in creating the festival.
“Really, our goal is to invite anyone and everyone from the broader Lancaster County community that would want to be a part of this,” Balepur says. “This is an all-inclusive initiative.”
The festival has its own webpage, oneworldfestivallancaster.org, which includes an online form through which organizations and potential volunteers and vendors can sign up to be involved in the event.
“We are considered the most welcoming city in the United States,” Zervanos says, “and there are a lot of refugees that have come to this community of ours.
“And I hope we can send a message of celebration to the greater community of how fortunate we are that this has happened to Lancaster, and that it’s richer, by far, as a result.”

Ivanka Trump dismisses critics: ‘It’s all noise ... I’m pretty thick-skinned’

Texto completo: Ivanka Trump hadn’t even landed in Morocco this week to promote women’s economic empowerment on behalf of President Trump before the social media sneers began.
“Ivanka Trump wants to be a queen so badly,” mocked one tweet. After arriving Wednesday, another wrote with outrage, “So far she's done two outfit changes.”
Ivanka, a regular on Twitter like her dad, only said, “Thank you to Her Royal Highness Lalla Meryem for a warm welcome to Morocco!”
More than any of her siblings, Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner, are harshly mocked by critics, mostly because of their official, unpaid positions in the West Wing as top advisers. But unlike Ivanka's two combative brothers, Donald Jr. and Eric, they don’t take the bait.
With the recent publication of two insider books about the Trump family in the White House, we are learning more about the president’s oldest daughter and most trusted confidant — and why she doesn’t react to complainers.
“I value the opinions of those I love. And those I work with. Anyone else? It’s all noise,” she told historian Doug Wead for his upcoming book, "Inside Trump's White House: The Real Story of His Presidency."
“On a very personal level, it can be very difficult, very challenging. Especially when it is wrong. Although I’m pretty thick-skinned,” she said, adding, “I choose to be happy and aim for impact. This is really important to me. I have no time for bitterness.”
Donald Trump Jr. wrote in his new book, Triggered: How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us, that his sister faces constant media coverage that is “incredibly unfair and cruel.” Still, he said, “she’s able to rise above the vindictiveness.”
A close friend told us, “Ivanka has the unique ability to take so much incoming and still stay above the fray. That’s what distinguishes her.”
Tweet
In fact, Kushner has a motto, said their friend: “We came to Washington with our dignity, and we will leave with it.”
The reaction to Ivanka Trump probably says more about her critics than her. Before her father ran for president, she was a popular magazine cover girl and heralded businesswoman. But as soon as he ran and she joined the campaign, her media fans turned on her.
“Before my father ran for president, Ivanka was the darling of those glossy magazines such as Vogue, Harper’s Bazaar, and Vanity Fair. Even the New York Times ran complimentary pieces about her. As my father’s chances to be elected improved, those same glossies and newspapers started publishing hit pieces on her,” said Donald Trump Jr.
Tweet
It continued after the election when she was tasked to help in the efforts to expand domestic jobs, build support for the 2017 tax cuts, reform lapses in criminal justice, and campaign overseas for women’s economic equality and the Women’s Global Development and Prosperity Initiative endorsed by world financial groups and governments.
Despite criticism that she lacked the experience to help on those projects, they succeeded.
Now she is her father’s top emissary, his “secret weapon,” somebody who has immediate credibility on the world stage because international leaders know she speaks only for the president.
“When people talk to her, they know they have a direct line to the president. Because she’s his daughter, they know there isn’t some side game going on with her. Anything she says or does is sanctioned by the president,” said the friend.
And attacks be damned, wrote her brother. “We are Trumps, we don’t play the victim card.”

Texto completo: Authorities in Texas said Wednesday that a 33-year-old Utah man was arrested in Mexico on a charge that he stole the truck and RV belonging to a couple whose bodies were found last month on a Texas beach.
The man, Adam Curtis Williams, faces a charge of felony theft, according to the Kleberg County Sheriff’s Office. He was transported to the United States and, as of Wednesday evening, was being brought from Houston to Kleberg County, said Chief Deputy Jaime Garza.
The killings of the couple — James Butler, 48, and Michelle Butler, 45, of New Hampshire — remain under investigation. They had been traveling the country in their RV and were staying at a South Texas beach when they disappeared last month. Their bodies were found buried in a shallow grave on the beach southeast of Corpus Christi, and their truck and RV were missing.
Authorities said at a news conference Tuesday that they believed Williams had absconded to Mexico after stealing the truck and the RV. They said he was seen in a surveillance photograph crossing the border into Mexico with a woman, Amanda Noverr, who remains a person of interest in the case.
Garza declined Wednesday evening to provide more information about how Williams could have been connected to the Butlers or the circumstances of his arrest in Mexico. Garza said that the truck and the RV, which were with Williams when he was arrested, remained in Mexico.
At the news conference Tuesday, authorities said that other people could be involved in the Butlers’ killings.
They have not released details on how the couple were killed.
The Butlers disappeared Oct. 15. More than a week later, a relative filed a missing persons report. Their bodies were found later that month, and Nov. 1, their deaths were ruled homicides.
Investigators used cellphone towers to approximate the Butlers’ last known location, leading them to an area of the beach on Padre Island known as “the bowl” for the way the sand dunes form a depression.

Texto completo: The Glenbard Parent Series: (GPS) Navigating Healthy Families will host an author event with Erika SÃ¡nchez, the New York Times bestselling author of "I Am Not Your Perfect Daughter," at 7 p.m. Wednesday, Nov. 20, at Glenbard South High School, 23W200 Butterfield Road in Glen Ellyn.
Through generations of families, it has been perceived that the ideal Mexican daughter does not go away to college and does not move out of her parents’ house after high school graduation because she shouldn’t abandon her family. Julia is not your ideal Mexican daughter. That was her sister’s role. But when a tragic accident on a busy Chicago street causes her sister’s death, Julia is left behind to reassemble the shattered pieces of her family.
SÃ¡nchez’s book is both heart wrenching and humorous. Julia’s story is an empowering, coming-of-age tale about losing a sister and shattering stereotypes to find herself amid the pressures, anxieties and expectations of growing up as a Mexican-American.
SÃ¡nchez is a contemporary young adult author and 2017 National Book Award finalist. She is a poet, feminist and cheerleader for young women. She was the advice columnist for Cosmopolitan for Latinas for three years. SÃ¡nchez’s writings echo the thoughts and ideas she wanted to read as a young adult and have appeared in numerous publications.
Glenbard South students will hear SÃ¡nchez during the day.
Continuing professional development units are available for the evening presentation.

The 3 most pressing questions about a Bloomberg presidential run right now

Texto completo: Former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg is moving toward a White House run, even as his aides say his attempt to get on the Alabama primary ballot doesn't guarantee he'll be a candidate.
That said, the news has shaken up the race ever since his team announced the move Thursday night. Bloomberg is driving the cable news discussion, and nearly all of the candidates in the race are reacting.
The uniqueness of a Bloomberg candidacy for president requires a whole different way of thinking about how he, the Democratic National Committee, his opponents, and voters should look at the race.
The biggest three questions of the moment are these:
Will Bloomberg skip Iowa or all of the early presidential primary states?
One thing Bloomberg, reportedly worth $52 billion, doesn't have to worry about with this campaign is raising money quickly. But what he does need to worry about is quickly building a campaign infrastructure in the early states that either matches or exceeds what those already in the race have built over the last 11 months or longer. That is unless he decides to skip the early states, an unprecedented move in modern American politics.
The biggest nut to crack is Iowa, which will hold its caucuses 87 days from Friday. More pressing than the time frame is how a candidate must compete there.
Iowa is a field organizer's paradise. That's because, in theory, each candidate faces the task finding Iowa voters in each of the 1,700 precincts. They have to make sure to have enough supporters who show up for the caucus in each precinct to at least meet the 15 percent threshold — otherwise their campaign won't even be counted.
The major campaigns already have hundreds of staffers aimed at the task of how caucus night will go. Bloomberg starts at zero and campaign ads cannot buy the tactical nuts and bolts required of this type of organizing.
Structurally, Bloomberg might just decide to skip all four early states. There are the Iowa organizing issues and the fact that he might have problems winning in Nevada with the heavy influence of one union there — the culinary union that represents all workers at casinos. Bloomberg met with the union in the spring when he last explored a run, but his messaging might not be a good fit.
Then there's South Carolina. Given that Bloomberg has never had a lot of support among African-Americans, including in his hometown, it could be tough to win there given that African-Americans make up 60 percent of the Democratic primary vote.
One place that Bloomberg could play is New Hampshire. He is a good ideological fit for the state, particularly where independents make up the biggest block of voters and are allowed to vote in the Democratic primary. And what field organizing is to Iowa, message and media campaigns are to New Hampshire. Playing in New Hampshire does make some sense, but it is a place where neighboring Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren already look like they are going to do quite well.
How worried are the early states that Bloomberg will just skip them? On Friday morning the Iowa and New Hampshire Democratic Party chairs took the rare step of issuing a statement directly to Bloomberg.
“We are certain that Granite Staters, Iowans, and other early state voters are eager to ask Michael Bloomberg about his plans to move our states and our country forward," the statement read.
What if he isn't a big deal?
There is an underlying premise of news coverage and the discussion on Democratic campaigns: Bloomberg is immediately a big dog in the race. But what if he isn't? While he does have some name recognition, there is no evidence that the next round of polls will show him anywhere new the top tier.
When polls were taken before he got in the race, he was in the single digits. And while he will be given some grace period to ramp up, if he is not in the top tier quickly, it is unclear what his path to the nomination will be, and how he could overcome momentum of the top tier with just television and digital ads.
The moment Bloomberg is seen by the press and voters as just another candidate — instead of a savior for the party — the underlying premise of his campaign is over.
Will he be in the debates?
Here is the thing about a self-funding candidate: They won't meet the donor threshold needed to qualify for the DNC televised debates.
For the December debate, candidates need to show they have 200,000 individual donors and have 4 percent in at least four different polls. Bloomberg could get to the poll threshold with the help of ads, but as for the donor requirement, he may decide not to invest on Facebook or elsewhere chasing $1 donations just to make a debate. Indeed, he might decide to not engage with other candidates in those forums.
And if Bloomberg becomes a big deal despite this, the Democratic National Committee will have to decide if it will adjust its rules in order to allow him in future debates. After all, rival candidates might demand it.

Texto completo: Top Trump administration officials mulled a mass resignation last year to warn the public about President Trump's conduct, says a yet-to-be-released book obtained by The Washington Post.
But the group rejected plans for a "midnight self-massacre" because it would have further destabilized Trump's teetering government, says the book by "Anonymous."
The book, titled, "A Warning," is to be released Nov. 19, and on Thursday night had reached No. 4 on Amazon's best sellers list.
The book's author is described as a "senior official in the Trump administration" famed for writing a September 2018 New York Times op-ed.
Trump spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham released a statement late Thursday saying, "The coward who wrote this book didn't put their name on it because it is nothing but lies."

Resumen: "Playing With Fire," starring John Cena, John Leguizamo and Keegan-Michael Key, gets less than favorable reviews from movie critics.

Texto completo: John Cena's upcoming big screen role as a firefighter tasked with babysitting three children doesn't appear to sit well with film critics.
"Playing With Fire," in theaters Friday, received an underwhelming score of 25% on Rotten Tomatoes. The film, which follows three firefighters (Cena, Keegan-Michael Key and John Leguizamo) who get stuck watching three kids following an accident, is called "fecal-flecked nonsense," by LA Times critic Katie Walsh.
Walsh notes that in light of the recent California wildfires, moviegoers should watch Joseph Kosinski's "Only the Brave," "rather than subject themselves and their loved ones to the surreal, fecal-flecked nonsense that is 'Playing with Fire. ' "
The Hollywood Reporter's Frank Scheck says that although the plot of the movie is nothing new (been there, done that), it might be fun for the kids to watch.
"Hollywood never seems to tire of the belief that there's something inherently hilarious about huge, muscle-bound men, preferably former bodybuilders or wrestlers, interacting with very young children," Scheck writes. " 'Playing With Fire' strikes strictly predictably beats. Key and Leguizamo, comic talents who are wildly overqualified for this sort of thing, work hard, very hard, to infuse the tired material with laughs. "
Cena donates to California wildfires: John Cena pledges $500K donation to first responders as California wildfires continue
Other critics co-signed that director Andy Fickman's firefighter comedy fails to follow through on key comedic moments and may only appeal children with its humor.
"Director Andy Fickman seems aware that there are potential laughs in how his performers are positioned on screen; Key’s Mark, for example, pops in and out of sight, often accompanied by animation-ready whooshing sound effects," writes Jesse Hassenger for the A. V. Club. "But he doesn’t choreograph these moments into funny set pieces, using his camera mainly just to accent moments of dopey, sometimes scatological slapstick. "
TheWrap's Yolanda Machado goes as far as to say the film's humor may not even land with children.
"The film is bland and predictable, underestimates kids’ abilities to understand story and humor, and relies way too much on sight gags that are clichéd and overdone," she writes.
The New York Times' Teo Bugbee lists many a wrong, calling the movie "flat," but notes one thing "Playing With Fire" did well was casting the right actors.
"The director Andy Fickman has made a visually flat film," Bugbee writes. "The editing is frequently awkward, clunkily overemphasizing physical gags, and lingering too long on the actors as they try to light up dusty material. "

Wurzbacher's success continues with new book

Texto completo: Ashley Wurzbacher has left her thumbprint on Iowa City with a pair of publications, and in turn, the city of literature has helped to buoy her; yet Wurzbacher has never come to town.
"I can't remember a whole lot about why I chose ('The Iowa Review') to submit to," Wurzbacher said. "But I think anything associated with Iowa has this kind of glow to it in the writing world. So I probably just saw that and wanted to be a part of it and it turned out to be a really great home for the story."
In October, Wurzbacher published "Happy Like This" having submitted it for the UI Press's John Simmons Short Fiction Award, which she subsequently won. The manuscript has landed Wurzbacher on the National Book Foundation's 5 Under 35 list of debut fiction authors and garnered a review in the New York Times.
But Wurzbacher's journey to this success — and her long-distance relationship with Iowa City — started in 2011 when her short story, "Burden," was published in "The Iowa Review."
At the time "Burden" was published, the editor for the publication was Russell Valentino, who now teaches at Indiana University.
"I mentioned (her) piece in the editor's note," Valentino recalled. "I think there was a body emphasis (in stories selected that year), we didn't have thematic issues but sometimes themes would emerge. This one was so much about pain — bodily pain and discomfort — particularly the aging body of the dancer."
"Burden" follows a ballet dancer struggling with the decision to get an abortion and reflecting on the weight, literal and rhetorical, a baby would add to her life.
This contrast of the petite cultural image of a ballerina against the weight of the character's decision is something Valentino helped Wurzbacher emphasize in the narrative. The alterations were small, a slight "nudge" to enhance already present themes.
Over the years, Wurzbacher has continued to revise the story, resulting in the version which appears in "Happy Like This." While revising "Burden," Wurzbacher continued to write and nudge other short stories and began finding related thematic threads binding them.
"There was a lot in my work about women's relationships with their bodies and women's friendships and sort of feelings of pain and self-doubt about the way that they're living their lives," she said. "I began to see that these were obsessions of mine."
"There's very little that happens in the stories that has actually happened to me," said Wurzbach. Rather, the stories expand on thoughts she's had and expand on some similar issues from women — friends, relatives — in her life.
The book includes 10 short stories, showing the courses of women navigating their lives as performers, researchers, students and the implicit intricacies therein.
The book was judged the winner of The John Simmons Short Fiction Award by Carmen Machado, a UI Writers' Workshop graduate and author who's also receiving buzz for her book "In the Dream House." Machado will be reading from her work at Prairie Lights reading this Saturday.
"I was very lucky because Carmen Machado, who I greatly admire, judged the book, and the rest is history," Wurzbacher said. "The judge's identity is not disclosed beforehand so I ended up being really surprised and pleased."
Now that "Happy Like This" has been released, Wurzbacher is promoting it coast to coast, revisiting places and people of her past in areas she's lived and written in while currently working on a novel. There are, however, no set plans for her to visit the city of literature were she found both one of her earliest and most recent successes.
"I did contact Prairie Lights bookstore over the summer to ask about coming to read and they were not able to fit me in their schedule," Wurzbacher said. "I've never been (to Iowa City) unfortunately, but would love to change that."

Texto completo: ALBANY - A Mineola-based attorney provided $500,000 in 2018 for a venture that brought together Rudolph Giuliani and a Ukrainian-born businessman Giuliani enlisted to collect information in Ukraine that could damage Democratic presidential candidate Joseph Biden, according to The New York Times.    
The lawyer, Charles Gucciardo, of Massapequa, is a longtime donor to Republican campaigns and a strong supporter of Trump who runs his own personal injury law firm.
On Thursday, Gucciardo's attorney said Gucciardo simply was investing in a cybersecurity company for which Giuliani, Trump's personal lawyer, would be the public face.
The Times reported that Gucciardo, 62, provided the $500,000 as part of a deal in which he would become an investor in a company started by Ukrainian-American businessman Lev Parnas. The company, Fraud Guarantee, was supposed to provide insurance to investors against fraud.
In subsequent months, Giuliani and Parnas would be involved in efforts to pressure Ukraine to mount an investigation aimed at damaging Biden, a former vice president and a front-runner in the race for the Democratic nomination to challenge Trump.
Congressional Democrats say the pressure campaign involved a quid pro quo in which Trump would release U.S. military aid if the Ukrainian government investigated Biden. Trump denies there was any quid pro quo.
Parnas was arrested in October with a Giuliani associate, Igor Fruman. Federal prosecutors have accused them of conspiring to violate campaign finance laws.
Gucciardo's lawyer, Randy Zelin of Manhattan, told Newsday Thursday that Gucciardo's "investment had nothing to do with politics and everything to do with Mr. Giuliani's reputation and experience in cybersecurity and protecting the public."
Zelin described Gucciardo as a "passive investor" in the company. Gucciardo "invested because he believed that Mr. Giuliani - the former Mayor of New York City, former United States attorney for the Southern District of New York and, the first name in cybersecurity - was in front of, behind, and alongside the company, which would catapult the company into the world of cybersecurity and investor protection," Zelin said.
Federal Election Commission records show Gucciardo in June 2018 contributed $50,000 to America First Action, a political action committee that works to help Trump.
In October, news media reports said America First Action received $325,000 from a company that federal prosecutors say Parnas and Fruman used to conceal their identities.
Since 2013, Gucciardo's law firm has contributed $8,400 to election campaigns on Long Island and to the Nassau County Republican Committee, according to state Board of Elections records.
In 2010, Gucciardo contributed $25,000 to Democrat Andrew M. Cuomo's campaign for New York governor.
Gucciardo's firm, The Gucciardo Law Firm, has sued hospitals, physicians, schools, governments, companies and other entities in personal injury cases, primarily on Long Island. The law firm's website notes more than two dozen cases in which defendants paid out millions of dollars to Guc

Texto completo: The sommelier Anthony Cailan, who was a rising star in the wine world, has resigned from the downtown Manhattan hotel where he worked, after a New York Times report last week in which several women said he had sexually assaulted them.
Bogdan Docu, the general manager of the Nolitan hotel, on Kenmare Street, where Mr. Cailan was beverage director since June 2018, confirmed that the sommelier no longer worked there in an email on Thursday. Mr. Cailan is also no longer employed at the hotel's restaurant, the Usual, where his brother, Alvin, remains the chef.
Anthony Cailan, 29, is alleged to have sexually assaulted, or attempted to assault, at least four women, two of whom described the incidents in detail in The Times and were named in the article. Mr. Cailan responded last week: "The truth is, these allegations against me are false. I look forward to the opportunity to clear my name." He could not be reached for comment this week by email or phone.
[ Read the women's accounts of Anthony Cailan's behavior .]
Mr. Docu added that none of Mr. Cailan's accusers worked at the Usual and that its management was not aware of any allegations against Mr. Cailan by any past or present employees. "The Usual does not tolerate any form of harassment in the workplace," he said.
After the article was published, Wine & Spirits magazine, which last month named him one of America's Best New Sommeliers of 2019 and ran his photograph on the cover, posted on Instagram: "We are deeply troubled by the allegations reported in The New York Times against Anthony Cailan. He was selected by his industry peers in our annual Best New Sommelier poll, and we were unaware of the allegations against him until today. Wine & Spirits does not condone sexually inappropriate behavior and we hope this will be a catalyst for change in our industry."
On the magazine's website, Mr. Cailan's name remains on its list of the Best New Sommeliers.
In another accolade, in 2017 Mr. Cailan was appointed by the Bordeaux Wine Council, a marketing arm of the vast Bordeaux wine business, as an "ambassador" in the United States. The appointment expired at the end of 2018, but Mr. Cailan continued to use the title on his email signature and public social media profiles. (Those accounts were taken down after the Times article was published.)
In response to a request for comment, a spokeswoman, Cécile Ha, wrote in an email: "The Bordeaux Wine Council does not condone misconduct in any form and, as an organization committed to accountability, we hope this brings about change in the wine industry."
Online, hundreds of people in the wine business posted their support for Raquel Makler and Sarah Fernandez, the women who told The Times, on the record, their accounts of being assaulted. Many women expressed relief that the systemic misogyny and sexual harassment they have experienced in their workplaces have become public knowledge. Some said there are many more offenders, more powerful than Mr. Cailan, who remain protected by silence and fear.
"I hope people don't think that just because Anthony isn't working at the Usual any more, we don't still have an immense amount of work to do," said Talitha Whidbee, the owner of Vine Wine in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. "This is just the start of a much larger conversation."

Previews & Openings
'THE BLACK HISTORY MUSEUM ... ACCORDING TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA' at Here (in previews; opens on Nov. 10). This arts complex reopens as an interactive exhibition in Smoke & Mirrors Collaborative's immersive piece about race, prejudice and America's fraught inheritance. Inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement, the production takes over the lobby and backstage areas to explore how black history has been disseminated and distorted.
212-647-0202, here.org
'BROADBEND, ARKANSAS' at the Duke on 42nd Street (in previews; opens on Nov. 10). A two-character, three-generation, five-decade-spanning musical, this new work from Ellen Fitzhugh, Harrison David Rivers and Ted Shen is produced by Transport Group.

212-721-6500, lincolncenter.org/white-light-festival
'THE ENIGMATIST' at the High Line Hotel (in previews; opens on Nov. 9). If doing the Saturday crossword in pen seems like a magic trick, prepare yourself for David Kwong, a conjurer and a cruciverbalist.

By Eduardo Garcia
Demand is booming for organic food. From 2013 to 2018, sales increased nearly 53 percent to almost $ 48 billion, according to the Organic Trade Association. That sounds like good news for the environment, but is it really?
The first thing to bear in mind is that agriculture, in general, is responsible for a lot of greenhouse gas emissions. In the United States, farming accounts for roughly 9 percent of emissions. About half of those come from the soil. That's largely because fertilizers, once applied to farmland, generate emissions of nitrous oxide, the third-most-abundant greenhouse gas.
Some organic farming practices, like crop rotation and the use of cover crops, additional plants that can help control erosion and pests, help keep nitrous oxide emissions in check. That's because they promote healthy soil, and healthy soil releases less nitrous oxide.
Other practices, though, like tilling the soil to get rid of weeds (instead of spraying chemicals), have the opposite effect. Tilling encourages nitrous oxide emissions. Moreover, because it typically produces less food per acre, organic farming tends to need more land, workers and organic fertilizer to stay competitive. That larger scale means larger greenhouse gas emissions.
"There's pretty good peer-reviewed science arguing that the carbon footprint would actually expand if we were to see a widespread shift to organic, versus having the productivity benefits of conventional production," said Michael Doane, the global managing director for sustainable food and water at The Nature Conservancy.
Julius McGee, an assistant professor of sociology at Portland State University, said that organic farming had a high carbon footprint because it's been co-opted by industrial growers that supply big-box stores.
"Large organic retailers rely on cheap organic foods and, in order to produce organics cheaply, you oftentimes operate under the same model as industrial agriculture where you try to reduce costs, and for that you need more inputs, which contributes to more greenhouse gas emissions," Dr. McGee said.
These retailers, he said, sell under a "gentrification model" that targets middle class buyers -- those who can afford to pay a premium for organic food -- displacing small farmers selling directly to people via farmers' markets, community supported agriculture groups or online.
Regardless of whether they have an organic certificate, Dr. McGee said, small farmers tend to have a lower carbon footprint because they "engage in a deeper relationship with the farm and the land." That often involves growing a wider variety of crops, and smaller farmers don't typically package their products in single-use plastics or transport them to buyers hundreds of miles away.
Not everybody agrees. Rodale Institute, a nonprofit group that promotes organic farming, argues that some of these studies fail to properly measure how much planet-warming carbon dioxide the soil can absorb when it is cultivated using sustainable methods. Rodale estimates that organic farmland can potentially sequester more carbon than is currently emitted.
But greenhouse gases are only part of the story. The synthetic herbicides and pesticides used in conventional agriculture can be harmful to farm workers and wildlife, especially pollinators and birds, while the natural-gas derived fertilizers are responsible for deadly algae blooms and high methane emissions.
The bottom line: Over all, organic food is probably better for the planet, even if the emissions picture is complex. If you can afford to buy organic, try to go small and local.

Virginia Democrats made big gains in Tuesday's election and the implications for climate change policy are potentially big, too.
For the first time in more than two decades, Democrats will control both the House of Delegates and the State Senate. That significantly increases the likelihood that the state will join a regional initiative designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Governor Ralph Northam, a Democrat, had long proposed that Virginia join the 10-state program, known as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. He was stymied in the past, though, when Republicans inserted language into a budget bill that prevented the state from becoming a member.
Under the program, states cap the planet-warming carbon dioxide pollution from power plants and then trade permits for emissions.
Vicki Arroyo, executive director of the Georgetown Climate Center, a research arm of Georgetown University Law School, called the election results "very consequential." She noted that Virginia has been trying to shift away from coal and rely more on renewable energy sources like solar and wind. Joining the regional initiative, she said, would bolster those efforts.
"This new Legislature opens doors to Virginia joining RGGI and enacting legislation to support and build upon recent executive orders on climate change," Ms. Arroyo said.
This year, the Democratic Party of Virginia unanimously approved resolutions supporting a move to 100 percent renewable energy and embracing the Green New Deal, an ambitious plan to tackle climate change and provide living-wage guarantees.
A spokesman for the Democratic National Committee also noted that several candidates in Virginia directly addressed the threats that climate change is posing to the state, notably flooding linked to rising sea levels.
Environmentalists poured significant money into the election. The League of Conservation Voters, for example, spent $ 1.5 million on direct mail and other advertising in Virginia.
Evan Webber, political director for the Sunrise Movement, a climate advocacy group that helped design the Green New Deal, called the election a "road map" for Democrats. "When candidates reject corporate money and run on ambitious plans to tackle climate change, lower utility costs, and create good jobs, they win," he said in a statement.

Texto completo: Known as "the girl with the golden eyes," she was seen in dozens of feature films and on television and sold more than 35 million records.
Marie Laforêt, the French actress and singer known in Europe as "the girl with the golden eyes" ("la fille aux yeux d'or"), died on Saturday in Genolier, Switzerland, a small town in the Nyon district north of Geneva. She was 80.
The death was announced by her family.
Ms. Laforêt appeared in some 35 feature films, as well as numerous television movies and mini-series, but her music career was even more successful than her work onscreen. She sold more than 35 million records, counting among her biggest hits "Vendanges l'Amour," "Ivan, Boris et Moi," "Viens, Viens" and "Il A Neigé sur Yesterday" ("It Has Snowed on Yesterday"), a 1977 tribute to the Beatles. Her songs were strongly influenced by folk music, and she even recorded versions of American folk songs, including "House of the Rising Sun."
Ms. Laforêt came from "a bourgeois milieu" and a family that was passionate about music, she said in a 2008 interview with the French newsmagazine VSD (Vendredi Samedi Dimanche). "The tea was brought on a silver platter at 5 p.m.," she recalled, adding: "My parents used the formal address 'vous.' My mother changed for dinner."
But her early years included considerable trauma.
Maïtène Marie Brigitte Doumenach was born on Oct. 5, 1939, in Soulac-sur-Mer, France, a seaside resort town north of Bordeaux. Her parents, Jean Doumenach, a manufacturer, and Marie-Louise (Saint Guily) Doumenach, had one other daughter.
At 3, Maïtène suddenly stopped speaking. More than three decades later, Ms. Laforêt revealed publicly that she had been raped by a neighbor that year, more than once, while her father was in a German prisoner-of-war camp. She was deeply affected for decades, and it was suggested in various articles that she later turned to acting because it offered catharsis. She agreed.
At the end of World War II, Maïtène's father returned and the family moved, first to Valenciennes, in the North of France, and then to Paris. She attended Lycée Jean de La Fontaine, in the wealthy 16th arrondissement, where she became interested in drama.
For a while, she talked about becoming a nun. But when she entered a radio talent contest in 1959 (filling in for her sister at the last minute), she won and was discovered by the director Louis Malle.
Ms. Laforêt was signed to appear in Malle's next film, but that project fell through. Instead she made her film debut, at 19, in "Purple Noon" ("Plein Soleil"), a 1960 movie based on a Patricia Highsmith novel about a handsome, homicidal young con man. She starred opposite Alain Delon as an indolent rich girl living in Italy, later played by Gwyneth Paltrow in "The Talented Mr. Ripley," the 1999 American film, starring Matt Damon, based on the same novel.
Ms. Laforêt's second film, "Saint-Tropez Blues" (1961), in which she sang the title song, led to her career as a vocalist. Her third, "The Girl With the Golden Eyes" (1961), gave her a lifelong professional nickname. (Her eyes were actually yellow-green.)
When that film opened in New York the next year, it led the critic Bosley Crowther of The New York Times to evaluate French cinema's latest direction, the Nouvelle Vague, or New Wave. He declared the picture "beautifully photographed" but said that it seemed to hit "the jackpot of intentional obscurity." Happily, he found Ms. Laforêt "haunting."
Ms. Laforêt left France for Switzerland in 1978 and ran an art gallery in Geneva for three years. She remained in her adopted country for the rest of her life, but did return to the entertainment industry.
In the 1980s and '90s, she appeared in films, television movies and mini-series. In 2005, she gave a sold-out concert tour of France. She played Maria Callas onstage in Terrence McNally's "Master Class" twice, in 2000 and 2008.
Her final screen appearances were in "God's Offices" ("Les Bureaux de Dieu"), a 2008 film about social workers and pregnant women, and "Dispositif 47 -- the Second Death" (2010), a short that also starred Jeanne Moreau.
Ms. Laforêt was married and divorced five times. Her first husband, Jean-Gabriel Albicocco, whom she married in 1961, was a filmmaker who directed two of her early movies. She later married Judas Azuelos (1965), Alain Kahn-Sriber (1971), Pierre Meyer (1980) and Eric De Lavendevra (1990).
Her survivors include two daughters, Lisa Azuelos, a French filmmaker, and Éve-Marie-Debora Kahn-Sriber; a son, Mehdi-Jean-Abraham Azuelos; and several grandchildren.
Le Monde wrote in its obituary that Ms. Laforêt was "modest, snobbish and cheeky, all at the same time, with a corrosive sense of humor," quoting her as saying that she loved "anguished people."

Seeing weak field, Bloomberg moves to join 2020 campaign

Texto completo: Former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg is making plans to enter the Democratic presidential primary campaign this week, a reflection of anxiety among party elites about the unsettled field of current contenders.
Bloomberg, who as one of the world's richest men would bring significant financial resources to his own campaign but also inflame the populist wing of the party, plans to file paperwork and has dispatched staff to Alabama to ensure he can get onto the ballot in a state that has a Friday filing deadline. He has been calling top party officials to let them know of his plans and could make an announcement as early as next week.
The move marks a major reversal for Bloomberg, who announced in March that he would not run for president, and also serves as a public rebuke of the performance so far of former vice president Joe Biden, who has attempted to build a coalition of the same moderate Democrats that Bloomberg would court.
One of the driving reasons Bloomberg decided against joining the race earlier this year - he announced his decision seven weeks before Biden entered - was his view that Biden was too formidable a contender. But in the months since, Biden has been underwhelming, remaining among the race's leaders but halting in his debate performances and stumbling over raising the tens of millions necessary to mount a strong campaign.
Bloomberg adviser Howard Wolfson would not take on Biden personally in confirming the billionaire's plans but did allude to questions about the field.
"We now need to finish the job and ensure that Trump is defeated," Wolfson said. "But Mike is increasingly concerned that the current field of candidates is not well positioned to do that."
Concern is also rippling through the Democratic Party over the others at the top of the candidate pile. The liberal policy positions advanced by Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) are seen by many as unpalatable in general election contests in the states expected to determine the winner. Sanders's health is also an issue after his October heart attack. South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg has attracted attention and raised substantial money, but he has little support among African Americans, one of the party's most important constituencies.
Bloomberg, 77, has been outspoken in his opposition to Warren's and Sanders's intentions to raise taxes on the extremely wealthy like himself, and on Thursday they returned the ill sentiments.
"The billionaire class is scared and they should be scared," Sanders wrote on Twitter after news of Bloomberg's possible entry became public.
"Welcome to the race, @MikeBloomberg!" Warren tweeted, providing a link to the impacts her policies would have on billionaires. She also sent out a fundraising email saying "the wealthy and well connected are scared."
It is still possible that Bloomberg would not ultimately enter the race, but he is taking steps to ensure he will be on the ballot. Alabama's deadline is Friday, and New Hampshire's is Nov. 15.
The Democratic field has winnowed recently from two dozen to 16, but Bloomberg's decision could also open the door to other announcements. Former attorney general Eric H. Holder Jr. has not ruled out a possible entry, nor has the party's 2016 nominee, Hillary Clinton. Oprah Winfrey, an early backer of Barack Obama, has repeatedly begged Disney chief executive Bob Iger to jump into the race, but he has so far been unwilling.
"His getting in the race is certainly going to stimulate thought and provocations that weren't there before," former senator Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) said of Bloomberg, whom he spoke to on Thursday. He is scheduled to talk with Holder early next week.
"Bloomberg doesn't do things halfway," Reid added. "He's going to stir up some conversation."
Bloomberg has decided not to raise money for his bid if he does move forward, which would preclude him from entry in the Democratic debates under rules that require a growing number of donors to qualify. "He has never raised a dime for his campaigns, and he is not about to start," said a person familiar with his thinking, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak frankly about the planning.
It is also possible that he decides to skip the first four voting states, an unorthodox strategy that could upend the regular nominating process and place far more emphasis on the Super Tuesday contests of March 3, when the race will become more nationalized - and more expensive. His advisers have said in the past that they did not plan to operate with a preset budget if he mounted a presidential effort.
News of Bloomberg's potential entry was first reported by the New York Times.
Bloomberg's adviser Wolfson, in confirming his plans, highlighted his history of building a business from scratch and becoming a "high-impact philanthropist." He has also spent lavishly on politics, donating more than $100 million in the 2018 midterms and playing a role in Tuesday's off-year elections, in which Democrats romped in the suburbs that often yearn for a moderate standard-bearer.
Bloomberg was open earlier this year about his desire to get into the Democratic primary race. He made trips to Iowa and New Hampshire, testing the waters for a campaign before deciding against it, and instead planned to fund an independent political operation that would work against Trump.
"I believe I would defeat Donald Trump in a general election," Bloomberg said in a statement in March. "But I am clear-eyed about the difficulty of winning the Democratic nomination in such a crowded field."
Bloomberg is the second billionaire Democrat to reverse an earlier decision. Tom Steyer had initially decided against running but recently joined the field.
A Monmouth University poll in March found that Bloomberg was disliked by just about as many Democrats as liked him - with 27 percent viewing him favorably, 26 percent unfavorably, and nearly half saying they had no opinion or hadn't heard of him.


Bloomberg's entrance would reignite a battle over how much the richest Americans should be taxed. In January, on one of his final New Hampshire trips before deciding against a bid, Bloomberg told The Washington Post that Warren's wealth tax was "probably unconstitutional," and he warned that seriously pursuing it could wreck the country's prosperity.
"We need a healthy economy, and we shouldn't be embarrassed about our system," Bloomberg said. "If you want to look at a system that's not capitalistic, just take a look at was perhaps the wealthiest country in the world, and today people are starving to death. It's called Venezuela."
Warren, who has eschewed big-money fundraisers, had warned from the outset of her campaign that a self-funding billionaire was a threat to the party.
"We ought to be building grass-roots support," Warren told reporters after her very first campaign event of 2019, in Council Bluffs, Iowa. "We ought to be building a movement. And the way we do that is with lots of involvement from lots of people. Not having billionaires buy these campaigns, whether we're talking about super PACs or self-funding."
Bloomberg's entrance would give her and Sanders another foil but could pose challenges not only to Biden and Buttigieg but a host of moderates who have struggled to gain traction, including Montana Gov. Steve Bullock and Sens. Michael F. Bennet (Colo.) and Amy Klobuchar (Minn.)
"I still believe Biden is best positioned to defeat Trump, but Bloomberg obviously fears that Warren or Sanders might prevail in the primary and then end up losing to Trump," said Jon Cooper, a Democratic fundraiser and prominent Biden supporter. "For those more centrist Democrats who share that concern, Bloomberg's entry into the race could offer a belt-and-suspenders approach."
When he decided not to run earlier this year, Bloomberg's advisers had pointed to the apparent strength of other moderate potential candidates, most notably Biden. But he has grown increasingly concerned, particularly as impeachment proceedings have threatened to ensnare Biden over his actions regarding Ukraine.
"As incredibly concerned as Mike was about Trump remaining president, after Ukraine he become ever more concerned. He is convinced the president is an existential threat," said the person familiar with Bloomberg's thinking.
"We have seen in data that Democrats are extremely focused on nominating the best candidate to defeat Donald Trump. There is a supreme desire to have the best possible candidates to run in November. We think we can make a very, very strong case that that is Mike Bloomberg," the person said.

Trump should be censured, not impeached

Texto completo: On Jan. 20, 2017, The Washington Post reported that "The effort to impeach President Donald John Trump is already underway." Even before Trump took the oath of office that day, Democratic groups were looking for a pretext to remove him from office.
They thought they would get one from special counsel Robert Mueller. Instead, Mueller found that Trump did not conspire with Russia to steal the 2016 election. But rather than capitalize on that moment of vindication, Trump decided to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory and give Democrats the pretext they had been looking for -- by asking Ukraine to investigate Hunter Biden.
Democrats can't believe their luck. Unlike Russia, this time Trump actually did something wrong. The president's phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy was not "perfect," as Trump repeatedly claims. A USA Today-Suffolk University poll finds that only 30% of Americans believe there was nothing wrong with the call. But the same poll finds that just 38% think it was an impeachable offense, while 21% say it was wrong but not impeachable.
That means most Americans agree with Democrats that Trump did something wrong, but only a minority believe his misconduct rises to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors. Worse still for Democrats, according to an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll, 53% of Americans believe that their impeachment inquiry is politically motivated. And in six key swing states likely to decide the 2020 election, voters oppose removing Trump from office by a margin of 53% to 43%, according to a New York Times-Siena College survey.
So, unless some bombshell evidence emerges to turn public opinion decisively in favor of impeachment, Trump will not be removed from office. Impeachment would be a purely symbolic act.
So why not drop impeachment and censure him instead?
There is precedent for doing so. In 1834, the Senate voted to censure President Andrew Jackson (whose portrait Trump has proudly hung in the Oval Office) over his stonewalling of a congressional investigation into Jackson's decision to shut down the Second Bank of the United States. If Congress voted to censure Trump, it would make him only the second president in history to have been so explicitly reprimanded.
The House could easily pass such a censure resolution and might even do so with a bipartisan majority. Right now, House Republicans feel no pressure to vote for impeachment, and Senate Republicans feel no pressure to convict, because most Americans agree with them that Trump's conduct is not impeachable. They know that, if anything, impeachment poses a greater political danger to Democrats, putting at risk 31 House seats held by freshman Democrats in districts Trump carried in 2016.
But by censuring instead of impeaching the president, Democrats could easily turn the political calculus against the GOP. The Post reports that a growing number of Republicans are ready to acknowledge that the president did use military aid as leverage to force Ukraine to investigate the Biden family but that "the president's action was not illegal and does not rise to the level of an impeachable offense." To oppose a censure resolution, Republicans would have to argue not just that the president's misconduct does not rise to the level of an impeachable offense, but that there was no misconduct at all. Clearly there was, and Americans know it. Censure would put public opinion squarely on the Democrats' side and put Republicans in a political bind.
A bipartisan censure vote would ultimately be more damaging to Trump than impeachment along party lines. The impeachment inquiry is energizing Trump voters, who believe Democrats are trying to invalidate their votes by removing Trump from office. Censure would take away that argument. It would be dispiriting to Trump's base, especially if some Republicans joined Democrats in voting to rebuke the president. Trump would be furious at a bipartisan vote of censure.
The Senate would not be required to take up a censure resolution passed by the House, but so what? Jackson's censure was passed by only one house of Congress. If the House censured the president, and the Senate failed to even vote on the resolution, it would look very bad for Republicans.
Will Democrats do it? Probably not. Their ravenous base wants to brook no compromise. But because impeachment will be nothing more than an act of censure anyway, why not actually censure Trump and pressure some Republicans to vote against their president? Then leave the decision of whether to remove Trump from office where it belongs -- in the hands of the American people next November.

Mike Pence, the 'Resistance's' new hero

Texto completo: Meet the Trump Resistance's new hero: Vice President Mike Pence.

At least, that’s what they thought, according to the anonymous author of A Warning, a book that details the internal effort to undermine President Trump’s administration.

The author of the book is the same person who wrote last year’s infamous New York Times op-ed, which detailed the efforts of inside bureaucrats attempting to temper Trump’s worst tendencies and even circumvent them.

One such effort involved several high-level White House aides and administration officials who considered invoking the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office. The author alleges that during their tally of Cabinet members who would sign a letter declaring Trump unfit, the resistance types counted Pence as one of them.

This effort, of course, never came to fruition. Even if it had, it’s highly unlikely Pence would have ever agreed to it. Pence’s team has already dismissed the allegation as “fake news,” and a few other individuals close to Pence have confirmed the vice president would never have signed on for that kind of plan in the first place.

But it’s worth considering why these bureaucrats thought Pence would jump on board the anti-Trump bandwagon. Pence has not once suggested (openly, at least) that Trump is unfit for office or unpresidential. If he had, he probably wouldn’t be vice president. Pence agreed to work with and for Trump, and when he made that decision he knew exactly who Trump was, faults and all.

For Pence to then turn around and sign a letter declaring Trump unfit would be completely out of character. Pence isn’t a hard guy to read (neither is Trump, for that matter). Quite frankly, Pence doesn’t seem to have the kind of political ambition necessary to betray the guy who chose him to be vice president and then take his job.
Believe it or not, Pence probably agrees with Trump — he might even like him, too!

Despite what the Resistance types might think, this is not a Shakespeare play and they are not heroes. This is politics, and Trump is a legitimately elected president. This means that when you fight a president, you fight him on legal and constitutional grounds, or impeach him, or kick him out in the next election, as I wrote last month. It doesn’t mean unidentified, unelected bureaucrats get to take governing powers into their own hands and run their own show behind the scenes.
These bureaucrats are make-believe heroes in search of a make-believe villain. At least there’s one person in Trump’s corner who understands that.

GOP can make a Senate impeachment trial just as painful for Democrats as it will be for Trump

Texto completo: When House Speaker Nancy Pelosi saw that her party’s presidential candidates were in a major rut, she broke the emergency glass to begin the impeachment process. But it’s not clear that she thought this all the way through.
Assuming impeachment in the House is inevitable, and it is, Republicans in the Senate can make things worse for Democrats heading into the 2020 election than they already are.
And they should. It will be fun!
Here are just a few ways to do it.
Subpoena the person that may very well be the Democrats’ 2020 presidential nominee: former Vice President Joe Biden. While they’re at it, bring in his middle-aged son, Hunter Biden. Among the million goal posts set up by Democrats in the impeachment pursuit is the claim that Trump wanted Ukraine to commit to investigating the Bidens for the sole purpose of hurting Biden in the election. The investigation would have presumably centered on Hunter Biden’s dubious involvement with the Ukrainian energy company Burisma, and Biden’s involvement as vice president in the ousting of a Ukrainian prosecutor who was investigating the company for corruption. There’s a there there, and Biden has all but admitted it in his very limited public remarks on the matter. They need to be asked about everything they know, even if it means Biden has a meltdown out of frustration on the witness stand.
Subpoena the career government employee who started this circus. If President Trump stands accused of not committing a crime but merely conducting government affairs in a disagreeable way, the person who brought the initial accusation should be questioned. The public deserves to know everything about him there is to know, directly from his mouth. The inspector general said the bureaucrat exhibited a political bias. What was the nature of it? What’s his employment history? Why did he meet directly with Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff’s staff, a step that’s outside the normal protocol for whistleblowers?
Next, Republicans can provide a detailed account of the Ukrainian government’s direct interference in the 2016 election. They can do that by subpoenaing the three New York Times reporters who broke the story in mid-August of that year. That last sentence will probably make every journalist in Washington soil themselves; so, to be clear, the purpose of bringing in the reporters would not be to force them to reveal sources and newsgathering methods (ZZZ) but to ask them to walk the public through their reporting on a major scandal. The story itself is transparent about the Ukrainian government agencies (which happen to also work with the FBI) that provided interviews, records, and other materials for the Times’ report. But the Senate trial will be televised, and seeing the story told is far more compelling than asking that the public read an article that’s now three years old.
Pelosi thought she was helping Democrats by creating an impeachment spectacle and taking the attention away from the flailing Democratic presidential candidates. It’s working for now, but Republicans can play that same game in the Senate.

Gail Collins: Trump’s loss in Kentucky was the greatest ever. At least, that’s what he said.

Texto completo: Counting down …
“Can you believe it? Less than a year,” Donald Trump told a rally in Kentucky this week, looking forward to election 2020.
Not nearly as much as we are, Don.
Tuesday’s voting was only a weenie prologue, although naturally we intend to read as much into the results as is humanly possible. Virginia went a serious shade of blue; the Pennsylvania suburbs started looking distinctly Never Trump, and the Republican governor of Kentucky seems to be out of a job.
That last was certainly embarrassing for Trump, who held a big rally in Lexington on the day before the election, during which he freely admitted that if Gov. Matt Bevin lost, the evil media would say “Trump suffered the greatest defeat in the history of the world.”
Well, maybe not the greatest. There was the fall of Troy. The Battle of Waterloo. The 1940 NFL championship game when the Chicago Bears beat the Washington Redskins 73-0. Still, pretty embarrassing.
The margin of victory for Democrat Andy Beshear is small, and Bevin is clearly going to keep battling until the vote counters faint. So it’s very likely that by the time Kentucky works this out, the rest of the country will have forgotten all about it.
Except for the part where Trump encouraged his fans to think the gubernatorial election was all a referendum on him. If you run into any problems this week that send you into a funk, just remind yourself that Donald Trump is feeling worse. I guarantee it will perk you up.
Of course, he’s rebranding. “Won 5 out of 6 elections in Kentucky, including 5 great candidates that I spoke for and introduced last night,” he tweeted. In other words: Hey, I lost the governor, but I saved the agriculture commissioner.
Trump’s supporters began excusing the president’s failure to deliver by suggesting Bevin was the worst candidate since the invention of voting booths. And he does seem to be pretty much a jerk. My favorite anecdote is the time he claimed America was “getting soft” after Kentucky school officials closed classes because of a wind chill forecast of 20 below zero.
“He’s such a pain in the ass, but that’s what you want!” Trump told his crowd.
What’s the glory in rallying the troops for a popular governor? It was Bevin’s awfulness that was supposed to convince the world that Republicans would vote for anybody, as long as he was tied to Trump. And you know that if he had won, we’d be hearing nothing all day from the White House but how Kentuckians really went to the polls to defeat impeachment. Bevin himself urged the people at Trump’s rally to “send a message … that we support the president of the United States.”
Message received, governor.
Besides his attempt to convince the world that he had golden coattails, Trump pretty much gave Kentucky his standard-model rally. He quoted mega-compliments from “the great Lou Dobbs,” the Fox Business talking head who recently appeared to claim Trump had invented Saturday and Sunday. (“Have a great weekend. The president makes such a thing possible for us all.”)
Dobbs, Trump confided to the crowd, said that he was “the greatest president of the history of the country, including George Washington and Abraham Lincoln.”
Lincoln, Trump added, was a Republican. “We forgot that: Abraham Lincoln.”
Ever since his election, he’s been marveling about the Lincoln factoid. (“We have to build that up a little more.”) Actually, most Americans know that Abraham Lincoln was a Republican. But everything about the past comes as a huge surprise to Trump. This is the man who addressed a roomful of guests honoring Women’s History Month and asked if any of them had ever heard of Susan B. Anthony.
There actually were some issues in Tuesday’s elections. Abortion rights advocates in Kentucky argued that part of the revolt against Bevin was due to the passage of a state law banning abortions after the first six weeks of pregnancy. In Virginia, where Democrats swept control of state government, one important theme was gun control. (In May, 12 people died in a mass shooting in Virginia Beach, and Republican legislators blocked attempts to take up gun legislation.)
Remember when Trump responded to the mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, by calling for new laws to allow authorities to take guns away from people who were clearly a danger to themselves and others? Those days are gone and — at least in the White House — totally forgotten.
“By the way, you’re going to lose your Second Amendment if you vote with Democrats,” the president told that Lexington rally. “You think I’m kidding? … You will lose your Second Amendment as soon — I’m telling you. As sure as you’re standing here. Is anybody sitting? Nobody ever sits. You can sit if you want. No, just stand. You know what they say in the fake news? Look, you’ve been standing. Nobody sat? I don’t know, isn’t that exciting?”
OK, the last part was sort of just to give you a taste of how his mind works. You’ll have plenty more chances to observe. Remember, we’ve still got a year to go.

Texto completo: En septiembre, el recién llegado presidente ucraniano, Volodymyr Zelensky, se enfrentaba a una difícil decisión: ceder antes las demandas del Presidente Donald Trump y hacer pública una investigación contra sus enemigos políticos o rechazarlas y perder la tan necesaria ayuda militar .
Solo Donald Trump podía desbloquear la ayuda, según le habían dicho dos senadores estadounidenses, y el tiempo se estaba acabando. Si los casi $400 millones de dólares no se desbloqueaban antes del 30 de septiembre, podría perder la cantidad completa, según publicó este jueves The New York Times.
A través de mensajes de WhatsApp y reuniones en Kiev, la capital ucraniana, los altos cargos del gobierno estuvieron varios días tratando de resolver el dilema. La política exterior ucraniana siempre había tratado de no entrar en los debates partidistas estadounidenses pero la ayuda militar del país norteamericano era, según el Times, vital en la guerra contra las fuerzas separatistas prorrusas . Este conflicto armado se ha cargado unas 13,000 vidas desde que comenzó en 2014.
La balanza para Zelensky se estaba inclinando cada vez más para lo que parecía inevitable y su equipo ya se estaba preparando para anunciar públicamente las investigaciones . Una decisión “fatídica”, de acuerdo al diario neoyorquino, ya que el presidente ucraniano había ganado las elecciones con una plataforma anticorrupción que apostaba por el fin de las investigaciones con motivos políticos.
El círculo cercano al presidente Zelensky se comenzaba a “inclinar hacia lo que le habían pedido”, dijo al Post Petro Burkovskiy, un alto cargo de la Fundación de Iniciativas Democráticas. Según él, estaban dispuestos a hacerlo a pesar del riesgo de perder el apoyo bipartidista en Estados Unidos .
El principal convoy de Trump a Ucrania, Gordon Sondland reconoció el martes en su testimonio en el Congreso que la administración Trump había retenido la ayuda militar para presionar a Zelensky a hacer pública dos investigaciones . Una de ellas apuntaría a la familia Biden y a sus hipotéticas presiones para destitutir al fiscal ucraniano que llevaba la investigación sobre la empresa de gas Burisma, en cuya junta directiva estuvo Hunter Biden. La otra iría destinada a acusaciones no probadas de que había sido Ucrania, y no Rusia, la que había intervenido en las elecciones 2016 a favor de Hillary Clinton.
En la llamada telefónica del 25 de julio, que provocó el inicio de la investigación para juicio político, Zelensky garantizó en privado a Trump que su gobierno examinaría dichos asuntos . Sin embargo, lo que Trump en realidad quería era un anuncio público que mermara la popularidad de su principal rival político Joe Biden.
Fue en septiembre cuando Sondland, a quien Trump designó como embajador de la Unión Europea, dijo que no había muchas posibilidades de que la ayuda llegara si no había anuncio público . Lo que Trump quería era que el presidente ucraniano hablara en CNN, según declaró el principal diplomático estadounidense en Ucrania, William B. Taylor Jr.
Después de eso, el gobierno ucraniano acordó que Zelensky hiciera públicas las investigaciones el 13 de septiembre en una entrevista en la mencionada cadena. Pero los eventos en Washington le salvaron de tener que hacerlo. El bloqueo de la ayuda militar se había filtrado y el Congreso estaba alborotado. Así que Trump ordenó enviar la ayuda y Zelensky rápidamente suspendió la entrevista .
Desde entonces, el gobierno de Trump ha tratado de justificar que la ayuda militar no estaba condicionada de ninguna manera alegando que se había enviado sin declaración alguna del gobierno de Ucrania

Texto completo: El exalcalde de la ciudad de Nueva York, Michael Bloomberg, entre a competir a las primarias demócratas de 2020 en Alabama , según han hecho público varios medios este jueves.
El multimillonario neoyorquino dijo en mayo que descartaba concurrir a las elecciones presidenciales de 2020 pero The New York Times lanzó recientemente que Bloomberg lleva semanas sopesando su posible candidatura. Aunque el diario dejó claro que el exalcalde no ha tomado una decisión final, un vocero suyo le dijo a CNN este jueves que “es de esperar” que el hombre se presente a las primarias de Alabama.
De acuerdo al Times, un equipo de Bloomberg se ha dirigido a Alabama para recoger allí las firmas necesarias para las primarias . Aunque las primarias de Alabama no es una de las primeras, la fecha límite que tiene el candidato para presentarse es, según el diario neoyorquino, este viernes.

A smidgen of hope

Texto completo: I've been feeling this strange sensation.
It started on Wednesday morning, and it is not at all unpleasant. I feel warmth for my fellow citizens to the south. And, weirdly, less dread about the future of the entire country. In place of leaden despair, there is something lighter.
Wait. Could this be . . . hope?
It's been a while, but still, I'm pretty sure this is what it used to feel like: The sense that every single thing is not, in fact, going to hell. That, at least sometimes, basic standards of decency will prevail. That, even in the unlikeliest places, enough voters still exist to reject those who say and do awful things.
Can we start with Kentucky? In that deep red state, voters delivered a spectacular, if narrow, victory to Democrat Andy Beshear over incumbent governor and Donald Trump fanboy Matt Bevin on Tuesday. Bevin isn't likely to concede any time soon, and it looks like Republican lawmakers will try to keep him in the corner office by whatever means they can conjure. But his loss has got to smart if you're a Trump cultist in that part of the world.
The president, who won the state by 30 points in 2016, begged voters at a Monday rally to reelect Bevin, who had said and done so many offensive and nutty things that it was easy to see why he and Trump were buds.
“If you lose, they're going to say Trump suffered the greatest defeat in the history of the world," Trump told rally-goers. “You can't let that happen to me!"
Oof! They let it happen to him. Like being booed at a baseball game and at an UFC fight, that has got to sting. You have to think that Bevin's loss — especially among suburban voters — will sow a little fear in Trumpland: Why, perhaps even soulless Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell — also of Kentucky — is rethinking his blind fealty to his president, or at least losing a little sleep.
Then again, nah. Mitch is a man without honor, and Bevin's loss was mostly about Bevin.
For heartening change that will stick, look to Virginia, where voters delivered Democratic majorities in both chambers of state government, revealing a commonwealth that is now reliably blue, and good with women candidates, who made many of the gains.
With Democratic majorities, Virginia can now make serious progress: Legislators can undo Republican gerrymandering (imagine, the party that wins a majority of votes winning a majority of seats!), raise the minimum wage, enact gun safety laws, and even force a national discussion of the Equal Rights Amendment, which would enshrine equal protections for women in the US Constitution. Delightful!
Closer to home, where we're spoiled for good news, there was plenty of it on Tuesday night. Jasiel Correia is leaving the mayor's office in Fall River: It seems that enough voters there finally see that he didn't have their best interests at heart. A truckload of federal indictments for fraud and corruption might have been the tip-off there.
And in Boston, voters elected a City Council dominated by women, progressives, and people of color — many of them big thinkers with powerful ambitions for themselves and the city. It's no less than residents of this majority-minority city — and its pressing problems — deserve.
Such progress warms the heart. Why, it almost makes one optimistic about the future.
Until reality intrudes to crush the election's sugar rush. Nobody with my inbox could stay hopeful for long, anyway. After all, Trump is still president, the man and his cruel policies enabled by a GOP that appears determined to look the other way , even as evidence piles up of impeachable offenses.
Worse, as a New York Times poll earlier this week revealed, he might yet win reelection because, though he trails in national polls, Trump is still formidable in the battleground states that carried him to Electoral College victory in 2016. And, worse still, there remain plenty of voters — even among those inclined to choose a Democrat for president — who are turned off by Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren solely because she's a woman. Female presidential candidates are “super unlikable," one respondent said. In 2019.
Ah, there is that familiar leaden thing again.
Hello darkness, my old friend.

Nonprofit says ex-CEO misused funds; Youth Policy Institute alleges former leader owes it $1.7 million that he spent on himself and his family.

Texto completo: The former head of the L.A.-based anti-poverty nonprofit Youth Policy Institute improperly used the organization's funds to pay the property taxes on his house, buy furniture for his home office and make national political donations, the group alleged in court documents filed this week.
Dixon Slingerland, who was fired as the group's chief executive in September, spent the nonprofit's money on an array of unauthorized and personal expenses, including private tutoring for his children, contributions to his wife's pension, and "lavish" dining, travel and entertainment, according to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing lodged by the nonprofit in federal court.
Board members at the nonprofit "concluded that Mr. Slingerland had been misusing YPI's funds for his personal use over an extended period of time, and at least since 2014," the document says.

Slingerland, a fundraiser for President Obama and Mayor Eric Garcetti, used his group's funds to make "partisan political contributions" to federal campaign committees, an activity that violates federal tax laws, according to the bankruptcy filing.
The allegations come nearly two weeks after the nonprofit abruptly closed its doors, eliminating nearly a thousand jobs and upending services for low-income families in such neighborhoods as Pacoima and Pico-Union. In its filing, Youth Policy Institute said it had sent Slingerland a letter demanding he repay more than $1.7 million.
In an email, Slingerland called many of the allegations in the bankruptcy filing "incorrect and extremely misleading." But he confirmed that "a handful of expenditures were mistakenly made" on his YPI credit card, saying he had already committed to reimbursing the group.
"I have made several attempts to meet with YPI leadership to resolve any and all issues, including the fact that YPI still owes me money," he said in an email. "YPI has refused to engage in discussions or provide me with the necessary detail needed to clear up these matters."
A representative of Slingerland, who declined to be named, provided additional details, saying he inadvertently used the nonprofit's American Express card to pay for his children's tutoring, his property tax bill and some political donations. The representative also said nonprofit funds were spent on Slingerland's own retirement benefits -- not his wife's -- and that those payments had been approved by the board.
Slingerland, who ran the nonprofit for 23 years, had a salary of around $400,000 when he was fired. During his tenure, he forged ties with local, state and federal politicians, raising campaign money and working with them to secure taxpayer funding for his organization.
Slingerland hosted at least seven fundraisers for Garcetti's 2013 mayoral campaign, according to campaign invitations and Los Angeles City Ethics Commission records. He contributed $5,000 to a committee set up by Garcetti to support congressional candidates in the 2018 midterm election.
Slingerland also raised money for the Obama Victory Fund, a joint project of Obama's 2012 reelection campaign and the Democratic National Committee. The New York Times, citing internal campaign documents, reported in 2012 that Slingerland had raised more than $743,000 for Obama over two presidential election cycles.
The bankruptcy filing does not say which political committee received the allegedly improper contributions. Dan Grunfeld, who served briefly as the nonprofit's CEO, declined to comment on the bankruptcy filing.
Kevin Meek, the nonprofit's lawyer, said in an email that he is "not at liberty" to answer questions about the case. "All questions must be directed to the trustee that will be appointed for the Chapter 7 estate of YPI," he said.
Youth Policy Institute had an annual budget of around $47 million, running programs at roughly 100 locations and offering tutoring, job training and many other programs. The group was frequently promoted by Garcetti and other politicians.
Federal education officials concluded earlier this year the group lacked the proper financial controls and the systems needed to manage its cash flow. And last month, the nonprofit was the subject of a scathing audit that found weak oversight and inaccurate financial reports -- and warned that the group's future was seriously in doubt.
The bankruptcy filing describes the board's effort to get a handle on the nonprofit's financial problems, including the formation of a special committee in April to investigate issues uncovered by auditors.
While reviewing Slingerland's expenses, the committee also found evidence indicating that Slingerland had directed the nonprofit to overstate its expenses on reports to state education officials, the filing says. The committee also found evidence that the former CEO had directed the disbursement of federal grant funds for a program that had not yet incurred any expenses, the document states.
Slingerland did not respond to questions about those particular claims. He said in a follow-up email that he has tried six times since July to discuss unresolved issues with the nonprofit.
During the nonprofit's final weeks, its executives attempted to rescue many of the group's programs. The Santa Ana-based nonprofit Think Together picked up the vast majority of the group's after-school contracts. Los Angeles city officials have been working to find groups to take over the nonprofit's job training programs.
Grunfeld, the former CEO, said last week that about 475 of the nonprofit's employees had found jobs with organizations that are taking over Youth Policy Institute's programs. A job fair has been scheduled for next week for those who did not find work, he said.
Many who worked for the Youth Policy Institute received less than 24 hours notice about the group's closure. Employees have not been compensated for their final week of work or their unpaid vacation days, said Bri-Anne Sullivan, who spent nearly two years with the nonprofit.
Sullivan, who managed some of the nonprofit's tutoring programs, said she was proud of the work she did and dismayed by new allegations that nonprofit money had been used for an executive's personal gain.
"It's astounding," she said. "I don't even have the words to tell you how that really hurts."

Texto completo: This summer, beauty fans online might have stumbled upon a story about how "Bird Box" star Sandra Bullock was leaving Hollywood to concentrate on her lifestyle brand. The story appeared on a website with pictures of her appearance on Ellen DeGeneres' talk show.
The ad claimed she was talking about the skin care products that have kept the 55-year-old actress looking youthful and even admitting to starting a backlash from plastic surgeons furious over her age-defying serum.
The problem for those consumers who then signed up for the free trial offer is that none of that is true, according to a lawsuit filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court on Wednesday.

Bullock knows nothing of the product, has no skincare line to leave Hollywood for, and appeared on the "Ellen" show in 2018 only to promote her movie "Ocean's 8," the lawsuit says.
"People are being defrauded in this massive scam using Sandra's and Ellen's names and images," said Michael Kump, Bullock's attorney, and Michael Weinsten, DeGeneres' attorney, in a statement.
The lawsuit exposes the abuses of so-called affiliate marketing in which fake celebrity endorsements have boomed online. The two stars join other A-listers who've sought to clamp down of fake endorsements using their image or likeness to shill products without their permission. The case was first reported by the New York Times.
Affiliate marketing is a popular way for online celebrities to earn money by promoting products and directing consumers to the online seller, netting a cut of each sale.
The actors are seeking unspecified damages and are using the litigation to unmask the cottage industry of scammers who create fake stories online to lure consumers without the expense of traditional advertising, according to the claim. The ads ask consumers to share their credit or debit card information and potentially rope them into recurring charges, with the promise of a free trial or the cost of shipping only.
The identities of these website creators, selling items such as beauty products and weight loss potions, are usually masked through private registration methods, making it hard to clamp down on their activities online, according to the claim.
High-profile actors like the Oscar-winning Bullock and DeGeneres are vulnerable to such schemes because of their age, great looks and reputation for honesty, the lawsuit alleges.
Both have been fighting such schemes for two years, sending cease-and-desist orders, but the ads reappear either in a different form or with a different product name. The lawsuit lists about 40 products that have been promoted without their consent.
The Better Business Bureau said in December that although free trials of products can be legitimate, millions of consumers are being scammed with fake endorsements. Some soon discover the trial is not free and are unwittingly charged $100 or more if they don't cancel in 14 days. Such scams have cost consumers more than $1.3 billion in the last decade, the bureau said.

Texto completo: Witold Banka's idea to expand WADA's reach into countries where testing is often nonexistent has run into immediate pushback.
KATOWICE, Poland -- Witold Banka, the sports minister of Poland and president-elect of the World Anti-Doping Agency, is full of ideas. His biggest one, though, might be a tough sell.
Banka, who at 35 is less than half the age of the man he will succeed on Jan. 1, this week proposed the creation of a so-called solidarity mechanism that would provide drug testing in parts of the world where, currently, it is almost nonexistent. It is a bold initiative, and an expensive one, but Banka is proposing that it be financed by corporate sponsors.
"This is ridiculous we have less than $ 40 million and we are the global regulator of antidoping," Banka said. That figure is a reference to WADA's budget, which is made up of contributions from public bodies -- the largest contribution comes from the United States -- and the International Olympic Committee.
Banka, a former 400-meter runner, said this week that sponsors should kick in, too. He raised the idea of a solidarity fund in remarks Tuesday at a WADA conference held in his hometown, then expanded on his proposal in an interview with The New York Times on Wednesday.
While his optimism was abundant, the likelihood of success may be low. A similar fund-raising arm created by WADA several years ago -- also aimed at drawing in private-sector donations -- yielded nothing. And when Banka revealed his initial proposal this week, the head of global sponsorships at Coca-Cola -- among the biggest investors in global sports -- took to social media to say any conversation seeking funds would likely be "very brief."
The I.O.C. this week pledged to provide as much as $ 10 million more to WADA, but that is not enough to fulfill all the requirements placed on the organization to police doping around the world. WADA also continues to struggle with the aftermath of the 2015 Russian doping scandal, and next month it is expected to make a decision on Russia's latest transgressions, which could lead to a new, more sweeping sporting suspension for the country.
It was when the Russian scandal first broke that WADA's outgoing president, Craig Reedie, went public with longstanding complaints bemoaning how a lack of financial firepower was preventing WADA from fulfilling its mission. Reedie, 78, said at the time that sponsors and media companies in the $ 145 billion sports industry also needed to play a part in keeping sports clean.
Reedie said then that he would begin knocking on the doors of the biggest corporations to ask for contributions. But as he plans to depart, those efforts have been met with silence.
"The problem with the corporate world is WADA doesn't provide the corporate world with any marketable benefits," Reedie said, conceding that he may have been too ambitious in his plans. He suggested Banka would do better reaching out to officials he knows who have access to government coffers.
The demands on WADA are higher than ever. Doping investigations in Russia and elsewhere have at times overwhelmed its investigative arm, while attempts to hack WADA's computer systems have required expensive investments in defending against cyberattacks.
"I am not naïve, I am optimistic," said Banka, who became Poland's sports minister at 31. He suggested he had a commitment from the head of Poland's main oil company to contribute to his antidoping fund, which he said would focus mostly on countries, particularly in Africa, where he said precompetition testing programs are inadequate or nonexistent.
"We are forgetting it's not fair on athletes from the United States, Britain, Poland or Germany which are from countries with strong antidoping policies that they are competing with athletes from countries without controls."
Banka has been more tight-lipped when it comes to WADA's ongoing dispute with Russia. He said he did not want to prejudge the most recent investigation, in which Russia is accused of making thousands of changes to an athlete database in an effort to cover up failed drug tests by former athletes.
WADA investigators are in the process of making a final submission to a committee led by a British lawyer, Jonathan Taylor. That committee will make a recommendation to WADA's board about whether Russia should face new penalties, which could include a ban from global sports. Taylor told The Times in September that Russia would need to "pull a rabbit out of the hat" to provide a legitimate explanation for manipulating the database.
Banka, at least this week, was urging caution. "Please wait for the future decision," he said. "I need to remind you my term in office starts Jan. 1 next year. My attitude to this case and other cases regarding antidoping will be very tough."
Like his departing colleagues, though, Banka said he shared the concerns of the International Olympic Committee over proposed legislation in the United States that would criminalize international doping conspiracies. Banka said the legislation, which has passed the House of Representatives and now requires Senate approval, risks giving the United States far-reaching powers.
Globally, sports officials have been wary of the reach of American law enforcement since 2015, when the Department of Justice unveiled a sweeping indictment and arrested dozens of officials linked to soccer's global governing body, FIFA.
"WADA has some concerns about extraterritoriality," Banka said, declining to elaborate.

Times Loses Advertising But Gains Subscribers

Texto completo: Readers continue to shower The New York Times with money. Advertisers, not so much.
The publisher added 273,000 new online subscribers in the third quarter, for a total of four million digital readers, the company reported Wednesday. The number of total subscribers, including print and digital, hit 4.9 million, a high. Advertising was the weak spot, falling 6.7 percent over all, with digital ad revenue dropping 5.4 percent.
The decline in print advertising was not unusual, as readers continue to prefer getting their news on screens. The drop in digital ads, however, was more surprising for The Times, an established publisher with a growing base of online readers.
The stock, which fell as much as 9 percent in early trading on Wednesday, was down 3.7 percent at the close.
In the earnings statement, Mark Thompson, the chief executive, chalked up the decline to the "continued turbulence in the digital advertising space." Last year, the company benefited from a more robust ad business when it drew marketers like Google, which spent heavily to promote its cloud service. The company said it expected a "challenging" fourth quarter as well, with digital advertising expected to fall somewhere around 15 percent.
For the third quarter, the company earned $ 44 million in adjusted profit, or 12 cents a share, on $ 428.5 million in revenue, beating expectations on income. Wall Street had expected a profit of about $ 40 million, or 10 cents a share, on $ 428.6 million in sales. Costs rose 5.4 percent, to $ 401 million, largely from higher newsroom expenses, which included new hires. The company, which is nearing 1,700 newsroom staffers, expects operating costs to increase "to higher levels" starting next year.
The New York Times Company kept the focus on its digital subscriber gains in its report, and Mr. Thompson called the period from July to September "our best-ever third quarter for new digital news subscriptions." The majority of the new additions, about 209,000, paid for the main news product. The rest came from subscriptions to the Crossword and Cooking products.
Despite the steady rise in online readership, each subscriber brings in less revenue on average as the company continues to offer promotions. The Times sold subscriptions for $ 1 a week starting in August 2018, and those customers are now seeing their rates rise after the one-year offer expires. Renewals for those readers have been fairly positive, Mr. Thompson said.
The Times also hailed a major change to the company's pay model, an initiative known internally as Project Redbird. Starting in the third quarter, the publisher limited the amount of free content available to anonymous users to just one article. Readers were then prompted to register to get to more free content, anywhere from five to 10 stories.
That was a key factor in the uptake of new subscribers in the quarter, executives said on an earnings call after the report. Meredith Kopit Levien, the chief operating officer, added that the project was part of long-term planning for a more efficient marketing strategy. The company expects digital subscription revenue to increase by around 15 percent for the fourth quarter.
The company also revealed for the first time the size of its international readership: 500,000 digital subscribers, mostly from Britain, Canada and Australia. The company said it was still on a pace to reach its previously stated goal of 10 million paying readers by 2025, with "at least two million" coming from outside the United States.
The company's new television effort, "The Weekly," available on the cable network FX and the streaming service Hulu, helped bump up revenue in the period. The company does not report sales figures for the show, but the unit under which it operates posted a $ 9.8 million jump in revenue, mostly from "The Weekly." Deals for documentary-style TV programs typically bring in $ 500,000 to under $ 1 million per episode for publishers.
The show, which began in June, averaged about 382,000 total viewers who watched it within the first week of each episode's air date, according to Nielsen data. That figure does not include those who watched on Hulu.
The publisher cut a multimillion-dollar, multiyear licensing agreement with Facebook last month that should also add to the company's fourth-quarter revenue. As part of its latest foray into publishing, Facebook will feature articles from The Times along with other publishers like The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post for a new section of its mobile app dedicated to news.
Mr. Thompson called it a strategically significant deal. "This is the first time that a Silicon Valley major has recognized the value of Times journalism to its platform with a substantial multiyear fee," he said.
The Facebook agreement differs markedly from one offered by Apple this year for its Apple News Plus product. The Times declined to join that effort, a deal that would have split subscription revenues with the hardware giant. Apple News Plus, a $ 10-a-month subscription app installed on all iPhones, hosts entire articles on its service. Facebook's news tab, by contrast, shows only headlines and summaries and directs users to the publishers' sites.
In December, the company expects to buy back its headquarters building, at 620 Eighth Avenue in Manhattan, for $ 245 million. That will eat into the company's cash holdings of about $ 877 million.
The Times spent $ 619 million on the 52-story building, designed by the architect Renzo Piano, and moved into the space in 2007. Two years later, the company entered into a sale-leaseback agreement and raised $ 225 million to help pay down its debts. The deal came with an option to buy the building back in 2019. The effective interest rate on the loan was about 13 percent.

MADISON IS A BIKE-FRIENDLY CITY - WITH A LONG WAY TO GO; COMMENTARY

Texto completo: My body is barely bruised. I've only got a nick on my forehead and an elbow scrape. You wouldn't know it from looking at me, but my muscles feel like they've been ripped apart. I keep struggling to fall soundly asleep. My body creaks and snaps with every subtle shift, and I am reliving the incident.
I feel like I was hit by a car. And perhaps, that's because I was.
A week ago Monday morning, as I was commuting by bike to work, I was hit by a driver at the intersection of Brooks Street and Campus Drive. Like every other day, I had taken the Campus Drive bike path westward until I would need to make a daring left turn across three lanes of traffic. This is the most exposed section of my commute. Cars are on the left three lanes and a bus lane is to the right (however, passenger vehicles are often illegally in the bus lane, too). When it's busy, I'll hear the roar of vehicles to my left, and feel the encroaching doom on my back right as a bus jockeys with me.
On this day, the traffic hadn't posed a threat. Soaked in the downpour, as the light turned green on Brooks Street, I started toward it staying on the right side of the road. A small, silver sedan started pulling out, turning left on Campus Drive, and right toward me. For a split second, I thought, "They'll stop." Every single time a car has pulled into my lane or area, they've stopped short. There have been plenty of close calls as a near-daily bike commuter for about six or seven years, but never any crashes. Largely, biking has been a wonderful way for me to stay active and reduce my carbon footprint.
I've biked in numerous cities for work and regular commutes, and Madison has been the most bike-friendly of all. There are protected bike lanes, special bike signals, bike sharing via BCycle and a culture of riding. The sum of these initiatives is an impressive infrastructure that encourages people to ride regularly, including older adults, children and people who haven't ridden in years.
Despite these advancements, there's a saying in the bike-riding business: It's not if, but when you will be hit. Monday happened to be my day. As the car on Brooks Street proceeded without caution, I was struck in my left thigh, then thrown across the hood. My shoulder was next to make contact, as it took the brunt of my fall to the ground. Finally, my helmeted head scraped the road. Thankfully, the crash did not result in a head injury or concussion.
A passerby ran over and asked if I was OK. I stood up rapidly, looked down at my body, and didn't notice anything bent at 90-degree angles or missing. The driver was shaken up, as well, and seemed genuinely concerned about my well-being. I don't know if she was texting, dialing or turning dials in her car. But she had at least stopped to check on me.
Only a block from work, I decided to walk the rest of the way and then assess the damage in my office. I limped and winced, but it took about 24 hours before the full extent of the pain and injuries were realized.
Today, I share my story with you because I want to continue to make Madison one of the most bike-friendly places on Earth. To achieve this, we must make meaningful changes to the infrastructure and culture of biking and driving, both here and across America.
We need fierce enforcement of distracted driving laws, which should include calling and texting while driving. Every day that I walk or bike, I see drivers looking down they're inputting Google Maps destinations, texting friends and family, and blissfully unaware of what's happening beyond their peripheries. Law enforcement should focus on making the streets safer by literally making the streets safer policing those who wield what New York Times columnist Allison Arieff called "death machines."
We need more advanced, protected bike infrastructure. Protections can include cones, concrete barriers and other physical separators. Especially on dangerous roads like Campus Drive, a physical separation should exist for those moving west in between passenger vehicles and buses.
We need more than lights on streets like Blair. Recently, the city installed crossing lights there for bikers and pedestrians. But lights aren't stopping cars. Almost every day I bike past that intersection, I see cars running that red light. Traffic cameras and enforcement could greatly impact the amount of illegal crossings, as would infrastructure that encourages slower driving such as bumps and signage.
We need bike boxes for making turns at challenging intersections. Some already exist on Johnson going east. They allow bikers to wait for traffic to open up, allowing them to cross safely and with greater visibility for cars on the perpendicular road. If biker boxes were painted on Campus Drive, it's possible this crash might have never happened.
A day after the crash, I walked to campus and found my bike where I locked it. I couldn't stay away for long. I tried to bike and could feel my knee snapping and the pedal bending. Both me and my bike were worse for the wear, but committed to moving and making Madison a safer, better city for all.

Texto completo: I always knew the Armenian genocide was real because I grew up with Armenians who survived it and then made their way to a safe space in the middle of the United States. I was born in Racine and raised in the western Racine County village of Union Grove. I came of age in the Racine County Courthouse. My dad was an assistant district attorney and, when I was a kid, he would take me to the courthouse with him in the morning. I got to run around that remarkable building and hang out in courtrooms and judicial chambers and clerk offices. I got to know Armaganians and Gulbankians and lots of other Armenian-Americans.
For more than a century, Racine has been a place of incoming for Armenian immigrants and a home to their children and grandchildren. They built churches, formed clubs and community groups, opened stores and coffee shops, and became CEOs and doctors and lawyers. Yet they never forgot where they came from, or why they had to come. Vartak Gulbankian, who had come to the United States at the age of 6 with her parents, and who settled in Racine, was one of the Armenian-Americans with whom my father practiced law. A remarkable woman, she graduated from high school at the age of 14 and, at the age of 21, graduated from the University of Wisconsin Law School as the only woman in the class of 1935. She went on to practice law for more than 50 years, and was a proud member of the American Civil Liberties Union and other groups that placed an emphasis on civil rights and civil liberties.
As a child, I learned from these immigrants the history of the Armenian genocide, which began on April 24, 1915, when hundreds of Armenian intellectuals and community leaders were murdered by the Turks. With that, according to the International Association of Genocide Scholars, the "Young Turk government of the Ottoman Empire began a systematic genocide of its Armenian citizens an unarmed Christian minority population. More than a million Armenians were exterminated through direct killing, starvation, torture, and forced death marches." Henry Morgenthau Jr., the U.S. ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, said at the time, "The great massacres and persecutions of the past seem almost insignificant when compared to the sufferings of the Armenian race in 1915."
I also learned of the denial of the genocide, as an assault on truth and memory that has extended across more than a century. There was never any question in my mind that Colin Tatz, the founding director of the Australian Institute for Holocaust and Genocide Studies, was right when he said, "The Turkish denial (of the Armenian genocide) is probably the foremost example of historical perversion. With a mix of academic sophistication and diplomatic thuggery the Turks have put both memory and history into reverse gear." Stanley Cohen, the great professor of criminology at Hebrew University, said, "The nearest successful example (of collective denial) in the modern era is the 80 years of official denial by successive Turkish governments of the 1915-17 genocide against the Armenians in which 1.5 million people lost their lives. This denial has been sustained by deliberate propaganda, lying and cover-ups, forging documents, suppression of archives, and bribing scholars."
The denial has continued to the present day, so egregiously that when Pope Francis acknowledged the 100th anniversary of the genocide in 2015, The New York Times reported that the papal statement "caused a diplomatic uproar with Turkey," which recalled its ambassador from the Vatican and condemned the pope's reference to "genocide" as "baseless." At the time the controversy flared, The Times reported, "Successive administrations have sought to skirt this question because of Turkey's growing importance as a NATO ally and as an influential political and economic power in the Middle East."
Last week, however, the U.S. House of Representatives put itself on the side of truth. The chamber voted 405-11 for a resolution that acknowledged the genocide "in solemn remembrance of one of the great atrocities of the 20th century." Congressman Mark Pocan, D-Town of Vermont, and every other member of the Wisconsin House delegation, Democrats and Republicans, liberals and conservatives, voted for the resolution. Turkish officials immediately decried and dismissed the vote describing it as "a meaningless political step."
But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., corrected that false premise. Of course it was meaningful. As Pelosi explained, "If we ignore history, then we are destined to witness the mistakes of the past be repeated." Added Pelosi, "Recent attacks by the Turkish military against the Kurdish people are a stark reminder of the danger in our own time."
But there is more to it than that. House recognition of the Armenian genocide is a vital step. It's not a final step, mind you; the Senate and the White House still must get on the right side of history. But it matters because, as Congresswoman Anna Eshoo, an Armenian-American from California, reminds us, "This resolution not only commemo-rates my ancestors who perished but all those who were lost in the first genocide of the 20th century."
It also honors those who have fought on behalf of history, and the truth Armenian-Americans, and their allies, in places like Racine. CREDIT: JOHN NICHOLS

Texto completo: John Leguizamo ha pasado el año haciendo algo que muchos calificarían como un acto desafiante: viajar a lo largo de Estados Unidos con un monólogo que reivindica el papel de los latinos en la historia de EE.UU.
Es de asumir que el público que paga una entrada para ver 95 minutos de su espectáculo admira al actor, pero no siempre ha sido así.
* ¿Hablas español? Sigue toda nuestra cobertura aquí
“Ocasionalmente hay una pareja, que suele ser blanca y un poco mayor en edad, que empieza a molestarse mientras ve el show. Y creen que es su derecho decirme que me devuelva a México o alguna locura así…”, le dijo Leguizamo a BBC Mundo en una conversación reciente en Los Ángeles.
“Por cierto, no soy de México… “, añade con picardía el intérprete de 55 años, que nació en Bogotá y llegó a vivir a la ciudad de Nueva York con apenas 4 años de edad.
Facebook Latin History For MoronsLeguizamo se hace pasar por maestro de escuela en su monólogo “Historia latina para tontos”.
El monólogo, que en 2018 recibió un reconocimiento especial en los Premios Tony de lo mejor del teatro de EE.UU., se titula Latin History for Morons, o “Historia latina para tontos”.
En él, Leguizamo se hace pasar por un maestro de escuela que enseña los episodios de la historia que “no aparecen en los libros escolares”.
La sátira del intérprete aborda, entre otras cosas, la “exterminación” por parte de los colonizadores de los imperios maya y azteca y de los indígenas taínos.
* ¿Cómo sería México si Estados Unidos no se hubiera apropiado de más de la mitad de su territorio en el siglo XIX?
En otro momento, destaca también el papel de latinoamericanos e indígenas en la Guerra de Independencia de EE.UU.
Desde su estreno en Broadway en noviembre de 2017, Leguizamo se ha presentado más de 80 veces y ha recorrido unas 30 ciudades del país.
Con una carrera sólida que ha incluido celebradas interpretaciones en películas y series como Carlito’s Way y When They See Us, Leguizamo no olvida lo difícil que es ser un actor latino en Hollywood.
“Cuando empecé me decía el mánager ‘cámbiate el nombre, actúa como italiano, no te broncees ‘”, describió a una audiencia mayoritariamente latina en el evento Hispanicize, celebrado a mediados de octubre en Los Ángeles.
* De costa a costa, cómo cambia el español que se habla en EE.UU. y qué variedades predominan
Y añadió que cuando presentaba algún proyecto a un grupo de ejecutivos de la industria, recibía comentarios como “ Los latinos no quieren ver historias positivas ” o “los latinos no quieren ver a otros latinos”.
Cada vez que puede, Leguizamo lanza la contundente aseveración de “apartheid cultural” para enmarcar la escasa representación de latinos en ámbitos como el entretenimiento y la política pese a constituir la minoría racial y étnica más numerosa en el país.
Getty ImagesLos actores latinos constituyen el 4,5% de los papeles con diálogos de Hollywood, de acuerdo a un estudio de este año.
“Hollywood está perpetrando imágenes negativas de los latinos como narcos o gánsters que alimentan directamente esa demonización que Trump hace de nosotros “, critica.
Leguizamo se refirió al presidente de EE.UU., Donald Trump, quien busca la reelección en 2020 y desde que inició su mandato en 2016 ha mantenido una retórica negativa contra los inmigrantes indocumentados de Latinoamérica.
Al preguntarle cómo explica ese “apartheid”, arroja estadísticas como dardos: “En Los Ángeles, casi el 50% de la población es latina y constituimos el 4% de caras frente y detrás de cámara. Eso es un apartheid cultural”.
De acuerdo a un estudio de este año de la Universidad del Sur de California, los actores latinos constituyen solo el 4,5% de los roles con diálogos de Hollywood.

Algo similar dice sobre la ciudad de Nueva York, que con un 29% de población latina (los blancos no hispanos constituyen el 32%), “ no hay igualdad en el número de historias que reflejen las realidades de los latinos en diarios como el New York Times“, sentencia.
La opresión de hace siglos de la que habla en su monólogo continúa hoy en día, agrega el actor. Algo con lo que piensa luchar por toda su carrera.
“¿Por qué Hollywood necesita venir a ti? Crea tu propio Hollywood”, dice.

Texto completo: Steven J. Hayes, quien cumple seis cadenas perpetuas por una masacre familiar en Connecticut, está recibiendo terapia hormonal en prisión como parte de una transición de género.
El recluso discutió su plan de cambio de sexo durante una serie de entrevistas telefónicas recientes con Joe Tomaso para el podcast “15 Minutes With…”, informó The New York Times.
Hayes, de 56 años, se encuentra en la prisión estatal Greene en Waynesburg, Pensilvania, después de ser transferido en 2016 como parte de un acuerdo interestatal.
Cumple seis cadenas perpetuas por los asesinatos de Jennifer Hawke-Petit (48) y sus dos hijas, Michaela (11) y Hayley (17), cometidos el 23 de julio de 2007.
“Hay muchos problemas con (mi) presentación como mujer”, dijo Hayes en el podcast. “Mucha gente lo acepta, pero en esta instalación, hay muchos racistas y fanáticos en el personal y no están contentos con eso. Hay dos de nosotros aquí que somos femeninas”.
Hayes todavía usaba el nombre Steven en el podcast, y no dijo cómo prefería ser llamado.
Afirmó tener un diagnóstico médico de disforia de género, en el que la apariencia externa de una persona no se alinea con su estado mental y emocional, y un problema recurrente de drogas.
“Soy transgénero”, dijo Hayes. “Me diagnosticaron a los 16 años con trastorno de identidad sexual. Mi familia nunca lo reconoció y nunca fui tratado”.
Maria Finn, portavoz del Departamento de Correcciones de Pensilvania , dijo que no podía comentar sobre un preso específico, pero comentó que había 222 personas transgénero en instituciones penales estatales.
Finn dijo que el sistema penitenciario estatal no paga las cirugías de afirmación de género, pero gasta $60 mil dólares al año en total y hasta $600 por interno en medicamentos para tratar a quienes tienen disforia de género. Los costos anuales de atención médica promedian $5,582 por recluso, según la vocera.
Además de la terapia hormonal, Hayes habló en el podcast de tratar de obtener “otras cosas” como parte del proceso de transición de género, pero no dio más detalles.
Originalmente Hayes recibió la pena de muerte por la invasión del hogar de Hawke-Petit, junto con un cómplice, Joshua Komisarjevsky, cuya apelación de condena será juzgada por la Corte Suprema de Connecticut.
Ambos fueron condenados a cadena perpetua después de que Connecticut abolió la pena de muerte en 2012, enojando a los partidarios de la pena capital y a los defensores de las víctimas, quienes dijeron que la derogación tenía la intención de ser prospectiva y no aplicable a los reclusos que ya estaban en el corredor de la muerte.
En el ínterin, Hayes se convirtió en judío ortodoxo en la cárcel.
Durante el podcast, expresó su remordimiento por los asesinatos y criticó la apelación de Komisarjevsky.
“No hay defensa para lo que hicimos”, dijo. “No quiero formar parte de este juicio. La familia ya no merece pasar por esto”.
Hayes y Komisarjevsky rastrearon a Hawke-Petit y sus dos hijas desde un supermercado cercano hasta su casa en Cheshire (Connecticut), donde las víctimas fueron retenidas como rehenes, agredidas sexualmente y rociadas con gasolina antes de que su casa fuera incendiada.
Antes de matarlas, Hayes obligó Hawke-Petit a ir a un banco local, donde retiró $15 mil dólares, mientras Komisarjevsky esperaba en la casa de la familia con las dos hijas, de 11 y 17 años.
El único sobreviviente del ataque, el Dr. William Petit Jr., un endocrinólogo que era el esposo y el padre de las víctimas, fue brutalmente golpeado con un bate de béisbol durante la invasión. En 2016 fue elegido miembro de la Cámara de Representantes del estado, por el Partido Republicano.
Hayes habló de haber tenido una recaída de drogas y estar en dificultades financieras en el momento de la invasión de la casa. “No era un monstruo”, afirmó sobre el triple homicidio.

The power to spread big lies

Texto completo: Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook says he'll run political ads even if they are false. Jack Dorsey of Twitter says he'll stop running political ads altogether.
Dorsey has the correct approach, but the debate skirts the bigger question: Who is responsible for protecting democracy from big, dangerous lies?
Donald Trump lies like most people breathe. As he's been cornered, his lies have grown more vicious and dangerous. He conjures up conspiracies, spews hate and says established facts are lies and lies are truths.
This would be hard enough for a democracy to handle without Facebook sending Trump's unfiltered lies to the 45% of Americans, for whom it is a source of news. Twitter sends them to 68 million users every day.
A major characteristic of the internet goes by the fancy term "disintermediation." Put simply, it means sellers are linked directly to customers with no need for middlemen.
Amazon eliminates the need for retailers. Online investing eliminates the need for stockbrokers. Travel agents and real estate brokers are obsolete. At a keystroke, consumers get all the information they need. But democracy can't be disintermediated. We're not just buyers and sellers. We're citizens who need to know what's happening around us in order to exercise our right to self-government, and our responsibility for it.
If a president and his enablers are peddling vicious and dangerous lies, we need reliable intermediaries that help us see them.
Intermediating between the powerful and the people was once mainly the job of publishers and journalists - hence the term "media." This role was understood to be so critical to democracy that the constitution enshrined it in the First Amendment, guaranteeing freedom of the press.
With that freedom came public responsibility to be a bulwark against powerful lies. The media haven't always lived up to it. We had yellow journalism in the 19th century and today endure shock radio, the National Enquirer and Fox.
But most publishers and journalists have recognized that duty. Think of the Pentagon Papers, Watergate and, just weeks ago, the exposure of Trump withholding $400 million in security aid to Ukraine until it investigated his major political rival, Joe Biden.
Zuckerberg and Dorsey insist they aren't publishers or journalists. They say Facebook and Twitter are just "platforms" that convey everything and anything - facts, lies, conspiracies, vendettas - with none of the public responsibilities that come with being part of the press. Rubbish. They can't be the major carriers of the news on which most Americans rely while taking no responsibility for its content.
The reason 45% of Americans rely on Facebook for news and Trump's tweets reach 68 million is because these platforms are near monopolies, dominating the information marketplace. No TV network, cable giant or newspaper even comes close. Fox News' viewership rarely exceeds 3 million. The New York Times has 4.7 million subscribers.
Facebook and Twitter aren't just participants in the information marketplace. They're quickly BECOMING the information marketplace.
Antitrust law was designed to check the power of giant commercial entities. Its purpose wasn't just to hold down consumer prices but also to protect democracy. Antitrust should be used against Facebook and Twitter. They should be broken up.
So instead of two mammoth megaphones trumpeting Trump's lies, or those of any similarly truth-challenged successor, the public will have more diverse sources of information, some of which will expose the lies.
Of course, a diverse information marketplace is no guarantee against tyranny. But we now have a president who lies through his teeth and two giant uncritical conveyors of those lies. It is a system that invites tyranny.

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
Eric Asimov, the wine critic at The New York Times for the last 15 years, believes wine, as a product, provides consumers a rare window into the natural world.
Last month, Mr. Asimov wrote a series of articles exploring how the wine industry is responding to one of the most powerful forces shaping agriculture -- climate change. He covered one wine producer's efforts to restore healthy soils, which can help offset emissions by storing carbon. He reported a global wine producer's experiment in planting high-altitude vineyards. And he looked at how vintners in Napa Valley, Calif., are grappling with heat waves, droughts, cold snaps and wildfires.
Mr. Asimov discussed the series, how an understanding of climate change shapes his work as a critic and what he hopes consumers will take away. This conversation has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.
How did this series come about?
Climate change has been an issue for a long time. I think the first article I wrote about climate change was in 2003. I have been aware of how it has affected farmers for years. It kind of coalesced this year because there have been so many examples of violent and unexpected weather. It seemed that, as in all other parts of life, the effects of climate change are escalating much faster than any of us imagined.
How did you approach the series?
Obviously, wine is of minuscule importance in the world, compared to many of the great issues, but it's a window into farming and agriculture and the natural world. So it's an opportunity to discuss how farming and agriculture are related to climate change. Most people don't realize that an enormous percentage of greenhouse gases comes from agriculture, of which wine makes up this tiny part.
What really stood out to you in your reporting?
I think just how much we have to rethink every element of wine, including where you put a vineyard in the world; how you orient it; how you farm it. We never thought about carbon output. Carbon dioxide is a byproduct of fermenting grape juice. Then you get to packaging and shipping wine, which is actually one of the most carbon-heavy elements. It's really a major re-understanding of all that we have assumed.
How does your understanding of climate change shape your work as a critic?
It's such a complicated issue, and I feel as if I have to make a deeper effort to understand every manifestation of climate change as it affects wine. I've always felt that one of the least interesting things for a wine writer to do is to try to describe how a wine tastes. I feel that even more strongly now.
It kind of encompasses every part of our reality. It's a microcosm of culture, politics, economics -- all of the debates that we have on our front page and that we see play out are also playing out in wine in a smaller way. It has deepened my fascination with it.
And it just forced me to consider the nonexperiential elements of wine. But it has all just deepened when you see how much has gone into putting this liquid in a bottle.
What would you encourage readers to think about as they're reading this series?
I hope people start asking more questions about where their wine comes from, how it's made, how the grapes are grown and how the producers take climate change into account in their production -- and make their feelings known through their buying decisions.
Where do you expect your reporting will go next?
I mean, climate change was always in the back of the mind. It was something that you would talk about with people in the wine business kind of in passing. But climate change is now part of the equation, and we have to think about it and talk about it. And as a reporter, we have to ask questions about it.

Texto completo: House investigators on Tuesday released transcripts from two more closed-door depositions.
The House committees leading the impeachment inquiry on Tuesday released transcripts from two more closed-door depositions as the proceedings move to a more public phase.
The transcripts include witness testimony from two figures central to the inquiry, Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union, and Kurt D. Volker, the former special envoy to Ukraine. Reporters from The New York Times combed through the documents and highlighted key parts, offering context and analysis.
Sondland told a Ukrainian official that more than an Oval Office meeting was at stake unless the Ukrainians announced the investigations that Trump sought.
Volker transcript, in text messages released with his testimony, Page 403: "Drove the 'larger issue' home with Yermak. Not about just a meeting but the relationship per se."
By mid-August, the American officials were trying to impress upon Ukrainian officials the need for them to publicly announce investigations into former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., one of President Trump's political rivals, and into a conspiracy theory that Ukraine worked against Mr. Trump in the 2016 election.
In this Aug. 19 text message to another American diplomat, Mr. Sondland wrote that he told Andriy Yermak, a top Ukrainian aide, that an Oval Office meeting between Mr. Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine was not all that hung in the balance. The larger "relationship" between Ukraine and the United States was also at risk, he implied. The Ukrainians wanted the Oval Office meeting to bolster Mr. Zelensky's credibility. But even more important, they wanted the White House to release its hold on $ 391 million in military assistance to help Ukraine fight pro-Russians forces waging a separatist war in eastern Ukraine.
-- Sharon LaFraniere
Sondland said he received a misleading description of the July call between Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart.
Sondland transcript, Page 251: "I think the only readouts I remember seeing were the ones from my team, which were very innocuous, and did not represent what was actually said on the call that I found out once the transcript was a released."
Even though he was dealing directly with the Ukrainian government to set up a meeting between the two presidents, Mr. Sondland said he was never given a readout of the telephone call between President Trump and Mr. Zelensky, which would have been customary for someone in his position.
Other diplomats dealing with Ukraine were also left in the dark. When the White House publicly released the transcript on Sept. 25, they were stunned to learn what Mr. Trump had said.
-- Lara Jakes
Trump complained Ukraine was trying to take him down.
Volker transcript, Page 31: "He gave the example of hearing from Rudy Giuliani that they're all corrupt, they're all terrible people, that they were -- they tried to take me down -- meaning the president in the 2016 election."
Mr. Volker told impeachment investigators that Mr. Trump dismissed their positive assessments of Ukraine during a May 23 meeting at the White House because of what he was hearing from his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani.
That story was echoed by Mr. Sondland, who told investigators that he had also heard Mr. Trump make a remark about believing that Ukraine wanted to take him down.
-- Michael D. Shear
Sondland cast doubt upon accounts that he had linked Mulvaney to a quid-pro-quo scheme.
Sondland transcript, Page 221: "I don't recall ever having a conversation with Mr. Mulvaney about that. I honestly don't. I've had very, very few conversations with Mr. Mulvaney."
Investigators were asking Mr. Sondland about a July 10 meeting with two senior Ukrainian officials in the White House office of John R. Bolton, then the national security adviser. At least one witness has testified that at that meeting, Mr. Sondland blurted out that the acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, had promised an Oval Office invitation to the new Ukrainian president if the Ukrainians announced the sought-after investigations. That would appear to draw Mr. Mulvaney into the scandal.
Questioned repeatedly on that point, Mr. Sondland said that he did not think he ever secured such a guarantee from Mr. Mulvaney and that he did not remember saying that in the meeting.
-- Sharon LaFraniere
After the July call, Volker learned the U.S. had never formally requested that Ukraine open an inquiry into possible interference in the 2016 election.
Volker transcript, Page 197: "Q Did you speak with anyone at D.O.J. about whether the U.S. had requested an official investigation?
A No, I did not. I did ask -- I did ask our Charge to also check. And I later understood that we never had. And because of that was another factor in my advising the Ukrainians then don't put it in now.
A You told the Ukrainians don't put it in the specific investigation?
A Yes, yes.
A Did you speak with the Ukrainians about whether or not the U.S. had ever requested an official investigation?
A It came up in this conversation with Andriy about the statement, and he asked whether we ever had. I didn't know the answer. That's why I wanted to go back and find out. As I found out the answer that we had not, I said, 'We11, 1et's just not go there."'
When Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky spoke on July 25, Mr. Trump said he wanted Attorney General William P. Barr to talk to Mr. Zelensky or someone on his staff about investigating Ukraine's involvement in trying to influence the 2016 presidential election to benefit the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, a far-right theory that has never been corroborated. When Mr. Volker was working on a draft statement with one of Mr. Zelensky's aides a couple of weeks later, Mr. Volker learned that the Justice Department never made a formal request to Ukraine to do such an investigation, which is the standard protocol.
Both Mr. Volker and Mr. Zelensky's aide, Mr. Yermak, agreed that because there was no official request from the Justice Department, it was best to leave out of any statement Mr. Zelensky would make about Ukrainian relations with the United States, further underscoring the separate foreign policy campaign Mr. Giuliani was trying to advance on behalf of Mr. Trump.
-- Eileen Sullivan
Days before the July 25 call, Volker warned Giuliani that the Biden-Ukraine narrative was not credible.
Volker transcript, Page 203: "And I said to Rudy in that breakfast the first time we sat down to talk that it is simply not credible to me that Joe Biden would be influenced in his duties as vice president by money or things for his son or anything like that. I've known him a long time, he's a person of integrity, and that's not credible."
According to Mr. Volker, he had breakfast with Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Giuliani's associate Lev Parnas at the Trump Hotel six days before the phone call between Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky. During their meeting, Mr. Volker tried to convince Mr. Giuliani that the allegations against Mr. Biden and his younger son, Hunter Biden, were not credible. Mr. Volker said he tried to explain to Mr. Giuliani that if Ukraine wanted to investigate possible corruption in one of its companies, Burisma Holdings, that was one thing, but Mr. Volker said he tried to warn Mr. Giuliani not to tie it to the Bidens because it would be seen as political.
-- Eileen Sullivan
In early July, Volker and Zelensky suggested that Giuliani's involvement in Ukraine affairs was a problem.
Volker transcript, Page 138: "The negative narrative about Ukraine which Mr. Giuliani was furthering was the problem. It was, in my view, it was impeding our ability to build the relationship the way we should be doing."
Mr. Volker and Mr. Zelensky met in Toronto on July 3, a few weeks before the phone call between Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky that is at the center of the impeachment inquiry. By Mr. Volker's account, he and Mr. Zelensky discussed the problem that Mr. Giuliani was causing by pushing a negative narrative about Ukraine's corruption as Mr. Zelensky was working to introduce his reform agenda. This shows that during the July 25 phone call, when Mr. Trump suggested that Mr. Zelensky work with Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Zelensky was well-aware of what the president's personal lawyer was doing.
-- Eileen Sullivan
The top U.S. diplomat in Kiev hesitated about taking the job partly because of the influence of Giuliani.
Volker transcript, in text messages released with his testimony, Page 386: "I am still struggling with the decision whether to go. Can anyone hope to succeed with the Giuliani/Biden issue swirling for the next 18 months?" Mr. Taylor said in text messages.
Later Mr. Taylor asked, "Do I want to enter this non-normal world?"
William B. Taylor Jr., now the top American diplomat in Kiev, sent this message to Mr. Volker on May 26, before agreeing to succeed Marie. L. Yovanovitch, who was ousted as the American ambassador to Ukraine. He specifically mentioned Mr. Giuliani in the context of "Biden." This appears to be a reference to Mr. Giuliani's claims, echoed by President Trump, that as vice president, Joseph R. Biden Jr. tried to squash a criminal inquiry of a Ukrainian company that had hired Mr. Biden's son as a board member. No evidence has surfaced to support those claims. Mr. Taylor was also worried about the lack of a normal chain of command.
-- Sharon LaFraniere
The July 25 phone call between Trump and Zelensky was scheduled after Giuliani got on board.
Volker testimony, Page 276: "Orchestrated a great phone call with Rudy and Yermak," Mr. Volker texted another diplomat on July 22. "Rudy is now advocating for a phone call."
This appears to show how, for the Ukrainians, the route to Mr. Trump ran through Mr. Giuliani. Some of Mr. Trump's official advisers, including Mr. Bolton, were against scheduling a July call between Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky.
Mr. Bolton specifically warned it could be "a disaster," according to another congressional witness. Mr. Volker and other aides had been pushing for it. After he connected Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Yermak, a top aide to Mr. Zelensky, Mr. Giuliani agreed to the call, Mr. Volker said. It took place three days later.
-- Sharon LaFraniere
White House lawyers called Sondland hours before whistle-blower report was made public.
Sondland transcript, Page 38: "I had a brief conversation with the White House Counsel's Office when the whistle-blower's report came out mentioning my name, and the White House Counsel's Office reached me, I was in New York at the United Nation Trans-Atlantic dinner. I stepped out of the meeting to take the call."
Mr. Sondland told House investigators that the White House Counsel's Office gave him a head's up a few hours before the public release of the whistle-blower's report about Mr. Trump's telephone call with the president of Ukraine. Michael Purpura, a White House lawyer, reached him by phone a few hours later, asking Mr. Sondland to come in for an interview since his name was mentioned in the document. Mr. Sondland told investigators that he did not agree to the interview with White House lawyers.
-- Michael D. Shear
A top national security adviser was 'shaking' in anger over what she saw as dysfunction at the White House.
Sondland transcript, Page 266: "And she [Fiona Hill] was pretty upset about her role in the administration, about her superiors, about the president. She was sort of shaking. She was pretty mad."
Sondland transcript, Page 267: "She's usually pretty calm, collected, straightforward, but she was pretty emotional."
Fiona Hill, a Russia scholar, was a top foreign policy adviser to Mr. Trump before she resigned on July 19 -- days before the telephone call between the president and Mr. Zelensky. Over a cup of coffee with Mr. Sondland a few days before she left, Ms. Hill specifically criticized Mr. Trump and Mr. Bolton.
Mr. Sondland recounted to House investigators that Ms. Hill said the National Security Council was not well run, and said she described disorder and communications problems in the Trump administration. He described a cordial working relationship with Ms. Hill and said their 15-to-20 minute meeting ended with a hug.
Ms. Hill has told investigators that she believed Mr. Sondland was too inexperienced for his post as ambassador to the European Union, and therefore was a counterintelligence risk.
-- Lara Jakes
Sondland claimed to be oblivious to Giuliani's real goals.
Sondland transcript, Page 70: "I became aware of his interest in Burisma sometime in the intervening period, but I never made the connection between Burisma and the Bidens until the very end. That is my testimony. I heard the word 'Burisma,' but I didn't understand that Biden and Burisma were connected."
In a tense exchange with House investigators during his interview, Mr. Sondland repeatedly insisted that he had no idea Mr. Giuliani's real interest in pressing Ukraine for an investigation of Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his family, including Burisma, the energy company that had put Hunter Biden on its board.
In the transcript of his interview, investigators appeared to grow increasingly incredulous as they presented Mr. Sondland with news media appearances and social media posts by Mr. Giuliani in which he described his intentions. At one point, the lawyer questioning Mr. Sondland asked, "You were completely oblivious to Rudy Giuliani's interest in Burisma because it involved the Bidens?""I never made the connection between Burisma and the Bidens until the very end," Mr. Sondland replied. "That is my testimony."

Why don’t Democrats drop impeachment and just censure Trump?

Texto completo: On Jan. 20, 2017, The Post reported that "The effort to impeach President Donald John Trump is already underway." Even before Trump took the oath of office that day, Democratic groups were looking for a pretext to remove him from office.
They thought they would get one from special counsel Robert S. Mueller III. Instead, Mueller found that Trump did not conspire with Russia to steal the 2016 election. But rather than capitalize on that moment of vindication, Trump decided to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory and give Democrats the pretext they had been looking for - by asking Ukraine to investigate Hunter Biden.
Democrats can't believe their luck. Unlike Russia, this time Trump actually did something wrong. The president's phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was not "perfect," as Trump repeatedly claims. A USA Today-Suffolk University poll finds that only 30 percent of Americans believe there was nothing wrong with the call. But the same poll finds that just 38 percent think it was an impeachable offense, while 21 percent say it was wrong but not impeachable.
That means most Americans agree with Democrats that Trump did something wrong, but only a minority believe his misconduct rises to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors. Worse still for Democrats, according to an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll, a 53-percent majority of Americans believe that the impeachment inquiry is politically motivated. And in six key swing states likely to decide the 2020 election, voters oppose removing Trump from office by a margin of 53 percent to 43 percent, according to a New York Times-Siena College survey.
So, unless some bombshell evidence emerges to turn public opinion decisively in favor of impeachment, Trump will not be removed from office. If Democrats persist and approve articles of impeachment, it will be a purely symbolic act - a way to publicly censure the president for his actions with regard to Ukraine.
So why not drop impeachment and censure him instead?
There is precedent for doing so. In 1834, the Senate voted to censure President Andrew Jackson (whose portrait Trump has proudly hung in the Oval Office) over his stonewalling of a congressional investigation into Jackson's decision to shut down the Second Bank of the United States. If Congress voted to censure Trump, it would make him only the second president in history to have been so explicitly reprimanded.
The House could easily pass such a censure resolution and might even do so with a bipartisan majority. Right now, House Republicans feel no pressure to vote for impeachment, and Senate Republicans feel no pressure to convict, because most Americans agree with them that Trump's conduct is not impeachable. They know that, if anything, impeachment poses a greater political danger to Democrats, putting at risk 31 House seats held by freshman Democrats in districts Trump carried in 2016.
But by censuring instead of impeaching the president, Democrats could easily turn the political calculus against the GOP. The Post reports that a growing number of Republicans are ready to acknowledge that the president used military aid as leverage to force Ukraine to investigate the Biden family but that "the president's action was not illegal and does not rise to the level of an impeachable offense." To oppose a censure resolution, Republicans would have to argue not just that the president's misconduct does not rise to the level of an impeachable offense but also that there was no misconduct at all. Clearly there was, and Americans know it. Censure would put public opinion squarely on the Democrats' side and put Republicans in a political bind.
A bipartisan censure vote would ultimately be more damaging to Trump than impeachment along party lines. The impeachment inquiry is energizing Trump voters, who believe Democrats are trying to invalidate their votes by removing Trump from office. Censure would take away that argument. It would be dispiriting to Trump's base, especially if some Republicans joined Democrats in voting to rebuke the president. Trump would be furious at a bipartisan vote of censure.
The Senate would not be required to take up a censure resolution passed by the House, but so what? Jackson's censure was passed by only one house of Congress. If the House censured the president and the Senate failed to even vote on the resolution, it would look very bad for Republicans.
Will Democrats do it? Probably not. Their ravenous base wants to brook no compromise. But because impeachment will be nothing more than an act of censure anyway, why not actually censure Trump and pressure some Republicans to vote against their president? Then leave the decision of whether to remove Trump from office where it belongs: in the hands of the American people next November.

How the commentariat could affect Trump’s impeachment

Texto completo: The members of the commentariat - reporters and editors, columnists, authors and broadcasters (whether online or on radio or television) - are either “influential” or “irrelevant,” and they are either “prolific” or “occasional.”
It’s a four-square box, and like all four-square boxes, imperfect but useful. The head of the German military general staff in the early 1930s classified officers as either diligent or lazy, and either clever or stupid. There was a place for the lazy and stupid officers - vast numbers of jobs needed a plodding even dense sort, not numbed by repetition. The diligent and clever officers became colonels, for they would get accomplished what the strategic thinkers - the clever and lazy generals - decreed. The energetic and stupid officers, though, needed to be cashiered for there was no limit to how much damage they could accomplish.
On impeachment eve, the commentariat has spent years sorting itself into fairly easily identifiable camps, camps that align along an axis from anti-President Donald Trump absolutism to a pro-Trump certainty. That axis has little to do with the four-square box. Indeed it is best to think of three different four-square boxes - one at each end of the spectrum and one in the middle.
In the box on the pro-Trump end of the axis, in the quadrant marked “influential and prolific,” for example, are Mollie Hemingway of the Federalist and Kimberley Strassel of the Wall Street Journal. At the other, anti-Trump end, again in the “influential and prolific” quadrant, are for example MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow and Nicholas Kristof of the New York Times.
There are many others in both boxes, of course. The middle-of-the-spectrum “influential and prolific” box includes a handful of journalists, including The Washington Post’s Dan Balz and the Times’s Peter Baker, who could conceivably move the story off the deadlock on which it rests now: a House certain to pass an article or two of impeachment and a Senate certain to reject them, perhaps peremptorily, given the vast deficiencies in the rules of the process adopted last week by the House. (Imagine a prosecutor being able to veto a defense counsel’s star witness!)
Say the House reforms its rules to match those of impeachments past and thus restores at least the patina of fairness to the proceedings. A handful of the commentariat could then be in a position to decide the matter.
Huh? Yes, it’s true. Simply put: Only surprise defections of prolific, influential members of the commentariat from the pro-Trump camp to the anti-Trump camp, or vice versa, would shatter the deadlock. Such influencers from the former camp would give cover to Republican senators. We are nowhere near the 20 GOP senators needed to remove the president, and until you show me at least six Republican senators willing to publicly state that it’s within the realm of possibility - that the process is fair enough and the evidence of a high crime and misdemeanor conclusive enough to vote to remove - we are closer to the Miami Dolphins going to the Super Bowl than we are to removing the president via conviction.
That could change if a Hemingway or a Strassel came upon evidence they thought sufficiently damning to overcome the obvious procedural assaults on the country’s shared understanding of fair play. Americans know that such processes need to be appropriate to the circumstances, whether that means a proceeding to penalize a high school student for drinking alcohol at the prom or to grant a variance at the homeowners association for a second-story addition. Right now, the pro-Trump people think the impeachment process lacks the fair-play element and that it is unlikely to be restored. They doubt as well that an offense deserving removal has occurred.
But if one, or two, or suddenly three or six of the presently pro-Trump influencers, including both the prolific or the occasional (think of Brit Hume and Fred Barnes as entrants in the occasional category), break and switch to the remove end of the axis, then the president will be in trouble. For it is the commentariat that listens closely to its audiences and reflects the consensus views, not automatically, but by this mysterious process known as reporting.
Similarly, if influencers from the anti-Trump camp go out from the citadels of the left and into handful of states that will decide the election of 2020 and return with the news that the impeachment proceeding led by Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., is widely understood to be a show trial and an assault on due process that is endangering the Democrats up and down the ballot in a year, then House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., will quickly descend from her throne to put the genie back in the bottle.
Rarely has the media possessed such power. But only if it acts in unpredictable ways. Otherwise, the deadlock persists until next November.

Texto completo: A Florida county commission unanimously denied a library's request for additional funding in order to pay for a subscription to the New York Times.
The Citrus County committee denied the request for $2,700 annually at a hearing last month. The hearing occurred the same day the Trump administration announced plans to end federal agencies' subscriptions to the Times and Washington Post.
One of the five commissioners who voted against providing the funding, Scott Carnahan, called the Times "fake news," and added that he agrees with President Trump and said, "I will not be voting for this. I don't want the New York Times in this county," according to the Post.
Ron Kitchen Jr., a different commissioner, asked, “Do we really need to subscribe to the New York Times?” Another commissioner, Jimmy Smith, wondered, "Why the heck would we spend money on something like that?"
The library was not pleased with the commissioner's decision.
“Someone’s personal political view does not have a place in deciding what library resources are available for the entire county,” Sandy Price, the chairwoman for the library’s advisory board, told the Citrus County Chronicle. “Libraries have to ensure all points of view are represented.”
One of the other commissioners later expressed regret, saying, "Our decision should have been impartial."

Texto completo: Three mothers and at least six children with Utah ties were killed Monday in Mexico, according to the victims’ families.
The victims are U.S. citizens who have lived in a fundamentalist Mormon community in the border region for decades. They were traveling in three separate vehicles when the gunmen attacked, several family members said. They described a terrifying scene in which one child was gunned down while running away, while others were trapped inside a burning car.
Two of the children killed were less than a year old, the family members said.
[UPDATED: Killing of 9 people with Utah ties become international issue between Mexico and U.S. with Trump and Romney weighing in.]
Three other children suffered bullet wounds but survived, said Lafe Langford Jr., a relative of some of the victims. He said doctors from across the Mexican state of Sonora were coming to help.
Video posted online by family early Tuesday showed what was described as a helicopter flying five children to Douglas, Ariz., for medical treatment.
?? The Helicopter with five children headed to US hospitals After being shot and their mother’s killed What an unbelievable day of shock and tears????
Posted by Willie Jessop on Monday, November 4, 2019
Kenny LeBarón, a cousin of the women driving the vehicles, said in a telephone interview that he feared the death toll could grow higher.
“When you know there are babies tied in a car seat that are burning because of some twisted evil that’s in this world,” LeBarón said, “it’s just hard to cope with that.”
The crimes set off a wave of social media posts from the victims’ families expressing sorrow at the deaths and pleas for the return of those who had earlier been kidnapped.
Maria Rhonita Miller and four of her children died on a road in northern Mexico, according to Langford and social media posts. Miller was traveling to Phoenix to pick up her husband, who works in North Dakota and was returning to celebrate the couple’s wedding anniversary, said her cousin, Kenny LeBarón.
Her car broke down, LeBarón said, and the gunmen “opened fire on Rhonita and torched her car.” She was killed, along with an 11-year-old boy, a 9-year-old girl and twins who were less than a year old, he said.
¡OJO! Atención a todo el mundo!!! Somos una comunidad de ciudadanos con doble nacionalidades, paisanos y estadounidenses, que viven y operan entre México y los Estados Unidos. Estamos bajo ataque mientras hablamos por los carteles en México ... Hemos estado solicitando a las embajadas estadounidenses en México todo el día sin resultado ... ¡Necesitamos que se compartan esto y que todo el mundo sea testigo de los atroces actos inhumanos y bárbaros que se cometieron contra nosotros hoy! Rhonita Miller y sus 4 hijos fueron asesinados a tiros en este vehículo y en este mismo momento hay DOS más Suburban con 2 de nuestras familias, con un total de 2 esposas y 10 niños desaparecidos y / o secuestrados por el cartel ... ¡Necesitamos ayuda de inmediato! .. ¡Ayudenos!
Posted by Lafe Langford Jr on Monday, November 4, 2019
About 8 miles ahead, the two other cars were also attacked, killing the two other women, LeBarón said. The bodies of Dawna Ray Langford, 43, and Christina Marie Langford, 31, were found later Monday, Lafe Langford Jr. said.
The bodies of two of Dawna Ray Langford’s children, Trevor, 11, and Rogan, 3, also were recovered Monday. An earlier report said Christina Marie Langford’s baby daughter, Faith Marie Johnson, had died, too, but that turned out to be incorrect.
Julian LeBarón said in a telephone interview from Bavispe, Mexico, with The New York Times that the women and their children had been traveling from the state of Sonora to the state of Chihuahua.
Social media posts from family of the victims said at least one of the children walked from the ambush site to the family home. Other children were found on the side of the road where the attackers abandoned them.
“Six little kids were killed and seven made it out alive,” LeBarón said.
The families are from La Mora, about 70 miles south of Douglas, Ariz. They are a mix of people who worship with the mainstream, Salt Lake City-based Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and polygamous offshoots. Lafe Langford Jr. said the killings happened near the town of Bavispe in the state of Sonora. The gunmen, Langford said, are believed to be members of a cartel from Chihuahua who encroached on another cartel’s territory.
LeBarón said the family had not received any threats, other than general warnings not to travel to Chihuahua, where they typically went to buy groceries and fuel.
Family members took to social media to implore the governments of Mexico and the United States to do something about the intensifying violence in Mexico, particularly in the areas along the country’s northern border, where Mormons and Mennonites have lived for decades despite the threat from rampant organized crime.
Many took particular aim at President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, whose government has struggled to articulate a coherent security strategy even as homicides mount and organized crime groups have carried out increasingly brazen attacks against citizens and the state.
On Tuesday morning, U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted: “A wonderful family and friends from Utah got caught between two vicious drug cartels, who were shooting at each other, with the result being many great American people killed, including young children, and some missing. If Mexico needs or requests help in cleaning out these monsters, the United States stands ready, willing & able to get involved and do the job quickly and effectively. The great new President of Mexico has made this a big issue, but the cartels have become so large and powerful that you sometimes need an army to defeat an army!”
Trump offered Mexico help against the violence on Tuesday.

Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, offered condolences on behalf of himself and his wife.
“Ann and I are heartbroken for the victims of the horrific attacks in Mexico," Romney wrote. "Our prayers are with their families who have suffered such an unspeakable tragedy. The U.S. must work with Mexican officials to hold accountable those responsible for this senseless violence.”
A video posted by Miller’s father-in-law and posted to Facebook showed the remains of the family’s Chevy Suburban. It had been burned and was still smoldering. Bullet holes are visible in the paneling.
The accompanying text says the Millers were ambushed. Langford, in a phone interview, said it appears the gunman mistook the Miller and Langford convoy of three SUVs for their intended targets.
Langford said one of the kidnapped victims’ relatives received a phone call from the missing women. She heard a woman screaming and men talking loudly, said Langford, who has been speaking with the families in Mexico.

Mexico’s federal Department of Security and Citizens’ Protection said security forces were reinforced with National Guard, army and state police troops in the area after “the reports about disappearance and aggression against several people.” They also were helping to search for missing family members believed to have fled when they came under attack.
The victims are part of a community in Mexico where the residents often have both U.S. and Mexican citizenship and have intermarried among Mormon churches.
It was the first time that members of the breakaway church had been attacked in northern Mexico, where their forebears settled — often in Chihuahua state — decades ago.
In 2009, Benjamin LeBaron, an anti-crime activist who was related to those killed in Monday’s attack, was murdered in 2009 in neighboring Chihuahua state.

Charles M. Blow: My wish for Michelle Obama

Texto completo: Michelle Obama is an extraordinary woman by any measure.
She is an attorney with degrees from Princeton and Harvard universities. She is the former first lady of the United States, and the first African American one. She just came off a gangbusters book tour for her memoir, “Becoming,” which was Amazon’s longest No. 1 title since “Fifty Shades of Grey.” And, according to polls, she is the most admired woman in the world.
She has conducted her life with the utmost honor, dignity and grace. Every day I miss her and her husband’s presence in the White House. Their contrast with the Trumps is so stark that it’s painful. America downgraded erudition to indecency.
Obama owes no one anything. She has nothing to prove. It is already proven.
This is why I was saddened to hear her say at the Obama Foundation Summit in Chicago that she “can’t make people not afraid of black people.” She continued: “I can’t explain what’s happening in your head, but maybe if I show up every day as a human, a good human … maybe, just maybe, that work will pick away at the scabs of your discrimination.”
Why should this brilliant black woman spend even a second of her time considering the mindset of a racist? She shouldn’t. No black person should. No person who suffers the sting of racism should.
Obama’s intentions are honorable, but the approach is problematic. Anti-black racism and white supremacy are not predicated on black people’s behavior. From the time Europeans started stealing people from Africa, they used pseudoscience and supposedly observed behavioral traits to justice their brutality, subjugation and exploitation.
Black people, in their eyes, were conversely brutish and savage or shiftless and lazy. They were less intellectually and culturally advanced. They lack the morality and character to exist on the same plain as white people. White people weren’t putting black people in an inferior position, God and nature had done that.
This behavioral rationale was used to justify and maintain slavery; to argue and fight against reconstruction; to justify black codes and Jim Crow; to sanction racially disparate drug policies and penalties, including mass incarceration; and now to excuse the killings of black people by the police.
Abraham Lincoln, during the Lincoln-Douglas debates in 1858, took it even further, saying. “There is a physical difference between the white and black races which I believe will forever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality.”
Black people were so submerged in this behavioral orthodoxy, that they absorbed it. They, too, started to believe that if they altered their behavior, if they better assimilated, if they rose to white people’s ideals, they would mitigate white racism.
Booker T. Washington, quite famously, subscribed to this thinking. Washington was a brilliant man who dedicated his life for the betterment and uplifting of black people. But, he made the miscalculation of thinking that he could so demonstrate his worthiness to white people that they would self-correct their racism and reward black people with social equality and justice.
It doesn’t work that way. Racism is a pathology bound up by power.
To the white racist, racism is heritage. In their worldview, white men created the modern world and advanced culture. To them, whiteness is beauty and power, it is the pinnacle of human evolution.
As such, there is nothing that a black person could do to graduate out of subordination and into equality. Our blackness itself is the mark, and it cannot be erased.
People worried during the Great Migration that blacks behaving badly would convert Northern whites into racists like their Southern brethren. In 1916, Kelly Miller, the dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at Howard University, wrote a letter to the editors of The New York Times worrying that the migrating black would “naturally enough, at first, mistake liberty for license unless he is carefully safeguarded and encouraged in the right direction.”
He continued:
“Should the influx of Negro laborers to the North, without proper restriction and control, be allowed to prejudice public opinion and thus reproduce Southern proscription in the Northern states, the last state of the race would be worse than the first.”
But, there were already white racists in the North. Their racism had nothing to do with black people’s behavior.
Asserting that there is a behavioral cure for racism simply supports the inverse argument: that there was a behavioral cause for it. Blaming white racism on black people’s behavior is an intellectual violence. It’s a crime.
No one should endeavor to live their life as an exemplar for the white gaze. For the oppressed to feel any obligation to fix the flaw in the oppressor is simply another form of oppression.
Centering on the white racism perception of you is futile, distracting and corrosive.
My wish for Michelle Obama is simple: that she never again allow herself to entertain the thought of how she is being perceived by racists and whether or not that is changing any of their minds.
Why should cave men be allowed to occupy space in the mind of a super woman?

Tim Wu: Facebook isn’t just allowing lies, it’s prioritizing them

Texto completo: “First, do no harm,” a doctrine typically associated with the practice of medicine, is the right ethic when it comes to decisions surrounding Silicon Valley’s paid promotion technologies and their effects on elections and democracy. A desire to avoid harm — in particular, the spread of misinformation — is part of what persuaded Twitter’s chief executive, Jack Dorsey, to announce that his company will no longer run political ads. And Twitter is not alone: LinkedIn, Pinterest, Microsoft and Twitch also refuse political ads, while Google accepts them in some states but not others.
Facebook is now the outlier, and it is increasingly hard to understand why it is insisting on accepting not only political advertising, but even deliberate and malicious lies if they are in the form of paid advertisements. Given how much can go wrong — and has gone wrong — the question everyone is asking is: Why does Facebook think it needs to be in this game? Naïveté is at this point the most flattering explanation.
It isn’t, as some think, just about making money, for as a revenue source, the money at stake is minor. But the money does matter, in a different way. Paying for promotion is how, on social media, some speakers gain priority over others. This creates an advantage unrelated to actual popularity. Paired with the freedom to lie, the effect is to give political lies and paid misinformation campaigns a twisted advantage over other forms of election speech (like “the news.”) Even as Facebook’s “integrity” teams try to stamp out other forms of deception, paid promotions gain access to the full power of Facebook’s tools of microtargeting, its machine learning and its unrivaled collection of private information, all to maximize the influence of blatant falsehoods. What could possibly go wrong?
If the idea of prioritizing lies over truth doesn’t sound very appealing, Facebook’s defenses of its policy are almost their own misinformation campaign. Nick Clegg, Facebook’s vice president for global affairs and communications, has suggested that Facebook sees itself as providing the “tennis court” where politicians play the game of politics. But tennis actually has strict rules; Facebook has embraced, instead, the norms of a fighting cage. More important, Clegg is hiding the more fundamental question: Who ever said Facebook needed be the tennis court in the first place?
Facebook, which for years has declared it is not a media company, is now asserting that it is a medium necessary to a fair electoral process. That’s the implication of the tennis analogy, and also of Zuckerberg’s favorite defense of his policy, that Facebook must run political advertisements, even blatant lies, to help political challengers take on incumbents.
Having personally run against a slate including an incumbent, I am sympathetic to measures that might level the playing field. But not only is there no evidence to back Facebook’s assertions, there are many other, more obvious and less dangerous ways to fight the advantages of incumbency, like the public matching of campaign donations. It is ludicrous to suggest that allowing paid political lies online is what’s really necessary to help out the little guys.
So strange is the policy, so confusing even to Facebook’s own employees, perhaps it really is nothing more than an effort to placate Facebook’s conservative critics — giving Zuckerberg space to loudly declare that he maintains a fair and balanced policy when it comes to political speech. Leave aside that this is unlikely to mollify mainstream conservatives, whose real concern is that Facebook’s filtering of hate speech will enshrine “political correctness.” It is the effort to mollify itself that should raise red flags.
What we are learning is that Facebook can, by tinkering with its rules for political ads, give itself a special, unregulated power over elections. Just that possibility gives Facebook political leverage and politicians reasons to want leverage over Facebook. And we are speaking not of the local television station, which is bad enough, but the nation’s dominant social network, creating the kind of monopoly influence over politics that the framers of the Sherman antitrust law were concerned about. By refusing to stay out, Facebook is in effect building the case for its own breakup.
It is a dangerous game, with enormous potential for corruption, which is why Dorsey and most of the rest of Silicon Valley are right to steer as far clear as they can. It may well be that Silicon Valley one day studies its role in elections and comes up with some kind of salutary town hall of the future. But false neutrality is worse than nothing. Lacking any certainty that they can do more good than harm, both Facebook and Google need to get out.

Texto completo: Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden will return to Pittsburgh on Tuesday evening for a "finance event," according to his campaign.
The fundraiser is not open to the public and Biden, the former vice president, is not scheduled to speak publicly. Additional details about the fundraiser were not available.
Biden kicked off his presidential campaign in Pittsburgh on April 29, at the Teamsters Union Local 249 hall in Lawrenceville. He said he chose the city because it represents working-class Americans, and "if I'm going to be able to beat Donald Trump in 2020, it's going to happen here."
High campaign costs and dwindling cash reserves have troubled the campaign in recent weeks. His private fundraiser on Tuesday is pitched to high-level political donors.
Biden, a native of Scranton, visited Pittsburgh frequently over his political career. He marched regularly in the Labor Day and St. Patrick's Day parades and has campaigned for other Democrats, including U.S. Rep. Conor Lamb, in 2018.
A New York Times/Siena College Poll released Tuesday puts Biden ahead of President Donald Trump by 3 points among registered voters in Pennsylvania.
In battleground states like Pennsylvania, Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina and Wisconsin, undecided voters swung in favor of Biden over Sen. Bernie Sanders, of Vermont, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, of Massachusetts, the poll showed.
Biden remains the top choice among registered Democrats in Pennsylvania, with 30% of surveyed voters saying they would vote for Biden, according to a Franklin & Marshall College poll released in October.
That's compared to 28% of surveyed voters who said they'd vote for Biden in July.
Since then, both Warren and Sanders have also maintained their ranks as second and third most popular, respectively, among Pennsylvania Democrats, the poll shows.
Sanders and Warren are catching up to Biden in polls in some early primary states.
Sanders visited visited Pittsburgh in August to pick up an endorsement from the Pittsburgh-based United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America union. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, of Minnesota, campaigned in the Pittsburgh area Sept. 18, visiting a training facility for trade workers in Robinson and holding a meet-and-greet near the University of Pittsburgh campus in Oakland.
Former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, of New York, both visited Pittsburgh this year. O'Rourke dropped out of the race last week; Gillibrand withdrew in August.

Texas poll shows Trump ahead of every Democrat

Texto completo: President Donald Trump holds a lead over every Democratic candidate if the election were held in Texas today, according to a new University of Texas/Texas Tribune poll.
The internet survey of 1,200 registered Texas voters, which was conducted Oct. 18-27, seems to indicate that the eventual Democratic nominee will have a lot of work to do in the Lone Star State.
Former Vice President Joe Biden and U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts are both 7 percentage points behind Trump. U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont trails Trump by 5 percentage points. Former U.S. Rep. Beto O’Rourke of El Paso, who dropped out of the race on Friday, lags behind the president by 6 percentage points.
Julián Castro, former U.S. housing secretary and mayor of San Antonio, would lose to Trump by 13 percentage points.
The margin of error is plus or minus 2.83 percentage points.
The numbers are a shift from previous surveys that found much tighter contests.
A Quinnipiac University poll of Texas voters in June found Biden with a slight lead over Trump among Texans, 48% to 44%. It showed Trump enjoying narrow margins over other candidates.
And polling in April from Emerson College found that Biden, Warren, Sanders and O’Rourke were in a statistical dead heat with Trump.
But James Henson, director of the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas, said voters often are wedded to one candidate at this stage of an election cycle,which affects responses to hypothetical matchups involving multiple Democratic candidates. Support for a candidate historically coalesces once that candidate seems assured of winning the nomination.
“This is a year out, and the situation a year out is not going to be much of a predictor of what this campaign is going to look like when you get to a general election,” Henson said.
Biden leads Democrats
Despite Trump’s lead over each candidate, a slight majority of Texas voters say they would vote for someone else rather than reelect Trump. Forty-eight percent of Texas voters said they are likely to vote for Trump, while 52% said they are unlikely to reelect him.
If the Texas Democratic primary were held today, Biden would win the most delegates, with 23% support, compared to Warren’s 18%, O’Rourke’s 14% and Sanders’ 12%.
Democrats are targeting 22 GOP-held state House districts and six GOP-controlled U.S. House districts in Texas and say that this year could be their chance to turn the state blue. Trump’s margin of victory in Texas against Democrat Hillary Clinton was 9 percentage points, making it the closest presidential contest in the state since 1996.
The UT/Texas Tribune poll found that Texans are split when it comes to U.S. House races, where 43% of voters say they’ll vote Republican and 43% say they’ll vote Democratic.
In an email Monday, Texas Democrats pointed to earlier polling that shows good news for Democrats.
“Poll after poll shows the same result: This election is razor-thin,” Manny Garcia, Texas Democratic Party executive director, said in a statement. “Republicans are scared. We can’t let up. Texas Democrats must keep organizing.”
Senate race
Meanwhile, name recognition is still an issue in the race for U.S. Senate, according to the UT/Texas Tribune poll. It surveyed voters’ knowledge of Democratic candidates running to unseat U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas.
MJ Hegar, a former combat helicopter pilot, leads the pack if the election were held today, but with just 12% support.
Just 24% of voters said they’ve heard of Chris Bell, a former congressman who ran for governor in 2006. Slightly more than 1 in 5 voters said they’d heard of state Sen. Royce West of Dallas. Hegar, who last year came within 3 points of defeating U.S. Rep. John Carter, R-Round Rock, is known to 20% of voters. Other candidates in the Democratic Senate race are lesser known.
The results could leave room for a better-known candidate to enter the race. The filing deadline is Dec. 9.
Castro, who is mired in the low-single digits nationally and in early nominating states, has said he wouldn’t join the Senate race even if he dropped out of the presidential race.
Cornyn’s campaign warned supporters that O’Rourke, who lost to U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, by 2.6 percentage points last year, is prepping for a run against Cornyn.
Throughout his presidential campaign, however, O’Rourke has said he would not run for Senate. O’Rourke spokesman Rob Friedlander reiterated that stance on Friday.
“Beto will not be a candidate for U.S. Senate in Texas in 2020,” Friedlander told The New York Times.

Texto completo: LONDON - Labour Party lawmaker Lindsay Hoyle was elected speaker of Britain's House of Commons on Monday, taking up the job with a clear message: I'm not John Bercow.
Hoyle was chosen by lawmakers from among seven candidates to replace the influential but contentious Bercow. Bercow retired last week after a decade as speaker that saw him become a central player in Britain's Brexit drama.
Hoyle took 325 of the 540 votes in a runoff with Labour colleague Chris Bryant after the seven-member field was winnowed down in three previous voting rounds.
Hoyle, 62, was elected to Parliament in 1997, has served as one of the three deputy speakers since 2010 and is popular. Like Bercow, he will run the daily business of the Commons.
The speaker is supposed to be an impartial arbiter of Parliament's rules, but critics accused Bercow of favoring anti-Brexit politicians at the expense of those supporting Britain's departure from the European Union.
Bercow denied Brexit bias, but clashed with the government and strongly opposed Prime Minister Boris Johnson's attempt to suspend Parliament for five weeks as an Oct. 31 Brexit deadline approached. The U.K. Supreme Court overturned Johnson's shutdown.
Bercow also interpreted Parliament's rules in ways that let lawmakers direct the government's hand at key moments. One such move forced Johnson to ask the EU to delay Brexit until Jan. 31, the current deadline. Hoyle is set to oversee months more of high-stakes debate and votes over Brexit.
Border Patrol agent shoots, kills gunman who opened fire
SUNLAND PARK, N.M. - A U.S. Border Patrol agent shot and killed a gunman who opened fire about a mile from the border with Mexico, immigration officials said.
The agent approached a group of four people early Monday, and one of them pulled out a gun and started shooting, according to a statement from U.S. Customs and Border Protection.
The agent fired back, hitting the man, who died at a hospital. No agents were hurt during the shooting in Sunland Park, a suburb of El Paso, Texas.
No additional information was released, including the names of the agent and gunman. The CBP's Office of Professional Responsibility is investigating the shooting.
New Mexico State police and FBI also are investigating, Albuquerque FBI spokesman Frank Fisher said.
DOJ sends letter to publisher of book by anonymous writer
NEW YORK - The Justice Department has sent a letter to the publisher and literary agency of the anonymous government official whose book is scheduled to come out Nov. 19. The letter raises questions over whether any confidentiality agreement has been violated and asked for information that could help reveal the author's identity.
The publisher, Hachette Book Group, responded by saying it would provide no additional information beyond calling the author a "current or former senior official."
The book, "A Warning," is by the official who wrote an essay published last year in The New York Times, alleging that numerous people in the government were resisting the "misguided impulses" of President Donald Trump.
Advice columnist sues Trump
for calling sex assault claim a lie
NEW YORK - An advice columnist for Elle magazine who has accused President Donald Trump of raping her in a New York City department store dressing room in the 1990s sued him Monday, saying he defamed her by calling her a liar whom he had never even met.
E. Jean Carroll's lawsuit, filed Monday in New York, says Trump "smeared her integrity, honesty and dignity - all in the national press" when he responded to her allegations, first broached in a New York magazine article this past June.
A message requesting comment was sent to a law firm that has represented Trump in other cases.
Carroll is among over a dozen women who have accused Trump of sexual misconduct or sexual assault, or both, predating his presidency.
Texan in school shooting said to be unfit for trial
HOUSTON - The trial for a teenager accused of fatally shooting 10 people at a Texas high school will be delayed while he receives mental health treatment, his attorney said Monday.
The news comes after three experts - one for the defense, one appointed by the court and one picked by prosecutors - found Dimitrios Pagourtzis incompetent to stand trial, said Nick Poehl, one of Pagourtzis' attorneys.
Kevin Petroff, the first assistant district attorney for Galveston County, said his office was working to meet with all families of the victims before making any statement.
Pagourtzis, 19, is charged with capital murder in the May 18, 2018, attack at Santa Fe High School, which is 50 miles southeast of Houston. His trial was set to start Feb. 18. Because he was 17 at the time of the attack, he is not eligible for the death penalty.
'King Perry' pleads guilty
in $115 million Ponzi scheme
SCRANTON, Pa. - The fraudster called himself "King Perry," and for a while he lived like royalty.
Perry Santillo masterminded an investment scam that collected more than $115 million from 1,000 investors around the country, using some of the proceeds to fund a lavish lifestyle of cars, casino junkets and houses in multiple states, according to federal securities regulators.
The Ponzi scheme collapsed, and Santillo, of Rochester, New York, is likely to trade his fancy duds for prison attire when he is sentenced on criminal conspiracy and fraud charges.
He appeared Monday in federal court to plead guilty to a federal fraud charge, having already entered a guilty plea last month to similar charges in Rochester. Each charge carries a maximum 20-year prison sentence.
In Oklahoma: More than 450 inmates walked out the doors of prisons across Oklahoma on Monday as part of what state officials say is the largest single-day mass commutation in U.S. history.
The release of inmates, all with convictions for low-level drug and property crimes, resulted from a bill signed by new Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt. The bill retroactively applied misdemeanor sentences for simple drug possession and low-level property crimes that state voters approved in 2016.
Stitt has made reducing Oklahoma's highest-in-the-nation incarceration rate one of his top priorities. Releasing the inmates will save Oklahoma an estimated $11.9 million, according to the governor's office.
Caption: PHOTO: Thousands of Spaniards protest Monday in Madrid after five men accused of raping an unconscious 14-year-old girl in 2016 were sentenced to 10 to 12 years behind bars last week for sexual abuse instead of assault or rape. Protests were held in over 40 cities.

Texto completo: Pittsburgh City Council on Monday gave final approval to a settlement with an Ohio man who sued in federal court over his treatment at the hands of police in 2017 outside PPG Paints Arena.
Pending the anticipated signature of Mayor Bill Peduto, the city will pay $47,000 to David T. Adelman, of Ravenna, Ohio - who said he suffered a broken nose, dislocated shoulder, bruises and concussion-like symptoms after an encounter with police - and his attorney, Steve Barth.
Officers punched Mr. Adelman, then 47, in the face several times and subdued him using a Taser, according to video of the September 2017 arrest captured by a bystander.
The five city officers involved in the arrest were identified in court records as Brian Markus, Andrew Jacobs, Todd Modena, Francis Rende and Robert Palivoda.
Police claimed that Mr. Adelman approached them and took "a fighting stance" as officers were in the process of arresting another man who was wanted on forgery charges and previously fleeing police, according to court records.
The vote was 8-0 with Councilwoman Erika Strassburger absent.
Council also on Monday voted to spend $10.9 million on new Tasers and body cameras for police officers.
Scottsdale, Ariz.-based Axon Enterprises will provide enough Tasers to equip 950 police - up from roughly 450 today - with the electric shock devices often used to subdue suspects. The deal also includes batteries and unlimited cartridges for the Tasers.
The Bureau of Police will also get 950 body cameras and a data plan allowing for unlimited data storage for the resulting footage. The package includes technology that activates the cameras when the Taser is drawn.
Councilwoman Theresa Kail-Smith acknowledged public concern over the cost but said the city will get upgraded equipment and service.
Meanwhile, the city's thousands of abandoned properties will soon be job one for a new Clean Sweep Division of the Department of Public Works, following a final vote of council Monday.
The ordinance, passed by an 8-0 vote, charges the new division with gathering a list of city-owned properties, mowing and cleaning them, reporting monthly on progress, finding long-term solutions to the challenge of maintaining lots, and filing liens against owners of overgrown parcels where possible.
"We can have our own public works employees do the work as they used to do in the past," Ms. Kail-Smith said. "The administration is drafting up a plan to make sure that we have a Clean Sweep Division," she said, adding that it is a step toward "a comprehensive plan on addressing vacant lots" in the city.
In the meantime, council also voted to pay contractor City Source Associates, the city's longtime lot cleaning contractor, $250,000 for lot maintenance work.
A recent audit by the office of city Controller Michael Lamb found that the city has about 2,000 parcels offered for sale on its website and is holding back nearly 3,000 other parcels for eventual transfer to the Urban Redevelopment Authority. Concerns about both the sale process and the city's property upkeep were detailed in an Aug. 18 Pittsburgh Post-Gazette story, "Few Winners in Pittsburgh's Property Lottery."

Texto completo: Smoke machines! Spotlights! Thundersticks! And a very different presidential race.
Hi. Welcome to On Politics , your guide to the day in national politics. I'm Lisa Lerer, your host, bringing you a dispatch from my weekend reporting trip to Iowa .
Democrats put on quite a show Friday night in Des Moines at their Liberty & Justice Celebration, a 13-candidate event considered the start of the final, three-month sprint to the Iowa caucuses.
There were smoke machines! Spotlights! A runway! And, of course, thundersticks!
Was this W.W.E.? No, it was the Iowa Democratic Party's annual dinner.
Somehow, amid the shouts of the booming announcer and the migraine-inducing glare of thousands of glow sticks, it became clear to me that the race has entered a new phase.
There has been no defining moment. No devastating gaffe. But over the past few weeks, the race in Iowa has begun to take a very different form than it had when the candidates sweated through the state fair just three months ago.
For months, this was a contest between two of the biggest boldface names in Democratic politics -- former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Now, the number of leading contenders has essentially doubled, creating a four-way race with Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders, yes, but also with Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. A New York Times/Siena College poll of likely caucusgoers taken last week showed those four candidates knotted at the top of the field.
As I wrote with my colleague Reid Epstein over the weekend, the energy seems to be with the two fresher faces, who used the dinner as a display of organizational force.
Mr. Buttigieg, helped by a cheering section of around 1,000 superfans who flew in from across the country to attend the dinner, cast himself as the heir to President Barack Obama's political legacy in his remarks -- a direct shot at one of Mr. Biden's central arguments.
Ms. Warren used her speech to debut a new line of attack against Mr. Biden, Mr. Buttigieg and her other centrist rivals. "Anyone who comes on this stage and tells you to dream small and give up early is not going to lead our party to victory," she said.
The attack underscored how questions about her "Medicare for all" plan have become central to this race. The Friday release of Ms. Warren's long-awaited, $ 20.5 trillion proposal explaining how she would fund the program prompted a new series of attacks over the weekend about the plan's specifics and whether she is being honest about the price tag.
Her campaign plans to release a proposal detailing how she would manage the transition from private health insurance plans to universal government-run health coverage. But the questions are likely to trail her for the foreseeable future.
Also worth noting from this weekend: The supersized field has finally begun shrinking to merely pleasantly plump. Former Representative Beto O'Rourke of Texas dropped out on Friday night, and rumors abound of other exits that could be coming soon.
Of course, not everything has changed. As has been the case since the start of this crowded contest, most of the field has found it all but impossible to break out of the single digits in polling.
At the dinner, Senators Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota delivered strong performances -- to a half-empty room. (Both had the unlucky draw of speaking toward the end of the five-hour program.)
And they had it far better than some of the candidates who followed. Former Representative John Delaney of Maryland was introduced with photos of Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana on the screens. And Mr. Bullock delivered the final address of the event -- after being announced as Mr. Booker.

Warren rattles Wall Street
Want more about Ms. Warren? Check out this story I wrote for the paper today with the ace business reporter Kate Kelly.
We dive into the fury that her rise in the polls has ignited on Wall Street, where money mangers, investors and bankers are contemplating voting for President Trump, threatening to leave the country and loudly predicting a double-digit dive in the market if Ms. Warren is elected.
Ms. Warren and her campaign see their rage as more beneficial than any monetary contribution. The joke making the rounds among Democrats on Wall Street is that every time a banker complains, Ms. Warren gets another thousand votes in Iowa.
Drop us a line!

Tomorrow is Election Day. Here's a key state to watch.
As several states go to the polls, we'll have live results on NYTimes.com and in the NYTimes app on Tuesday night. Here's a cheat sheet from our colleague Trip Gabriel :
Three states have particularly consequential elections on Tuesday. Kentucky and Mississippi are choosing governors in unexpectedly competitive races. But perhaps the biggest attraction is in Virginia, where control of the state legislature is up for grabs. Two years ago, the majority in the state's House of Delegates turned on a random drawing to settle a tied race.
If Democrats reverse the slim majorities that Republicans hold in both chambers -- as polling and a court-ordered new map of key districts suggest is likely -- it will cap off a decade-long evolution of a Southern state, the former seat of the Confederacy, into a progressive bastion.
With a sitting Democratic governor, Ralph Northam, new Democratic majorities in the legislature would be expected to advance liberal priorities on gun restrictions, the minimum wage, health care and civil rights protections for women and L.G.B.T. people. Perhaps most important to Democrats, unified control of state government would put the party in charge of mapping new voting districts in 2021.
Virginia, which holds elections every year, has been at the forefront of a national revolt against President Trump among suburban voters since 2017.
Tuesday night's returns are certain to be interpreted as a report card on Mr. Trump ahead of 2020. But Virginia is not an ideal presidential bellwether. Republicans have not won a statewide election there since 2009.
These elections, like local elections everywhere now, are a kind of referendum on the president; but the simple toting up of W's and L's will not be especially meaningful. More telling will be the intensity of both parties' voters. Look for the margins of victory or loss, and the overall turnout, which nonpartisan analysts think will be in the mid-40s.
... Seriously

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Lev Parnas, an associate of President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani, has reversed field and will cooperate with a subpoena issued in the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, according to multiple news reports on Monday.
Joseph Bondy, one of Parnas’ new attorneys, reportedly sent lawmakers a letter last week informing them Parnas is now prepared to answer questions and produce documentation for the inquiry.
Parnas, who was born in Ukraine, and Igor Fruman, a fellow Giuliani associate, helped the former New York City mayor and ex-federal prosecutor seek damaging information in Ukraine about the family of former Vice President Joe Biden, who's vying to challenge Trump in the 2020 presidential race.
That has made the men potential key figures in the impeachment proceeding against Trump. The President is at the heart of a probe focused on an alleged effort to freeze U. S. military funding to Ukraine unless the country's new president pressed investigations of Ukrainian business dealings by Biden's son, Hunter, and also sought evidence that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered with the 2016 U. S. presidential election.
Pathway of the impeachment process: How it works, where we are
“We are willing to comply with the subpoena to the extent that it does not violate any appropriate privilege that Mr. Parnas may properly invoke,” said Bondy, who now represents Parnas along with Edward MacMahon, The New York Times reported.
Parnas, a U. S. citizen born in Ukraine, and Belarus-born Fruman were indicted last month on charges of funneling foreign money to U. S. political candidates and campaign committees. They and two other co-defendants have pleaded not guilty.
Parnas and Fruman were arrested Oct. 9 at Dulles International Airport with one-way tickets to Vienna, Austria. Both were subpoenaed the next day by impeachment investigators.
Parnas’ previous lawyer, John Dowd, a former attorney for Trump, called the congressional requests overly broad , and said Parnas would not cooperate with the investigators.
Parnas changed his mind, the Times report said, when Trump claimed he didn’t know the Giuliani associates after the two were indicted.
'You have to ask Rudy': Criminal case against Giuliani's associates darkens cloud over Trump's personal attorney, White House
“I don’t know them. I don’t know about them, I don’t know what they do," said Trump. "But, I don’t know, maybe they were clients of Rudy. You’d have to ask Rudy. I just don’t know. ”
Despite that denial, multiple photos have surfaced of the associates with Trump and other members of the administration, including Vice President Mike Pence. One photo of Trump and Parnas was taken in 2014, two years before Trump won the White House.
Parnas had previously posted a picture of himself with Trump at the White House on May 1, describing an “incredible dinner and even better conversation. ”
When pressed about the photos, Trump said, "I don’t know if there’s anybody I don’t have pictures with. "
Additionally, both Parnas and Fruman have dined with Trump at the White House and donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to U. S. election campaigns, including a $325,000 donation to a super political action committee formed to back Trump.
Parnas also told The Washington Post that he began his business career in real estate by selling Trump condos in Brooklyn for Fred Trump, the president's father.
It was not immediately clear what documents, testimony or evidence Parnas would provide to impeachment investigators. His attorneys did not respond to multiple USA TODAY messages seeking comment.
.
Reuters first reported Parnas' willingness to comply with the impeachment investigation.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein renews call for racing to be suspended at Santa Anita Park after latest horse death

Texto completo: U. S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif. ), citing the death of a horse that was euthanized Saturday after racing in the Breeders’ Cup, renewed her call for horse racing to be suspended at Santa Anita Park.
“With continued racetrack deaths, it’s clear that not enough has changed, so I renew that call,’’ Feinstein said in a statement Monday.
Since December, 37 horses have died at Santa Anita either while racing or while training at the racetrack.
“That’s simply unacceptable,’’ Feinstein said.
On Saturday, Mongolian Groom suffered a broken leg during the homestretch of the $6 million Breeders’ Cup Classic and a team of veterinarians determined the horse could not be saved.
INVESTIGATION: Horse racing deaths mount as states spend billions to keep tracks alive
OPINION: Mongolian Groom's death will haunt horse racing
'SAD SITUATION': Mongolian Groom trainer 'very sorry' after horse's death
Feinstein said she will work with California Gov. Gavin Newsom “to look at all options to protect racehorses and increase transparency at racetracks. If the horse racing industry is unwilling to treat these magnificent creatures humanely, it has no business operating in the United States. ”
On Monday, Newsom called on the California Racing Board (CHRB) to take additional action after adding safety measures earlier in the year
"Gov. Newsom believes clearly more must be done if horse racing is to remain viable in California," spokesperson Jesse Melgar said in a statement. "Despite implementing new safety review standards – which are now proving to be a new national model – too many horses are getting injured or dying.
The Governor has requested recommendations from CHRB within 30 days for further potential regulatory or statutory changes to improve animal welfare. "
Santa Anita’s fall meet ended Sunday and the winter meet will begin Dec. 26.
Before the two-day Breeders’ Cup, Feinstein wrote that the event would be a “critical test’’ for the future of horse racing.
“Despite increased scrutiny and additional measures that have been put in place, the horse racing industry was unable to make it through a single weekend without a critical injury and euthanized horse,’’ she said. “This problem is not unique to Santa Anita. More than 3,000 horses have died at California racetracks in the past two decades, and thousands more at racetracks throughout the country.
“Unfortunately, most states lack sufficient reporting requirements, so we may never know the exact numbers of horses that die nationwide as part of the horse racing industry. This is a gap that should be closed. ’’

ELECTION 2020; Facing a big test in Iowa, Kamala Harris goes small

Texto completo: In better times, Kamala Harris' presidential campaign was full of flash: a launch rally that drew more than 20,000 people to Oakland, a five-day summer tour of Iowa on a luxury bus with her name blazing from the side in colorful capital letters, a robust multi-state operation headquartered in Baltimore.
Now, the bus has been swapped for a nondescript black SUV. The campaign stops are more intimate than immense -- a few dozen people in a pastoral red barn, several hundred in a pub. And her efforts have narrowed to a single make-or-break prize: Iowa.
To revive her flagging campaign, Harris is betting big on going small. It is a marked tonal shift and a strategy born of necessity, reflecting her dwindling cash and limp poll numbers.

The California senator proved she can still deliver a high-wattage performance, earning glowing reviews for an energetic speech Friday night at a major gathering of Iowa Democrats. But her October blitz in Iowa largely focused on humbler settings -- making dinner in supporters' homes and dropping in on small businesses, in hopes that one-on-one encounters can help close the deal with caucus-goers who will make or break her presidential aspirations.
"The obvious risk is you're not speaking to large crowds," said Dan Callahan, a 57-year old contractor from Independence who attended the Harris town hall in a Winthrop barn. But he pronounced the personal approach a "good thing."
"It's what Iowa expects," he said. "It's what we're used to."
Iowa's Feb. 3 caucus wasn't always so central to Harris' plan. Her strategists' hopes had initially hinged on Western and Southern states. They presumed she would have a geographic advantage in Nevada's Feb. 22 caucus and a demographic edge Feb. 29 in South Carolina, where black voters dominate the Democratic primary electorate. From there, they predicted a Super Tuesday jackpot March 3, seeing friendly territory in her home state of California and large African American populations in places such as Alabama.
The freshman senator catapulted into top-tier status after a commanding performance in the first debate. But subsequent mediocre debate showings, along with a murky ideological message, particularly on healthcare and her seesawing embrace of her prosecutorial past, hobbled her. By September, her campaign was forced to reboot, directing more attention on Iowa, home of the first Democratic nominating contest.
"I'm f--ing moving to Iowa," Harris was overheard telling a fellow senator in September. Her campaign embraced the declaration, which ended up on a T-shirt sold by Des Moines retailer Raygun, known for its cheeky political merchandise.
The Hawkeye State became even more important after her campaign acknowledged last week it was laying off staff and slashing spending. Her team has fired employees at her Baltimore headquarters, all but pulled out of New Hampshire and moved workers from Nevada and California into Iowa. In addition to ramping up its ground game, the Iowa campaign is planning a seven-figure television ad buy in the weeks before the caucus. Her South Carolina team will stay in place.
"We have made a decision -- a difficult decision -- but made a decision of what we need to do to win," Harris told reporters Wednesday.
It was a move her most ardent fans wished she'd made months ago.
"I was disappointed when she listened to people and stayed away from Iowa for a while," said Doug Cameron, 71, a retired principal from Grinnell who backed Harris early on, drawn by her teacher pay proposal. "She needed to be here sooner than she was, make her presence known."
But Cameron was optimistic that the redoubled efforts were moving the needle for Harris.
"It may not be immediately obvious," he said, "but the people I talk to are starting to come around."
So far, Harris' poll numbers in Iowa haven't shown much improvement. A New York Times/Siena College poll released Friday showed her mired in the low single-digits, a world away from the upper echelon of candidates: Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and former Vice President Joe Biden.
When a reporter noted that Harris had said in the past she considered herself a top-tier candidate, the California senator interrupted to firmly insist: "I still do."
Presidential primary history is filled with comeback stories, and Harris' campaign was quick to point out that Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona in 2008 and Democratic Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts in 2004 were both forced to cut spending before notching resurgent victories and, ultimately, winning their parties' nominations. (Both went on to lose the general elections.)
"A lot can change really fast," said Grant Woodard, a Des Moines lawyer and Democratic campaign veteran, who worked on Kerry's bid. "Three weeks out, I don't think anyone in our campaign had a hope and prayer to win."
Kerry's victory was attributed in part to the snarling feud between the top contenders in the Democratic field that year -- Vermont Gov. Howard Dean and Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt. Voters irritated by the negativity turned to Kerry.
Woodard predicted that this year's battle could get just as testy, particularly among the top-polling candidates. Harris could be the indirect beneficiary of the attacks, if she avoids becoming a target.
That possibility underscores the extent to which Harris' fate is not entirely in her own hands. Even if she executes her Iowa strategy perfectly, her backers acknowledge she will still be at the mercy of waiting for her rivals to stumble.
Perhaps her biggest challenge is that voters can be fickle.
Dani Goedken, 18, was already a Harris supporter in September when she met the senator at the University of Northern Iowa, where she is a freshman studying pre-law and political communications. After the encounter, Goedken told a television reporter that she was even more sure she'd caucus for Harris.
But a few weeks later, her loyalties were torn. Warren had just held a rally on the campus in Cedar Falls, and Goedken found herself drawn to the Massachusetts senator's ability to connect with younger voters. Her caucus plans, once certain, had become hazier.
"I can see myself being up for grabs," Goedken said, "because I've gone back and forth with them so many times."
Harris' advisors say she thrives as a scrappy upstart, as she showed in her first race for district attorney in San Francisco. Facing a well-known incumbent, she set up an ironing board in front of grocery stores as a mobile desk to hand out fliers and introduce herself to voters. Now, in the smaller settings in Iowa, she is once again a tactile campaigner, warmly clasping well-wishers with both hands and fixing her gaze on them with laser focus.
In rural Newton, she stood in front of a living room fireplace -- its mantle decorated with family photos and a colorful wooden parrot statue -- and listened to Rose Evans fret that President Trump would not go gracefully from the Oval Office, even if he lost.
Harris, speaking directly to the retired teacher, promised she'd have the courage to take on Trump. With a self-deprecating reference to her diminutive stature, she puffed up her chest and assured Evans, "I'm really tall and big."
"We need to put some Iowa beef on you!" Evans, 68, replied.
The interaction was enough to move Harris into Evans' "top four," she later said.
"She comes off much better in person -- making the eye contact, talking to us -- than she does on TV," Evans said.
Not all voters were wowed. Laura Harreld, 62, pressed Harris at the Winthrop town hall on what could be done about homelessness in San Francisco, where the Democrat won two terms as district attorney.
"What was her answer? She doesn't have a clear plan for that," said Harreld, an interior designer from Strawberry Point. She demurred when a campaign staffer asked her to sign a card promising to caucus for Harris.
For an hour after her talk ended, Harris stayed in the Winthrop barn, wearing a jacket and scarf to ward off the chill as she chatted with voters. When nearly everyone had left, Harris remained, hunched over an ironing board signing placards and books.

Texto completo: Is it possible that more than 20 Republican senators will vote to convict Donald Trump of articles of impeachment? When you hang around Washington, you get the sense that it could happen.
The evidence against Trump is overwhelming. This Ukraine quid pro quo wasn't just a single reckless phone call. It was a multiprong several-month campaign to use the levers of American power to destroy a political rival.
Republican legislators are being bludgeoned with this truth in testimony after testimony. They know in their hearts that Trump is guilty of impeachable offenses. It's evident in the way they stare glumly at their desks during hearings; the way they flee reporters seeking comment; the way they slag the White House off the record. It'll be hard for them to vote to acquit if they can't even come up with a non-ludicrous rationale.
And yet when you get outside Washington, it's hard to imagine more than one or two GOP senators voting to convict.
In the first place, Democrats have not won widespread public support. Nancy Pelosi always said impeachment works only if there's a bipartisan groundswell, and so far there is not. Trump's job approval numbers have been largely unaffected by the impeachment inquiry. Support for impeachment breaks down on conventional pro-Trump/anti-Trump lines. Roughly 90% of Republican voters oppose it. Republican senators will never vote to convict in the face of that.
Second, Democrats have not won over the most important voters - moderates in swing states. A New York Times/Siena College survey of voters in Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin found that just 43% want to impeach and remove Trump from office, while 53% do not. Pushing impeachment makes Democrats vulnerable in precisely the states they cannot afford to lose in 2020.
Third, there is little prospect these numbers will turn around, even after a series of high-profile hearings.
I've been traveling pretty constantly since this impeachment thing got going. I've been to a bunch of blue states and a bunch of red states (including Kansas, Missouri, North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Utah). In coastal blue states, impeachment comes up in conversation all the time. In red states, it never comes up; ask people in red states if they've been talking about it with their friends, they shrug and reply no, not really.
Professor Paul Sracic of Youngstown State University in Ohio told Ken Stern from Vanity Fair that when he asked his class of 80 students if they'd heard any conversation about impeachment, only two said they had. When he asked if impeachment interested them, all 80 said it did not.
That's exactly what I've found, too. For most, impeachment is not a priority. It's a dull background noise - people in Washington and the national media doing the nonsense they always do. A pollster can ask Americans if they support impeachment, and some yes or no answer will be given, but the fundamental reality is that many Americans are indifferent.
Fourth, it's a lot harder to do impeachment in an age of cynicism, exhaustion and distrust. During Watergate, voters trusted federal institutions and granted the impeachment process a measure of legitimacy. Today's voters do not share that trust and will not regard an intra-Washington process as legitimate.
Many Americans don't care about impeachment because they take it as a given that this is the kind of corruption that politicians of all stripes have been doing all along. Many don't care because it looks like the same partisan warfare that's been going on forever, just with a different name.
Fifth, it's harder to do impeachment when politics is seen as an existential war for the future of the country. Many Republicans know Trump is guilty, but they can't afford to hand power to Nancy Pelosi, Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders.
Progressives, let me ask you a question: If Trump-style Republicans were trying to impeach a President Biden, Warren or Sanders, and there was evidence of guilt, would you vote to convict? Answer honestly.
I get that Democrats feel they have to proceed with impeachment to protect the Constitution and the rule of law. But there is little chance they will come close to ousting the president. So I hope they set a Thanksgiving deadline. Play the impeachment card through November, have the House vote and then move on to other things. The Senate can quickly dispose of the matter and Democratic candidates can make their best pitches for denying Trump reelection.
Elizabeth Bruenig of The Washington Post put her finger on something important in a recent essay on Trump's evangelical voters: the assumption of decline. Many Trump voters take it as a matter of course that for the rest of their lives things are going to get worse for them - economically, spiritually, politically and culturally. They are not the only voters who think this way. Many young voters in their OK Boomer T-shirts feel exactly the same, except about climate change, employment prospects and debt.
This sense of elite negligence in the face of national decline is the core issue right now. Impeachment is a distraction from that. As quickly as possible, it's time to move on.
David Brooks writes a syndicated column for the New York Times.

Searching for the Jerome Liebling 'that no one knows'

Texto completo: AMHERST — Most people remember the photographer Jerome Liebling for his black-and-white photographs: workers, children, people going about their lives. A boy spreads his overcoat like two wings, poised to fly. A mother on the streets of Málaga, Spain, clutches her child as a bike whirs past. A slaughterhouse worker spattered with blood steadies himself on a wall and glances down.
But type “Jerome Liebling" into Getty Images's search engine, and color pops into view: lush greens and reds of an apple orchard, turquoise stripes on Art Deco apartments in Miami Beach, orange-and-pink swirls on a patterned dress in Brooklyn. There are famous faces, too: politicians, writers, filmmakers.
It's a surprising selection, and it's no accident. When Rachel Liebling, the photographer's daughter and primary manager of his estate, decided to make 640 of her father's photographs available for licensing through Getty Images, she had a plan.
“I was like, 'I'm putting out the work that no one knows,"' Rachel said, sitting at the kitchen table in her late father's Amherst home this summer.
Born in 1924, Jerome Liebling worked early in his career with the Photo League, a group that pioneered socially conscious street photography in midcentury New York City. His work is featured in the permanent collections of the Museum of Fine Arts, New York's Museum of Modern Art, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, to name a few. He also was widely known as a teacher, especially in photography circles. “But you'd think he'd died in 1960," Rachel said with a laugh.
With control of an artist's archive comes control over his or her legacy. Unless the artist has a large foundation — think Picasso or Dalí — the responsibility usually falls to heirs. Since her father's death in 2011, Rachel has managed his archive with a mind to showcasing later and lesser-known works. She hopes to reframe his artistic legacy, to avoid “this idea of one Liebling," she said.
Rachel was thrown into archive management sooner than she anticipated. Just a few days after her father died, she got a call from The New York Times asking for photos for a memorial article. She was already busy grieving and preparing for her father's service. “Right away, I was dealing with, 'What body of work are we going to put out?' " Rachel said. “I hadn't really thought about it."
When Liebling died, he left behind 15,000 images, stored as prints and negatives in his Amherst study — proof of an active, six-decade-long career. Liebling cared deeply about social issues, a passion informed by his childhood during the Great Depression and service in World War II. He took pictures, he said, to “figure out where the pain was, to show things that people wouldn't see unless I was showing them."
Before he died, Liebling placed his archive in a family trust managed by his widow, Rebecca Nordstrom, and four daughters from a previous marriage. Rachel, the youngest, had experience working in the art world, so she was the logical choice to spearhead the management of her father's archive. In the next years, she helped organize a handful of retrospective exhibitions.
Then, in February 2018, René Aranzamendez contacted Rachel about licensing her father's photos through Getty Images. Aranzamendez is the senior editor of Getty Archive, a branch of the gargantuan online photo library dedicated to licensing editorial photographs taken before the year 2000. He had seen Liebling's photographs online.
“A lot of these folks digitize their content, and it's going on a website that's fairly local. So they're spending their resources and a lot of energy into content that's fantastic, but the reach is never going to be 20-offices' worth," Aranzamendez said in a phone interview, referring to the more than 20 locations that Getty has around the globe. Photographic estates that have licensed with Getty include those of Ansel Adams, Berenice Abbott, and Andreas Feininger.
An inherited photography archive is “a wonderful legacy, but a huge responsibility,"' Mary Engel said in a phone interview. Daughter of the well-known photographers Morris Engel and Ruth Orkin, Engel is founder and president of the American Photography Archives Group, a nonprofit organization that educates its members about the preservation and management of privately-owned photography archives.
Since Engel founded APAG, in 2000, new ways have emerged to promote a photographer's legacy. Through social media, websites, online licensing, and online galleries, archive managers can increase exposure, build audiences, and monetize more works. But they also risk losing control of the images and how they're used and circulated on the Web. “You know, it's scary, because anything that gets out on the Web gets out," Rachel said. “People just think they're public domain."
Pursuing legal action against every Pinterest account or blog that uses your image without permission just isn't feasible, Engel said — especially when the archive is handled by family members. Archivists can either make their photos viewable online and vulnerable to improper use, or not put photos online at all. “A lot of this is about: How much control do you want to keep?" Engel said.
The Lieblings and Nordstrom talked over the offer from Getty Images before deciding to go ahead with the project. “It was definitely an opportunity that we saw for getting Jerry's images out there in the world," said Nordstrom, Liebling's widow.
After seven years of fielding individual requests, Rachel also looked forward to handing over some of the responsibility for licensing. Her contract with Getty would be nonexclusive, meaning she could still handle some requests herself. But it would free up time and extend the archive's reach.
Rachel was still careful to impose limits. The Liebling estate's contract with Getty allows photos to be licensed only for editorial use — meaning images can run in newspapers, but not on mugs or T-shirts. Some archivists, like Engel, will produce posthumous prints; Rachel decided against it, which means all Liebling works are “lifetime prints," produced while he was alive.
The Lieblings receive a small percentage of the profits from each image they license through Getty. They're not expecting to get rich from the deal, Rachel said. The most important thing is increasing exposure and rewriting the narrative about her father's career.
Liebling's well-known works were of anonymous people — workers, children, every-men and -women. “Most people don't know he actually did a lot of portraits, too," Nordstrom said. The archive includes many recognizable faces: the novelists Chinua Achebe and James Baldwin, the photographer Paul Strand, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, candid portraits of a young Ken Burns from when the filmmaker was a student of Liebling's at Hampshire College, to name just a few.
“There was so much material there that other people — other than family, our close friends — haven't ever seen. And some of it is extraordinary work," Nordstrom continued. She found negatives from Liebling's travels to Spain, which she had never seen — although Rachel remembers trailing after her father at bullfights as a girl. There were also street scenes, like one featuring three young women leaning against a car in Holyoke.
Liebling, they said, knew about the growing importance of new technologies. He always shot on film but experimented with digital printing techniques late in life. “Jerry embraced the change, because he knew it was a way for people to see his work," Nordstrom said. “So I think he would be very much in support of this initiative that we've taken."
But Rachel and Nordstrom agree that Liebling wasn't thinking much about posterity before he died. He was just too busy. “Even at the end of his life, he was he was still working and still wanting to publish and get more of his images out there," Nordstrom said. “He was going a mile a minute."

Texto completo: ARCADIA, Calif. — Mongolian Groom, a 4-year-old gelding, was euthanized Saturday at Santa Anita Park after breaking its left hind leg during the final race of the two-day Breeders’ Cup.
Jockey Abel Cedillo, who was riding Mongolian Groom during the featured $6 million Breeders’ Cup Classic, pulled up the horse on the final stretch.
Mongolian Groom was loaded onto a van, which drove the horse to be evaluated by a team of veterinarians who determined the horse could not be saved, according to a Breeders’ Cup statement.
“The death of Mongolian Groom is a loss to the entire horse racing community,’’ the statement read. “Our equine and human athletes’ safety is the Breeders’ Cup’s top priority. We have worked closely with Santa Anita leading up to the World Championships to promote enhanced equine safety. ”
OPINION: Mongolian Groom's death will haunt horse racing
The death was a catastrophic ending to an otherwise incident-free Breeders’ Cup at the embattled racetrack. A string of horse deaths at Santa Anita — 36, as a result of racing or training, since December — had fueled concerns about the possibility of a catastrophic breakdown taking place during the high-profile races Friday and Saturday.
The 37th death took place down the final stretch of the final race of one of the sport’s marquee events and was televised by NBC.
PETA, which has decried the string of deaths at Santa Anita Park and at other tracks around the country, called on more reform and said, “We will not tolerate another mangled horse. ’’
“This is now non-negotiable,’’ the statement read. “The racing industry must make a choice by doing the right thing by the horses or shutting down forever. ’’
Political pressure has mounted, too.
U. S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, in a letter sent earlier this week to the executive director of the state’s horse racing regulatory board, called the Breeders’ Cup a ‘’critical test for the future of horse racing in California. ’’ California Gov. Gavin Newsom in September told the New York Times that horse racing is a “sport whose time is up unless they reform. ’’
In June, the Breeders’ Cup discussed the possibility of moving the event to Churchill Downs or another track before deciding to stick with Santa Anita, which was hosting the event for a record 10th time.
Craig Fravel, CEO of the Breeders’ Cup, told USA TODAY Sports earlier this week that reforms Santa Anita instituted this spring helped ease concerns.
“It wasn’t really that hard a decision because it was the right thing to do and we needed to acknowledge people were taking the right kind of steps that we believe are important for the whole industry to take,’’ he said.
Fravel has dismissed the idea that his accepting a new job with the Stronach Group, which owns Santa Anita Park, influenced the Breeders’ Cup board’s decision to keep the event here.
“I take comfort in the fact that we’ve done everything that we can to control the controllable,’’ Fravel said. “What misfortune could occur that we can’t avoid, I worry about it but that’s just because I’m a worrier, not because we haven’t done everything we can do to address it. ’’
Mongolian Groom, who won three times in 17 starts and earned $579,141, was an overachieving horse. He sold for $11,000 at a yearling sale and $12,000 at a 2-year-old sale.
After the race, he was attended to by a team of veterinarians led by Ryan Carpenter at the Santa Anita equine hospital, according to the Breeders' Cup.

Heisler: Warriors just went from dynasty to expansion team

Texto completo: Farewell, little dynasty.
That splat you heard was the the Warriors, who dominated the NBA the past five seasons as it went from marginally profitable to immensely wealthy, hitting the pavement like an egg dropped from space.
Of course, it’s still way early to write them off, as TNT’s Charles Barkley did, predicting they wouldn’t even make the playoffs … at halftime of their opener … or, at least it was until Steph Curry broke his hand in the fourth game.
There’s now a common theme in Warriors stories
Will they tank?
Shouldn’t they tank?
Are they tanking?
Isn’t it timely that they lost Curry, removing the temptation to claw into the playoffs so they can tank … as owner Joe Lacob seemed to suggest to The Athletic (“Potentially, there’s a silver lining in all of this, who knows?”)
Not that the Warriors may have a choice with all of last spring’s nine rotation players, and all three of their Big Three, out or gone for the duration: Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson Andre Iguodala, Shaun Livingston, DeMarcus Cousins and Quinn Cook.
That left Draymond Green, who hurt just his left index finger, and Kevon Looney, who’s out with a pulled hamstring.
Things started off challenging with Las Vegas setting their over-under at 47 wins, No. 6 or 7 in the West.
Then, unfortunately for the Warriors, the season started.
Game 1: In the opening of the new Chase Center, the Clippers beat them by 19 points, after leading by 31.
Thompson, recovering from knee surgery, goes on with TNT at halftime, airs his hopes … and has Barkley inform him to his face they won’t make the playoffs.
As if agreeing, Coach Steve Kerr notes, “This is not a one-off. This is the reality. There are going to be nights like this this year.”
Game 2: Showing Kerr was right, they lose by 28 in Oklahoma City … after trailing by 41 … to the Thunder, a 1-4 team going into this weekend.
Game 3: Win in New Orleans!
Game 4: Lose by 11 in Phoenix … after trailing by 33.
In the very bad, awful, no good, worst possible news, Curry breaks his left hand early in the third quarter with the Warriors down by 29.
Game 5: Back home, lose to Spurs by 17 … after trailing by 25.
They now start Green, D’Angelo Russell, Glenn Robinson, Willie Cauley-Stein and rookie Jordan Poole, looking more like an expansion team than a dynasty.
This isn’t just a fall. This is the end of the pride of the NBA.
The Warriors didn’t invent the modern offense, spacing the floor with three-point shooters. That was Mike D’Antoni in coaching stints at Phoenix, New York and Houston.
Nevertheless, it was Steph, Klay & Co. who took it and ran with it, popularizing an approach that had always been anathema, expressed by the mantra, “Live by the jump shot, die by the jump shot.”
With their unprecedented firepower came a coincidence of personalities that made the Warriors a delight for the press and lured KD as a free agent in 2016: the personable Kerr … the sweet-tempered Curry, everyone’s favorite … the unaffected Thompson … the trash-talking, stand-up guy, Green.
“To me, they speak not just to the modern NBA, but to the unique place that sports can have in society,” said Commissioner Adam Silver before the season.
“And it’s not just the spirit they bring to the game on the floor, but, I think, the spirit they bring as citizens and to their participation in their community.”
The ascent was symbolized by the $1.4 billion Chase Center they built in San Francisco with money they raised privately, leaving the boondocks of the East Bay.
With personal seat licenses estimated at $18,000 each, revenue is projected to zoom from last season’s $400 million that was already ahead of the Lakers’ $398 million, according to Forbes, to $700 million … ahead of every team in every U.S. league except the Dallas Cowboys.
This is a new reality, indeed. The Lakers, long the NBA’s richest team, used to wish there was no salary cap so they could spend whatever they wanted. Now they can thank their lucky stars there is one
(Giannis Antetokuonmpo, anyone? He’s not free until 2021 but the big teams are eyeing him in all they do.)
The Warriors cherished the fact they were all in this together, but it was no longer true.
Things began unraveling last fall when Green argued with Durant, who had spurned an extension to sign for one year, signaling his intention to become a free agent.
“We won without you,” snapped Green, according to Yahoo’s Chris Haaynes. “We don’t need you. Leave.”
Dray and KD made up, insisting it was behind them in countless interviews … until last week when Durant, now in Brooklyn, acknowledged the blowup had been a factor in his decision to leave (“I mean, your teammate talked to you that way, you think about it. … Definitely, for sure. I’m not going to lie about it.”)
Nevertheless, the Warriors clung to their illusions to the bitter end when Durant went down in Game 5 of the Finals.
GM Bob Myers choked back tears in the interview room. Teammates were glum, despite having just won to cut the Raptors’ lead to 3-2.
If KD wanted most of all to be loved, it looked like the outpouring of grief might persuade him to stay.
Instead, he signed with the Nets to play alongside Kyrie Irving, who is already reportedly showing the mood swings in Brooklyn that he had in Cleveland and Boston.
Of course, the Warriors will try to put Humpy Dumpty back together next season, but they’re not the kids they were when they won the first of their three titles in 2015.
Curry, 31, was averaging 20 points and 2.3 threes, compared to his pre-KD zenith of 30 and 5.1 … as Kerr noted they can’t just turn Steph loose, a la James Harden (“That kind of basketball wears you out, especially for a guy who’s 180 pounds like Steph is.”)
With all those shot attempts and points gone, Green, 29, is averaging a pale 9.4 points, 7.8 rebounds, 5.2 assists and 0.0 blocks, compared to his pre-KD zenith of 14-10-7 with 1.4 blocks.
Thompson, 30, may be coming off a missed season.
You can’t say they didn’t enjoy the journey. In 2015 after winning their first title, Lacob told the New York Times, “We’re light years ahead of probably every other team in structure, in planning, in how we’re going to go about things. We’re going to be a handful for the rest of the NBA to deal with for a long time.”
So they were, but “a long time” is over, the Warriors just learned.

Texto completo: “Correr es mi vida, me hace sentir libre”, afirma con sencillez Guillermo Piñeda Morales, maratonista de 46 años que actualmente se ubica entre los 10 corredores más rápidos del mundo en su grupo etario.
Contrario a la mayoría, “Memo” no se promociona en las redes sociales, no va a gimnasios costosos ni usa cronómetros complicados. Entrena en el parque y se chequea el pulso tocando su propio cuello con sus dedos.
Nativo de Santa Ana Coatepec ( Puebla ), a los 15 años cruzó la frontera indocumentado hacia EEUU. “Vine a trabajar”, dijo.
Laboró en cocinas y como mensajero en bicicleta. Hoy trabaja en el mantenimiento de un edificio en Rego Parks (Queens).
En 1995 corrió su primer maratón y al año siguiente, cuando fue arrestado por estar indocumentado , pensó que todo había terminado y sería deportado. Pero logró pagar una multa y el juez le dio una oportunidad, que concretó con la ayuda de un abogado de inmigración.
En 2005 pudo naturalizarse, lo que a la larga le permitió convertirse en el 2do estadounidense más rápido en su grupo de edad, tras registrar 2:28:42 en el maratón de Boston, en abril de este año.
Sería el primero en México, pero prefiere representar a EEUU, en agradecimiento, afirmó al diario The New York Times.
Sus claves son dos muy puntuales: trabajar duro y nunca rendirse. Este domingo, correrá el Maratón de Nueva York, con el # 477, y así puede ser ubicado en la aplicación oficial de la competencia.
This is Memo. Memo runs fast — like, top 10 in his age group fast. But, he doesn't need any #Fitspo. He only needs two things: Hard work, and never giving up. https://t.co/hYeNf0m3Sx pic.twitter.com/Fxurvp6EMb

New York governor on Trump's Florida move: 'Good riddance'

Texto completo: ALBANY – Gov. Andrew Cuomo is not lamenting President Donald Trump's decision to change his residency from his lifelong home of New York to Florida.
"Good riddance," the Democratic governor said in a statement late Thursday.
The New York Times reported Thursday that Trump, a Republican, and first lady Melania Trump filed separate "declarations of domicile" in Florida last month, a legal move that shifts his residency from Manhattan to his Mar-A-Lago Club in Palm Beach.
The move means Trump's permanent residence will no longer be Trump Tower, the Manhattan building where he has long called home.
And it means New York will no longer be able to lay claim to being the home of the sitting president, though Cuomo — like Trump, a native of the New York City borough of Queens — did not seem to mind.
"It's not like Mr. Trump paid taxes here anyway," Cuomo said in his statement. "He's all yours, Florida."
Trump confirmed the move in a series of tweets Thursday night, criticizing state leaders for what he said was unfair treatment.
"I cherish New York, and the people of New York, and always will, but unfortunately, despite the fact that I pay millions of dollars in city, state and local taxes each year, I have been treated very badly by the political leaders of both the city and state," the president wrote.
Trump has repeatedly clashed with Cuomo and other Democratic officials in his former home state.
Cuomo has repeatedly criticized Trump for the 2017 Republican tax reforms that limited state and local tax deductions to $10,000, a change that disproportionately affected wealthy residents of high-tax states like New York.
State Attorney General Letitia James' office is currently leading dozens of legal actions challenging the Trump administration's policies and actions.
In June, state lawmakers approved a bill allowing the state to release Trump's state tax returns — which the president has declined to make public — to certain congressional committees, if requested. Cuomo signed the bill into law the next month.
And Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance has subpoenaed Trump's tax returns, though Trump is fighting the subpoena in federal court.
Trump, meanwhile, has repeatedly lamented the decline of upstate New York from its industrial heyday, telling reporters in February that upstate residents should consider moving.
"If New York isn't gonna treat them better, I would recommend they go to another state where they can get a great job," Trump said.
In his tweets Thursday, Trump said his shifting residency "will be best for all concerned."
"As President, I will always be there to help New York and the great people of New York," Trump wrote. "It will always have a special place in my heart!"

Islamic State names new leader and confirms al-Baghdadi’s death

Texto completo: Days after the Islamic State group’s leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and his heir apparent were killed in back-to-back attacks by U.S. forces in northern Syria, the group broke its silence Thursday to confirm their deaths, announce a new leader and warn America: “Do not be happy.”
In an audio recording uploaded on the Telegram app, the Islamic State mourned the loss of al-Baghdadi, who led the organization for nearly a decade, and its spokesman, Abu Hassan al-Muhajir, who was killed a day after al-Baghdadi and who had widely been considered a potential successor.
The audio recording was the first word from the Islamic State confirming the death of its leader, which President Donald Trump triumphantly announced Sunday as a huge blow to the world’s most fearsome terrorist group.
Trump and Pentagon officials said al-Baghdadi had blown himself up with a suicide vest, also killing two children, after he had been cornered Saturday in a dead-end tunnel during a U.S. military raid in a northern Syrian village. Al-Muhajir was killed Sunday in an airstrike elsewhere in northern Syria.
Al-Baghdadi’s death came eight months after U.S.-led forces in Syria seized the last remnants of the territory once held by the Islamic State, which at its height spanned an area the size of Britain across parts of Syria and Iraq.
The Islamic State announcement said that al-Baghdadi had been succeeded as leader by Ibrahim al-Hashemi al-Qurayshi, whom it identified as the “emir of the believers” and “caliph.”
Almost nothing is publicly known about al-Qurayshi, including his real name, and counterterrorism analysts were scrambling Thursday to try to figure out who he is.
“Nobody — and I mean nobody outside a likely very small circle within ISIS — have any idea who their new leader ‘Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi’ is,” Paul Cruickshank, editor of the CTC Sentinel at the Combating Terrorism Center, said in a tweet Thursday. “The group has not yet released any meaningful biographical details which might allow analysts to pinpoint his identity.”
Daniele Raineri, a journalist and analyst who has been studying the Islamic State’s leadership structure for more than a decade, said that the group’s leaders often acquire a new nom de guerre with the appointment to a new position, meaning al-Qurayshi may have had a completely different name last week.
The al-Qurayshi appellation at the end of his name indicates that he is being portrayed as a descendant of the Quraysh tribe of the Prophet Muhammad, a lineage that the Islamic State considers to be a prerequisite for becoming a caliph or ruler of a Muslim theocracy.
Its use indicates that the Islamic State continues to see itself as a caliphate — even if one with practically no territory.
“It shows that while the world is ready to pronounce the Islamic State dead and finished, the group’s core leadership continues to believe it can operate much as it has in the past,” said Colin P. Clarke, a senior fellow at the Soufan Center, a research organization in New York.
“The suggestion is that nothing changes, allegiance should still be to the leadership, and affiliates and franchises should continue to look to al-Qurayshi for guidance on how to operate,” he said.
The announcement, in a seven-minute, 37-second recording, was coupled with a warning to the United States not to gloat over killing al-Baghdadi, who oversaw beheadings of American hostages and other atrocities.
“Do not be happy America, for the death of Sheikh al-Baghdadi, and do not forget the cups of death at his hands, may God accept him,” the announcement said.
It boasted of the group’s disciples and expansion beyond the Middle East, even as its core territory in Iraq and Syria was reduced to nil: “Don’t you see America that the State is now on the threshold of Europe and Central Africa?”
Records of wire transfers and the testimony of captured fighters in the Democratic Republic of Congo indicate that the group has set up a base of operation in the Central African country.
The announcement also took aim at the leadership of Trump, admonishing the United States: “Don’t you see how you became the laughingstock of the nations, and an old and crazy man controls your fate, whose opinion changes between morning and evening?”
The announcement implied that the Islamic State hierarchy had convened in order to discuss the successor question and suggested that he had been hand-picked in advance by al-Baghdadi: “The sheikhs of the mujahedeen agreed, after consulting with their brothers and acting upon the recommendation of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, to pledge allegiance to the sheikh and mujahid, the scholar, doer and worshipper Abu Ibrahim al-Hashemi al-Qurayshi,” the announcement said.
Devorah Margolin, a senior research fellow at George Washington University’s program on extremism, said that the fact a shura, or governing council, had selected the new leader “shows the ISIS bureaucracy is still in place.” She added: “We should not underestimate them.”
The announcement also called upon supporters to pledge allegiance to the new leader, a ritual that took new meaning under al-Baghdadi’s reign, as attackers around the world recorded video pledges of fealty to the caliph before carrying out killings.
Counterterrorism officials said to expect in the coming weeks a string of videos pledging allegiance from Islamic State affiliates in Afghanistan, Sinai, the Philippines and other far-flung insurgent hot spots.
“This will possibly be followed by a message from the new leader,” said Laith Alkouri of the business risk consulting company Flashpoint Global Partners, who monitors the group’s online messages. “He’s inherited the burden of leading the group and he needs to put on a show to maintain the morale of the support base.”
Clarke added, “This selection of the new leader is a way for ISIS to link its past with the future it will promise its adherents and followers.”
Intelligence officials and analysts were trying to make sense of the announcement and to place the announced successor among the known cadre of the Islamic State. Some speculated that Abu Ibrahim al-Hashemi may be a new nom de guerre of Hajji Abdullah, who appears in recently recovered internal Islamic State records archived by Aymenn al-Tamimi, a researcher.
“It could be to create confusion or for operational security reasons,” said Aaron Zelin, a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.
The recent announcement by the State Department of a $5 million reward for information leading to his capture was a sign of the importance that the United States placed on him.
Besides the new leader, the Islamic State announcement also proclaimed a new spokesman, identified as Abu Hamza al-Qurayshi, again using a name indicating a lineage from the Prophet’s tribe, and setting up another potential successor.
“Those names are the most generic names I can think of in a long time,” Raineri said. “This trick is obfuscating on purpose the possible links to people we know.”

Horse deaths hover over Santa Anita

Texto completo: ARCADIA, Calif. – Craig Favel sat down in front of the grandstands at Santa Anita Park as he looked across the famed racetrack and into the distance.
"Sitting here at the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains, you can see why this is such a great venue for the Breeders' Cup," the CEO and president of the Breeders' Cup told USA TODAY Sports this week. "It's a spectacularly beautiful place."
Yet it's also fraught with tension and scrutiny as the annual two-day horse racing event is set to begin Friday.
The 36th running of the Breeders' Cup, 14 races with purses of no less than $1 million each that culminate with the $6 million Breeders' Cup Classic, has attracted many of the sport's top horses. It's also certain to attract protesters decrying a string of horse deaths – 36 since December – at Santa Anita.
The deaths have activated animal rights groups such as PETA and led to an investigation by the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office.
Yet in June, with a chance to move the Breeders' Cup to famed Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky, or another racetrack, the organization's board of directors voted to keep the event at Santa Anita, which will be hosting the Breeders' Cup for a record 10th time.
Favel has dismissed the idea that his accepting a new job with the Stronach Group, which owns Santa Anita Park, influenced the Breeders' Cup board's decision to keep the event here.
"It wasn't really that hard a decision because it was the right thing to do and we needed to acknowledge people were taking the right kind of steps that we believe are important for the whole industry to take," said Favel, who after the Breeders' Cup will become CEO of racing operations for the Stronach Group, which owns six other thoroughbred racing tracks.
Unable to slow the alarming rate of horse deaths, Santa Anita shut down racing for almost all of March. Two experts were brought in to inspect the track. The Stronach Group later announced the track was deemed fit to resume racing.
Reform followed.
The use of race-day medication was banned with the exception of Lasix, and the Stronach Group has committed to phasing out permitted use of the potent diuretic. Jockeys faced new restrictions on the use of whips. The Stronach Group also said it has invested in potentially life-saving diagnostic equipment designed to detect horse injuries.
USA TODAY Sports requested an interview with a member of the Stronach Group's executive team but none was made available.
Despite racing reforms at Santa Anita and throughout the state, Gov. Gavin Newsom in September put California horse racing on notice during an interview with The New York Times.
"I'll tell you, talk about a sport whose time is up unless they reform," Newsom told the Times. "That's horse racing. Incredible abuses to these precious animals and the willingness to just spit these animals out and literally take their lives is a disgrace."
Besides the horse deaths, Newsom pointed to another troubling matter: In September, the Times reported that Justify, winner of the 2018 Triple Crown, failed a drug test after winning the Santa Anita Derby, which preceded the horse's sweeping the Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes and Belmont Stakes. Yet California horse racing regulators disposed of the inquiry behind closed doors, the Times reported.
Earlier this week, Jim Gagliano, president and chief operating officer of the Jockey Club, said the sport of horse racing is facing a reckoning.
"Safety and integrity, those are fundamental matters for any sporting competition," said Gagliano, who is helping spearhead a push for federal legislation – the Horse Racing Integrity Act – that would establish a central body responsible for drug-testing horses. "This is a gambling sport. Integrity has to be of the highest variety."
But reality has cast a shadow over talk of reforms. During buildup to the 2019 Breeders' Cup, the horse death toll at Santa Anita continued to mount.
On Oct. 25, G Q Covergirl, a 6-year-old mare, was euthanized after injuring her front legs while on the training track. On Sunday, Bye Bye Beautiful, a 2-year-old filly, was euthanized after she injured her front right leg during a race.
"Like I've been arguing for a long time, they can't stop the killing," said Patrick Battuello, an animal rights activist focused on the death of racehorses. "It's built-in to the system."
Yet Favel, wearing a purple Breeders' Cup sweatshirt as he sat in front of the Santa Anita grandstands this week, looked serene with the view of the San Gabriel Mountains in the distance.
"I take comfort in the fact that we've done everything that we can to control the controllable," Favel said. "What misfortune could occur that we can't avoid, I worry about it, but that's just because I'm a worrier, not because we haven't done everything we can do to address it."

On Day of the Dead, life and death can blur

Texto completo: Everything I know about Dia de los Muertos I learned while living in Mexico.
In Oaxaca and Michoacan, two states with deeply rooted Muertos traditions, I saw how lifelong practitioners dressed their ofrenda altars with precise additions according to the fancies of the departed person being honored: a plate of mole, just so; a specific reposado tequila, served neat; a certain brand of those tiny filterless cigarettes that are still sold down south. Everything had meaning, and a place in the spiritual order of the altar itself.
In the unending hustle of Mexico City, in the darkest days of the post-2008 global recession, neighbors in my downtown apartment building would gather around one another's ofrendas and share warm chocolate and pan de muerto, or bread of the dead. Sometimes we'd carouse around the neighborhood cemeteries, drinking and partying, as Day of the Dead, in its traditional iteration, can also encourage mischief.

I began building my own ofrendas, first to family members and ancestors, then to friends and finally to people whom I greatly admired, like the California writer Michele Serros, or David Bowie. Day of the Dead always felt like a welcoming custom, one that anyone can participate in. After all, who doesn't want a reason to focus fond thoughts on a lost loved one? Who doesn't need a day to contemplate what awaits us all?
Since returning to the States, I've watched as Dia de los Muertos has ballooned into a bonafide cultural phenomenon. Day of the Dead street fairs have become civic fixtures from coast to coast. Daycare centers and elementary schools hold arts and crafts, with children making paper skulls and mini-altars. Concerts, fundraisers, festivals and food events ring with Muertos cheer. Countless enthusiasts don calavera (skull) face makeup.
Its incursion into popular entertainment is also astounding. Look no further than the successful Pixar film "Coco," a story built entirely around Day of the Dead motifs; or the opening sequence of the 007 film "Spectre," in which a lavish Day of the Dead "parade" (a Hollywood fiction) became such a calling-card for its filming location in downtown Mexico City that the local government now re-creates the film's scene-setting parade every year. Everywhere now, Muertos merchandise drowns the consumer market. We have Day of the Dead-inspired Halloween costumes, sneakers, shower curtains, sandals, donuts, and this year a Barbie doll, which promptly sold out.
At the root of it all, though, is a genuine ritual. In homes where the original practice is followed, preparations begin long before the actual celebration days of Nov. 1 and 2. With nightfall on Nov. 1 a bridge opens to allow a brief unification of the living and the dead. It's visitation night for the residents of Mictlan, the underworld .
The holiday has roots dating back 3,000 years, according to Martha Ramirez-Oropeza, an artist and scholar who teaches a sought-after course on Dia de los Muertos in the Chicano studies program at UCLA. "You can feel it as a deeper layer, that goes from pre-Hispanic times, to contemporary times, because when you see an ofrenda, you see parts of the history of Mexico."
This week, Ramirez-Oropeza built ofrendas with students and participants at the longtime Venice arts center SPARC, and on the UCLA campus. Many of her students do not have Latino backgrounds, a sign that a custom centered on honoring one's ancestors resonates with all of us.
If so inclined, you too can participate, by making a modest ofrenda at home. It's quite easy, stripped to its basic rules. (Also, it's helpful for the cynic seeking to offset the energy of a "Sexy Catrina" costume.)
First, an ofrenda should have at least two levels, and some of the offerings should come in sets of two -- two vases for flowers, two candles, two sugar skulls, etc.
Photos and mementos to the dead should be on the top level. Below go food offerings -- a piece of pan de muerto, a sampling of the dead person's favorite food, a cigarette or favorite tequila or water (to quench the spirit's thirst after the long journey from the land of the dead).
For flowers, if you're unable to find those glistening cempasuchil marigolds, any flower will suffice in a pinch. Use petals to create a pathway to the altar. Burn Copal resin or a bit of sage as an invocation.
And that's it. Stay up past midnight, reflect, send thoughts to those who've left us.
I've found, over the years since I adopted the practice, that building an ofrenda for a dead soul is a soothing experience. The ritual embodies the essential duality of Mesoamerican cosmology: There is no living without the dead, and no death without the living. In almost any interpretation, Dia de los Muertos posits a universal truth: The dead need us as much as we need them.

Previews & Openings
'THE BLACK HISTORY MUSEUM ... ACCORDING TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA' at Here (previews start on Nov. 1; opens on Nov. 10). This arts complex reopens as an interactive exhibition in Smoke & Mirrors Collaborative's immersive piece about race, prejudice and America's fraught inheritance.

800-745-3000, thenewgroup.org
'DR. RIDE'S AMERICAN BEACH HOUSE' at Ars Nova at Greenwich House (in previews; opens on Nov. 5). Blasting into space, doable. Navigating gender and sexuality on Earth, harder.

The story of a dysfunctional family, it is directed by Diane Paulus, with a book by Diablo Cody. Jesse Green wrote of last year's production in Massachusetts that it does the good work "we are always asking new musicals to do: the work of singing about real things." Will you fall head over feet? Don't be surprised.
212-239-6200, jaggedlittlepill.com
'TINA: THE TINA TURNER MUSICAL' at the Lunt-Fontanne Theater (in previews; opens on Nov. 7). What's Broadway got to do with it? This bio-musical traces eight decades of Tina Turner's life, from her rural Tennessee origins to her early success and her abusive marriage to her solo triumphs.

Michael Wilson directs.
212-244-7529, signaturetheatre.org
Last Chance
'HEROES OF THE FOURTH TURNING' at Playwrights Horizons (closes on Nov. 17). Will Arbery's anguished moonlit chat with young Christian conservatives ends its Off Broadway run. Jesse Green wrote that this astonishing play, set in Wyoming and directed by Danya Taymor, "explores the lives and ideas of conservatives with affection, understanding and deep knowledge -- if not, ultimately, approval."
212-279-4200, playwrightshorizons.org
'LINDA VISTA' at the Hayes Theater (closes on Nov. 10). Tracy Letts's comedy about a toxic middle-aged man reaches its final performances. Ian Barford stars as Wheeler, a shambling seducer sucker-punched by his own comeuppance. Ben Brantley described this Steppenwolf Theater production, directed by Dexter Bullard, as an "inspired, ruthless take on the classic midlife-crisis comedy."

Texto completo: An unassuming moderate, he pushed through a 10-year $ 10 billion transportation initiative and worked to clean up Chesapeake Bay.
Gerald L. Baliles, a former Democratic governor of Virginia who pushed through a $ 10 billion transportation initiative as well as measures to clean up Chesapeake Bay, died on Tuesday at his home in Charlottesville, Va. He was 79.
Gov. Ralph Northam confirmed the death, from cancer, in a statement. Mr. Northam said state flags would fly at half-staff for 30 days.
Serving from 1986 to 1990, Mr. Baliles (his slogan was "Baliles. The name rhymes with smiles") was seen as one in a tide of ambitious, moderate governors who rose to prominence in the 1980s, among them Bill Clinton in Arkansas and Thomas H. Kean in New Jersey. The New York Times called Mr. Baliles "a tough, intelligent, shrewd politician and manager with an intellectual bent."
Mr. Baliles pushed through the transportation measure during the first year of his administration; a 10-year plan, it required increases in the gas and sales taxes.
"He had the courage to take the political hit for raising taxes for improvements that future governors would cut the ribbons on," Vivian E. Watts, a Democratic state delegate from Arlington, said in 2002. She was secretary of public safety and transportation under Governor Baliles.
Mr. Baliles, who had been the state's attorney general under another centrist, Gov. Charles S. Robb, committed Virginia to an ambitious cleanup of the Chesapeake Bay while in office and later continued his conservation efforts. He wrote the book "Preserving the Chesapeake Bay" (1996) as a call to arms to keep the bay cleanup going.
Under his governorship, teacher salaries increased to within $ 400 of the national average. He introduced the first statewide standardized testing in the public schools. To emphasize the importance of thinking globally, he had oversize maps of the world installed in every seventh-grade classroom in Virginia. He also fought to expand the state prison system and appointed the first woman to the Virginia Supreme Court, Elizabeth B. Lacy.
In 1989, a violent coal strike in southwest Virginia had tensions so high that he was advised to stay out of the area. The economy then collapsed in his last year in office, and when he left the Executive Mansion in Richmond -- prohibited under state law from seeking a second consecutive term -- the state was saddled with a $ 2 billion budget deficit. He was succeeded by his lieutenant governor, L. Douglas Wilder, who became the first African-American to be elected governor of any state.
After leaving office, Mr. Baliles served as chairman of a national commission appointed by President Bill Clinton in 1993 to find ways to keep airlines profitable. While in office, he was successful in helping to wrest Virginia's two largest airports, Washington National and Washington Dulles International, away from federal control and into the hands of the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority.
After retiring as a partner at the Richmond law firm of Hunton & Williams, he returned to his law school alma mater, the University of Virginia, in 2006 to direct the Miller Center of Public Affairs.
Gerald Lee Baliles was born on July 8, 1940, in rural Patrick County, in western Virginia. He spent his early years in Washington, where his father worked during World War II, but returned to Virginia with his father after his parents broke up. He and his brother Larry lived with their grandparents as "farm boys," he said, while his younger brother, Stuart, stayed nearby with an aunt and uncle.
Mr. Baliles graduated second in his class from Fishburne Military School in Waynesboro, Va. He received a bachelor's degree in government in 1963 from Wesleyan University in Connecticut before earning his law degree from the University of Virginia School of Law.
He met his future first wife, Jeannie McPherson, while at Wesleyan, where she was a graduate student in history. They divorced in 1996, and he married Robin Deal in 2003. She survives him, as do two children from his first marriage, Jonathan Baliles and Laura Baliles Osberger; two stepdaughters, Katherine Stone Walsh and Danielle Deal Hudak; and four granddaughters.
Mr. Baliles's cautious, deliberate style and moderate politics were credited with fueling his climb from state legislator to attorney general to governor without ever losing an election.
"I'm not flamboyant," he said after winning the governor's seat. "But I don't know many people who have been brash who have gotten far in politics."

Eric Bolling: Opioids are an equal-opportunity killer

Texto completo: It’s become a depressing fact that American politics is so polarized. That’s also true about where we live and work. We rarely interact with people from the hated other party, except maybe an outcast relative at Thanksgiving.
From immigration to impeachment, guns to graft, it seems we’re divided on every topic. But maybe there is an issue that can unite us — one admittedly born of a father’s deepest grief.
One night in 2017, I received a call that every parent dreads. My only son, a college student, died after taking a Xanax pill laced with fentanyl. His life was lost to a class of painkillers called opioids.
Sadly, he’s not alone. Over the past two decades, more than 400,000 Americans have died from an opioid overdose. The epidemic kills on average 130 Americans every day, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
This is a nationwide horror story, not just a set of cold statistics. Yet the cause of death on such scale is deeply known to most of us, including me.
I tried to translate my grief into helping others. As a television anchor and commentator, I was invited to host a series of town halls highlighting the crisis. I was often joined by Melania Trump, the first lady, Jerome Adams, the surgeon general, or James Carroll, the national drug policy director.
At these town halls I learned that a lot of parents think addiction strikes only other people’s children. They are fooling themselves. And I tell them that every chance I get.
As for children, they can be blindsided by the loss of a father or mother because of addiction, which has shattered communities across the country.
Having lost my only child and best friend, I took another step. I established the Eric Chase Foundation to warn parents and to urge doctors, lawmakers and others to combat the opioid epidemic.
Yes, today’s political climate is nasty. Yes, we wring our hands over how progressives and conservatives hate one another so much that no candidate, legal decision, movie, restaurant and bakery is free from partisan controversy.
Yet here is a unifying issue — here is a calamity that can strike any of us like a brick falling from a building. The crisis brings misery and death to all races, parties, genders, classes and religions. Here is a nonpartisan, equal-opportunity killer.
That’s why we have to battle it together. We can still argue over immigration and impeachment, but on this issue we must unify.
There is some hope. The Trump administration has addressed the crisis — and with bipartisan support, I’m happy to add. Some 57 federal programs sponsor nearly $11 billion dedicated to prevention, treatment and recovery, as well as research, criminal justice, health surveillance and supply reduction.
It’s a wonderful start, but there is so much more to do. Let’s not merely react to current suffering. Let’s punish deceitful drug marketers, set up treatment centers and clamp down on prescribing painkillers.
My view is that Americans can band together to go deeper into this crisis, right to the core issue: how we treat pain. Pain is the body’s reaction to injury, chronic problems and disease. Everyone is susceptible to pain of some kind. It’s a unifying human experience.
Let’s redouble our efforts to find pain treatments that don’t risk drug dependency and addiction. Let’s harness the nation’s research and design resources to produce remedies that end pain, not mask it.
As for my pain of loss and grief, I don’t think there ever can be relief for that. I just try to channel my emotions into something positive. I hope that our personal experiences can lead to a shared understanding — and that our divided nation can unite to end the opioid epidemic and save lives.

Texto completo: At a climate forum in Pittsburgh Wednesday, Mayor William Peduto said he opposes construction of any new petrochemical facilities in the region because of their long-term toll on climate, the environment, public health and even the local economy.
Mr. Peduto, speaking at the Climate Action Summit in the David L. Lawrence Convention Center, also was sharply critical of area industries that refuse to acknowledge the dire threats posed by ongoing climate change or join efforts to combat it.
"Let me be the first to say that I oppose any additional petrochemical facilities," he said, the statement almost drowned out by cheers and applause from more than 350 people in the audience. "We do not have to become the petrochemical and plastics center of the U.S."
Mr. Peduto said the corporations and culture of the region continue to support extractive industries and petrochemical facility development tied to the region's shale gas boom, and that must change if the region is to move ahead economically.
Royal Dutch Shell is building an ethane-cracking plant in Potter, Beaver County, and four or five other such projects are under consideration.
"Groups asked me to oppose the Shell cracker plant, but the ring is out of that bell and we can't put it back," Mr. Peduto said. "But building more such operations will come at a cost of new companies looking at and locating in Pittsburgh.
"Companies don't want to live in a frack field or downwind from more petrochemical plants. Living downwind has a direct effect."
Leann Leiter, Pennsylvania & Ohio field advocate for Earthworks, a national environmental organization, thanked the mayor for taking a stand against petrochemical facility shale gas development.
"This long-awaited statement recommits us to our economic rebound by embracing the future and moving past a fossil fuel based economy that poisons communities and threatens the climate," she said.
But Darrin Kelly, president of the Allegheny-Fayette Central Labor Council, which represents 100,000 workers in the region, said the mayor shouldn't oppose creating thousands of jobs in the region.
"While I respect the mayor's opinion, I wholeheartedly disagree with it," Mr. Kelly said in a Twitter statement. "Calling to banish an entire industry is an insult to a lot of good hard-working men and women in organized labor and their entire way of life."
However, speakers at the climate meeting said continuing to invest in and operate fossil fuel based industries when scientists say the world needs to quickly end carbon emissions is an insult to future generations who will live on a much hotter and changed planet.
Grant Oliphant, president of The Heinz Endowments, one of the hosts of the summit along with p4 Pittsburgh and Sustainable Pittsburgh, said the shale gas and petrochemical industries are expanding at the same time climate scientists say the globe must cut greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030 or face "cataclysmic consequences."
"The region is transforming into the next petroscape, a landscape of pipelines and wells," Mr. Oliphant said. "They tell us it's the price of prosperity, but on a rapidly warming planet it is a false promise."
David Wallace-Wells, author of The New York Times bestseller "The Uninhabitable Earth: Life After Warming," said half of all the fossil fuel emissions by man have occurred in the past 30 years.
"That means that we've done more damage in the last 30 years than in all the centuries before that and we've done it knowingly," he said, adding that in 2018 carbon emissions set a new record and this year will set a new record again.
"Not only are we not moving quickly in the right direction," he said. "We're also moving in the wrong direction."
Climate change impacts are already significant and widespread, Mr. Wallace-Wells said. Two examples: Wildfires are five times worse today than in 1972; and Houston, Texas, has been hit by five 500-year storms in the past five years.
Mr. Wallace-Wells said there is a silver lining.
"The climate changes we see are a reflection of the power we have over the climate," he said. "So since man is the main driver of climate change, we can rewrite the story."
The future, he said, will be filled with massive solar arrays, a new, non-wasteful energy grid, a new kind of plane that runs on electricity, a new kind of locally based agriculture, meat grown in a laboratory, and massive carbon capture from billions of new trees and carbon capture technology.
"But more than new technology we need new politics," Mr. Wallace-Wells said. "In a world as divided as ours, we need to pursue a positive, collective and global response. We're not going to be able to beat climate change, so we have to learn to live with it."
Joylette Portlock, executive director of Sustainable Pittsburgh, found hope in what she said is a "major shift" in public opinion about climate change.
"Polls show 70% of Americans think climate change is affecting the economy and most think government is doing too little about it. Businesses are building sustainability into their bottom lines."
Mr. Peduto said there's a myth that anyone who wants to work on climate change strategies is "bad for business," and it's an attitude that goes well beyond the fossil fuel industry.
"If we stay in that culture, in that mindset, the region will be left behind economically," he said. "There's $1 trillion on the blocks for green and clean energy in the U.S. presently, and $56 trillion available over the next 10 years globally. The question is do we want a seat at that table or do we bury our heads in the sand?"
The opportunity for investment in green energy and a clean environment also carries with it a responsibility to transition workers from the old jobs to the new employment opportunities in solar, wind and other green industries, Mr. Peduto said.
"People will choose false hope over no hope every time," Mr. Peduto said. "If we want to move them from opponents to environmentalists we need to put a paycheck in their hands."

Easy, Getty and Kincade fires are ravaging California. So how did wildfires get named?

Texto completo: Just this week, wildfires in California such as the Kincade Fire, the Getty Fire and the Easy Fire have all wreaked havoc across the state, scorching thousands of acres and forcing widespread evacuations.
But where do these names come from?
Unlike hurricanes, which get their names from a predetermined list of names prepared years in advance, wildfire names are created on the spot when the blaze begins.
Fires typically are named by the dispatch center that sends the first responders to the fire, though sometimes they are named by the first firefighters on the scene, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.
Cal Fire said that “quickly naming the fire provides responding fire resources with an additional locator, and allows fire officials to track and prioritize incidents by name. "
The name comes from a geographical location, local landmark, street, lake, mountain, peak, etc. , Cal Fire reported.
For example, the Carr Fire, which destroyed 1,000 homes and killed eight people near Redding, California, before reaching full containment in August 2018, got its name not for the flat tire that sparked it but for nearby Carr Powerhouse Road, the San Francisco Chronicle said.
Investigation: Where will the West's next deadly wildfire strike? The risks are everywhere
According to the National Interagency Fire Center, there are some fire names that should be avoided. This includes naming a fire after a person, private property or a company, or naming a fire after another catastrophic fire (one that experienced fatalities or high property losses, for instance).
This is similar to how hurricane names are "retired" if they caused devastating damage or destruction. For example, there will never again be another Hurricane Katrina or Hurricane Sandy, both of which had their names retired due to the historic devastation they caused.
In addition, the fire center recommends against using cute or funny fire names, or using a play on words to name a fire: "What may be funny to one person or group may not be to another," the agency said.
Fire science: Infamous 'Diablo' winds are fueling fierce northern California wildfires. So, what are they?
Sometimes a fire can have two names: One of the worst wildfire disasters in U. S. history, a 1994 blaze that killed 14 firefighters, has become known as the Storm King Fire after the mountain where the crew died. But, officially, the blaze was known as the South Canyon Fire.
Some names are rather whimsical: “You could have a fire by a landfill – and they might call it the Dump Fire,” Heather Williams, a Cal Fire spokeswoman told the New York Times. “Sometimes the names come through and it’s like, ‘Really guys?’”

Texto completo: Samin Nosrat has an award-winning cookbook. She has a popular show on Netflix and a New York Times column.
And she’s coming to Philadelphia next week.
Nosrat will speak at the Kimmel Center at 7:30 p.m., Wednesday, Nov. 6.
Her first cookbook, “Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat: Mastering the Elements of Good Cooking” won several awards including the 2018 best general cookbook from the James Beard Foundation.
Nosrat’s show on Netflix is split into four episodes, each one exploring a key to great cooking. It’s been called “remarkable” and “down to earth.” “Nosrat announces herself as an enthusiastic, democratic avatar of home cooks everywhere,” writes Alison Herman of The Ringer.
The author is working on a second book, "What to Cook."
“Samin Nosrat has long been a household name in the culinary arts realm, yet recently, her infectious love for food has instilled her in the wider, cultural lexicon,” said Anne Ewers, President and CEO of the Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts. “She presents gourmet food with an accessibility seldom seen, providing an educational experience without an ounce of condescension. Her brilliance is in her simplicity, giving audiences a feeling of friendship with her warmth and vivacity that is even more charming live.”
Tickets for the talk in Philadelphia range from $25 to $55.

Armenians disappointed in Omar on genocide vote

Texto completo: Members of the Twin Cities Armenian community criticized U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar on Tuesday for not supporting a measure that recognizes the century-old mass killings of Armenians by Ottoman Turks as a genocide.
The House voted overwhelmingly Tuesday to approve the measure in a clear rebuke to NATO ally Turkey in the wake of its invasion of northern Syria. Omar, however, was one of three members who voted "present."
It passed 405-11 at a time when American lawmakers have criticized Turkey's incursion against the Kurds along the Turkish-Syrian border.
In a statement, Omar, D-Minn., said she believes accountability for human rights violations, especially ethnic cleansing and genocide, is paramount. "But accountability and recognition of genocide should not be used as cudgel in a political fight," she said. She argued other atrocities, including the slave trade and the killings of Native Americans during colonization, need to be acknowledged.
The Rev. Tadeos Barseghyan, pastor at St. Sahag Armenian Church in St. Paul, said he was pleased by the vote but was disappointed by Omar. "This is recognizing the victims and their descendants," Barseghyan said.
The argument that the politics today makes it the wrong time to vote on this is an excuse that American Armenians have heard before, he said.
"Is there a right or wrong time to … stand up for justice that she claims to be a champion for?" he asked.
Michele Byfield Angell, the parish council's chairwoman, said she wishes Omar had approved the resolution. "If [Omar] is going to be representing our community here, she should hear us. … If she's voting present as acknowledging it but not doing anything about it, then what is she doing?
Gov. Tim Walz also weighed in, tweeting: "The Armenian Genocide is historical fact, and the denial of that fact is a continuation of the genocide. As a member of Congress, I sponsored this legislation. The memory of the victims and the commitment to the survivors demands that history acknowledge the lives lost."

Arizona Democratic chair criticized for saying Trump has 'aligned himself with ISIS'

Texto completo: PHOENIX – Hours before President Donald Trump announced the death of the leader of ISIS, the chairwoman of the Arizona Democratic Party said in public remarks that Trump had aligned himself with the terrorist organization.
The Arizona Republican Party hit Felecia Rotellini on Tuesday for her ill-timed remark at Saturday's "We the Voters Conference" hosted by the Citizens Clean Elections Commission in downtown Phoenix.
During a panel discussion, Rotellini explained why she thought people will show up to vote in 2020.
"Another reason why people are going to vote (is) because Donald Trump is manipulating the White House and has aligned himself with ISIS and Saudi Arabia," Rotellini said.
State Republican Chairwoman Kelli Ward, who was part of the same panel, immediately interjected. "I have to say that is not true. That is not true," Ward said as Rotellini tried to continue.

Who is Alexander Vindman: The White House expert who testified about Trump’s Ukraine call?
'Poor choice of words'
The remarks came as American forces began a raid in Syria that trapped Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the world's most wanted terrorist, who blew himself up in a tunnel, along with three children, according to Trump's telling of al-Baghdadi's final moments.
"It was a poor choice of words," Matt Grodsky, spokesman for the Arizona Democratic Party, said in an email to The Arizona Republic on Tuesday.
Grodsky said the comments stemmed from "President Trump's haphazard decision to withdraw troops from Syria, which has been opposed by Republicans and Democrats alike because it abandoned our Kurdish allies in the fight against ISIS, empowered Iran, Russia, and the Syrian regime, and hurt our interests in the region. "
Ward, who has had more than a few cringe-inducing remarks of her own, hit back at Rotellini for what she viewed as slanderous comments.
"It is extremely disconcerting to hear the top Democrat in Arizona slander and malign an innocent person for being aligned with the world’s most evil terrorists, let alone the president of the United States," she said.
"While fear-mongering from the left is expected up to a point, we have to draw the line somewhere if they’re going to refuse to police themselves. Baseless statements like those made by the chair of the Arizona (Democratic Party) are wildly irresponsible and not rooted in reality. "
Jeffrey Epstein: Private pathologist questions whether Epstein died by suicide
Comment stems from Syrian troop withdrawal
Rotellini's comment came as people across the political spectrum wrestled with Trump's decision to withdraw at least some troops from northern Syria after the Turkish offensive into the territory previously held by Kurds aligned with the U. S.
Democrats and Republicans alike said the move empowered ISIS and sent a bad message to U. S. allies.
Trump gained a measure of redemption with the announcement Sunday that al-Baghdadi was dead.
The credit has proven fleeting for the administration, amid reports that Trump's withdrawal orders forced the Pentagon to speed up the long-planned raid on al-Baghdadi's location.
The New York Times reported that U. S. officials determined his whereabouts with a tip and collaboration with Iraqi and Kurdish intelligence officials.

Texto completo: BOSTON -- Concert promoters in the U.S. are stepping back from plans to scan festivalgoers with facial recognition technology, after musicians and others gave it some serious side-eye.

Although it remains entirely possible that music venues will eventually take a second look at the controversial technology.

Live-entertainment giants AEG Presents and Live Nation both recently disavowed any plans to use facial recognition at music festivals, despite earlier indications to the contrary. Their public pronouncements have led a group of musicians to declare victory after a months-long campaign to halt the technology's use at live shows.

Advances in computer vision have enabled businesses to install cameras that can recognize individuals by their face or other biometric characteristics. Venue operators have talked about using the technology at gateways to secure entry for select groups or to offer perks for repeat customers.

Privacy advocates worry that such uses might also pave the way for greater intrusions, such as scanning audience members in real time to analyze their behavior.

Both concert organizations seemed to be edging toward remembering more faces. In May 2018, for instance, Live Nation subsidiary Ticketmaster announced it was partnering with and investing in Texas facial recognition startup Blink Identity, saying in a note to shareholders that its technology will enable music fans to associate their digital ticket with their image and "then just walk into the show."

AEG, which operates the Coachella festival in southern California and other major events, updated its online privacy policy earlier this year with language stating that it may collect facial images at its events and venues for "access control," creating aggregate data or for "personalization" -- a term commonly used by retailers trying to tailor advertising or promotions to a specific customer's behavior.

Now, however, both organizations have done an about-face. AEG's chief operating officer for festivals, Melissa Ormond, emailed activists earlier this month to say: "AEG festivals do not use facial recognition technology and do not have plans to implement." AEG confirmed that statement this week but declined further comment.

Live Nation said in a statement that "we do not currently have plans to deploy facial recognition technology at our clients' venues." The company insisted that any future use would be "strictly opt-in," so that non-consenting fans won't have to worry about potentially facing the music.

Facial recognition isn't seen in many musical venues. The biggest location known to employ it is New York City's Madison Square Garden, which confirmed this week that facial recognition is one of the security measures it uses "to ensure the safety of everyone" in the arena. It declined to say what it looks at and why. The New York Times first reported its use last year.

While the music industry paused, Major League Baseball stole a base by rolling out biometric ticketing in the U.S., usually involving fingerprints or iris scans to get into ballparks. Authorities in some parts of Europe have bounced around the idea of using either facial or voice recognition to keep tabs on unruly soccer fans, such as those participating in racist chants. Police agencies in China have used facial recognition at concerts featuring pop singer Jacky Cheung to identify and arrest people wanted as criminal suspects.

American music event promoters this fall have been pressured to disclose their facial recognition plans by digital rights group Fight for the Future, which asked dozens of festival organizers to pledge not to use a technology it describes as invasive and racially biased.

For some, it was an easy answer. Organizers of the Summer Meltdown Festival outside Seattle said they are "happily free of facial recognition technology." Also confirming they don't use it were hosts of events including South by Southwest, Lollapalooza, Bonnaroo, Governors Ball and the Voodoo Music and Arts Experience in New Orleans.

Rage Against The Machine guitarist Tom Morello co-authored an opinion column in BuzzFeed last week that described the pledge as the "first major blow to the spread of commercial facial recognition in the United States."

The CEO of Blink Identity says opposition to its Ticketmaster partnership is misguided.

"They're talking about mass surveillance," said Mary Haskett, who co-founded the Austin, Texas startup. "We're against mass surveillance.... Nobody's talking about doing what they're protesting against."

Haskett said Blink's system allows concertgoers to opt in by taking selfies with their phones, which the company transforms into mathematical representations and deletes. The system might offer access to a shorter line or a VIP section.

But protesting musicians fear their fans' mugshots could still end up in the hands of law enforcement or immigration authorities.

"Of course it's going to be used by security," said Joey La Neve DeFrancesco, a guitarist for Rhode Island punk band Downtown Boys, which played Coachella in 2017. "Of course it's going to be used by law enforcement."

Punk rockers aren't the only ones fixing the technology with a death stare. A June survey by the Pew Research Center found that while people are generally accepting of facial recognition used by police, only 36% said they trust tech companies to deploy it responsibly. Just 18% trust advertisers.

Texto completo: Rudy Giuliani punched back at Lt. Col. Alex Vindman Tuesday, suggesting the star impeachment witness is less than 100% loyal to America.
The ex-mayor slammed Vindman over a New York Times report that said the White House security adviser discussed Giuliani's shadow diplomacy effort with Ukrainian counterparts in their native tongue.
"A US gov. employee who has reportedly been advising two gov's?" Giuliani (inset) tweeted, referring to Vindman. "No wonder he is confused and feels pressure."
Giuliani's tweet echoed smears by some other right-wing figures that questioned whether Vindman is guilty of feeling dual loyalty to the U.S. and Ukraine, where he was born.
The Purple Heart winner came to the U.S. as a toddler and grew up in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, before joining the military and serving in Iraq. He is the top Ukraine expert on the White House National Security Council.
Vindman, who delivered damaging testimony against Trump, suggested the effort led by Giuliani to dig up dirt on Democrats in Ukraine "undermined U.S. national security."
"This alternative narrative undermined U.S. government efforts to expand cooperation with Ukraine," Vindman wrote in his prepared opening statement.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – The White House's top expert on Ukraine twice notified superiors about concerns that the president and those working for him were linking foreign aid to Ukraine with investigations that would help President Donald Trump politically, a push that he said could undermine U.S. national security, according to his opening statement obtained by USA TODAY.
The testimony of Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman before the House Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight committees Tuesday marked the first time lawmakers investigating the impeachment inquiry heard from someone who listened to Trump's July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky -- the call at the center of the impeachment investigation that included Trump's request that Ukraine investigate former Vice President Joe Biden.
"I was concerned by the call," Vindman wrote in his opening statement. "I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government's support of Ukraine."
Vindman, a key member of the National Security Council, outlined his service to the country, including his two decades as an Army officer, which included a tour in Iraq, where he was wounded in an IED attack and awarded a Purple Heart. He says his family fled the Soviet Union and immigrated to New York City in 1979.
"I am a patriot," he said in the statement. "And it is my sacred duty and honor to advance and defend our country, irrespective of party or politics."
Vindman did not answer questions from reporters as he entered a secure room in the Capitol basement.
Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., said they learned new information in the deposition but declined to elaborate on specifics.
Republican lawmakers pushed back on concerns they were attempting to out the whistleblower's identity by having it uttered during Tuesday's testimony.
"We're just trying to get information that we're entitled to get and the witness is supposed to answer our questions," said Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio.
He and fellow Republicans attacked House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff for objecting to a line of questions posed by GOP members, including questions about who Vindman had spoken with about his concerns relating to Ukraine, especially about the July 25 Trump-Zelensky call and the July 10 meeting with European Union Ambassador Gordon Sondland and Ukrainian officials.
The New York Times first reported on Vindman's opening statement.
Trump and his allies attempted to undermine Vindman's credibility.
Appearing on CNN Tuesday morning, former Rep. Sean Duffy, R-Wis., said Vindman seemed to have an "affinity" for Ukraine because of his heritage.
But top congressional Republicans defended him against attacks on his Ukrainian heritage. Speaking at a press conference with House Republicans, Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the third-ranking House Republican, said attacks on Vindman's patriotism were "shameful" and said Republicans "should not be involved" in them.

The new political dynamic

Texto completo: In the conventional view of American politics, Joe Biden is a moderate, while Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are on the left, and Donald Trump is on the right.
This conventional view is rubbish. The most powerful force in politics today is anti-establishment fury. There are no longer "moderates." There's no longer a "center." Today's great divide is between democracy and oligarchy.
Four decades ago, when America had a large and growing middle class, the left wanted stronger social safety nets and more public investment in schools, roads and research. The right sought greater reliance on the free market.
In those days, a general election was like a competition between two hot dog vendors on a long boardwalk. Each had to move to the middle to maximize sales. If one strayed too far left or right, the other would move beside him and take all sales from the rest of the boardwalk.
This type of American politics is now obsolete. As wealth and power have moved to the top and the middle class has shrunk, more Americans have joined the ranks of the working class and poor. Most Americans, regardless of whether they were once on the left or right, have become politically disempowered and economically insecure. Nowadays it's the boardwalk vs. private jets on their way to the Hamptons.
As Rahm Emanuel, Barack Obama's chief of staff and the former mayor of Chicago, told The New York Times in July, "This is really the crackup. Usually fights are Democrats versus Republicans, one end of Pennsylvania versus the other, or the left versus the right. Today's squabbles are internal between the establishment versus the people that are storming the barricades."
In 2016, Trump harnessed many of these frustrations, as did Bernie Sanders. If anything, the frustrations today are larger than they were then. Corporate profits are higher, as is CEO pay. Markets are more concentrated. The three richest Americans now have more wealth than the bottom half of the population put together. Yet most people's pay has gone nowhere, and they have even less job security.
Big corporations, Wall Street and billionaires have entrenched their power. Trump has given them all the tax cuts, regulatory rollbacks and subsidies they've wanted.
Why doesn't the rest of America rise up in protest against Trump's virulent attacks on American democracy? Because American democracy was dysfunctional even before Trump ran for president. The moneyed interests had already taken over much of it. This partly explains why Biden is foundering.
At the same time, Trump and his propagandists at Fox News have channeled working-class rage at the establishment into fears of imaginary threats such as immigrants, socialists and a "deep state."
But a large majority of Americans could get excited about moving toward a real democracy and an economy that works for the many. This is why the oligarchy is so worried about Elizabeth Warren's rise to frontrunner status in some polls.
Politico reports that Democratic-leaning executives on Wall Street, in Silicon Valley and across the corporate world are watching Warren with an increasing panic.
If Biden implodes and neither Buttigieg nor Klobuchar takes the lead away from Warren, Wall Street and corporate Democrats hope former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg will make a late entrance in the Democratic race.
It won't work. The stark reality is that Democrats cannot defeat Trump's authoritarian populism with an establishment candidate who fronts for the oligarchy.
Unless Democrats stand squarely on the side of democracy against oligarchy, they risk that on Election Day too many Americans will either stand with Trump or stay home.

Hong Kong Bars Activist From Running For Council

Texto completo: Mr. Wong, a leader of the 2014 Umbrella Movement, had planned to run for a district council position amid widespread public anger with the government.
HONG KONG -- The Hong Kong authorities on Tuesday barred Joshua Wong, a prominent democracy activist, from running in district council elections next month, a blow to the protest movement's efforts to convert deep anger toward the authorities into electoral gains.
The government cited statements by Mr. Wong's political organization that the future of Hong Kong should be determined by its people, and independence is a possible option. An official said those statements were incompatible with the Basic Law, Hong Kong's mini-constitution, which states that the semiautonomous city is part of China.
"The candidate cannot possibly comply with the requirements of the relevant electoral laws, since advocating or promoting 'self-determination' is contrary to the content of the declaration that the law requires a candidate to make to uphold the Basic Law and pledge allegiance" to Hong Kong, the government said in a statement.
Mr. Wong said the decision showed that China's central government was manipulating the election, which is expected to be a key test of public sentiment about the protest movement.
In a news conference outside the Hong Kong government headquarters, he called the decision to bar him "a political order that Beijing has handed down."
Earlier he said that the official who made the decision had been relegated to a role as the "thought police."
The district council elections, which will be held on Nov. 24, are usually focused on local issues such as bus stops and neighborhood beautification. But the race is taking on a broader political significance this year. Whichever side wins the most seats will control 117 votes in the 1,200-member election committee that chooses the next chief executive, Hong Kong's top government position.
The pro-democracy camp's fears of even wider prohibitions on their candidates seeking office have not been realized, as Mr. Wong will most likely be the only candidate barred from the district council race.
He said Tuesday that he hoped voters would support another candidate, Kelvin Lam, who had registered to run in the event of Mr. Wong's disqualification.
Mr. Wong, 23, grew to international prominence as a student leader during the 2014 Umbrella Movement, when protesters occupied streets for weeks to push for freer elections. He was sentenced to short prison terms twice over the 2014 protests, and was still in custody in June when the current protest movement began.
The current protest movement began as a fight over a now-withdrawn extradition bill and has expanded its demands to include an investigation into use of force by the police and direct elections for the chief executive and the entire Legislative Council.
Unlike 2014, there are no widely known protest leaders. But Mr. Wong has remained a prominent participant and has been regularly attacked in the state-run Chinese media. In August, he and Agnes Chow, another 2014 protest leader who belongs to the same political group, Demosisto, were arrested on unauthorized assembly charges for a June 21 protest, when thousands of protesters surrounded police headquarters.
Ms. Chow was disqualified from running for the Legislative Council last year over similar questions of support for self-determination, including an option for independence. She won an appeal last month, with a judge ruling that she had insufficient opportunity to respond to the grounds for disqualification.
Ms. Chow said that ruling was a "Pyrrhic victory," because it still upheld the ability of officials to disqualify candidates based on their political beliefs.
Mr. Wong had previously publicly shared his response to the official who disqualified him, Laura Aron, on Facebook on Saturday, where he argued that his advocacy remains within the bounds of the city's Constitution.
"My position is that any decision on Hong Kong's future should be carried out within the constitutional framework of 'one country, two systems,"' he wrote. "Supporting democratic self-determination does not mean supporting Hong Kong's independence from the central government of the People's Republic of China."
He added that comments two weeks ago by China's leader, Xi Jinping, that any effort to divide the country would end in failure showed the futility of upholding such a position.
When Mr. Xi "threatened in strong terms that 'anyone attempting to split China in any part of the country will end in crushed bodies and shattered bones,' I believe that in reality Hong Kong independence cannot become an acceptable option," Mr. Wong wrote.
Ms. Aron wrote in her decision that by referring to Mr. Xi's comments, Mr. Wong suggested that "both Demosisto and he were pressed into saying that they have given up the notion as a compromise, instead of a genuine intention."

Texto completo: Elena Ferrante, the Italian writer whose Neapolitan quartet of novels have sold more than 11 million copies worldwide and inspired last year's HBO series "My Brilliant Friend," has a new book slated for publication in the United States next year.
The book, "The Lying Life of Adults," will come out on June 9, 2020, her United States publisher, Europa Editions, announced Monday. It is expected to be published next month in Italian.
"The Lying Life of Adults" will be Ms. Ferrante's 10th book. According to Michael Reynolds, her editor at Europa, it will center on similar themes to her other books, which have explored female friendship, motherhood and class.
Ms. Ferrante, who writes under a pseudonym, has gained a following over the last few years for her Neapolitan series, starting with the 2012 novel "My Brilliant Friend." The four books, which include "The Story of a New Name," "Those Who Leave and Those Who Stay," and "The Story of the Lost Child," all follow the lifelong friendship of two women from Naples. The books have been released in dozens of countries -- 2.5 million copies sold in the United States -- and have prompted passionate debate about their story lines as well as the identity of their author. In a 2014 interview, Ms. Ferrante told The New York Times that she writes "to put my writing on display, not me."
Europa provided little information about "The Lying Life of Adults" except for a brief excerpt that it posted on Twitter early Monday. Its first sentence: "Two years before leaving home my father said to my mother that I was very ugly."
Mr. Reynolds declined to provide further details, though he said it would be shorter than Ms. Ferrante's Neapolitan books, some of which were nearly 500 pages.
"I do think readers who fell in love with Ferrante with the Neapolitan novels -- I think they're going to be pleased," he said.

Texto completo: SEATTLE -- Amazon has yet to find the key to unlocking huge grocery sales. Now, the company is trying a new tack: free delivery for more people.
On Tuesday the company announced free two-hour grocery delivery for Prime members in more than 20 major metropolitan areas. The changes eliminate what had been a monthly $ 14.99 fee for people shopping on Amazon Fresh, its online grocery service that delivers milk, eggs, seafood and other perishable products from its warehouses.
The new delivery option is in addition to the free delivery Amazon offers to Prime members who shop at most Whole Foods Market stores. Both methods require a minimum purchase for $ 35 to have no delivery fees. Prime memberships typically cost $ 119 a year.
Amazon has long wanted to make headway in the $ 700 billion grocery industry -- it is not only an immense market, but also a category in which customers buy with high frequency.
Amazon bought Whole Foods two years ago, by far its biggest splash in the industry. So far, though, the impact at Whole Foods's physical stores and on Amazon's bottom line has been modest. But the glimmers of hope Amazon has seen from buying Whole Foods have largely been from delivery.
"We made Fresh both available to more customers, and much faster, over the past year," said Stephenie Landry, Amazon's vice president of grocery delivery. Ms. Landry explained that while Whole Foods orders were fulfilled in the grocery stores, Amazon delivers its Fresh orders from small fulfillment centers located close to customers. "We have opened more of those over the past year, and that's what enables us to offer free two-hour delivery," she said.
Amazon Fresh sells a broader selection of branded products like Doritos or Coke that Whole Foods does not carry.
At a traditional grocery store, perishable items account for about two-thirds of sales. For Amazon, excluding Whole Foods, those fresh products make up just about 6 percent of food sales, according to a February report from Bain & Company.
Since Amazon bought Whole Foods, traditional grocers have fought back aggressively. While Walmart, Kroger and others offer home delivery for a fee, they have been pushing ways for customers to order online and pick up groceries in their stores, an approach analysts say has been popular in part because it is free.
With its new announcement, Amazon is showing it is willing to spend heavily on delivery where its competitors have not, and make up the costs through other purchases made by Prime members, to undercut the value traditional grocers have been offering.

Amazon has made fast delivery a key to driving more retail sales. Last week, Amazon already said it expected to spend about $ 1.5 billion this quarter on one-day shipping for Prime customers, and it is now adding free grocery delivery within two-hours to its spending spree. They are long-term bets that Amazon can change customer behavior and expectations in ways that will create more loyalty for Prime customers, who buy more, and more frequently, than non-Prime customers.
In July, The New York Times reported that Amazon was pursuing a new chain of grocery stores designed specifically with pickup and delivery in mind. In September, a local news outlet in Los Angeles reported that a "new-concept Amazon grocery store" was slated to open in November at the site of an old Toys "R" Us store.
Ms. Landry declined to comment on the new stores and whether they would be used as part of the free delivery push.

Texto completo: El teniente coronel Alexander Vindman , principal experto en Ucrania para el Consejo de Seguridad Nacional, testificó este martes ante los representantes encargados de la investigación previa a al juicio político del presidente Donald Trump. Su testimonio no gustó al mandatario pero reveló información que puede ser clave para que los demócratas sigan adelante con un proceso que puede sacar a Trump de la Casa Blanca.
Vindman estuvo en la llamada telefónica que el presidente hizo el 25 de julio a su homólogo ucraniano y que llevó a la presidenta de la Cámara de Representantes, Nancy Pelosi, a anunciar el inicio de una consulta que reuniera los apoyos necesarios para someter a Trump a un impeachment. En dicha conversación, tal y como confirmó el coronel en su testimonio, Trump presionó a su homólogo ucraniano para que investigara a su rival político Joe Biden y a su hijo Hunter.
Vindman aseguró a los legisladores que la transcripción de la llamada que publicó la Casa Blanca había excluido la palabra “Burisma” , la compañía de gas ucraniana por la que Trump quiere que investiguen a los Biden. En la transcripción tampoco aparece las palabras de Trump afirmando que había grabaciones de Biden .
The New York Times publicó en la tarde del martes que Vindman ofreció correcciones pero las rechazaron. Según sus declaraciones, el excombatiente en Irak no comprendió por qué hicieron unos cambios y no otros.
Su testimonio supuso la quinta confirmación hasta ahora de que Trump condicionó o bien una reunión con Zelenski o bien la entrega de ayuda militar a Ucrania a una investigación de sus rivales políticos, un tema que podría espolear un proceso de destitución del presidente.

A new frontier for grandma's cooking: the electronic range

Texto completo: A rooster crows as Ángela, a Mexican woman in a purple apron, takes her place beside a wood-fired grill to teach us how to make gorditas, corncakes plump with fillings. “Hola, mi gente bonita," she greets us. Hello, my beautiful people. Doña Ángela — no one seems to know her last name, only that she lives somewhere in Michoacán — is the host of De Mi Rancho a Tu Cocina, a YouTube cooking channel that has amassed 1.5 million subscribers since its launch two months ago. (The name translates to “From My Ranch to Your Kitchen.") As the host pats corn dough between her palms with evident satisfaction, we hear children chattering in the background; perhaps that, combined with her kind, lined face, is why she is always referred to as an abuela (grandmother) or some fond variant thereof — e.g. “tiny abuelita," in a Vice story that notes “a distinct ASMR vibe" to her soothing videos.
Meanwhile, over on Instagram, 114,000 people have watched a video of Lan Lin — a.k.a. “Mama Lin," the 70-something mother of food blogger Lisa Lin — wrap and fry spring rolls. The YouTube channel Pasta Grannies (431,000 subscribers) spawned a cookbook out in the US this week, “Pasta Grannies: The Secrets of Italy's Best Home Cooks," featuring recipes from more than 70 nonne for pici, trofie with pesto, and the like. Pasta Grannies was featured recently in The New York Times, which last year ran an obituary for Mastanamma, an Indian great-grandmother who died at 107 with more than a million subscribers to Country Foods, the YouTube channel where she documented recipes for tamarind rice, chicken curry, and whole lamb biryani.
It is true that grandmothers have always cooked, and that we have always loved to watch them. But now the grandmothers doing the cooking are not necessarily our own, and we are turning up in droves to learn their family recipes. Granny cooking has found a new frontier — the electronic range — and women who came of age before the Internet existed are being celebrated online for their culinary prowess.
"I talk about my mother to my friends a lot and they find her funny," says Lisa Lin, a former lawyer whose mother supports her career change while not always understanding it. "I thought: Why don't I record her making peanut candy and post it online? I got such a great reaction from my audience, more so than I've ever had before. It turns out a lot of people really enjoy watching my mom cook."
This is understandable. Mama Lin's mooncakes, dumplings, and garlicky green beans look delicious, and her technique is impeccable. The only route to hand-shaping tapered silver-needle noodles so effortlessly is years and years of practice. In her De Mi Rancho a Tu Cocina videos, Ángela brings us into the garden to pick vegetables with her before cooking them in bright enamelware with “poquita sal": Who needs exact measurements? (Or potholders, for that matter? Ouch.) A comment on a Pasta Grannies video, in which 96-year-old Pierina rolls out strudel dough until you can see the tablecloth's pattern through it, reads: “I'm a cook for over 40 years and [I'm] feeling as green as hell. This is art."
It is. In an age when cookbook publishers rarely pay to have recipes tested, and the reliability of those found online is a crapshoot, it is comforting to see something prepared by hands that have prepared it hundreds of times over decades. Does this recipe work? There's no question about it.
But more than that, there is a nostalgic appeal. We like to think of grandmothers as figures who exist for the purpose of nourishing and nurturing us, a notion that may never have been quite so simple in reality. Regardless, it's awfully hard to spend all day making chicken potpies from scratch when your high-powered job keeps you late at the office. The grandma of yore is an endangered species, here on earth but for a short time more.
“Every generation has nostalgia for the generation before," says Anastasia Miari, a UK-based journalist who with creative director Iska Lupton is working on a project called Grand Dishes, documenting the stories and recipes of grandmothers from around the world. “Our lives are so fast-paced and saturated with instant gratification. . . . Especially in cities, young people, or millennials, or snowflakes [laughs], we seem to not have time to cook, not have time to feed ourselves, not have time to take care of our mental health. We're all suffering from burnout. The simple lives our grandparents live are now attracting us. We're learning maybe that's a better way to live."
Grand Dishes will culminate in a cookbook of the same name that Miari and Lupton aim to have out for the holidays next year. They have spent time with grannies from Sicily, Cuba, Hong Kong, Eritrea, and more; this week they set out on a US road trip. First stop: New York restaurant Enoteca Maria, which has a rotating menu prepared not by trained chefs but by grandmothers from around the world, serving up dishes from their own cultures. As with most people who set out to preserve these recipes, Miari and Lupton were inspired by their own grandmothers, from Greece and Germany, respectively.
"These are the last generation of women that won't have had their lives recorded in the way we record our lives now," Miari says. "These stories and recipes might be lost forever if we're not around to take them down or inherit them."
Even for those who don't cook, these videos have appeal. They feed our wanderlust with glimpses of cultures and countries we may never visit ourselves. At the same time, they show us how universal our relationships are. In a scene from Ángela's rancho, she shells beans with one of her daughters. Each makes eye contact with the camera, and their expressions are suffused with love and its complex accompaniments: frustration, tolerance, pride.
There is a tendency, when we talk about older people in this society, to simplify and condescend — to reduce complicated, fully realized human beings to “cute" grandmas and grandpas. Videos of grandmothers cooking upend these notions subversively. Sure, there's your sweet little nonna making delicious food. But she's also racking up the views and the likes (so much for olds who don't know their way around computers), finally being rewarded in one way or another for all those years of uncompensated labor.
Perhaps the most satisfying viral video of them all features 86-year-old culinary grande dame and actress Madhur Jaffrey. Although she has written many seminal Indian cookbooks, this happens to be a music video, by hip-hop artist Mr. Cardamom. The song, “Nani," is a tribute to his maternal grandmother, played by Jaffrey. It does begin with her in the kitchen, getting chewed out by an ungrateful son. But before you know it, she's dropping F bombs, knocking all her supplements to the floor, applying red lipstick, and fanning herself with a wad of cash as she smokes a cigarette. “I'm the best damn Nani that you ever done seen," she snarls. Believe it. The video has more than 100,000 views.

Prospect of Impeachment Complicates Already-Complicated Path for Spending Bills

Texto completo: The uncertainty could further muddle the already fraught process of trying to prevent another government shutdown.
WASHINGTON -- When virtually all legislative activity ground to a halt during the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton in 1999, senators had already resolved the most pressing item on their agenda: fully funding the government.
But now, as the Senate reckons with the growing possibility of an impeachment trial of President Trump, lawmakers have yet to address 12 must-pass spending bills. None have reached the Senate floor, let alone the president's desk.
And the uncertainty of impeachment could further complicate the already fraught process of preventing another government shutdown, less than a year after the start of the last one, which devolved into the government's longest lapse in funding.
"It used to be that we frequently finished up the appropriations bills before the start of the fiscal year," Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine and one of the jurors during the 1999 trial, said in an interview. "That was the case that year."
"A potential impeachment trial gives added urgency to our making as much progress as possible on the appropriations bills," Ms. Collins added, "before we could be presented with the articles of impeachment."
With just a handful of legislative days before the current short-term spending bill expires, lawmakers have begun to discuss extending that funding into early 2020 to avoid running out of money later this year if senators are mired in an impeachment trial with little time for legislative work.
The uncertainty about impeachment has aggravated the existing disarray in the annual spending process. As they did last year, lawmakers have struggled to agree on how to fund the Trump administration's efforts to build a wall at the southwestern border. While they set overall funding levels in a budget deal earlier this year, lawmakers have yet to agree on how to divide that money among domestic programs.
"I would hope the senators accept the responsibility that they have to complete their work," said Representative Nita M. Lowey, Democrat of New York and the chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee. (The House passed 10 of the 12 bills earlier this year.)
Buoyed by their majority in the House, Democrats have resisted appropriating additional money for fencing at the border or allowing Mr. Trump the authority to transfer money to wall construction. They have also objected to replacing some of the military construction funds that were already diverted to the wall under the president's national emergency declaration. Republicans, for their part, have rejected such provisions in the spending bills as violations of the bipartisan budget agreement struck over the summer.
One Democrat, Senator Patty Murray of Washington, introduced separate legislation that would restrict the president from reallocating congressionally approved funds, though it is unlikely to reach the floor.
Most of the spending bills containing those provisions came out of the Senate Appropriations Committee on strictly partisan lines, and the White House has held firm that Mr. Trump is unwilling to accept anything less than the $ 5 billion he has requested for wall construction. (Democrats have said that such a demand is a nonstarter.)
The Senate is expected to vote in the coming days on bipartisan spending bills that would fund some domestic programs, considered to be a promising start by several lawmakers.
Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, on Monday urged his colleagues to move forward with procedural votes on defense funding, once some of the domestic bills had passed. But his Democratic counterpart, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, has previously objected to legislation that was not bipartisan, warning that "that's what the history of this chamber shows."
But even if the Senate approves the legislation, for any federal programs to be permanently funded, senators must reconcile their legislation with the House's version of the bills -- and secure Mr. Trump's signature.
"Barring a miracle of the first order up here, I don't see any way," Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama and chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said of the possibility that any of the spending legislation becomes law before Nov. 21. "Based on my experience here, I could see it going into late January, February. Might not. I hope it won't."
Standing in the Capitol late last week, he waved his hand in the direction of the House chamber. "We have things coming from the House, looming on the horizon. That's going to take time in the Senate."
There is little doubt that the process of funding the government will require another temporary salve when the current stopgap spending bill expires on Nov. 21. Lawmakers widely agree that they must avoid another gap in spending after enduring 35 days of a partial shutdown earlier this year. What remains unknown is what, if any, bills can become law before the Nov. 21 deadline.
"Fundamentally, it's a political problem," said Molly Reynolds, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution. "You have Congress's perpetual difficulty in completing the appropriations process on time and this year, it has run headlong into this confrontation involving impeachment."
While lawmakers' reliance on short-term spending bills has become more routine in recent years to help them avoid lapses in federal funding, some have objected to such bills that extend funding for months at a time, as opposed to a couple of weeks. While such legislation avoids the most destructive outcome -- a lapse in funding, with thousands of federal workers going without pay -- it in effect negates increases in spending that lawmakers negotiated earlier this year and makes it difficult for federal agencies to invest in long-term planning.
"There's not a company that could operate where you say, O.K., we're gonna operate for awhile, then just think about it and take a rest, then work some more," Representative Kay Granger of Texas, the top Republican on the House Appropriations Committee, told reporters earlier this month during a discussion about defense funding. "Congress gets in the habit of doing something like that, and it's incredibly harmful."
Ms. Granger, like other lawmakers on the appropriations committees, acknowledged that a short-term bill would be preferable to a shutdown, and lawmakers have said they remain focused on converting as many of the dozen must-pass bills into law as possible before Thanksgiving, in an effort to pre-empt any impeachment trial.
But a stopgap spending bill that expires after an impeachment trial would also test the negotiating power of a divided government after what is likely to be a bitter partisan feud over the allegations that Mr. Trump abused his power to pressure Ukraine to open investigations that could benefit him politically.
"To the extent that the appropriations committee has remained and continues to remain a bastion of bipartisanship," Ms. Reynolds of the Brookings Institution said, "the question of whether the appropriators themselves could come to an agreement is less of an issue than it is for the broader chamber, or even the White House."

Texto completo: It's not easy to turn your back on political comrades.
I'm often incredulous at Republican servility to Donald Trump. I've struggled to understand how people who've spent a lifetime chest-beating about patriotism can be so willing to burn liberal democracy to the ground to protect a man they wouldn't trust to sell them a used car. So I've tried to envision a situation in which I might be tempted to do the same.
There's no left-wing analogue to Trump in American life, but it's possible to imagine such a figure. Picture an amalgam of Marianne Williamson and Hugo Chávez, a charismatic ideologue able to speak to the spiritual hunger of lonely, atomized masses. She enters the Democratic primary to elite mockery, but her rallies are huge and rapturous, and she holds crowds spellbound promising to cleanse America of its demonic legacy of racism and sexism. Her pronouncements are at once shocking and thrilling. She pledges to expropriate investment banks and to turn Mar-a-Lago into a homeless shelter.
At first Democrats freak out -- her movement seems like a cult -- but she wins the primary, and then the presidency, perhaps with an assist from China. Then she sets about trying to make progressive dreams come true. Stacey Abrams becomes attorney general. Larry Krasner, Philadelphia's district attorney and an icon of criminal justice reform, replaces Clarence Thomas on the Supreme Court. Declaring a national health emergency, the president takes $ 3.6 billion from the military and gives it to Planned Parenthood. She orders the government not to do business with any company that advertises on Fox News.
It's obvious to all but true believers that the president is unhinged; there's an increasingly messianic, Jim Jones quality to the revival-like rallies she presides over. She spends a third of her time at her network of wellness centers, bringing much of the government with her and putting tens of millions of dollars into her family's company. Conservatives scream that she's a self-dealing demagogue. Deep down, liberals agree, but they love her appointments and don't want to be tarred as privileged reactionaries. When the president announces a plan to unilaterally naturalize every DACA recipient, what progressive wants to be the one carping about executive overreach?
I like to hope that in this (admittedly absurd) scenario I would still speak up against corruption and for the rule of law, but I don't think it would be easy. That's one reason I've come to believe that anti-Trump Republicans -- the people Trump called "human scum" last week -- deserve more credit than the left typically gives them.
[ Listen to "The Argument" podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt. ]
In recent days, as Senator Mitt Romney of Utah has staked out a lonely role as Trump's most prominent Republican critic, many progressives have rolled their eyes. He's been widely mocked for the once-secret Twitter account he kept under the pseudonym Pierre Delecto, which he used to like anti-Trump tweets that he'd probably never endorse publicly. Democrats, said a recent NBC News report, "tend to dismiss Romney as ineffectual because he has stopped short of calling for Trump's impeachment and removal from office."
Former Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, who gave up his political career to speak out against Trump, was similarly dismissed. Even ex-Republicans who do call for Trump's impeachment and removal are regularly pilloried on the left.
I agree with progressives who argue that Trump is the apotheosis of the modern Republican Party, not a departure from it. Everyone who helped build that party bears some responsibility for him. But apostate conservatives also deserve admiration for the sacrifices they're making. It must be painful to have the movement that's defined your life turn against you.
"You're giving up personal relationships, which are some of the most important things psychologically for any human being," said Jerry Taylor, the president of the center-right Niskanen Center, who holds regular meetings of anti-Trump Republicans. "If you spend decades of your life circulating with a certain group of friends and colleagues and associates and business partners and political allies," it's no small thing to break with them.
Take George Conway, the conservative lawyer and impeachment supporter married to top Trump aide Kellyanne Conway. Obviously, I'd split with my beloved husband in a second if he backed Trump. But if he worked for a lunatic whose policies I liked? I'd find it a lot harder to publicly distance myself.
"You have to find entirely new social networks in your life," said Taylor. "That in a sense is probably the biggest obstacle for a lot of people."
Those of us who regard Trump as an existential threat to the Republic should try to make it easier for wavering conservatives to make the leap. I don't mean we should nominate a bland centrist for president, just that we should recognize when people show courage, even if we wished they'd show more.
Last week, I interviewed the Harvard professor Erica Chenoweth, an expert on nonviolent social movements, about whether mass protests could create momentum for impeachment. One key, she said, was attracting defectors. "It's basically a process where people who would be surprising allies of these calls for impeachment start to appear visibly in support of it," she said. "That usually indicates that the status quo supporters are starting to shift their sense of what their own interests are." People like Romney shouldn't be jeered for their inner Pierre Delectos. They should be urged to set them free.

Texto completo: Army expert who heard
Trump's demand will
testify to investigators
An Army officer assigned to the White House plans to tell House impeachment investigators on Tuesday that he was disturbed by President Trump's demand that Ukraine investigate one of his political rivals and feared it would undermine U.S. national security.
Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, a top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council, was part of a small group of White House officials assigned to listen in on Trump's July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. His testimony returns repeatedly to his fears that Trump's manipulation of Ukraine policy to discredit his political rival, former vice president Joe Biden, is unethical and damaging to U.S. national security.
"I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government's support of Ukraine," Vindman intends to tell lawmakers, according to a draft of his opening statement.
Vindman is the first White House official to testify who listened to Trump's controversial call, which was exposed by a government whistleblower and triggered a historic impeachment inquiry. His prepared statement, first reported by the New York Times, bolsters previous testimony by Fiona Hill, his former boss at the National Security Council, and William B. Taylor Jr., the acting ambassador to Ukraine.
Vindman's testimony follows House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's (D-Calif.) call for a vote later this week authorizing the impeachment inquiry. Pelosi's move came in response to Republican criticism that the Democrats' activities to date amount to a partisan hit job and have denied the president due process.
In his statement Vindman repeatedly insists he has no partisan bias and asserts that he is motivated by loyalty to the Constitution and the country. Vindman and his family fled the Soviet Union was he was 3, and he describes himself as both an immigrant and a patriot.
"It is my sacred duty and honor to advance and defend OUR country, irrespective of party or politics," his prepared statement reads.
Vindman was assigned to the White House in July 2018 after a tour in the Pentagon, where he writes that he authored the U.S. military's principal strategy for managing competition with Russia.
In his statement Vindman states that he has never had direct contact or communication with the president. He also notes that he is not the whistleblower whose complaint helped spark the impeachment inquiry .
"I do not know who the whistleblower is and I would not feel comfortable to speculate," his statement reads.
Despite his remove from the White House, Vindman became deeply concerned about the way the president and some of his top advisers were manipulating Ukraine policy to discredit Biden, a possible challenger in the 2020 election.
Vindman states that Trump's initial call with the new Ukrainian president, made after Zelensky's April election, was positive.
"President Trump expressed his desire to work with President Zelensky and extended an invitation to the White House," the statement reads. Vindman notes that the Ukrainians saw the meeting with Trump as "critical" to solidifying American support in the face of Russian aggression.
But within weeks of that initial promise, he grew worried that the policy was being hijacked by partisan politics.
"In the Spring of 2019, I became aware of outside influencers promoting a false narrative of Ukraine," his statement reads. "This alternative narrative undermined U.S. efforts to expand cooperation with Ukraine."
Vindman cites a July 10 meeting in which Gordon Sondland, a major Trump donor and ambassador to the European Union, emphasized that to secure a meeting with Trump, the Ukrainians would have to "deliver investigations into the 2016 election, the Bidens and Burisma," a Ukrainian natural gas company that had controversially tapped Biden's son to serve on its board.
"I stated to Amb. Sondland that his statements were inappropriate, that the request to investigate Biden and his son had nothing to do with national security, and that such investigations were not something the National Security Council was going to get involved with or push," his statements reads.
Following the briefing, Vindman reported his concerns to the National Security Council's top lawyer. Vindman's statement notes that an investigation into the Bidens and Burisma would likely inject Ukraine's new president into U.S. politics and cause the struggling democracy to lose bipartisan support in Congress.
"This would undermine U.S. national security," Vindman writes.
Vindman's most direct contact with Trump came in the form of preparing documents for the president to sign regarding Ukraine.
At the direction of his superiors at the NSC, including John Bolton, then the national security adviser, Vindman drafted a memorandum in mid-August that sought to restart $391 million in security aid that was being withheld from Ukraine, according to the Times report. But Trump refused to sign it. He also drafted a letter in May congratulating Zelensky on his inauguration that Trump declined to sign, according to the Times.
In his testimony Vindman, like others who have preceded him in the impeachment hearings, emphasizes the importance of Ukraine to the security of the United States. "A strong and independent Ukraine is critical to U.S. national security interests because Ukraine is a front-line state and bulwark against Russian aggression," he writes.

Texto completo: DARIEN — Holding signs reading, “Save Scott Hapgood” and “Justice for Scott,” family and friends joined local and federal officials Monday calling for the UBS trader’s safety.
Hapgood, 44, charged with manslaughter in the death of a hotel worker while he was vacationing with his family last spring in Anguilla, is supposed to return to the Caribbean island on Nov. 11 for his next court appearance.
But many say his safety is at risk.
“As a parent of five children myself, I know, we all know, that Scott did what any parent would do … protect his children from a highly intoxicated and crazed man,” Darien First Selectman Jayme Stevenson said during the rally outside town hall.
“We are here today to stand with the Hapgood family as a community and to ask for transparency, fairness in the judicial process and safe passage for Scott as he travels back to Anguilla in two weeks.”

Autopsy: Cocaine could have killed hotel worker in Scott Hapgood case
An emotional Hapgood thanked the gathering of about 100 who attended the rally for their support.
“As incredibly difficult as this has been, on days like this, I am reminded how much support we have from friends, family and the community,” he said. “The community support gives my family strength.
“We are still in shock that a simple vacation we had been looking forward to turned into a nightmare.”
As Hapgood described how his life has changed since April, his voice broke with emotion.
“I’ve not been allowed to work — not return to the job I’ve had for 20 years. I’ve been disqualified from coaching my kids’ teams — that gave me purpose,” he said.
Hapgood said he hopes with a “fair and balanced review of the facts” the charges against him should be dismissed.
The Hapgood family has said the Darien man was defending himself and his young children after hotel worker Kenny Mitchel came to their room to fix a bathroom sink while they were on vacation in April.
Hapgood contended the sink was never broken and no one called for someone to come to their room, but he trusted Mitchel because he was wearing a hotel uniform.
A revised autopsy report, based on new toxicology tests, determined Mitchel died from a lethal dose of cocaine and not from injuries he sustained in the fight, according to a recent story by The New York Times.
The report described cocaine levels in Mitchel’s bloodstream “twice that commonly accepted to have a fatal outcome,” causing his lungs to fill with blood and suffocating him.
The revised report supports the defense’s claim Mitchel was allegedly behaving erratically and aggressively — common side effects for that level of drug use.
Sen. Richard Blumenthal described what happened to the Hapgood family as “every American’s worst nightmare.”
“We live in a great country that guarantees fairness and transparency — an American abroad should receive no less,” he said Monday.
Blumenthal said since the incident he has been working with the State Department and officials in Anguilla as well as the United Kingdom.
“This has nothing to do with politics and nothing to do with partisan politics. Whatever our differences, we stand behind the Hapgood family,” he said.
Blumenthal expressed concerns with Anguilla’s legal process — including closed-door meetings, a delay on evidence such as the updated toxicology report, and the lack of a guarantee for Scott Hapgood’s security.
“We’re here today to stand in support of Scott Hapgood, and ask for fairness and transparency in this process,” Blumenthal said. “We want fair and transparent proceedings and safety for Scott Hapgood as he goes through those proceedings.”
“We are going to be sparing no efforts to ensure Scott Hapgood is given his basic rights,” he said.
State Sen. Carlo Leone, D-27th, said a family vacation should result in good times and positive memories — and a safe return — and “not the stories we are now living.”
“We have to remain together as a community — it applies the pressure on Anguilla and the British Parliament to stand with us and make sure the rule of law stands,” he said.
State Rep. Terrie Wood, R-141st, said she has known Hapgood for many years in also calling for his “safe passage and a fair and transparent process.”
“I’ve watched Scott grow up, and by virtue of the people here, it is clear the impact that he has made on this community,” she said.
As Hapgood’s November court date approaches, his family and friends have been circulating a petition and reaching out to local and federal officials for help. The petition created by Sarah Stabile seeks 6,500 signatures to support Hapgood, and persuade officials “to intervene on Scott’s behalf.” A goal of the effort is to enable Hapgood to participate in the trial from the United States for his safety.
Darien Police officials said the Hapgood family has experienced “offensive” behavior directed toward them, but those actions have not been criminal.
“We’ll continue to work with the family on a case-by-case basis during this challenging time for them,” Capt. Jeremiah Marron said.
Hapgood’s story was featured this month on Fox & Friends and President Donald Trump tweeted afterward that he would look into the case.
“Will be looking into the Scott Hapgood case, and the Island of Anguilla,” Trump tweeted. “Something looks and sounds very wrong. I know Anguilla will want to see this case be properly and justly resolved!”

Texto completo: BRUNSWICK -- Longtime Maine artist John Bisbee is leaving the state for a temporary job in New Jersey, where he's been hired to introduce art into a massive eco-friendly redevelopment of a gritty industrial site where 35,000 workers once built warships for the U.S. Navy.
Bisbee, 54, is taking a dozen studio assistants and former students from Bowdoin College with him to begin making art for the 130-acre site in the Newark suburb of Kearny. They will work with other artists across disciplines and from other parts of the country to convert one warehouse into an arts center and inject contemporary art into the entire Kearny Point project. "We have a very simple command, and that's to activate it and start to create and invent an arts program down there with a long-term vision for a world-class arts center," Bisbee said.
Real estate developer, environmentalist and social justice advocate Wendy Neu is leading the $1 billion adaptive reuse project on the Hackensack River. She is the chief executive officer of the New York City-based Hugo Neu Corp., which specializes in recycling. She is related to Bisbee - he is her sister's brother-in-law - and a fan and collector of his art. "My late husband was a great admirer of John's work," Neu said. "To have John come here speaks volumes to what we are trying to do."
Bisbee, who taught at Bowdoin until four years ago, sculpts with an industrial aesthetic. He welds and forges exclusively with nails. He lives and works in Brunswick, with studios at Fort Andross Mill. He is not giving up his studio in Brunswick and expects to be in New Jersey at least six months. He and his collaborators will leave Brunswick this week.
Among the artists going with him is his partner, painter Emilie Stark-Menneg.
"I am pumped because I love adventure and this seems like a big adventure," she said. "I am also pumped for the possibility to collaborate and the conversations we will be able to have in that type of space. This will be a chance to take bigger risks."
Neu began the Kearny Point project in 2014, two years after Superstorm Sandy inundated the site. Neu razed some structures, rehabbed others and removed industrial waste. Her goal is to create a mixed-use industrial park that's in tune with climate change and the evolving economy, with space for start-ups, small-scale offices and flexible rental terms, as well as retail, restaurants and green space, all designed around effective flood control.
It's not a traditional industrial park. She calls it an "environmental and social justice collider" and "a model for sustainable urban resilience." She wants it to become an economic driver "for people who have been marginalized and left behind." She favors clean, green businesses that are in sync with her progressive philosophies.
She asked Bisbee and his team to relocate there to help articulate and embody those ideals.
"Artists have vision. We need vision. We need to see ourselves and what we can become," Neu said. "We are trying to do something very different and create a model that will be an example to folks who are concerned about these issues and how our world can look going forward. Artists are important to communicate that message and educate people. They create interest and a sense of discovery."
One building on the site, a 160,000-square-foot behemoth known as Building 78, has about 175 tenants. Another, Building 197 with 150,000 square feet, will open next year. Hugo Neu spent a combined $56 million on the two buildings, according to reporting in The New York Times.
Bisbee's project is tiny in comparison, though massive on its own. He and his team will work in Building 44C, which has about 79,000 square feet and 50-foot ceilings. He said Neu has committed $1.8 million to the art component through early 2020, and all the artists involved will be paid a stipend and live rent-free. Neu declined to discuss her financial arrangements with the artists or her investment.
Their work will involve making sculpture and other art for the site, working with architects and introducing art and design principles to the community. Bisbee called it "a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and truly a gift from the gods. We're going into this thing not as a corporate journey, but an ethical journey. We're going down there, walking into an empty space, setting up and begin making art."
Bisbee is calling his project Gardenship, in reference to New Jersey's nickname - the Garden State - and the site's former use as a shipyard. The Federal Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Co. made aircraft carriers and other ships for the U.S. Navy on the site, turning out a finished ship weekly during World War II.
Bisbee thinks the association of his work with American industry influenced Neu's invitation. "It's important that the shipyard maintain its roots as a place of heavy industry. She wants an iron foundry, a fabrication shop. There will be lots of steel going on," he said.
Bisbee has experience as an incubator and collaborator. In addition to teaching sculpture at Bowdoin, he worked closely with philanthropist Roxanne Quimby to establish an artist colony and served as art director of the Bonnaroo Music & Arts Festival in Tennessee, where he marshaled teams of artists to create temporary public art projects.
Suzette McAvoy, executive director and chief curator of the Center for Maine Contemporary Art in Rockland, said this project represents "an amazing new opportunity" for Maine artists.
"The scale is enormous, and I'm very excited to see it take fruition from a dream to a reality," she wrote in an email. "There's a long tradition of artistic exchange between the greater New York metropolitan area and Maine, and this project adds an inspiring new chapter."
CMCA hosted Bisbee's "American Steel" exhibition last year.
Richard Keen, a Bisbee friend with a studio at Fort Andross, likes the idea of Maine artists going to New York to make a mark, instead of the other way around.
"For years, there's been this dialogue between New York and Maine, and that seemingly has always been from New York to Maine. This is a broadening of that conversation," Keen said. "I'm really glad they're going, but their presence will be sorely missed."
Nearly all the artists going with Bisbee are either former students or assistants. Several are involved with the artist-run coop New Systems Exhibitions on Parris Street in Portland.
"It's a unique chance for us to step out of Portland and Maine to make art," said artist Cody Stack, one of the artists involved with New Systems Exhibitions. "To have a way to do that in a place like New York is pretty cool."
Tom Ryan said he appreciates that artists are being involved in the early stages of the project and that their voices are valued.
"We have a chance to experiment and prove what art brings to the table, in terms of a piece of the structure and not just the cherry on top," he said. "We're trying to see what it means to have art be part of a commercial and industrial space, and not just a decoration."
Jim Larson likes that he is getting paid upfront and that opportunities are being given to young artists. Elijah Ober appreciates the chance to "cross-pollinate" with other artists, some of whom, like Bisbee and Stark-Menneg, are established in their careers.
"Most of our group is emerging artists and early-career artists," Ober said. "It's cool to break down a certain career divide and work together with artists at different stages of their career."
Dominique Lueckenhoff, senior vice president of corporate affairs and sustainability for Hugo Neu, said it was important to bring in artists from different parts of the country into the project, for different perspectives.
"They are coming from Maine and from a different landscape and environment than this post-industrial corridor that we are in. We're interested in how they see it and how they appreciate what we are trying to do," she said.
What they will find, she added, is a large, historic Brownfield site that now represents the next generation of green redevelopment - and is home to at least one pair of nesting eagles.
"It flies in the face of those who believe this corridor should look like devastation," she said. "We see this as a model not only for New Jersey but a global model. We call ourselves ground zero for net zero."

Texto completo: In a shareholder letter last week, Netflix touted some recent programming wins. The streaming service announced that 64 million accounts had watched the new season of "Stranger Things" within four weeks of release, while 32 million had checked out "Unbelievable," a powerful drama about a rape investigation, during the same time frame.
For a company that guards its viewership data like Donald Trump does his tax returns, these morsels were tantalizing. Using the tidbits Netflix has been including in shareholder letters since January, the New York Times and Bloomberg compiled lists of the most popular Netflix titles, and the Guardian offered an analysis of "what works and what doesn't" for the streamer.
"Stranger Things" led the pack as the most-watched TV show -- hardly a shocker -- but some of the findings were more eye-opening. According to Netflix, some of the most popular shows on the service include the comic book adaptation "The Umbrella Academy" (45 million) and the Spanish-language crime drama "Money Heist" (44 million).

The irresistible temptation is to compare these figures to Nielsen ratings, which would make "Stranger Things," with its audi- ence of 64 million, just about the most popular scripted show on TV since the finale of "Friends."
Yes, Netflix is sharing more information about how many people are watching its shows than it did just a year ago, and we now have a broad sense of which shows and movies are especially popular with its subscribers. But there's plenty of reason to avoid these apples-to-oranges comparisons and take this data with a grain -- make that a heaping scoop -- of salt.
To start with, not even Netflix is claiming these "top 10 lists" are definitive. A representative for the company said the shareholder letters include select highlights but are not intended as "a comprehensive list of the most-watched titles." Unlike Nielsen, which measures the U.S. only, Netflix is available in 190 countries.
Netflix also counts anyone who's watched 70% of a single episode as a viewer, meaning if you watched the first 45 minutes of the first episode of "Umbrella Academy" and then turned it off, you'd be included as a viewer. This would be like ABC reporting on the premiere ratings for the first Roseanne Barr-less episode of "The Conners," then never mentioning how many people tuned in the next week. A far more useful metric would be average per-episode audience.
But these cherry-picked figures allow Netflix to boast about its most obvious successes without putting them in any kind of useful context. Clearly, a lot of people are watching "Stranger Things." But how much of an outlier is it? The numbers shed virtually no light on how many people, on average, are watching hundreds of other shows on the service, from critical darlings like "Russian Doll" to oddball cult favorites like the recently canceled "The OA."
Netflix shares viewership information only about originals, not about the many very popular shows in its back catalog. That's understandable. Especially as it faces a whole bunch of competitors, the company probably doesn't want to advertise the enduring popu- larity of licensed titles that will soon be going to rival streaming services, like "The Office" and "Friends." (Netflix said its "true" top 10 list consists of originals.)
Unlike old-fashioned linear networks, which have to rely on the far-from-perfect Nielsen ratings system -- a guesstimate based on a narrow sample audience -- Netflix has access to an arguably alarming amount of data about what sub- scribers are watching.
Netflix knows much more than whether you watched the latest season of "Stranger Things." If you finished all eight episodes, it knows how long it took you to get through them. If you didn't, it knows when you called it quits. It knows what devices you watched on and whether you skipped the credits. It knows your entire, possibly embarrassing viewing history, including how many times you, say, watched "A Christmas Prince" when you had the flu last winter.
Based on that, Netflix knows which thumbnail image is most likely to get you to watch another title. It knows your email address and where you live. Who knows? Before long, it may know your rising sign, your resting heart rate and which flavor ice cream you're going to eat during your next binge-watching session. It uses this data to decide not only which shows get canceled or renewed but also which shows get a green light in the first place. As digital rights expert Mi- chael Veale revealed this year, Netflix even tracked the choices made by viewers who watched the interactive film "Black Mirror: Bandersnatch."
So when a company that has a borderline unsettling amount of information shares vague numbers that sound good but are presented in a contextual vacuum, we should all practice some healthy skepticism.

A View Of The Future On A Brooklyn Rooftop Meadow

Texto completo: NEW YORK - Tall grasses glow in the afternoon sunlight. The last bees and butterflies of the season hover over goldenrod and asters. Silver orbs that look like alien spacecraft shimmer nearby.
The wild-looking meadow is not in a rural outpost but sandwiched between a sewage plant - the orbs are the tanks - and a parking lot packed with tractor-trailers. The plants perch on the roof of a film studio in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn, beside a Superfund toxic-waste site.
As bird and insect populations plummet, sounding new alarms about the health of the natural world, one promising arena where humans can help is also a surprising one: cities. In New York, scientists and officials are calling for residents and companies to do their part, with projects as ambitious as the rooftop meadow and as simple as choosing native plants for home window boxes.
For some species, scientists say, cities can be more hospitable than rural and suburban areas because fewer lawns and farms mean fewer pesticides. The green roof in Brooklyn, Kingsland Wildflowers at Broadway Stages, draws endangered monarch butterflies, a panoply of birds and wild bees that are native to New York City but threatened by what scientists have called an “insect apocalypse.”
Measures to help wildlife survive in, and migrate through, cities overlap with those needed to protect people from the effect of climate change and the related flooding.
Green roofs like the one in Greenpoint, for instance, are expected to multiply under a city law that is set to take effect next month and will require new buildings to be topped with green spaces or solar panels. Either measure can help reduce carbon emissions and rising temperatures; green roofs also reduce stormwater runoff. The 730 green roofs in New York cover just 60 of the city’s 40,000 rooftop acres, according to the Green Roof Researchers Alliance.
“Cities have so much potential for creating natural habitats,” said Alixandra Prybyla, science director for the Honeybee Conservancy, a group that is expanding its activities to include the protection of wild bees.
There are 2.9 billion fewer birds in the United States and Canada than there were 50 years ago. Over 20 years, America’s monarch butterfly population has declined 90%, and the number of bumblebees has dropped nearly as much. The declines could be a harbinger of broader ecological collapse, and the disappearance of pollinating creatures threatens the food supply.
But in the same way that “wildlife corridors” created by countries like Indonesia and India have helped protect large animals like tigers, smaller spaces in cities can be corridors and archipelagoes of green space for birds and insects.
Much of New York City’s potential in this regard remains untapped, experts say. But the law taking effect next month could change that.
With it, New York will join cities like Chicago, Denver and San Francisco, which use requirements or tax incentives to promote the development of green roofs. New York state also recently increased the value of the tax abatements it offers for such roofs in some city neighborhoods.
Real estate groups argue that requiring green roofs is too expensive and burdensome for property owners. The solution that environmental activists consider ideal - charging properties for the amount of stormwater runoff they produce and creating incentives for installing green roofs to reduce such runoff - is often called a “rain tax” by opponents.
New Yorkers often think of animals in the city as out of place, if not nuisances, like the swarm of bees that divebombed Times Square in summer 2018. People also tend to view cityscapes mainly as obstacles for wild species, like the birds that get stuck circling the Sept. 11 tribute lights.
But many animals thrive in urban settings, adapting to them over generations, or using them creatively, like Prybyla’s favorite, a hive of honeybees that started producing red honey. It turned out that the bees had discovered vats of red syrup in a maraschino cherry factory in Brooklyn’s Red Hook neighborhood.
“We want to challenge what people think belongs in an urban ecosystem,” said Guillermo Fernandez, the Honeybee Conservancy’s executive director. “People think only the hardiest rat or pigeon could live in our city, but then we start hearing about hawks and even sometimes deer and coyotes roaming through.”
The Greenpoint project can have a calming effect on humans, too. School visits, community science projects and parties regularly bring workers and residents to the roofs.

Cronyism allegations fly in gov. race

Texto completo: Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves and Attorney General Jim Hood have adopted similar messages as they fight to become Mississippi's next governor: The other guy is unethical or has conflicts of interest. Vote for me instead.
But they may cancel each other out. Both Hood, a Democrat, and Reeves, a Republican, have long faced criticism over their actions surrounding campaign finance, state contracts and pet projects.
Most recently, the candidates traded attacks about a frontage road, a television ad and lucrative state contracts for trial lawyers. And in most cases, their claims are accurate.
What does Jim Hood say? The latest barrage of allegations came last week, as Hood hammered Reeves for filming part of a public education commercial at the private New Summit School in Jackson.
The ad promotes a Reeves plan to increase public teacher pay by about $4,000. Hood also proposes raising teacher pay, and says due to inflation teachers make less now than when Reeves entered office.
"This makes my blood boil," Hood said at a news conference. "You know, for somebody who hasn't done anything for public education for the past eight years to go to a private school talking about public education and teacher pay — he's not funded public education or given teachers raises."
Hood criticized the lieutenant governor for accepting campaign contributions from top people at the New Summit, and for steering more than $1 million in state funds to a company affiliated with the school. At a debate last week, Reeves pointed out Hood also received some campaign funds from the school's leaders.
"Everything is transactional with him," Hood said, calling for Reeves to pull the "phony" ad down.
Then Hood released his own ad going after Reeves's proposals, saying they were "last-minute promises on education."
A day later, Hood doubled down on his transactional description of Reeves at a state Capitol news conference.
"It's time for us to throw the money changer out of the temple — I'm talking about Tate Reeves," Hood said, calling out Reeves's campaign donors and what he claimed was their influence on several pieces of legislation in the Senate. "We've got to drain this swamp over here ... He's been transactional. Every bill he's passed, it's been to get campaign contributions back."
Government transparency and campaign finance reform are a central theme of Hood's campaign.
The Legislature should be subject to open records laws, he has said, and gifts to legislators banned. He's also advocated for outlawing campaign contributions during the legislative session, and banning corporate contributions.
What does Tate Reeves say? Reeves has a simple rebuttal to Hood's attacks: trial lawyers own Jim Hood.
In recent days the Reeves campaign pointed to a 2009 Wall Street Journal editorial, which describes Hood's practice of outsourcing major state cases to private lawyers, who earn a hefty cut of any settlement.
The ethical problem, the editorial explained, is that these legal firms are "only too happy to return the favor to Mr. Hood via campaign contributions." It found 27 firms that had worked with the AG who gave a total of $543,000 to Hood's campaign over two election cycles.
And other campaign donations from trial lawyers to Hood were effectively routed through the Democratic Attorneys General Association, the editorial claims.
A 2014 New York Times analysis of trial lawyer-attorney general relationships nationwide found Hood accepted nearly $400,000 from trial law firms over the prior decade, more than any other AG.
One senior partner at a Houston firm gave $125,000 to Hood's campaign after the firm filed suit for Mississippi against drug company Eli Lilly, the report said. In another prominent case, a Louisiana firm and Mississippi attorney Joey Langston, a Hood contributor, received $14 million in legal fees after Hood hired them for a state lawsuit.
Langston later served jail time for conspiring to bribe a judge in another case.
"The business community in Mississippi is scared to death of having a trial lawyer as governor," Reeves said at their first debate, arguing that's why he's been so successful raising money for his own campaign. Reeves also release a TV ad about Hood's relationship with trial lawyers.
The practice continues. Mississippi has paid out more than $115 million in attorney fees to private firms since 2009 for help with big cases, according to state records. And prominent lawyers still cut Hood's gubernatorial campaign some of its largest campaign checks.
Still, Hood often points to massive settlement payouts these high-profile AG cases bring back into Mississippi's coffers. The Times story found Hood's office won $400 million for the state thanks to lawsuits filed with private attorneys.
What other issues have they faced? The ethics back-and-forth began when Hood attacked Reeves earlier this year over a now-halted frontage road designed to connect Reeves's gated Flowood neighborhood to a nearby shopping center.
A 2018 Clarion Ledger investigation found the road project was fast-tracked because of political pressure, and Hood pledged to look into the matter.
But then Hood continued investigating Reeves over the road even as their gubernatorial race heated up this summer — more than a year after the probe began. Hood said he even wrote the investigative report himself.
This prompted sharp criticism from the Reeves campaign, saying Hood's direct involvement was "beyond a conflict of interest" and "abuse of power."
The candidates lobbed attacks about the road during their first debate earlier this month. And both launched TV ads about it.
"The fact is, the emails were there, the evidence is there," Hood said. "He went after a state agency to build a road from his gated subdivision."
Reeves fired back: "The attorney general abused his office investigating his political opponent and everybody knows it."
Early this year, Reeves also faced ethical questions when he quietly helped tuck language into a budget bill to fund a $2 million private school education program, which sends children with special needs to private schools.
Lawmakers were surprised when they discovered the last-minute budget line item. The organization Empower Mississippi pushed for the funding — and had donated $45,000 to Reeves since 2015.
In 2004, not long after Hood took office, he criticized certain types of political donations and issued a stern warning that he would prosecute those who sidestep Mississippi's campaign finance laws.
He said companies and others should not be able to funnel their political donations to candidates through political action committees, labeling the practice "money laundering."
But it turned out Hood himself benefited from such donations. Two Mississippi law firms gave the Democratic Attorney General Association a combined $150,000 one day in 2003. The next day, DAGA reported, it cut a $150,000 check for Hood.

Texto completo: I was a 20-year-old journalism intern looking through some ancient newspaper files from the turn of the century when I found out that I had the look of a murderer.
The Western Pennsylvania county served by the newspaper where I interned was home to a massive steel mill. While researching an article about the origins of one of the company towns in the area I came across an old newspaper account of a murder trial. The victim was from a patrician family. The accused killer was an Italian immigrant.
A local reporter covering the trial pounded out his dispatches with a sneer. When the Italian-speaking defendant was hauled into court in chains, the writer described him as having "the swarthy Mediterranean look of a murderer."
In other words, he looked like me.
I thought about that a few weeks back, on Columbus Day.
I'm not sure how many of my Italian-American fratelli e sorelle (brothers and sisters) fell for Donald Trump's sappy remarks that day, but I'm hoping they recognized this wasn't a president expressing affection for an ancient explorer or for Italians or for Italian-Americans.
"To me it will always be called Columbus Day," Trump said. "Some people don't like that — I do."
This was Trump's ongoing effort to make white Americans feel as if they are an oppressed class in order to ratchet up the country's racial and ethnic divide in the hopes of using it to win reelection. This time he used Italian-Americans because, these days, we qualify as white.
That wasn't always the case.
The New York Times on Oct. 13 ran a historically sobering article by Brent Staples under the headline "How Italians became white."
It didn't happen that long ago, actually.
My four Italian grandparents, for example, who immigrated to the United States during the first two decades of the last century, would not, strictly speaking, have been thought of as "white." Not as we imagine that description today, anyway.
Italians were among the first immigrant groups to reach the U.S. after the Civil War, and many took the jobs being abandoned by freed blacks in the South.
In Staples' article he wrote:
"Few who march in Columbus Day parades or recount the tale of Columbus's voyage from Europe to the New World are aware of how the holiday came about or that President Benjamin Harrison proclaimed it as a one-time national celebration in 1892 — in the wake of a bloody New Orleans lynching that took the lives of 11 Italian immigrants. The proclamation was part of a broader attempt to quiet outrage among Italian-Americans, and a diplomatic blowup over the murders that brought Italy and the United States to the brink of war."
Those murders in New Orleans remain the largest mass lynching in our history.
It wasn't the only time it happened.
In 1899 five Italian immigrants, two of them store owners, were lynched in Tallulah, La, in part because they had offended white men in town by not waiting on white customers before those who were black.
It goes on.
In 1907 the United States Immigration Commission was established. It's often called the Dillingham Commission. In its 1911 report the commission stated: "Certain kinds of criminality are inherent in the Italian race. In the popular mind, crimes of personal violence, robbery, blackmail and extortion are peculiar to the people of Italy."
Sounds a little like what Trump said about Mexicans when he announced his campaign, doesn't it?
The Immigration Act of 1924 later codified a lot of the prejudices against Italians (and others) into law. After the law passed immigration from Italy went from about 200,000 a year to about 6,000.
Sounds a little like the treatment other ethnic groups are receiving from the Trump administration, doesn't it?
As for the restrictions imposed in 1924, they weren't lifted until the 1960s. Families suffered. The country suffered. Imagine the potential lost.
Columbus Day is a good thing in that it helped bring Italian-Americans into the mainstream. Using Columbus Day to pit one ethnic group against another does just the opposite.

Texto completo: Actor and best-selling author John Lithgow skewers President Donald Trump in “Dumpty," his new collection of satirical verse. Inspired by A.A. Milne, Lewis Carroll and even Rodgers and Hammerstein, Lithgow's rhymes chronicle the president's first two tumultuous years in office. Lithgow's long acting career has included starring in the hit television series “Third Rock from the Sun" and portraying Winston Churchill in the Netflix hit “The Crown."
BOOKS: What are you reading currently?
LITHGOW: Just two days ago I finished “She Said: Breaking the Sexual Harassment Story That Helped Ignite a Movement" by the New York Times reporters Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, which was just fabulous. Now I'm reading a wonderful book by the English actor Stephen Fry called “Mythos." He tells all the stories of Greek mythology in this zippy, sassy, popular culture way. I've never been able to keep track of all those gods, titans and mortals born of gods, so I plunged right in.
BOOKS: What was your last best read?
LITHGOW: Anne Patchett's new book, “The Dutch House."I wrote her a fan e-mail after I read “Commonwealth" and we became email friends. She sends me books that she recommends. I've discovered some wonderful writers through her, such as Maile Meloy. Anne sent me her story collection “Both Ways is the Only Way I Want It," which is just sensational. She also sent me a wonderful book of stories by Kevin Wilson, “Baby, You're Gonna Be Mine." He's got the greatest voice.
BOOKS: Do you lean more toward fiction or nonfiction?
LITHGOW: Definitely fiction. I read about 80% women novelists. I don't know why that would be. Jane Smiley, Anne Tyler, and Elizabeth Strout. I've read a few books by all those women. My goddaughter is Nell Freudenberger, who is an estimable novelist. She has a new book, “Lost and Wanted." I read everything she writes like a good godfather. I generally read nonfiction to prepare for a role. I recently read John Heilemann's “Game Change,"which is about the 2008 presidential election, because I was in the play “Hillary and Clinton" on Broadway. I read “The Loudest Voice in the Room" by Gabriel Sherman, which is about Roger Ailes whom I play in the new movie “Bombshell." To play Churchill in “The Crown" I read William Manchester's big biography, “The Last Lion."
BOOKS: Do you have a favorite literary character?
LITHGOW: I love the outrageous character of Sabbath in Philip Roth's “Sabbath's Theater." I love how George Saunders portrayed President Lincoln in “Lincoln in the Bardo." Basically great writing generates great characters.
BOOKS: What were your favorite classic authors when you studied literature at Harvard?
LITHGOW: I would say Dickens, Jane Austen, and George Eliot. I wrote my senior thesis on satire in Restoration comedy, so I read a lot of poetry and plays from 300 years ago. I rarely ever sit down to read a play for pleasure now but, god knows, I have read a lot of plays.
BOOKS: Are there any classic authors you didn't jibe with?
LITHGOW: “Moby-Dick" was such a slog. I played the role of Don Quixote and felt like I had to read the novel by Cervantes. That was like reading the Bible. It was fantastic but it went all over the place. I'm not a great reader really. I'm slow, not persistent, and easily distracted. I have a book with me when I go to the movie set, and I'm lucky to read a paragraph. I'm in a social business, so you tend to sit around talking all day.
BOOKS: Then how do you read as much as you do?
LITHGOW: If a friend sends me a book, I'm grateful because it becomes like required reading for me. My friend David Maraniss sent me his memoir, “A Good American Family," about his father and the blacklist, which I dove into. Every year I go to Harvard and interview the Harvard Arts Medal winner. For that I've interviewed Margaret Atwood and Colson Whitehead so I needed to read their books. I really need an assignment to get off my ass and read. Then I'm relieved that someone made me do it.
Amy Sutherland is the author, most recently, of “Rescuing Penny Jane" and she can be reached at amysutherland@mac.com

Great Mexican Movies: Get Them Online

Texto completo: Hiding in plain sight (or rather in the internet underbrush) is a great national cinema: Mexico's. Prospecting for its "golden age" can yield precious nuggets, somewhat tarnished by low resolution but watchable just the same.
Emilio Fernández's "Salón México" (1949), Roberto Gavaldón's "Macario" (1960) and Luis Buñuel's "Illusion Travels by Streetcar" (1953) are three such movies, findable online with English subtitles. Examples of popular -- as well as populist -- cinema, they were made in the post-World War II era when Mexico had become the world's leading producer of Spanish-language motion pictures. Energized by savvy filmmaking and star performances and infused with folkloric elements, they were made as alternatives to, rather than imitations of, contemporary Hollywood movies.
Fernández, the most internationally celebrated of Mexican auteurs and the leading purveyor of Mexicanidad (Mexicanness), specialized in heroic tales of rural life -- most famously the Cannes award-winner "Maria Candelaría." His "Salón México" was a departure -- a noirish musical melodrama set in a tawdry Mexico City cabaret to a near continuous rumba beat.
Mercedes (the Argentine actress Marga López) is a "fichera" (dancer, code for prostitute) who is determined to support her younger sister in a classy boarding school. Abused by her pimp, Mercedes receives moral support from a sympathetic cop (Miguel Inclán, the malevolent blind man in Buñuel's "Los Olvidados") who nevertheless proves helpless to avert the tragic ending.
In an addition to dishing out stabbings, shootouts and seasonal fiestas, Fernández synthesizes a host of cultural references. Frenzied Afro-Cuban dancing mixes with statelier Mexican danzón; one set piece is illuminated by a flashing neon sign, and another puts Mercedes and her sister in a museum, surrounded by pre-Columbian artifacts. The owner of the cabaret tells patrons that the composer Aaron Copland got the inspiration for his "Salón México" suite while sitting at their very table.
Even more eclectic than Fernández, the prolific Gavaldón worked in a variety of genres, including an English-language children's movie, "The Littlest Outlaw" (1955), made for Walt Disney. "Macario," which was nominated for an Oscar -- and, like "Salón México," shot by the distinguished cinematographer Gabriel Figueroa -- was a prestige project, based on a fable by the expatriate writer B. Traven. A penniless woodcutter with a large family, Macario (Ignacio López Tarso) gets his fondest wish -- an entire turkey to eat by himself -- and, after outsmarting avatars of both Jesus and the Devil, uses his solitary feast to cut a deal with a starving personification of Death (Enrique Lucero).
Gavaldón's movie -- which augments Traven's story with a prologue explaining the Day of the Dead -- further politicizes the magical realist tale, set in Spanish-occupied Mexico, by having Macario persecuted by the Inquisition. The New York Times critic Bosley Crowther began his favorable review by noting, "So seldom do our own filmmakers come up with a good folk tale or do better than an animated cartoon in the way of fantasy that it remains for the foreign filmmakers to send one along now and then."
That observation might be applied to the great surrealist Luis Buñuel, who arrived in Mexico in 1946 by way of the United States (where his career was hampered by his leftist political associations). Our loss, their gain. The 20 features Buñuel made in Mexico from 1946 through 1965 are his oeuvre's heart and soul. Only two, "Los Olvidados" ("The Forgotten Ones") and "The Exterminating Angel," may be recognized as masterpieces, but even the most conventional of the others provided the opportunity for Buñuelian subversion.
On the surface, "Illusion Travels by Streetcar" is an unpretentious comedy about the pleasure of playing hooky. A garrulous, none-too-bright pair of transit workers gets drunk at a neighborhood Christmas party and decides to treat their decommissioned trolley to a last ride. Their dreamlike, off-the-rails tour of Mexico City is a succession of unlikely (if not miraculous) events with an undercurrent of social criticism.
Like "Los Olvidados," if far more gently, "Illusion" satirizes Mexican cinema's conventionally sentimental view of the urban poor. An introductory voice-over announces the movie as a depiction of life among the "poverty-stricken classes," facetiously defined as the "common people" who "travel on streetcars." In fact, as the title tells us, "Illusion" is more like their fantasies -- including that of a free ride.
The trolley careens through the city and is repeatedly commandeered. Passengers include butchers bearing carcasses and rowdy schoolchildren bound for the floating gardens of Xochimilco. The density of vivid secondary characters suggests Preston Sturges. While no one escapes the movie's fondly mocking tone, Buñuel takes particular pleasure in deriding officious bureaucrats, complaining fat cats, corrupt officials, and, at once point, a gringa (North American) tourist who vents her anti-Communism in English. Roman Catholic ritual also comes in for some gentle ribbing.
Anticipating the episodic structure of later Buñuel art films like "The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie" and "The Phantom of Liberty," "Illusion" is subtly self-referential. Midway through, the trolley breaks down on a movie set. "The mood is deadpan and decidedly strange," Janet Maslin wrote on the occasion of the movie's belated theatrical release, adding that "the film inhabits a cool, only slightly distorted fantasy world that has its own eccentric rules of decorum." Viva Mexico.
Movies of Mexican cinema's "Golden Age" are plentiful on YouTube, where "Salón México," "Macario" and "Illusion Travels by Street Car" can all be found with English subtitles. As the resolution is low, small images make for better viewing. (The subtitles for "Illusion" go slightly out of phase midway through, lending an additional, if inadvertent, surreality to the film.)

WASHINGTON -- A secret agreement has allowed the nation's homebuilders to make it much easier to block changes to building codes that would require new houses to better address climate change, according to documents reviewed by The New York Times.
The written arrangement, in place for years and not previously disclosed, guarantees industry representatives four of the 11 voting seats on two powerful committees that approve building codes that are widely adopted nationwide. The pact has helped enable the trade group that controls the seats, the National Association of Home Builders, to prevent changes that would have made new houses in much of the country more energy-efficient or more resilient to floods, hurricanes and other disasters.
The agreement shows that homebuilders accrued "excessive power over the development of regulations that governed them," said Bill Fay, head of the Energy Efficient Codes Coalition, which has pushed for more aggressive standards. Homes accounted for nearly one-fifth of all energy-related carbon dioxide emissions nationwide last year.
While four seats is a minority on the two committees, which focus on residential building codes, the bloc of votes makes it tougher to pass revisions that the industry opposes. Before the homebuilders gained seats on the committee that handles energy, for example, the energy efficiency of those building codes increased 32 percent over six years, according to a federal analysis. After the industry's influence expanded, that number was less than 3 percent over the same amount of time.
"The influence doesn't get any stronger than that," said David Cohan, who managed the Building Codes Energy Program at the Department of Energy until last year, referring to the agreement. "It makes it such an uphill battle."
Today in Las Vegas, members of the International Code Council, a Washington-based nonprofit that develops recommended building codes, are meeting to consider the proposed changes to energy-efficiency building codes, which get updated every three years. This round, the homebuilders have opposed changes that include requiring better insulation in attics and air ducts, as well as a proposal requiring new houses to be equipped with the circuitry required to install a plug for an electric vehicle -- potentially making it easier for homeowners to switch to electric cars in the future.
"Increased adoption of EVs will have a positive effect on overall U.S. household energy spending and carbon emissions," the sponsors of the proposal wrote. The homebuilders opposed the change, saying the requirements "would have a significant impact on affordability, particularly for entry-level homes and rentals."
The chairman of the homebuilders association, Greg Ugalde, said it was appropriate for homebuilders to have a voice on the committees. "Our industry is essential in the use of the codes," he said in a statement. "Our members are the ones using them most directly and they know what works and what doesn't."
In return for getting seats on the committees, the builders association agreed to support the adoption of the council's codes by state and local officials, according to Tim Ballo, a lawyer at the environmental advocacy group Earthjustice who has seen the agreement.
The homebuilding industry says it opposes proposals that would make houses more expensive, pricing people out of the market. Supporters of the changes say they would more than pay for themselves over time with lower energy bills and reduced likelihood of damage in the event of floods or other disasters.
Building codes in the United States are set by state and local officials, but they are usually based on model codes published by the International Code Council.
Other countries, including in Latin America and the Caribbean, also draw from the codes published by the council.
"The code council has not tried to keep this a secret," Whitney Doll, the council's vice president of communications, said of the agreement. She said the council had not made any "official public statements" about it.
To develop its proposed building codes, the International Code Council collects proposed changes from building inspectors, engineers and others, then convenes committees to review them. The proposals eventually go to a vote by the full membership of more than 8,000 state and local officials.
However, individual committees act as crucial gatekeepers: If a committee rejects a change, it is much harder for it to win final approval, under the code council's rules.
In 2002, the code council signed an agreement with the National Association of Home Builders -- which represents 140,000 builders, suppliers and others in the industry -- that gives the association the right to select four of the 11 voting members of the committee responsible for the International Residential Code, which governs home construction. (The other members are chosen by the code council directly and tend to be a mix of government officials and others who work in the building industry.)
The confidential agreement's existence has long been a subject of speculation among people who work on building codes. When contacted by The Times, the council initially denied having an agreement with homebuilders. It later acknowledged the agreement and defended it as appropriate, while declining to provide a copy.
When presented with a summary of the agreement from Mr. Ballo, the council confirmed that the summary was accurate.
While four seats out of 11 on the residential building-code committee is a clear minority, it provides considerable power, critics of the arrangement say. Advocates for any change opposed by the homebuilders must win the support of six of the committee's seven remaining voting members.
"It really makes it difficult for the advancement of energy efficiency," said Ron Jones, a former board member at the association who is critical of its position on codes. "The homebuilders took them hostage by saying, 'If you don't work with us, we will look elsewhere to promote other codes."'
Michael Pfeiffer, senior vice president for technical services at the International Code Council, said that guaranteeing the seats to the homebuilders was a way to take advantage of the industry's experience. "It's all about bringing stakeholders to the table," he said.
Mr. Pfeiffer also said it was not unusual for the council's 8,000 voting members to overturn a decision by a committee. "You've got the necessary checks and balances," he said.
In messages to its members, the homebuilders association has noted the committee's effectiveness at stopping proposals it did not support. That includes issues like mandating tougher foundations in flood-prone areas or ensuring that roofs were less likely to blow off during a hurricane.
"Only 6 percent of the proposals that NAHB opposed made it through the committee hearings intact," the association wrote to its members after meetings in 2015. "NAHB saw favorable votes on 87 percent of the codes proposals, including 92.5 percent of high-priority proposals," it wrote again about votes last year.
The chairman of the homebuilders association, Mr. Ugalde, said in his statement that the committee members selected by his organization were "not a block vote -- they make their own decisions on how to vote."
In a blog post last year titled "Money in Your Pocket," the association wrote that its success at keeping "costly provisions" out of the 2015 building code alone had saved homebuilders $ 1,000 per housing start. That figure, combined with other regulatory changes the group claimed credit for, "demonstrates just how much value NAHB delivers for members," the association wrote.
Advocates for tougher building codes say the effects of decisions like these will be felt for generations as global warming leads to more powerful storms and higher risk of damage to property.
"Our definition of cost is what it costs the families when the home is built poorly," said Leslie Chapman-Henderson, president of the Federal Alliance for Safe Homes, a consumer advocacy group. Those costs, she said, are more than financial and extend to the emotional and social burdens of a family being forced out of their home.
The consequences of the deal between the code council and homebuilders are easiest to measure when it comes to energy efficiency, which came under the influence of the homebuilders' agreement in 2011.
Until that point, the model building codes had drastically improved the energy efficiency of new homes with each new three-year edition. The 2009 and 2012 development cycles together reduced homeowners' annual energy costs by 32 percent, according to an analysis by the Department of Energy.
Then, after energy-efficiency codes fell under the agreement between the code council and the homebuilders, that momentum ground to a halt. The 2015 codes, the first to be negotiated after the change, reduced residential energy use and costs by less than 1 percent, the Energy Department found. Savings from the 2018 codes were less than 2 percent.
"The participation of these industry representatives is critical to the process," Ms. Doll, the code council's spokeswoman, said. "Their input helps ensure that code change proposals reflect the evolving needs of the construction industry."

Texto completo: Some stories are more moving than others when it comes to shipwrecks. This one has really hit home, as in shockingly. Read on ...
On April 23, 1945, the USS Eagle sank off the coast of Maine near Cape Elizabeth. She was towing a practice target for bombers from the nearby Naval Air Station Brunswick.
According to a July 20 article in The New York Times:
"This ship was part of a class of submarine chasers built by the Ford Motor Co. to combat German U-boats in World War I, but saw their first substantial action in World War II."
There were 62 crew members aboard. The mood was light, somewhat relaxed as the men knew World War II was winding down. The word was out that U-boats were close to the Atlantic Coast. What good would it do the Germans to shoot down a submarine chaser, but call attention to the U-boat? After all, seamen on both sides were weary after a long war.
Five miles offshore the German U-853 found its target, the USS Eagle 56, and destroyed her. Only 13 men lived to tell their stories. The Navy's official records listed the cause of sinking as a boiler explosion.
If so, then why did my birth mother (June Kern Davies Williams) tell me 29 years ago that her first husband, and love of her life, Bob Davies, was on the Eagle when it was hit by a German U-boat? Who had she talked to? Survivors? Naval officials? Her mind was very clear about this; the Navy was wrong.
A Court of Inquiry had been formed on April 23, 1945, consisting of U.S. Navy Rear Adm. Felix Gygax; Lt. Cmdr. William Coolidge, naval reserve; and Lt. Cmdr. Norman Kaufman, naval reserve. The purpose was to:
"Make a thorough investigation into all the circumstances connected with the aforesaid loss, the causes thereof, damages to property there from, injuries to personnel, and the responsibility therefore.
"The court will include in its findings a full statement of the facts it may deem to be established."
The Court of Inquiry was held at the First Naval District North Station Office Building in Boston. Eleven pages of questions were asked of the witnesses who were men from the Eagle's base at Grand Trunk Pier in Portland, Maine, and the survivors. Most of the survivors, when asked where they thought the explosion had come from, declared that it had come from outside the ship. Lt. j.g. John P. Scagnalli told the Court of Inquiry that he "felt the explosion was from outside inwards. It was very similar to a depth charge explosion."
Numerous questions were asked about the ship's boiler, but the survivors had similar testimonies, stating that the explosion had been caused by "something outside the ship."
The USS Eagle sank in 15 minutes in 300 feet of water. The testimony recorded that the deceased men had died immediately; the survivors were able to swim away from the ship. This tragedy occurred less than a month before the war ended. In retaliation, the German U-boat 853 was sunk by the Americans two weeks later.
Until she died in 2019, June Kern Davies Williams insisted the Eagle had been torpedoed. Reticent to talk about her teenage pregnancy, giving up the baby for adoption and the loss of her husband, no one ever questioned her further. The official version was still that the boiler explosion caused the sinking.
No one could determine the exact location for 75years. Eight civilian divers finally found the USS Eagle 56 . The group was composed of diving and sonar experts. Ryan King, a member of the team photographers, told The New York Times that "When you see a 4-inch deck gun, you know you're not dealing with a fishing boat. The Eagle is located down in a rocky cavern at the bottom of the Atlantic. Experts took their findings to the Navy. The site is not for recreational divers, and is protected by federal law as a war grave.
Historian and lawyer Paul M. Lawton from Warren, Massachusetts, had been interested in finding the ship for two decades after hearing about it from two friends whose father had died aboard when the ship was torpedoed. Gary Kozak lent his knowledge as an expert in side-scan sonar, searching for five years with no luck. Three of the survivors were interviewed, but no new clues were revealed. Photographer Ryan King dove the site and did much of the photography which identified the lost ship.
"The Hunt for Eagle 56" is a three-part documentary produced by the Smithsonian Channel. It is well worth watching. Questions outnumber answers at times. Why did the Navy insist a boiler had exploded when survivors thought and had seen both the submarine and a torpedo? Could there have been a cover up for some reason?
The official finding of the Eagle marks the first time in the history of the Navy that such a correction has ever been made. The official cause of the sinking of the Eagle has been changed to being torpedoed by a German U-boat.
Docents at the New Jersey Maritime Museum are extremely well informed in various parts of our state's maritime history. They have had experiences diving, antique postcard collecting, researching wrecks, writing and are experts in many fields. Now this author has found that her birth mother actually lived the sinking of the Eagle at the age of 21 when her husband of two years died aboard the ship less than a month before the official end of World War II.
What story will be uncovered next? On your next visit to the NJ Maritime Museum bring us your stories; we want to hear them. And we will tell you some of ours. NJ Maritime Museum, 528 Dock Road, Beach Haven, open Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Weekdays by appointment, call 609-492-0202.

Texto completo: Charles Kupperman , exasesor adjunto de seguridad nacional del presidente Donald Trump, presentó una demanda el viernes pidiendo a un juez federal que determine si debe testificar en la investigación de juicio político que lleva a cabo la Cámara de Representantes.
El resultado podría afectar la capacidad de otros testigos que trabajaron estrechamente con el presidente para cooperar con la investigación en curso. La demanda fue publicada por primera vez por The New York Times este viernes.
Kupperman está programado para testificar el lunes. La entrevista acercaría la investigación a la órbita de John Bolton, el exasesor de seguridad nacional de Trump.
Los demócratas de la Cámara de Representantes están llevando a cabo una investigación de juicio político que se centra en la presunta presión sobre el presidente de Ucrania para que anuncie investigaciones sobre lo que se ha llamado una teoría de conspiración en las elecciones presidenciales de 2016, así como sobre el exvicepresidente Joe Biden y su hijo.
Los críticos dicen que eso equivale a un abuso de poder por parte del presidente para beneficio político personal. Kupperman alega en la demanda que los abogados de la Casa Blanca le dijeron que no compareciera el lunes.
La demanda añade que el abogado de la Casa Blanca informó al abogado de Kupperman que “para proteger las prerrogativas de la oficina del presidente hoy y en el futuro, y en respuesta a su solicitud, el presidente le ordena al Sr. Kupperman que no comparezca en el horario programado del Comité en la audiencia del lunes 28 de octubre de 2019 “.
Kupperman afirma en la demanda que no está seguro de si la citación emitida por la Cámara le obliga a comparecer y que “está obligado por su juramento a cumplir los mandatos constitucionales legales tanto del presidente como de la Cámara de Representantes”. “El demandante no puede satisfacer las órdenes de los Demandados de la Cámara de Representantes, por un lado, y del Presidente Trump, por el otro”, señala en el texto.
El viernes pasado, un juez federal determinó que la investigación de juicio político es válida, a pesar de los argumentos del presidente y sus aliados de que era necesario un voto pleno de la Cámara para comenzar el proceso.
“Incluso en casos de destitución presidencial nunca se ha requerido una resolución de la Cámara para comenzar una investigación de destitución”, escribió la jueza Beryl Howell, juez principal del tribunal de distrito de Washington, D.C.
La oficina del abogado de la Casa Blanca se ha negado a cooperar con la investigación, argumentando que es ilegítima porque la Cámara no celebró una votación formal para declararla.
Howell en el fallo del viernes también ordenó al Departamento de Justicia que entregue el material del gran jurado al que se hace referencia en partes redactadas del informe del abogado especial Robert Mueller al Comité Judicial de la Cámara. Se espera que el Departamento de Justicia apele.

Texto completo: Re "Undoing the great mistake of 2016," editorial, Oct. 20
As your editorials on beating Donald Trump in 2020 make clear, there are so many examples of shocking malfeasance by this president that it is difficult to remember them all. Why many of them haven't been judged to be impeachable offenses long before now is somewhat mystifying.
Just as one example, how can we countenance a president whose "reciting verifiable falsehoods" happens almost nonstop to the point where we literally cannot believe anything he says? For the president of our country, isn't this clearly a "high crime"?

The Republican senators who will hold the fate of our country in their hands when they vote on removing Trump from office will hopefully put aside any partisanship, remember their oath of office, and stand up for our beloved democracy. If not, they will face the severe judgment of history and richly deserve the label "deplorables."
Gertrude Barden, Porter Ranch
::
Trump recently called the emoluments clause "phony." This is the part of the U.S. Constitution that bars federal officials from taking money from foreign governments, as the president was reminded by Democrats and Republicans when he tried to have next year's Group of 7 summit at his Doral resort in south Florida.
Also, the L.A. Times Editorial Board has listed a litany of alarming acts by Trump.
Mr. Trump, your time is up. Please do the right thing by resigning the presidency so our citizens do not have to be dragged through the squalor of impeachment. Please do America a favor.
Perhaps the salient words of Jane Austen sum up my sentiments: "What is right to be done cannot be done too soon."
Tom Kaminski
Manhattan Beach
::
Thank you for having the courage to present your series to your readers. You can expect blowback, but you have done the right thing.
There is a quote by Shakespeare on the National Archives building in Washington: "What is past is prologue." All of the misdeeds of this president that are adversely affecting our country will only get worse with time.
I hope our elected leaders will ask themselves if they think our democracy is better off now than when Trump was elected. The answer is clear, and they need to do the right thing.
Arthur Kraus
Venice
::
I heard echoes of the Declaration of Independence in your editorial series.
To borrow again from the Declaration, we can only hope that those Republicans who purport to revere our founding fathers rediscover their "sacred honor" and "dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another" (in this case, Trump).
As your editorial makes clear, we are saddled with a president who, like King George III, has engaged in "a long train of abuses and usurpations" and "evinces a design to reduce [the American people] under absolute despotism."
It is time to provide for new guards of our future security.
Steven Formaker
Los Angeles
::
There was no mistake in 2016. Hillary Clinton received nearly 3 million more votes than Trump.
The mistake was our adherence to the electoral college.
Every presidential election winner should be determined by a just count of each American vote.

Times is anti-Trump. Shocking
Re "The train-wreck presidency," editorial, Oct. 22
Those of us who are supporters of President Trump and will work for his reelection in 2020 can thank the Lord that the Los Angeles Times is only preaching to the choir in its market area.
In our view, there was no mistake in 2016.
Neither we nor the president expect to carry the greater Los Angeles area or the state of California in 2020. We assume that the Democratic nominee, whoever that is, will carry these areas with the support of The Times.
Instead, we are going for that almost completely red-colored map of all U.S. counties from 2016.
I keep thinking, where do I want to be on election night in 2020 to watch the returns? The offices of the Los Angeles Times? The New York Times? Or the White House?
Probably the White House.
George A. Vandeman
Playa del Rey
::
The funny thing about your anti-Trump editorials is that you're preaching to the choir.
California has only so many electoral votes going into the 2020 election, and right now you can put those votes in the column of whomever the Democrats put on the ballot in opposition to the president.
On the other hand, voters in the Golden State opposed to the left-wing, populist hash-up of programs offered up by the various Democratic candidates do have one resource at their disposal: their checkbooks.
One suspects said books will be put to good use during the campaign.
Louis H. Nevell
Los Angeles
::
I voted for Trump in 2016 because I believed he would do the better job on my top two priorities, the economy and defense.
I have not been disappointed and will vote for him in 2020.
I have yet to see any ideas generated by the Democratic candidates that will make my life better -- if anything, all we will get is California's problems on a national scale.

Beat Trump? Pick Pelosi
Re "Sorry, 'electability' matters," editorial, Oct. 23
Are Sens. Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris, all Democratic presidential candidates, electable?
Sanders just suffered a heart attack. Harris is done after throwing former Vice President Joe Biden under the bus. Others remain viable, but there's still one good candidate waiting in the wings: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
Pelosi is the most qualified Democrat who could be drafted at the party's convention. She is the de facto Democratic Party leader, heading the effort to impeach President Trump. She brilliantly contrasts with our unstable and dangerous commander in chief.
As speaker, she was crucial in obtaining passage of the Affordable Care Act. As president, she would be an effective partner with Congress.
Bruce Cort Daniels
Running Springs, Calif.
::
The editorial board tells us to consider electability when voting in the Democratic primary, yet you provide no guidance on how to determine who is the most electable.
The big question is whether it is more important to excite the base or to attract swing voters. When Democrats made the mistake in 1972 of nominating George McGovern, the answer was clearly the latter.
But 47 years later, there aren't many swing voters left. The best way to find the most electable candidate may be to vote for the one who excites you.
Russell Stone
Westchester
::
The winner in 2020 will be decided by the independents and soft Trumpers in swing states. These voters have made clear they have no use for a real lefty.
For Democrats, it boils down to this: Field a reasonably centrist candidate, or prepare to lose.

A Bad Word Versus A Bad Law

Texto completo: They were guilty of vulgarity and ignorance, but "ridicule" is not a crime.
Imagine if the cast members of "The Book of Mormon" could be arrested and prosecuted for ridiculing Mormons. Preposterous, you say?
The idea is not entirely fantastical. A law in Connecticut criminalizes anyone who "ridicules or holds up to contempt" a person or group because of "creed, religion, color, denomination, nationality or race." Violators are guilty of a misdemeanor and face up to 30 days in jail and a $ 250 fine.
The law is now in the news because of an incident involving two students at the University of Connecticut, who were arrested by the campus police on Monday night and charged under the law with ridiculing a protected group.
Ten days before their arrest, the two men, both white, were being stupid, as college-age males sometimes are wont to do. They were walking with a third man through a parking lot on campus, playing, according to a police report, "a game in which they yelled vulgar words." Unbeknown to them, someone in a nearby apartment was watching -- and recording them.
The video, which was shared widely on social media, shows the two men appearing to say the N-word to each other. They and their friend then laugh and continue on their way. The epithet is not directed at anyone, and contrary to some descriptions in the media, the video does not show the men "yelling" or "shouting." They were just amusing themselves in a vulgar, ignorant way.
After student protests at which school administrators were urged to take action, the two men were arrested and charged. They are scheduled to appear in court on Wednesday. The men also face discipline by the university.
To be clear: No decent person approves of such use of the N-word. But no sensible person wants to live in a world in which authorities have free rein to lock people up for engaging in what government functionaries decide is inappropriate "ridicule."
An important purpose of the First Amendment is to protect against such arbitrary use of government power. Indeed, the anti-ridicule statute, at least as applied in this situation, is unconstitutional, for three reasons.
First, the Supreme Court has long held that a law may not be so vague that it leaves an ordinary person uncertain about what it prohibits. Criminal laws, the court has said, may not create a "standardless sweep" that "allows policemen, prosecutors, and juries to pursue their personal predilections."
Those who cheer the arrests of the University of Connecticut students might ask themselves whether they would be equally happy with a prosecutor who decided that it was criminal "ridicule" for someone to walk down the street uttering a racial slur while reciting rap lyrics. But that's not ridicule, you say? Well, that's the point: Who should be trusted to decide such things when fines, jail time and expulsion from college loom as possible consequences?
Second, federal courts consistently have struck down speech codes at public universities that punished students who engaged in undefined "acts of intolerance" or who "stigmatized" others based on their race, religion, sexuality or other characteristic. One such decision invalidated a university speech code that imposed discipline for "threats, insults, epithets, ridicule or personal attacks."
The reasoning in those cases -- that speech may not be censored or punished for its content -- also applies in the University of Connecticut case. Here, there was not even an identifiable target of the offensive speech, just a bystander with a cellphone. (Moreover, it appears that the Connecticut law, which was enacted a century ago, was intended to apply only to some form of "advertisement," making the use of the law to criminalize the students' speech even more misguided.)
To be sure, speech may be punished when the words used are likely to produce what the Supreme Court has called "imminent lawless action," such as physical violence. But this leads to the third reason Connecticut's anti-ridicule statute is unconstitutional. The Supreme Court case that established that rule, Brandenburg v. Ohio in 1969, involved the prosecution of Ku Klux Klansmen who were filmed uttering repulsive racist statements -- including the N-word. But as in the case of the University of Connecticut students, the Klansmen's words provoked no action, and the Ohio law under which the men were prosecuted was struck down under the First Amendment.
In the face of an absurd statute like Connecticut's anti-ridicule law, it is tempting to extol the value of satire, irreverence and cheek as part of our country's robust free-speech traditions. But this is not the time for that. Racial, ethnic, sexual and religious slurs exact a social cost. They deprive members of the affected groups of their dignity and inhibit their participation in our democracy as equal citizens.
But it is possible to hold that thought in mind while keeping in mind another thought: that we do not want the police or prosecutors -- or university administrators, who too often cave in to public pressure in such situations -- wielding the power to decide what constitutes "ridicule" and when someone should be hauled up on charges for engaging in it.

Texto completo: MOSCOW – Officials have opened a criminal investigation after a circus bear attacked and injured its trainer during a performance in northern Russia.
Video of the Wednesday attack in Olonets, a town 110 miles northeast of St. Petersburg, shows the bear pushing a wheelbarrow while walking on its hind legs, then attacking the trainer, biting him and forcing him to the floor. Another trainer hurries forward and kicks the bear repeatedly.
The online news site gazeta. ru cited a witness as saying the bear then ventured into the audience area before being subdued with an electric shocker.
According to The New York Times, the 16-year-old brown bear named Yashka was the star of the Anshlag traveling circus from the city of Voronezh. The bear's handler, Ruslan Solodyuk, said the 660-pound animal was on his last tour as a performer and wasn't feeling well at the time of the attack, the paper reported.
Who is the ‘fattest bear of all’? Her name is Holly, and she lives in Alaska

Solodyuk told the Russian site Daily Storm that the bear was never violent before Wednesday's attack.
The manager of the circus, Lyudmila Misnik, told Russian news media Thursday that audience members didn't turn off the flash on their cellphones, which might have provoked the bear. She also assured that both the trainer and the bear are fine.
There were no barriers between the circus ring and the audience. The Interfax news agency said the Investigative Committee has opened a criminal investigation on a charge of providing unsafe services.

Texto completo: Rear Adm. Collin Green was correct when he said "we have a problem" in Naval Special Warfare, but his desire to punish Edward Gallagher is not the solution, it is part of the problem.
Eddie Gallagher spent months in jail for a murder he did not commit. His children were dragged from their home in their underwear at gunpoint by Navy criminal investigation agents. Prosecutors repeatedly violated his constitutional rights. Senior Navy SEAL leaders tried to improperly influence the proceedings and send him to jail for life. But an impartial jury found Gallagher not guilty of every serious charge.
Just before the trial began, Green touted the results of a study on Navy SEAL culture as "properly balancing a culture of operational excellence with a culture of sound ethical compliance." After the trial, he reversed himself to say "we have a problem."
There was not a precipitous deterioration in the culture, but rather the sudden need to find a scapegoat because during the trial, we had exposed massive leadership failures. Instead of learning from mistakes and holding leadership accountable, leadership chose to blame Gallagher and deflect attention from themselves.
Green's stated goal of restoring good order and discipline is both needed and laudable, but his methods are not. He recalled an entire platoon from Iraq for drinking on base, yet, according to eyewitness statements, both Green and Capt. Matthew Rosenbloom drank in Iraq on prior occasions. Green is under investigation by the inspector general for retaliating against SEALs who consult with attorneys.
Anonymous sources made a stunning admission to The New York Times that, even after being acquitted, "Green and other Navy leaders were planning to demote (Gallagher) and force him out of the SEALs," but that they couldn't execute this unlawful plan because they're afraid of the president.
Their attempt to appeal to the partisan divide misses the point. Respecting jury verdicts and the constitutional rights of military members is not a partisan issue.
If Green really wanted to fix Navy SEAL culture, he should abandon his fixation on punishing Gallagher and instead sit down with him to learn what the real problems are from his deckplate perspective. Gallagher has experienced both the best and the worst aspects of the SEAL culture, but he loves the SEAL teams and would do anything to help them improve.
Timothy Parlatore, a former Navy officer, is a lawyer representing Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher.

Texto completo: "Contrary to what you may have heard from others,
my brother and I have been very sensitive to this issue (of the late astronaut's possessions) since my father's passing."
Mark Armstrong
A fresh chance to pick up a piece of Neil Armstrong memorabilia rolls up Friday when a Dallas auction house opens bidding on the fourth parcel of rare goods the space hero's sons have put up for sale.
The auctions, which have raised roughly $12 million so far, concerned some people close to the late astronaut – by nature a private person who stopped signing autographs when he learned people sold them.
In July, the astronaut's personal lawyer, Ross Wales, told the New York Times the auctions ran counter to that spirit: Armstrong "just didn't like to be made a fuss over."
But one of Armstrong's two sons, Mark, outlined in an email to The Enquirer the dozens of donations and contributions he and his brother have made of their father's possessions.
"Contrary to what you may have heard from others, my brother and I have been very sensitive to this issue since my father's passing," he wrote.
The Wapakoneta native was the first man on the moon. The auctions of his belongings have coincided with the yearlong celebrations of the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing July 20, 1969.
Since October 2018, Heritage Auctions of Dallas has conducted three auctions of possessions that Rick and Mark Armstrong inherited from their parents, including hundreds of items from their father's astronaut career.
Rick Armstrong of Mason, the astronaut's elder son, declined to discuss the auctions.
In two emails, younger son Mark Armstrong of West Chester Township told The Enquirer he and wife Wendy plan to use a portion of their auction proceeds to build a charitable organization called Vantage Earth Foundation focused on the fate of the planet.
Aerospace historian James R. Hansen published his definitive biography, "First Man: The Life of Neil A. Armstrong," in 2005, and the book became a 2018 movie.
"My concern as a historian is that I would want to know if there are any historically significant documents," Hansen said, such as a letter to Armstrong from Charles Lindbergh, the first man to fly solo across the Atlantic in 1927.
Armstrong gave 450 boxes of his papers to his alma mater, Purdue University. In October 2018, the collection's archivist wrote a letter to the Times that the Armstrong auctions were "problematic." The archivist didn't respond to emails for comment.
Mark Armstrong's email outlined dozens of donations and contributions he and his brother have made of their father's possessions. He said they also have ensured that auctioned items have been cataloged for public review.
The Lindbergh letter, for example, has been on loan since June 2017 to the San Diego Air and Space Museum, he said, and will not be in the auction.
In May, the brothers donated the Explorers Club flag "that our father flew on Apollo 11" to the Explorers Club in New York.
About a month ago, Mark Armstrong said, he and his brother made a donation of items to the University of Cincinnati, where their father taught for decades.
Among the goods is a 1971 letter from a key House leader thanking the astronaut for his service to the nation: "Surely NASA's loss is the University of Cincinnati's gain."
In 1978, President Jimmy Carter awarded the first Congressional Space Medal of Honor to Armstrong. That honor now is displayed at the "Destination Moon" exhibit of the Cincinnati Museum Center. Mark Armstrong said he and his brother have offered the medal permanently to the Smithsonian.
Mark Armstrong also listed 30 museums, nonprofits and other groups to which the brothers have loaned items or donated time, money or items.
"Although we are hard-pressed to understand how it is anyone's business what my brother and I decide to do with our personal property, I trust that you will find that these examples indicate that we have been thoughtful about where these historical artifacts should be housed for the long term," Mark Armstrong wrote.
"Furthermore, at our great expense, we made sure that all auctioned items have been researched, restored, preserved and photographed by both (Collectibles Authentication Guaranty, an independent evaluator) and Heritage Auctions, so that this information is accessible to anyone, worldwide."
The "Space Exploration Auction Featuring the Armstrong Family Collection" through Heritage Auctions has already brought in $12.14 million, said spokesman Steve Lansdale. Additional auctions have not been scheduled, but Lansdale said there are more items that could be put up for sale.
Bidding in the fourth auction opens online Friday. Among items available are other commemorative medals in gold and silver, 4-by-6-inch state flags that traveled on Apollo 11, a flight path to the moon that Armstrong drew and signed, an envelope postmarked the day Apollo 11 blasted off and Armstrong's 1951 order for a new Oldsmobile 88 from Niswonger Chevrolet in Wapakoneta.
Not all items on the block are from the Armstrong family. As in the three previous auctions, goods are available that were signed by Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins, the other Apollo 11 astronauts. But all things Armstrong brought the highest prices.
Each of the Apollo 11 astronauts carried a specially struck gold medal. Armstrong's medal, which went to the lunar surface, sold in July for $2.04 million, the biggest individual sale of the auction. An American flag carried on Apollo 11 sold for $275,000.
Armstrong died Aug. 25, 2012, at Mercy Health Fairfield hospital after coronary bypass surgery. Documents show a nurse pulled wires leading to a heart pacemaker, which triggered bleeding around the heart that took more than an hour to stop. Armstrong never regained consciousness, and after his death, he was buried at sea.
In July, The Enquirer reported that Armstrong's sons threatened a wrongful-death lawsuit, and Mercy Health, Ohio's largest hospital system, settled the matter with a $6 million payment to the sons.
Janet Armstrong, Neil's first wife, died in June 2018 at 84. Carol Armstrong, his second wife, lives in Indian Hill.
"Contrary to what you may have heard from others,
my brother and I have been very sensitive to this issue (of the late astronaut's possessions) since my father's passing."
Mark Armstrong
The two sons of astronaut Neil Armstrong gave this Aug. 27, 1971, letter to the University of Cincinnati this year. The letter from the chairman of the House Committee on Science and Astronautics bids farewell to the astronaut as he departed from his NASA career to teach at UC.

Texto completo: Two years ago at the Toronto International Film Festival, a movie about Thomas Edison, George Westinghouse, Nikola Tesla and, for a climax, the dazzling illumination of the 1893 Chicago World's Fair, failed utterly to ignite the movie world.
En route to its premiere, "The Current War" met with more than the usual amount of uber-meddling from distributor Harvey Weinstein. A few weeks after the Toronto festival, The New York Times published the first historymaking story of sexual assault and serial harassment allegations against Weinstein. After decades of one mogul's predation, suddenly, that was that. The unreleased "Current War," meantime, went into turnaround and became an asterisk.
Now there's a director's cut of "The Current War," already released in England, featuring newly shot footage, various cuts, reorderings, a new musical score and a 10-minutes-shorter running time. I never saw the earlier version. This one remains a bit of a mess but a pretty interesting one.
Director Alfonso Gomez-Rejon ("Me and Earl and the Dying Girl") sweats like crazy to visually energize a story largely about alternating current versus direct current, embodied by the driven but very different inventors and industrialists at the fictionalized story's center. Benedict Cumberbatch stews and furrows his way through the role of the distracted Edison, in a performance more concerned with interior tension than audience love. Unkempt and increasingly unscrupulous, Edison lives in the shadow of personal tragedy; Tuppence Middleton portrays his wife in a few quick early scenes.
With the sometime assistance of the brilliant Serbian-born Tesla (Nicholas Hoult), Edison scores an early victory by lighting up a good chunk of New York City with his direct current. His wily but fair-minded competitor is Westinghouse (Michael Shannon), boasting the more efficient AC system. Westinghouse's company powers more and more of the outlying nation, away from Manhattan's bright lights. And while the movie lacks a conventional structure - it's based on a musical play screenwriter Michael Mitnick wrote in grad school at Yale - the third act concerns who will win the contract to illuminate the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago.
The movie offers one peculiarity after another. The director's cut foregrounds the supporting character of Tesla, if only to explain to the audience his relationships to Edison and Westinghouse. (The scene where Tesla's upbraided by his boss as a measly "immigrant" wasn't in the original cut.) The current and much-loved "Spider-Man," Tom Holland, plays Edison's devoted assistant Samuel Insull. He comes into prominence late in the game; as Marguerite Westinghouse, Katherine Waterston does a lot with a little. Smart actors, and this ensemble's full of them, know they needn't do a lot, with elegant period costumes handling so much of the work for them.
Nervous about boring the audience, Gomez-Rejon and cinematographer Chung-hoon Chung spin the camera 'round and 'round, here a twirling overhead zoom, there a nostril-proximity fisheye closeup. It's strenuous, though the settings and production designs shine. The movie, which began filming in late 2016, was made mostly in England, and the digital effects bring the Chicago World's Fair to life.

Ghosn Team Not Allowed To Review Nissan Files

Texto completo: Defense attorneys say prosecutors won't share records that might help their client, citing the automaker's fears that company secrets could be revealed.
TOKYO -- In the year since the Japanese authorities arrested Carlos Ghosn, the fallen Nissan boss, prosecutors have seized laptops, hard drives and reams of files from the automaker and its executives as they build their case against him.
Now, Mr. Ghosn's defense attorneys want access to that information as they look for evidence that could clear their client. But prosecutors have declared thousands of the files off limits. Nissan, they say, considers the information too sensitive, and prosecutors agree, refusing to provide any details of what they plan to withhold.
So far, judges have sided with the prosecutors. The legal clash is now headed to Japan's top court, as Mr. Ghosn's lawyers make a last-ditch attempt to get access to the files, or at least to find out what they are being barred from seeing.
Their appeal, filed on Oct. 17, is the latest twist in a case that has riveted the global auto industry and raised fundamental questions about the fairness of Japan's justice system. The decision not to disclose the files, Mr. Ghosn's attorneys argue, highlights the cozy relationship between prosecutors and Nissan, as well as a Japanese legal system that too often favors prosecutors.
"The judge says, 'Don't worry, you should trust the prosecutors,"' said Takashi Takano, a lawyer for Mr. Ghosn. But if the courts are content to simply trust the prosecutors, he added, "why do we even have to defend against these criminal charges?"
In response to questions from The New York Times, the Tokyo district prosecutor's office said it would share with the defense team copies of electronic media seized from Nissan that excluded "parts that were not appropriate to disclose," while keeping the originals intact. It declined to elaborate.
A spokeswoman for Nissan said the company could not comment on active judicial proceedings.
Both Nissan and Mr. Ghosn have been charged with underreporting Mr. Ghosn's compensation. A trial date has not been set.
Mr. Ghosn has denied the charges. On Thursday, his legal team asked the court to dismiss the case, citing what it described as "multiple acts" of prosecutorial misconduct.
"The prosecutors illegally ceded their investigative powers to certain Nissan employees and consultants" in an effort to topple Mr. Ghosn, his lawyers wrote in a statement.
Nissan has worked hand in hand with prosecutors to provide evidence against Mr. Ghosn, whom the automaker blames for many of its problems. At least two of its executives have struck cooperation agreements with the government guaranteeing them criminal immunity in exchange for providing evidence against their former boss.
That situation creates incentives for both Nissan and the prosecutors to protect the company while they try to get Mr. Ghosn convicted, according to Makoto Ibusuki, a law professor at Seijo University who is not involved in the case.
"It's impossible to deny that information that could be helpful to Mr. Ghosn could be hidden" within the files, Mr. Ibusuki said.
Japanese prosecutors enjoy broad discretionary powers over how they conduct their investigations. Conviction rates in the country hover near 100 percent. The vast majority of convictions are achieved with a confession, sometimes extracted under pressure.
Critics say the prosecutors' broad discretion includes how much evidence they choose to share with defendants. Numerous high-profile murder cases have been retried after revelations that prosecutors withheld key evidence from the courts. In March, a murder conviction was reversed after the defendant's defense team learned that prosecutors had failed to share evidence that would have cleared him.
In white-collar cases, Japanese prosecutors often seize large quantities of evidence but frequently return or destroy it if they believe the evidence is not relevant to the case, said Taichi Yoshikai, a former prosecutor who is now a law professor at Kokushikan University in Tokyo.
Since 2016, prosecutors have been required to provide the defense with a list of all of the evidence in their possession. Still, given the broad powers that prosecutors continue to have over evidence, Mr. Ghosn's attorneys are right to be concerned, said Seiho Cho, a criminal defense attorney in Tokyo.
"These are items that are related to the case," said Mr. Cho, who is not involved with the case. "That's why they seized these computers. So if the defense is not allowed to see what's inside them, of course that's strange."
It is not clear whether the records contain evidence that would help Mr. Ghosn, or whether they are even relevant to the case. Defense attorneys say they are worried that they will never get the chance to find out.
"It is completely impossible to know what type of data has been erased," his lawyers wrote in their appeal to Japan's Supreme Court. They added that the courts had simply asked Mr. Ghosn's defense team to trust that the prosecutors were providing them with all of the relevant evidence.
"That kind of attitude is not the approach of a fair and impartial judge," they wrote.
In a pretrial hearing last summer, Nissan argued that the files seized by prosecutors included "corporate secrets" and personal information about employees and asked the court to allow prosecutors to redact them, according to an Oct. 4 court filing by Mr. Ghosn's lawyers. But the judge ordered prosecutors to "broadly disclose the evidence" by the end of August.
In early September, days before Mr. Ghosn's lawyers were scheduled to view the evidence, prosecutors informed the defense team that they had received "a request from Nissan asking us 'not to disclose electronic data relating to employee privacy, etc.,"' the filing said.
The request included a list of nearly 6,000 pieces of evidence that "Nissan does not wish to be disclosed," prosecutors told the defense team, adding that they were "deleting electromagnetic recording media that is subject to disclosure."
Prosecutors later told the court that they would return only documents that were "clearly unrelated to this case" and would retain "copies of media for which a decision is difficult," the filing said.
Lawyers for Mr. Ghosn said prosecutors would not disclose the list submitted by Nissan nor explain the criteria used for judging whether records were related to the case.
Japanese prosecutors have collected over 100 electronic devices from Nissan, ranging from laptops and desktops to external hard drives, according to Mr. Ghosn's lawyers. Some were handed over voluntarily, while others were seized under a warrant.
They have also seized "more than 100 boxes of original documents" from the company, Nissan's lawyers said in an August filing in a federal court in the United States, where the company is facing a civil suit from investors.
Some of the information in prosecutors' hands came from Hari Nada, a former head of the company's legal department and one of the senior executives who have struck cooperation agreements with prosecutors.
Lawyers both inside and outside the company have expressed concern that Mr. Nada used his position to influence the investigation into Mr. Ghosn, creating a significant conflict of interest that could undermine the case against him.
In the course of the investigation, Mr. Nada provided prosecutors with "a large amount of electromagnetic recording media," the defense team's filing said.
Mr. Nada has not responded to requests for comment. Nissan relieved Mr. Nada of his responsibilities as head of the company's legal department this month, but said it had "found no evidence of inappropriate involvement by Nada in the internal investigation into executive misconduct led by former chairman Carlos Ghosn and others."
Makiko Inoue contributed reporting.

Texto completo: A scrapbook page shows mayor-elect Jose Paez Cruz, who was 37 when he was assassinated by a bomb hidden in a Christmas basket in 1971.
I was 2 and living in the Philippines when I saw my first ghost, but to me, he was simply Tito Pepe.
He was my mother’s favorite cousin. Jose Paez Cruz: smart, business-savvy, generous to a fault, effortlessly charming. They had grown up together and because they were close in age, remained stalwart confidantes.
On Dec. 25, 1971, Mom brought us children to her hometown of Malabon, a highly urbanized city in Metro Manila, to visit relatives and collect “aguinaldos,” gifts of Christmas cash from our elders. We joined a seemingly endless line of kids and watched as Tito Pepe doled out money with a ringing ‘Merry Christmas” to each. He was in high spirits because he had just been elected mayor of Malabon the month before, the latest pearl on a string of achievements.
“Everything he touched turned to gold,” Mom would say.
I remember him bending down to give me a crisp, blue, 2 peso bill, and me clutching it tightly, thinking about what candy I would buy. He laughed about something with Mom, always the best buddies, then walked around the corner.
Mom says she later examined him because he had a cold. Take it easy, lots of fluids, see you at your inauguration, she told him. He teased her: “Make sure to wear something nice!”
The next day, he was dead. Someone had delivered a cellophane-wrapped Christmas basket to his home. Tito Pepe had taken it, alone, to his room, where he untied a ribbon to see the goodies inside. One item in the basket was a bomb, made to look like a round of Edam cheese.
On Page 24 of its Dec. 26, 1971, edition, the New York Times ran this report: “The new mayor of suburban Malabon, 34-year-old Jose Cruz, died tonight in the explosion of a ‘Christmas gift’ handed him by an unidentified man. Mr. Cruz was elected Nov. 8 after a heated campaign against incumbent mayor, Lucio Gutierrez.”
Mom made the hourslong trek to identify his body. I was left with my sisters and the household helpers, one of whom must have put me down for a nap.
What I remember next is feeling an icy chill starting from my toes and slowly traveling up my body. I kept my eyes closed until the cold reached my neck. Then I sat up.
Tito Pepe was standing behind an easy chair at the foot of the bed, his usual debonair hair slicked back, wearing a white dress shirt and shiny, brown suit. He was talking and gesturing naturally, but like a TV on mute, made no sound.
I remember trying very carefully to hear, not at all afraid. The maids, on the other hand, ran around in a tizzy when I appeared downstairs and said, “Tito Pepe is upstairs and he wants to talk to Mom.” There was a bit of a commotion until Mom came home and heard the tale.
She calmly announced she would wait for Tito Pepe in my room. She prayed as she sat, remembering their childhood escapades, how he would pick her up in his white convertible, swing by the movie theater his parents owned and charm some cash from the girls in charge of the registers. She was haunted by their last conversation. She had hoped his cold was getting better.
Mom sat up all night, alone, waiting. “I only ask you make me forget you are dead when you come,” she prayed. Nothing happened. After all these years, she still wonders what he wanted to say.

Texto completo: NEW YORK — With skating season kicking off at Central Park's two rinks, those returning to the ice may notice a lot less of something that was conspicuous in the past: President Trump's name.
Trump's unpopularity among many New Yorkers has led to his name being stripped from some private properties in New York, including the Trump SoHo hotel, now the Dominick, and some former Trump Place condos. But the rinks — two of several public concessions the Trump Organization operates in the city — continued to flash the name prominently through last spring. In recent weeks, though, the company made a significant change, removing the Trump name quietly and without explanation.
At Wollman Rink, Trump's name had long been splashed all over the site, which he has run since taking it on as a rescue mission in the 1980s: in big red letters on the dasher boards' inner walls, on signs listing rules for skaters, and in big letters near the cashier and skate rental. But Tuesday, the name was gone from the boards, replaced by logos saying “Wollman Rink NYC Central Park." It was buried in small type at the bottom of a sign listing hours and fees. And it was represented by a lone “T" over the skate rental counter.
The Trump Organization did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The changes at the rinks were not sought or required by City Hall, officials said.
New York Times
Biden, too, used a reference to lynching — in 1998
WASHINGTON — Joe Biden apologized Tuesday night for for using the phrase "partisan lynching" two decades ago to describe an impeachment proceeding. It came several hours after Biden called President Trump "despicable" and "abhorrent" for saying the impeachment proceedings against him amounted to a "lynching."
It is rare for Biden to offer a fulsome apology; his usually fall into the "I really regret some have taken totally out of context" category, as in 2007, when he called then-candidate Barack Obama, for whom he would later be vice president, "articulate and bright and clean." Tuesday's apology marked how potentially significant his campaign viewed his use of the word.
Unlike his Democratic primary rivals, Biden has often had to clean up his past comments before taking a shot at Trump. The latest example: Trump on Tuesday said the impeachment inquiry amounted to a lynching. Biden and many other Democrats and Republicans denounced his use of the word and said it was intended to deepen racial wounds.
"Impeachment is not 'lynching,' it is part of our Constitution," Biden tweeted. "Our country has a dark, shameful history with lynching, and to even think about making this comparison is abhorrent. It's despicable."
But Tuesday night, CNN unearthed a video of Biden in 1998 using a similar phrase while talking about the impeachment of Bill Clinton.
"Even if the president should be impeached, history is going to question whether or not this was just a partisan lynching or whether or not it was something that in fact met the standard, the very high bar, that was set by the founders as to what constituted an impeachable offense," Biden said in an interview with Wolf Blitzer.
"This wasn't the right word to use and I'm sorry about that," Biden tweeted Tuesday.

Trump's hotel cancels aid group's tribute to Kurds
WASHINGTON — A Christian aid group that planned a gathering to honor and pray for the Kurdish people at President Trump's hotel were told by hotel staff this week that the event was canceled, two members of the group said. "A Night of Prayer for the Kurds" was to be hosted by Frontier Alliance International, a religious nonprofit that provides medical help in the Middle East, its website said.
In recent weeks, Trump pulled US soldiers out of Syria, paving the way for an invasion by Turkey that targeted Kurdish forces. The fighting has prompted Kurdish refugees to flood out of Syria and caused a political headache for the president, who has been accused by Republicans and Democrats alike of abandoning a US ally.
The aid group's founder, Dalton Thomas, said the reasons behind the cancellation were "hazy," adding, "all we know is they canceled."
The group's administrator, Charlene Struebing, said hotel staff expressed "security concerns." Critics of FAI's decision to hold its event at the Trump hotel had planned to protest outside, she said.
Washington Post
Giuliani associates' case may see executive-privilege claim
NEW YORK — One of two indicted associates of President Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, on Wednesday tied the case to the president himself, saying some of the evidence gathered in the campaign finance investigation may be subject to executive privilege.
The argument was raised by a defense lawyer in federal court as Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman pleaded not guilty to federal charges they made illegal contributions to US political candidates in exchange for ­potential influence.
They have become unexpected figures in events at the heart of the House Democrats' impeachment inquiry, having played a role in helping Giuliani's efforts on behalf of Trump to dig up information in Ukraine that could damage ­former vice president Joe Biden.
Giuliani denies wrongdoing but has acknowledged he and the two men worked with Ukrainian officials to collect damaging information about the US ambassador to Ukraine and other targets of Trump, including Biden and his son Hunter Biden.
Edward MacMahon, a lawyer for Parnas, told the judge in the case that the potential for the White House to invoke executive privilege stemmed from the fact that Parnas had used Giuliani as his own lawyer at the same time Giuliani was working as Trump's lawyer.
Parnas and Fruman were charged earlier this month with concealing the source of political donations in order to advance their own business interests and the political interests of Ukrainian government officials.
Trump and Giuliani were not named in the indictment, though prosecutors are investigating whether Giuliani broke lobbying laws in his dealings in Ukraine, according to people familiar with the inquiry.

Texto completo: President Trump’s impeachment prospects may hinge on how the current contradictions in the testimony between William Taylor and Gordon Sondland ultimately get reconciled.
On Tuesday, Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, gave damaging testimony in which he unequivocally linked the decision to delay congressionally appropriated aid to the country with Trump’s insistence that the Ukrainians investigate Joe and Hunter Biden.
But Taylor’s opening statement conflicts in several key ways with the testimony that Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, gave just last week.
To recap the timeline, which is confirmed by texts among U.S. officials and between them and Ukrainian officials, for much of July, the Trump team was dangling the prospect of a White House visit in front of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in an effort to get Ukraine to investigate issues related to Ukraine’s role in the 2016 election interference and Burisma — the company that gave a sweetheart deal to Hunter when Joe Biden was vice president.
On Aug. 29, or about a month after the July 25 Trump-Zelensky phone call, Ukrainians reacted nervously to a Politico report that aid was being held up. (Though the New York Times is now reporting that some Ukrainian officials got word of aid hitting a snag in early August.)
From the Taylor and Sondland opening statements, we now have more context about what was happening at the time of subsequent texts exchanged between the two of them in early September — it’s just that they offer two dramatically different impressions.
Taylor testified that his concerns about the link between the delay of aid and the investigation into the Bidens were initially triggered by a Sept. 1 conversation he had with Tim Morrison, the National Security Council's senior director for Europe and Russia, who conveyed details of a conversation that Sondland had with Andriy Yermak, an adviser to Zelensky.
According to Taylor, Morrison informed him, “Ambassador Sondland told Mr. Yermak that security assistance money would not come until President Zelensky committed to pursue the Burisma investigation. I was alarmed by what Mr. Morrison told me about the Sondland-Yermak conversation. This was the first time I had heard that the security assistance — not just the White House meeting — was conditioned on the investigations.”
This is a significant revelation. To this point, one of the defenses of Trump has been that even though aid was delayed, it couldn’t have been part of a “quid pro quo” because Trump never mentioned it to Zelensky on their phone call, and the Ukrainians didn’t find out the aid was being held up until late August. Yet Taylor is saying that Sondland in fact, in late August/early September, communicated that the aid delay was linked to the demand to investigate the Bidens.
Taylor said this concern is what prompted him to text Sondland, “Are we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?” Sondland replied, “Call me.”
According to Taylor’s account, “During that phone call, Ambassador Sondland told me that President Trump had told him that he wants President Zelensky to state publicly that Ukraine will investigate Burisma and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. Ambassador Sondland also told me that he now recognized that he had made a mistake by earlier telling the Ukrainian officials to whom he spoke that a White House meeting with President Zelensky was dependent on a public announcement of investigations — in fact, Ambassador Sondland said, ‘everything’ was dependent on such an announcement, including security assistance. He said that President Trump wanted President Zelensky ‘in a public box’ by making a public statement about ordering such investigations.”
Taylor testified that he spoke to Morrison the next day and briefed him on this call. During the call, he said they both commiserated with each other about not knowing what to say to Ukrainian officials asking them about the hold on the security assistance. When the two spoke on Sept. 7, Taylor testified that Morrison told him he had a “sinking feeling” after learning of a conversation in which Trump told Sondland that while he wasn’t after a “quid pro quo” he wanted Zelensky to make a public statement to say he was opening an investigation into 2016 and the Bidens.
When the texts were released by Democrats earlier this month, many puzzled over one in which Taylor wrote to Sondland, “The nightmare is they give the interview and don’t get the security assistance. The Russians love it. (And I quit.)” What exactly was the “interview”? According to Taylor, this was a reference to an interview Zelensky was going to do with CNN in which he would announce the investigations.
On Sept. 8, Taylor said he spoke to Sondland, who told him, “President Trump was adamant that President Zelensky, himself, had to ‘clear things up and do it in public.’ President Trump said it was not a ‘quid pro quo.’ Ambassador Sondland said that he had talked to President Zelensky and Mr. Yermak and told them that, although this was not a quid pro quo, if President Zelensky did not ‘clear things up’ in public, we would be at a ‘stalemate.’ I understood a ‘stalemate' to mean that Ukraine would not receive the much-needed military assistance.” That’s when Sondland said Zelensky agreed to do the CNN interview.
This, again, is another important example of Taylor claiming that the connection between aid and the Biden investigation was clearly articulated to Ukraine.
During the same call, he said Sondland described Trump as acting like a businessman in withholding the aid while awaiting a public guarantee of the Biden investigation. “When a businessman is about to sign a check to someone who owes him something, he said, the businessman asks that person to pay up before signing the check.”
On Sept. 9, Taylor texted Sondland, “As I said on the phone, I think it’s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.” Sondland, about 4 1/2 hours later, shoots back by saying, “Bill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump’s intentions. The President has been crystal clear no quid pro quo’s of any kind.”
Of course, saying something isn’t a “quid pro quo” isn’t the important part — what is important is the underlying actions.
Sondland’s testimony, however, offers a much different account of these events. Unlike Taylor, who saw references to Burisma as synonymous with an investigation into the Bidens, Sondland claims that he wasn’t aware that there was any connection between the two. And he portrays his interactions with Trump and Taylor as being much more benign.
Of his ominous sounding “call me” and “stop texting” messages that drew a lot of media attention, Sondland conveyed that he preferred to discuss complex matters over the phone.
Sondland testified that “to the best of my recollection, I do not recall any discussions with the White House on withholding U.S. security assistance from Ukraine in return for assistance with the President’s 2020 re-election campaign.”
He said, “On September 9, 2019, Acting Charge de Affairs/Ambassador William Taylor raised concerns about the possibility that Ukrainians could perceive a linkage between U.S. security assistance and the President’s 2020 reelection campaign. Taking the issue seriously, and given the many versions of speculation that had been circulating about the security aid, I called President Trump directly. I asked the President: ‘What do you want from Ukraine?’ The President responded, ‘Nothing. There is no quid pro quo.’ The President repeated: ‘no quid pro quo’ multiple times. This was a very short call.”
He then said, “I tried hard to address Ambassador Taylor’s concerns because he is a valuable and effective diplomat and I took very seriously the issues he raised. I did not want Ambassador Taylor to leave his post and generate even more turnover in the Ukraine mission. I further encouraged Ambassador Taylor to contact Secretary Pompeo, as I followed up as far as I could go. As you have seen in the press, my contemporaneous messages support my recollection.”
While we do not have access to a transcript of their full testimony, including questioning, there’s a stark difference between Sondland’s account and Taylor’s insistence that Sondland communicated to both him and the Ukrainians that they needed to publicly commit to the investigations to receive the aid.
So how to reconcile the two?
Some would rely heavily on the resume. Taylor is a career diplomat who served in both Democratic and Republican administrations and who was given his job by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Sondland was a businessman who got his job because he was a major donor to the Trump campaign. But such background isn't dispositive.
One thing that undermined Sondland’s credibility was saying he didn’t realize that there was any connection between Biden and Burisma, even though Rudy Giuliani had been talking publicly about the connection, which was the subject of a lengthy story on the front page of the New York Times. Trump, who he was in contact with, also mentioned the Bidens (but not Burisma) in his call with Zelensky.
And Taylor’s testimony is bolstered by the fact that he is said to have taken extensive contemporaneous notes of all of his conversations.
But it seems that an increasingly important element that will go a long way to resolving this will be the testimony of Morrison. According to Taylor, he was in regular contact with Morrison, and they briefed each other on their interactions with Sondland, and what they understood about his interactions with Trump and the Ukrainians. If Morrison testifies and his account squares with Taylor’s version of the events and contradicts Sondland’s more benign interpretation, then it will tip the balance significantly in Taylor’s favor. It suddenly goes from a “he said/he said” situation to a “they said/he said” situation. And that will be deeply damaging to Trump’s defense.

¿Por qué capturaron y soltaron al Ovidio Guzmán, el hijo de ‘El Chapo’? Circulan varias versiones

Texto completo: Más allá de la versión oficial, han florecido múltiples las hipótesis sobre lo que pasó con la captura efímera de Ovidio Guzmán López, el hijo de “El Chapo “. Tras su aprehensión el 17 de octubre, un grupo de civiles fuertemente armados salieron al rescate de Guzmán López. Y lo consiguieron.
En las horas que duró la detención del narcotraficante, la violencia se apoderó de las calles de Culiacán, Sinaloa (México) y dejó alrededor de 13 muertos. Después de la puesta en libertad, los medios empezaron a hacerse eco de lo que ocurrió a lanzar versiones diferentes.
El gobierno justificó su decisión diciendo que quería evitar una “masacre” en Culiacán ya que los militares se habían precipitado , eran pocos y carecían de una orden de cateo. Según cuenta Univision, el ejecutivo mexicano la ofensiva del cartel de Sinaloa -cuyo bastión es Culiacán- rebasó en poco tiempo al ejército y grupos de sicarios acudieron a las afueras de un complejo residencial donde viven familiares de los soldados para amenazar al gobierno.
El presidente, Andrés Manuel López Obrador , dijo en una de sus “mañaneras” que no se arrepiente de su gestión ante el conflicto ya que, en sus propias palabras, “nosotros no vamos a optar nunca por la guerra, por la confrontación o por el uso de la fuerza. Lo que nos importa es la vida de las personas”. “Yo tengo mi conciencia tranquila y sé que actuamos de manera correcta”, aseguró el mandatario.
Se barajan al menos cuatro razones detrás de los hechos que ocurrieron en Culiacán el 17 de octubre:
1. La intervención de ‘El Mayo’ Zambada es una de las versiones que han citado medios que no creen que la célula criminal de Ovidio Guzmán haya actuado sola. Según esta hipótesis, el capo Ismael ‘El Mayo’ Zambada, que lleva más de tres décadas al frente la organización criminal, ayudó a coordinar las acciones violentas que forzaron al Gobierno a replegar el ejército . Además, el exagente de la DEA Jack Riley dijo al semanario Proceso que es posible que Zambada haya impedido la detención de otro miembro de los Guzmán. J. Jesús Esquivel, experto en narcotráfico de esta misma revista, aseguró que “en Culiacán y en ningún lugar de Sinaloa se mueve un dedo sin la bendición y autorización de […] ‘El Mayo’ Zambada.
2. El periodista de The New York Times, Alan Freuer, dijo en Twitter que, además de a Ovidio, los militares también arrestaron a su hermano Iván Archivaldo . De acuerdo con esta versión, Archivaldo conseguiría primero la libertad y se encargaría de dirigir la ofensiva que acabaría en la liberación de Ovidio Guzmán . Para conseguirlo, Freuer comenta que habrían secuestrado a familiares de los soldados.
3. El ejército mexicano insiste, según Univision, en que sus soldados solo rodearon la vivienda en la que se encontraba Ovidio pero “nunca estuvo formalmente detenido . Sin embargo, un audio viral de un supuesto militar contradice la versión oficial afirmando que “cumplimos con el objetivo de detener a un delincuente”. “Se estima que eran entre 700 y 800 delincuentes -continúa el audio-. Solo 350 de nosotros le hicimos frente”. Esta grabación, adelanta Univision, aún no se ha confirmado.
4. El diario The Wall Street Journal informó de que los soldados bajaron las armas porque, entre los videos que recibieron, uno muestra como rehenes a los miembros de una patrulla . En otro se ve a un soldado ejecutado con un disparo en la cabeza, según dijo un exfuncionario al citado diario. Por otro lado, Marcelo Erbrard, canciller mexicano, reconoció que miembros del crimen organizado se colocaron el jueves frente a viviendas de familiares del ejército esperando la orden para abrir fuego.

Texto completo: More than 20 area authors will discuss the world of publishing next month at Naperville Public Library’s second annual Local Author Day.
The celebration will run from 1 to 4 p.m. Saturday, Nov. 2, at the 95th St. Library, 3015 Cedar Glade Drive.
It will feature a diverse mix of well-known and first-time authors who will discuss the publishing world, meet and greet attendees and have signed copies of creative materials available for purchase.
"If you like books or support local creativity, Local Author Day is perfect for you," said Karen Toonen, collection development librarian and Local Author Day co-chairwoman. "Both bibliophiles and aspiring authors will be able to connect one-on-one with Chicagoland talent."
Mary Kubica, one of Local Author Day’s panelists, found success with her critically acclaimed debut novel "The Good Girl," which has been translated into more than 30 languages and sold more than 2 million copies worldwide.
But before Kubica was a New York Times bestselling author, she was an unpublished writer frustrated with the prospects of ever getting published.
After reaching out to nearly 100 agents with her first novel, only one offered her representation.
"My advice to writers is to not give up, to keep searching until you find someone as passionate about your work as you are," Kubica said. "Know that if what you’ve written isn’t catching someone’s eye now, that doesn’t mean it won’t in a few years. Be persistent."
Author Essence McDowell, who co-wrote "Lifting as They Climbed: Mapping a History of Black Women on Chicago’s South Side," took a different approach.
Along with writing partner Mariame Kaba, the duo decided to self-publish.
"It gave us complete autonomy with the content, design, information and financial capacity over the project," she said. "I designed the entire book from cover to cover — Mariame had been doing research on black women’s histories for decades — and together we joined forces to write the book and map out the tour. Self-publishing allowed us to do this without any limiting constrictions."
Also speaking on the panel is romance writer Melonie Johnson, who moonlights as an audiobook narrator. Being a double-major in English and theater, Johnson combined the two and found a career in narration by accident.
"During conferences and workshops, authors often bring samples of their writing to read out loud in critique sessions," she said. "Many authors are introverts and prefer not to read out loud in a crowd … I am not one of them."
For Ilya Kabirov, adult services librarian and co-chairman, Local Author Day is about crossing an item off his bucket list.
"Publishing a book is one of my life goals," he said. "Local Author Day offers a wonderful opportunity to learn from more experienced authors about the way to achieve that goal."
A panel discussion from 1 to 2:30 p.m. will explore the many paths of publishing and discuss ways aspiring authors can reach audiences using different forms of creative media.
Authors on the panel include Kubica, Johnson and McDowell, along with Stacey Ballis, Sonali Dev and Shaha Drehs.
Other local authors scheduled to attend are J. Leigh Bailey, Donald J. Bingle, Pat Camalliere, Mayank Chhaya, Michelle Cox, Kristina Cowan, John Everson, Michelle Falkoff, Kevin Frantz, Keziah Frost, Kate Gingold Libby Fischer Hellman, Lou Holly, Nic Joseph, Becky Klein-Collins, Barbara Lipkin, J. Michael Major, Beshanda Owusu, J.T. Patten, RenÃ©e Rosen and Damian Serbu.

Texto completo: Sarah Frey is thinking about running for Congress. Only one thing is stopping her.
"What if I win?" she said.
Frey, 43, lives in the 15th Congressional District of Illinois. It is the largest district in the state by size, and the smallest by population. Most of the district is farmland, and Frey wants to give farmers a voice in Congress.
Frey is herself a farmer. In fact, if you have a jack-o'-lantern this Halloween, there is a good chance she grew it. Her company, Frey Farms, raises more pumpkins than any other farm in the country.
A New York Times article called her the Pumpkin Queen of America, and the name has stuck. Her family-run company owns 15,000 acres in seven states, from the Bootheel of Missouri to Florida.
Hers is an amazing success story.
She grew up in a large family on a small, failing farm in unincorporated Orchardville, Ill., about 20 minutes outside of Mount Vernon. The family was poor; they ate only what they could grow or hunt, and had no money left over for anything other than the barest essentials.
She hated it.
Her mother had a delivery route, buying melons from farms in southern Indiana and delivering them to eight grocery stores in Illinois. When she was just 8 years old, she began accompanying her mother on her route.
"For me it would be a chance to get off the farm," Frey said.
When Frey was 16, her mother got a job at a radio station. Frey took over the melon route, worked hard at the job and increased the number of stores she was selling to.
She was still in her teens when she drove past a sign announcing the construction of a new Walmart distribution center in Olney, Ill. She was already delivering to a few scattered Walmart stores, and she thought it would be easier if she could just bring them all to this one location.
She went inside, where she was introduced to the center's new produce buyer, who was just setting up her office. That woman asked if Frey could deliver, say, three loads of one kind of melon and two loads of another every week. Frey agreed to the deliveries, and it was only as she was walking out the door that she had a stunning realization.
The woman was talking about semi-trailer loads. Frey's idea of a load had been her relatively small three-quarter-ton pickup truck.
"I had to figure out how to make it happen. That first year was so challenging, running around to all of those farms. Sometimes we had to go to six or eight different farms just to get enough produce to fill a semitruck. Sometimes it was a hair-on-fire experience. We were scraping and scrapping, we would go to any farm just to fill our truck," she said.
She never could have survived without the help of her brothers, who left college when she asked them to come help save the family business. She gave up her own dream of going to college, too.
"I had to fight like crazy just to save this little tiny farm, 80 acres of dirt in the middle of nowhere," she said.
Frey still lives on that original farm, though she also has a house in Florida. Today, the company not only grows and processes produce, it also sells several different types of juice. Next year, the Sarah's Homegrown line will start selling a pumpkin pie.
"I was actually inspired while on a trip to France. I had this pumpkin pie from a street vendor that was so delicious I was decoding the ingredients that went into it," she said.
She realized as she was eating it that it used an heirloom pumpkin her company already sells. It's one of more than 100 varieties they grow.
She may make more money from watermelon, but pumpkins are Frey's passion.
"Pumpkins in other parts of the world are as common as potatoes are in America. Pumpkins in Australia are consumed almost daily," she said.
"When I started traveling more, I realized we are just about the only country in the world that only carves up pumpkins."
Frey is determined to change that. Pumpkins, a member of the squash family, have a great deal of nutritional value. And then there's the taste.
"My preference is to use the pumpkin in savory dishes. I like soups and stews, I like to cut up the pumpkin to use it like potato," she said.
Next up is making a pumpkin beverage similar to a pumpkin cider for retail stores. Unlike a lot of pumpkin-spice products, it will have real pumpkin in it. And they are also working on frozen pumpkin to be sold in grocery store freezers along with other frozen vegetables.
"When I was a little girl, I didn't have access to those packaged goods. We were growing our own foods," she said.
That explains her interest in packaged goods today. But she also wants these items to reflect the simpler times and simpler food that she grew up with -- "I wanted to make food that was clean and delicious and as close to the farm as you can get," she said.
If you think Frey's life story would make a good book, she has already beat you to it. Her memoir, "The Growing Season," will be published by Random House next June.

Trump's condemnation of violent video is hard to take seriously

Texto completo: Re “Trump condemns violent video shown at event" (Page A2, Oct. 15): President Trump's condemnation of a fake violent video showing him shooting members of the news media and political opponents does not square with his own practices. He has retweeted fake videos showing him beating up a person whose face bears the CNN logo and him knocking Hillary Clinton down while she is entering an airliner.
He has said that if he shot someone dead on New York's Fifth Avenue, he wouldn't lose a vote, and promised to pay the legal fees of supporters if they beat up a protester. He warned of violence if he didn't get the 2016 nomination, and of a civil war if he was impeached. In March 2016, before he was even nominated or elected, The New York Times published a documentary video record, appropriately called “Trump's history of encouraging violence."
Therefore, how can his condemnation of the most recent video be taken as serious or sincere?
The video also depicts him attacking former president Barack Obama, which alone should attract the attention of the Secret Service. They should investigate the showing of such a video inside Trump's own Florida resort property.
These acts, taken together and combined, also warrant inclusion into a further article of impeachment.

Exxon's Climate Change Deceit

Texto completo: New York's attorney general is about to square off against the oil giant in court.
The New York attorney general's office will take its case against Exxon Mobil to trial on Tuesday, arguing that one of the world's largest oil and gas companies misled its shareholders and the public by misrepresenting the risks that climate change poses to the value of its oil and gas assets.
The lawsuit is one of several the company is facing that if successful, would force Exxon Mobil, which took in some $ 290 billion in revenue last year, to account for the true costs of its nature-crushing fossil fuel business, making it less competitive with wind, solar and other renewable energy sources and thus accelerating the transition to a clean-energy economy.
This is Economics 101. It's cheap to pollute if you don't include the costs of the damage on your books. And for the world's oil companies, those current and future damages are nearly incalculable if you consider how climate change is leading to the collapse of the planet's diversity, and the financial losses and human suffering that will result from rising seas and temperatures. One recent study estimates that the world's top 20 fossil fuel companies are responsible for 35 percent of energy-related greenhouse gas emissions since 1965. Exxon Mobil was the fourth-largest contributor on the list.
What makes this especially mind-numbing is that Exxon knew for decades that its business was altering the climate but repeatedly deceived the public, just as the tobacco companies knew their cigarettes caused cancer but denied it. The attorney general's office, now under the command of Letitia James (her predecessor, Barbara Underwood, brought the suit) argues that to mislead the investing public, Exxon "erected a Potemkin village to create the illusion that it had fully considered the risks of future climate change regulation." But "in reality, Exxon knew that its representations were not supported by the facts and were contrary to its internal business practices."
Exxon had denied wrongdoing and called the case politically motivated.
But in internal memos dating back to the 1970s, Exxon predicted that the effects of fossil fuel emissions could "indeed be catastrophic (at least for a substantial fraction of the world's population)." In 1982 it estimated with stunning accuracy that the atmosphere would contain 415 parts per million of carbon dioxide this year and what that would mean for increased global temperatures. The parade of horribles foreseen by the company -- sea level rise, more intense rain and snow, inundation, hotter temperatures, desertification, agricultural disruption -- are now regular features of the nightly news. And it will only get worse.
But rather than warn the public, Exxon spent over $ 30 million on climate-denying think tanks and researchers to confuse the public about climate science -- a confusion that persists to this day -- while doubling down on its destructive business model. More than half of all industrial carbon dioxide emissions were produced after Exxon heard the clarion call from its own scientists to change direction.
Exxon now concedes that climate change is happening because of the burning of fossil fuels, and it has spent a modest amount on low-carbon investments. Still the company plans to increase its oil output by 25 percent by 2025 at a time when the world should be sharply reducing its greenhouse gas emissions. Actions speak louder than words.
New York is just one front in a legal struggle against the fossil fuel industry, one that the organization I direct has been involved in by financing legal advocacy groups representing plaintiffs in two other lawsuits against the oil giant. Altogether, Exxon and other oil and gas companies are facing at least a dozen other lawsuits, primarily from municipalities, including New York City and Baltimore, and one state, Rhode Island, which want help paying for the substantial climate damages the companies have already caused.
For coastal communities, the cost of defending against rising seas alone will exceed $ 400 billion, according to a recent study by the Center for Climate Integrity, which the Rockefeller Family Fund supports. This, of course, doesn't include other enormous expenses. Puerto Rico, Houston and towns in the Midwest are still reeling from climate-juiced storm systems that ravaged homes and infrastructure and led to the deaths of thousands of people. The burden of these costs will fall squarely on all of us who pay taxes unless the responsible climate polluters are required to pay their fair share.
These lawsuits are an important step for society to free itself from the grasp of this lethal industry. Most directly, the suits can provide the billions necessary for communities to repair climate damages and fortify their infrastructure for the storms ahead. And if these cases are successful, Big Oil will finally be forced to assume a greater portion of the costs they have foisted on taxpayers. Their business, which significantly lagged the S & P 500 over the past five years, will take another deserved financial hit.
These cases are also teachable moments. We're not in this mess because we heat our homes or drive our children to school, which is what the fossil fuel companies want us to think. We're victims of a small group of gargantuan companies that recklessly and deliberately ignored the implications of their own science and unabashedly worked to deceive the public.
If you don't believe me, then consider the words of the chief judge of the United States District Court in Rhode Island, William E. Smith, a George W. Bush appointee. In a procedural opinion in the state's climate case against Exxon and other major oil and gas companies, Judge Smith wrote in July that those companies have "extracted, advertised, and sold a substantial percentage of the fossil fuels burned globally since the 1960s." He continued:
This activity has released an immense amount of greenhouse gas into the Earth's atmosphere, changing its climate and leading to all kinds of displacement, death (extinctions, even), and destruction. What is more, defendants understood the consequences of their activity decades ago, when transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable sources of energy would have saved a world of trouble. But instead of sounding the alarm, defendants went out of their way to becloud the emerging scientific consensus and further delay changes -- however existentially necessary -- that would in any way interfere with their multibillion-dollar profits. All while quietly readying their capital for the coming fallout.
That's the case against Big Oil in a nutshell. The industry is based on a deceit. The companies know the planet is headed toward a climate catastrophe, but they keep drilling away, trying to squeeze the last nickel from their deadly product. It will be up to the judge overseeing the New York case, Barry Ostrager, to determine whether Exxon's misrepresentations violated New York's securities law, but when it comes to the moral repugnancy of the company's climate deception, the verdict is in.
Lee Wasserman is the director of the Rockefeller Family Fund. Among its goals is to accelerate the transformation away from fossil fuels by opposing additional fossil fuel infrastructure, drilling, mining and exporting.

Texto completo: A reader urges Mrs. Clinton to stay out of the campaign. Also: Turkey's nuclear ambitions; President Trump's foreign policy playbook; the case for regulation.
To the Editor:
Re "Tulsi Gabbard Lashes Back at Hillary Clinton After Claim of Russian Influence" (nytimes.com, Oct. 18):
In this lead-up to the primaries, Democrats should be operating under their version of Ronald Reagan's 11th commandment: Thou shalt not speak ill of any fellow Democrat. Doing so could weaken another candidate who might end up as the nominee.
Hillary Clinton continues to do what she has done for years -- create conflicts, distractions and problems for the Democratic Party.
The accusations she made about Tulsi Gabbard being a Russian asset, without offering any evidence, are yet another example of her self-absorption, ignoring what is best to get a Democrat back in the White House.
The Democrats need to focus on cleaning up President Trump's mess, a mess that Mrs. Clinton's prior failure helped make possible.
If Mrs. Clinton has proof of her accusations, she should put that proof out in public. If not, she should stop her whining, blaming and pointless meddling and go back to a quiet retirement.

Turkey Wants a Bomb? Don't Let It Happen!
To the Editor:
Re "Emboldened, Erdogan Seeks Nuclear Bomb" (front page, Oct. 21):
So the Turks want a bomb. Given its geopolitical position, this makes sense. However, the United States must never allow it to happen. Not because I fear that Turkey would use the bomb, but because if Ankara has it, then leaders in Tehran, Riyadh and Cairo, among others, will quickly work to develop it, too.
Thus, we cannot allow the first domino to fall. This means working diplomatically to persuade Ankara that it is not in its interest to develop the bomb, while working with intelligence agencies to prevent Turkey from procuring the means necessary.
If this tactic fails, and it may, the United States and our European allies must assure Turkey that if it begins developing nuclear weapons, those facilities will be pre-emptively destroyed. Harsh, yes, but the alternative of proliferation in an already unstable region is far more severe.

How Trump Really Conducts Foreign Policy
To the Editor:
Re "The Trump Guide to Diplomacy" (Op-Ed, Oct. 16):
Peter Navarro, assistant to the president for trade and manufacturing policy, outlines a principled and orderly approach to diplomacy that he calls the president's approach. But this is President Trump's real approach to diplomacy:
Abrogate or denigrate prior treaties and relationships, like the Paris climate accord, the Iran nuclear agreement and NATO.
Pick unwinnable trade wars with other countries, with tariffs paid for by American consumers and with adverse effects on American farmers and the national and global economies.
Act unpredictably, without input from diplomatic, economic and military advisers, to our country's detriment.
Conduct diplomacy by tweet.
Use back-channel communications and rogue diplomatic operatives to avoid deliberation and scrutiny.
Over all, take actions that benefit Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin.
This is the harsh reality, not the orderly, principled approach described by Mr. Navarro.

Rules Keep People Safe
To the Editor:
Be careful what you ask for when it comes to deregulation. You might get it. Boeing was given a regimen of self-regulation by the Federal Aviation Administration, resulting in a disastrous lack of accountability.
The Food and Drug Administration allowed an array of unregulated e-cigarette and vaping products without requiring safety data. The results so far: an epidemic of teen nicotine addiction (a disease in its own right) and a slew of products associated with lung illnesses. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now says no vaping products can be considered safe.
Rules keep people safe. Regulations can be well meaning but poorly done or overdone and therefore easy to lampoon as part of a "nanny state." However, do busy citizens really have the expertise to assess the harms and safety risks of products like airplanes or those delivering addictive drugs like nicotine?

Texto completo: According to PG&E: "For public safety, it may be necessary for us to turn off electricity when gusty winds and dry conditions  are forecasted." And that's exactly what the utility did on Oct. 9 to 800,000 customers in Northern and Central California.
Although there were gusty winds, they occurred in only a few areas. Much of the huge shutoff area was unaffected by adverse weather conditions and "far from the risk of fire."
Instead of controlling the power grid from a central location, PG&E had to send crews into the field to manually control the outages. "It's an incredible travesty, this sort of really crude and unsophisticated approach for dealing with what is a very serious issue," Jack Brouwer, an engineering professor and director of the National Fuel Cell Research Center at UC Irvine, told The New York Times.
The PG&E website, where people were supposed to go to see if their power would be shut off, crashed for much of the critical period when this was happening.
Bill Johnson, the CEO of PG&E whose annual base salary is $2.5 million, said, "As a result of this, millions of people have been without a fundamental service they expect and deserve." He continued, "We are in the business of providing power, not taking it away." And yet, take it away he did.
Gov. Gavin Newsom said, "This is not, from my perspective, a climate change story so much as a story of greed and neglect."
Let's take a step back. This is the same company that went bankrupt because of the disasters it caused. PG&E incurred $30 billion in liabilities due to wildfires caused by faulty equipment. Most recently, it brought us the Camp Fire in 2018, the deadliest wildfire in California history, which killed 85 people, burned 150,000 acres and was started by faulty electrical equipment. And let's not forget the San Bruno gas pipeline explosion in 2010 that killed eight people and resulted in the Public Utilities Commission fining the company $1.6 billion.
Faulty electrical equipment, along with unstable power poles, overhanging trees and excessive vegetation are all problems that can cause electrical fires and are all problems that can be largely fixed by PG&E. Shutting down that faulty equipment doesn't fix it, only delays the dangers from its operation. Unfortunately, it's difficult to devote the resources necessary to fix these problems when executives are making multimillion-dollar salaries and resources are being diverted to please PG&E shareholders.
PG&E customers suffer greatly from shutoffs, which create dangerous conditions for everyone affected, particularly those who are not mobile or who have medical problems. A forced power shutoff is not just turning off the lights.
In a shutoff, there is no refrigeration, no air conditioning, no internet, no elevators and no microwaves during the hottest time of year. In buildings where water is provided by electric pumping, a forced shutoff means no water or plumbing. Access to emergency services is limited. Schools, churches, restaurants, shopping malls, gas stations and other retail establishments must close. Maybe it is in the interest of public safety to not have shutoffs.
With climate change expected to cause more frequent and dangerous wildfires in the coming years, the last thing the people of California need is a power company with a policy that when followed to its logical conclusion, takes us back to the 19th century, when there was no electricity.
PG&E is like a modern-day HAL, the computer in the movie "2001: A Space Odyssey" that malfunctions and slowly turns off all power in the spaceship. Do we really want HAL in charge of our power?
What California needs is an energetic response to the challenges of wildfires and climate change that includes using new technologies. We need to find a power company that is up to these challenges.

Lee Wasserman: Exxon spent $30 million on climate change denial

Texto completo: The New York attorney general’s office will take its case against Exxon Mobil to trial on Tuesday, arguing that one of the world’s largest oil and gas companies misled its shareholders and the public by misrepresenting the risks that climate change poses to the value of its oil and gas assets.
The lawsuit is one of several the company is facing that if successful, would force Exxon Mobil, which took in some $290 billion in revenue last year, to account for the true costs of its nature-crushing fossil fuel business, making it less competitive with wind, solar and other renewable energy sources and thus accelerating the transition to a clean-energy economy.
This is Economics 101. It’s cheap to pollute if you don’t include the costs of the damage on your books. And for the world’s oil companies, those current and future damages are nearly incalculable if you consider how climate change is leading to the collapse of the planet’s diversity, and the financial losses and human suffering that will result from rising seas and temperatures. One recent study estimates that the world’s top 20 fossil fuel companies are responsible for 35 percent of energy-related greenhouse gas emissions since 1965. Exxon Mobil was the fourth-largest contributor on the list.
What makes this especially mind-numbing is that Exxon knew for decades that its business was altering the climate but repeatedly deceived the public, just as the tobacco companies knew their cigarettes caused cancer but denied it. The attorney general’s office, now under the command of Letitia James (her predecessor, Barbara Underwood, brought the suit) argues that to mislead the investing public, Exxon “erected a Potemkin village to create the illusion that it had fully considered the risks of future climate change regulation.” But “in reality, Exxon knew that its representations were not supported by the facts and were contrary to its internal business practices.”
Exxon had denied wrongdoing and called the case politically motivated.
But in internal memos dating back to the 1970s, Exxon predicted that the effects of fossil fuel emissions could “indeed be catastrophic (at least for a substantial fraction of the world’s population).” In 1982 it estimated with stunning accuracy that the atmosphere would contain 415 parts per million of carbon dioxide this year and what that would mean for increased global temperatures. The parade of horribles foreseen by the company — sea level rise, more intense rain and snow, inundation, hotter temperatures, desertification, agricultural disruption — are now regular features of the nightly news. And it will only get worse.
But rather than warn the public, Exxon spent over $30 million on climate-denying think tanks and researchers to confuse the public about climate science — a confusion that persists to this day — while doubling down on its destructive business model. More than half of all industrial carbon dioxide emissions were produced after Exxon heard the clarion call from its own scientists to change direction.
Exxon now concedes that climate change is happening because of the burning of fossil fuels, and it has spent a modest amount on low-carbon investments. Still the company plans to increase its oil output by 25 percent by 2025 at a time when the world should be sharply reducing its greenhouse gas emissions. Actions speak louder than words.
New York is just one front in a legal struggle against the fossil fuel industry, one that the organization I direct has been involved in by financing legal advocacy groups representing plaintiffs in two other lawsuits against the oil giant. Altogether, Exxon and other oil and gas companies are facing at least a dozen other lawsuits, primarily from municipalities, including New York City and Baltimore, and one state, Rhode Island, which want help paying for the substantial climate damages the companies have already caused.
For coastal communities, the cost of defending against rising seas alone will exceed $400 billion, according to a recent study by the Center for Climate Integrity, which the Rockefeller Family Fund supports. This, of course, doesn’t include other enormous expenses. Puerto Rico, Houston and towns in the Midwest are still reeling from climate-juiced storm systems that ravaged homes and infrastructure and led to the deaths of thousands of people. The burden of these costs will fall squarely on all of us who pay taxes unless the responsible climate polluters are required to pay their fair share.
These lawsuits are an important step for society to free itself from the grasp of this lethal industry. Most directly, the suits can provide the billions necessary for communities to repair climate damages and fortify their infrastructure for the storms ahead. And if these cases are successful, Big Oil will finally be forced to assume a greater portion of the costs they have foisted on taxpayers. Their business, which significantly lagged the S&P 500 over the past five years, will take another deserved financial hit.
These cases are also teachable moments. We’re not in this mess because we heat our homes or drive our children to school, which is what the fossil fuel companies want us to think. We’re victims of a small group of gargantuan companies that recklessly and deliberately ignored the implications of their own science and unabashedly worked to deceive the public.
If you don’t believe me, then consider the words of the chief judge of the United States District Court in Rhode Island, William E. Smith, a George W. Bush appointee. In a procedural opinion in the state’s climate case against Exxon and other major oil and gas companies, Judge Smith wrote in July that those companies have “extracted, advertised, and sold a substantial percentage of the fossil fuels burned globally since the 1960s.” He continued:
“This activity has released an immense amount of greenhouse gas into the Earth’s atmosphere, changing its climate and leading to all kinds of displacement, death (extinctions, even), and destruction. What is more, defendants understood the consequences of their activity decades ago, when transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable sources of energy would have saved a world of trouble. But instead of sounding the alarm, defendants went out of their way to becloud the emerging scientific consensus and further delay changes — however existentially necessary — that would in any way interfere with their multibillion-dollar profits. All while quietly readying their capital for the coming fallout.”
That’s the case against Big Oil in a nutshell. The industry is based on a deceit. The companies know the planet is headed toward a climate catastrophe, but they keep drilling away, trying to squeeze the last nickel from their deadly product. It will be up to the judge overseeing the New York case, Barry Ostrager, to determine whether Exxon’s misrepresentations violated New York’s securities law, but when it comes to the moral repugnancy of the company’s climate deception, the verdict is in.
Lee Wasserman is the director of the Rockefeller Family Fund. Among its goals is to accelerate the transformation away from fossil fuels by opposing additional fossil fuel infrastructure, drilling, mining and exporting.

Texto completo: Un reporte de The New York Times hecho por la periodista Paulina Villegas afirma que los residentes de Culiacán apoyaron la decisión del presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador de liberar a Ovidio Guzmán López, alias “El Ratón” .
El texto destaca que aunque analistas y medios nacionales y extranjeros cuestionaron la liberación del hijo de Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán Loera , quienes vivieron la violencia desatada en Culiacán, Sinaloa, consideran que fue la mejor opción.
“Los residentes de Culiacán, la capital del estado de Sinaloa y el lugar de nacimiento del cártel, no comparten esos sentimientos. Dicen que la decisión salvó vidas” , indica la autora del texto, quien realizó una crónica de los días posteriores a los hechos violentos.
La historia expone los resultados del enfrentamiento y el miedo generalizado entre la población.
“Las huellas de la violencia estaban en todas partes. Los agujeros de bala golpearon edificios gubernamentales, restaurantes y hogares, e innumerables residentes llevaron consigo el trauma de lo que habían vivido ”, indica.
Las acciones del Cártel de Sinaloa provocaron terror entre los residentes de la capital.
“En los días posteriores al asedio de la ciudad de Culiacán por el Cártel de Sinaloa, los residentes se sintieron aliviados: alivio de que el terror haya terminado”, indica el Times. “Que más personas no murieron”.
La postura de los “culichis” coincide con la del presidente López Obrador, quien ha defendido la decisión de liberar a Guzmán López, a fin de de evitar más muertes.
“Ningún criminal vale más que una vida” , habría dicho el mandatario, quien este martes reconoció que desconocía que había un operativo para detener a “El Ratón”, aunque un día después de los enfrentamientos había dicho que respaldó la liberación del hijo de Guzmán Loera.

US Rep. Pressley slams Trump 'lynching' remark but says people should stay focused on impeachment

Texto completo: Massachusetts US Representative Ayanna Pressley on Tuesday joined the chorus of voices criticizing President Donald Trump for using the word “lynching" to describe the impeachment investigation of Trump underway in the House of Representatives.
But Pressley also said in a tweet that people shouldn't be distracted by their outrage at the Republican president and instead focus on what's expected to be key testimony today from a US diplomat as the impeachment case against Trump gains momentum.
Trump claimed in his tweet that he was being impeached “without due process or fairness or any legal rights."
“All Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here - a lynching. But we will WIN!" he said.
Trump drew widespread criticism for his jarring use of the word “lynching" in describing his political situation. Thousands of black Americans were lynched, or executed in mob violence, after the Civil War. The NAACP says there were 4,743 lynchings from 1882 to 1968, mostly in the South, including 3,446 lynchings in which the victims were black.
Pressley, a Democrat, tweeted that she hadn't “even had coffee yet" and Trump, “the bigoted man who called for the execution of the exonerated 5 is tossing the word 'lynching' around."
She was apparently referring to the case of the Central Park 5, who were wrongly convicted of the brutal rape of a jogger in New York City in 1989. Trump took out newspaper advertisements at the time calling for New York State to adopt the death penalty (though the ads never explicitly called for the death of the five defendants). Trump told Tne New York Times in June he would not apologize for taking out the ads.
Presssley continued in her tweet, “Lord give me the strength to not take the bait but hold this man accountable for every single thing he says and does."
In a tweet posted moments later, she told her nearly half-million followers that Trump was “using a predictable play to try to distract & divide. We see right through him."
She included a link to an NBC News story about the closed-door testimony expected Tuesday from diplomat Bill Taylor, one of a series of witnesses who have been questioned by the House impeachment inquiry about Trump's efforts to push Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate his political foe, former Democratic vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter.
Taylor is the author of a key text message that has been scrutinized as part of the investigation into whether Trump held up military to pressure Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.
“As I said on the phone, I think it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign," Taylor texted another diplomat in September.
Pressley is a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, one of the committees investigating Trump.

Texto completo: On the campaign trail in 2015, Donald Trump said it was “disgusting” that a big corporation could escape taxation by using bookkeeping tricks to shift profits out of the United States. Now the Trump administration is thinking about making it easier to play those tricks. Bloomberg reported that the Treasury Department, in a development sure to gladden the hearts of the corporate class, was considering a rollback of rules written by the Obama administration to prevent the very kinds of shenanigans Trump once condemned.
While Congress focuses on the question of whether to impeach Trump, the potential change in tax policy is a reminder that the wheels of the government grind on — and that Trump’s administration continues to make decisions that are bad for most Americans.
In recent months, the Agriculture Department has decided to reduce inspections at the slaughterhouses that process the nation’s pork; the Environmental Protection Agency has decided to let farmers and factories dump toxic chemicals into thousands of acres of previously protected wetlands; and the Labor Department has ruled that states can perform drug tests on applicants for unemployment benefits, allowing Texas, Mississippi and Wisconsin to begin efforts to curtail aid for people who need help.
These changes in regulatory policy are part of a clear pattern. The Trump administration has worked assiduously to reduce federal protections for consumers, workers and the environment, making the United States a dirtier and more dangerous place in which to live.
The Trump administration also continues to flout its obligation to comply with existing law.
A federal judge said last week that the Education Department, under the leadership of Betsy DeVos, had committed 16,000 violations of a court order by improperly seeking to collect student loan payments, including docking paychecks and confiscating tax refunds.
Magistrate Judge Sallie Kim of the United States District Court in San Francisco described the department’s behavior as “deeply disturbing,” adding, “I’m not sending anyone to jail yet, but it’s good to know I have that ability.”
The Obama administration erased the debts of thousands of former students of Corinthian Colleges, a for-profit company that went out of business in 2015, under a policy that forgives the loans of students who are the victims of a fraud. Under DeVos, however, the department began to grant only partial debt relief to Corinthian students, prompting a lawsuit. Kim ordered the government to suspend collection efforts while the case winds through the courts. She said she was “astounded” by the failure to comply.
Meanwhile, the department has finalized a new rule making it much harder for future student loan recipients to get relief from the government even if they are victims of fraud.
The Trump administration’s regulatory policy can generally be summarized as marching to the orders of the businesses it regulates. Indeed, the administration has pushed so hard to reduce regulation that even companies have sometimes expressed reservations: Four major automobile manufacturers have refused to embrace Trump’s campaign to prevent California from reducing air pollution, instead striking a deal with California to meet stricter emissions standards.
Trump also has an obsession with erasing rules written under President Barack Obama.
The potential rewrite of the tax rules governing corporate profits is an example of both tendencies. Corporations dislike the Obama-era rules, which cracked down on the practice of sending profits to a foreign branch, lending the money back to the home office and then writing off the interest expense. Under the rules, the government can prevent companies from treating those transfers as loans, and thus from claiming the resulting tax benefits.
Corporations argue that the current rule is broad, burdensome, and no longer necessary because the 2017 tax law limited the incentive for profit-shifting by reducing the tax rate on corporate income. But that overstates the effect of the law, which still leaves room for companies to hide profits. There is simply no good reason to weaken the Obama-era rule.
The administration’s penchant for this kind of petty vandalism does not add one whit to the case for Trump’s impeachment. It is instead a reminder that if Trump does stand for reelection in 2020, Americans can improve their lives by voting for someone else.

SMALL POLICY TWEAKS WON'T FIX FACEBOOK THE SOCIAL MEDIA GIANT'S BIGGEST PROBLEMS ARE ENTIRELY INTERNAL

Texto completo: Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, writing in The Wall Street Journal, insists that his company will not act as a proxy censor for the world's governments - that it has neither the capacity nor the legitimacy to do so, and that attempting it would constitute an improper exercise of corporate power.
"I don't think it's right for a private company to censor politicians or the news in a democracy," he writes. With exceptions, of course: "We don't allow content if there's a risk of real-world harm, and we don't allow voter suppression."
Mr. Zuckerberg's attempt to position Facebook as a kind of night watchman looking after community safety rather than a censor cannot bear very much scrutiny. Private companies of course exercise editorial judgment of politicians and the news in our democracy constantly - The New York Times, for example, is a private company, and it will not simply repeat every claim it receives or print every political ad somebody wants to pay for. ABC, HarperCollins, National Review - everybody makes decisions about content, and those decisions are made based on a combination of ethical, intellectual and commercial considerations.
There's no avoiding it.
Facebook could, in theory, be a platform permitting a very wide range of communication, intervening only in extraordinary circumstances, e.g. the publication of child pornography or schematics for nuclear weapons. But governments, especially European governments, will not allow it to be that. Neither will the hysterically conformist culture of these United States circa 2019. "Information wants to be free," the techno-utopians used to say. But very few people actually want information to be free.
And Facebook's management is no less shaped by the homogeneity-enforcing culture of tribal imperative than is any other similar company's. This is incomprehensible to Mr. Zuckerberg and other men of his kind for the same reason fish don't know what water is.
Facebook is not exactly a publisher and not exactly not a publisher; Mr. Zuckerberg and his team wish to avoid admitting that what Facebook does is at least partly editorial in character, because such a confession would bring with it responsibilities (and, possibly, liabilities) that Facebook does not wish to take on.
The rhetoric of "safety" must be understood as an intellectual dodge and nothing more, a way for Facebook to enjoy the desultory exercise of editorial powers without taking on more editorial responsibilities. The enforcement of such nonempirical standards as taste and judgment implies a kind of cultural and aesthetic hierarchy that Silicon Valley's ruling class embraces ruthlessly but will never admit to countenancing.
Hence the tech moguls' confused attitude toward everything from the enjoyment of vast wealth to the urgent question of free speech. In both cases, tech executives are working backward from their own social comfort to corporate policy.
That much is obvious from Facebook's own peculiar selectivity. The figures that Facebook and other social-media companies have blacklisted include most prominently gadflies and media entrepreneurs such as Milo Yiannopoulos and Laura Loomer - who are straight-up dopes, rodeo clowns rather than storm troopers. These people are not excluded from Facebook because they present a danger to anything other than good taste; they are excluded because they are unpopular - or, to be more precise, because they are unfashionable.
For comparison, consider the parallel cases of Louis Farrakhan and the Rev. Al Sharpton. Facebook was finally shamed into banishing Mr. Farrakhan on tit-for-tat grounds, inasmuch as his racism and anti-Semitism are more plain and more consequential than whatever prejudices might be reasonably attributed to, say, Alex Jones or Gavin McInnes, crackpots and bigots though they may be.
Mr. Sharpton's views are only slightly if at all less odious than Mr. Farrakhan's, and he is one of the handful of political communicators in American public life whose rhetorical excesses have been very closely linked to murderous political violence, his provocations having preceded the Crown Heights riots and the massacre at Freddy's Fashion Mart. But he remains welcome in polite society, and it is impossible to imagine Facebook's excluding an MSNBC host.
I don't make these comparisons to point out hypocrisy. I mean instead to draw attention to something else entirely: that Mr. Zuckerberg and his colleagues do not actually understand their own product or the role Facebook and other social media platforms actually play in political life in the United States - beginning with the fact that our political discourse is only incidentally about politics.
On the front end, platforms such as Facebook and Twitter are trivial as technological achievements. The interesting part of Facebook largely remains invisible to its users. But crude as the social-media interfaces may be, they intersect in very powerful ways with cultural currents that are experienced at the moment as extraordinarily urgent, though the long-term durability of that urgency is far from certain.
The ironies are titanic: By offering to connect everyone to everyone, social media has created a new kind of loneliness; by offering a democratized platform for speech it reveals how little of interest most of the demos has to say. The genius of Facebook and Twitter is in exploiting natural and nearly universal human anxieties about social status by quantifying that status and publicizing it, thereby fusing it with the online identities of social-media users.
Facebook, properly understood, is a kind of basketball court or baseball diamond, a field of play in the game of status-seeking. People do not go to Facebook or Twitter to learn about the world or to engage in productive and intelligent conversation with people who see the it differently. That is why sneering, intellectual dishonesty, lies, insults, ad hominem, etc. are the ruling modes of communication on social media. They are status-lowering, and status-lowering strategies work pretty well in a status game.
My own brief interactions with Mr. Zuckerberg left me with the impression that he is both intelligent and earnest but also both politically and culturally naive. He faces great difficulty as he and his team attempt to negotiate the political realities of Washington - where Democrats blame Facebook for the defeat of Hillary Clinton in 2016 as a means of psychologically absolving themselves of their own culpable incompetence - and the even more challenging environments in Berlin, Vienna, Brussels, Beijing, etc.
Part of that difficulty is rooted in a sentimental inability to admit what Facebook has become, which is not what Mr. Zuckerberg had intended it to be. At least as far as it touches political discourse, Facebook is not a means of connecting people and enabling relationships. It is a vast online role-playing game played by mediocrities who do not even quite understand what it is they are so angry about and why their daily acts of social media theater fail to provide the catharsis they desire, leaving them instead only more agitated, anxious and despairing.
Which is to say, fixing what's wrong with Facebook must begin with conceptual reform and a new spirit of intellectual forthrightness that the company's executives so far have not managed to muster, however good their intentions. A few policy tweaks, no matter how clever, are not going to get it done. Facebook's short-term problem may be Elizabeth Warren, but Facebook's long-term problem is Facebook.

Reversals on G-7, potentially Syria show Trump buckles under GOP pressure

Texto completo: President Trump backs down when confronted with criticism from congressional Republicans if it's loud enough and he fears he could lose support from his base.
National Rifle Association leaders have told Trump that he'd lose the support of gun owners if he threw his weight behind universal background checks. This helps explain why he has backed down after calling for stricter background checks in the immediate aftermath of multiple mass shootings. This weekend, Trump ended plans to host the Group of Seven summit at his Doral golf club not because it gave Democrats fodder for an article of impeachment but because key Republicans told him they couldn't defend it. The president appears to be repeating this pattern with Syria.
These are all illustrations that conservative lawmakers have more leverage over the White House than they seem to think, especially with impeachment votes looming. "I've said this to the president as recently as this week: We have to be in friend-making mode," former New Jersey governor Chris Christie (R) said Sunday on ABC. "There's a time to be combative, and there's a time to be in friend-making mode vis-a-vis your own party."
Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper told reporters in Kabul on Sunday that U.S. troops being withdrawn from Syria are being relocated across the border into western Iraq, where they'll have two missions. "One is to help defend Iraq and two is to perform a counter-ISIS mission as we sort through the next steps," he said. "Things could change between now and whenever we complete the withdrawal, but that's the game plan right now."
This is quite at odds with Trump's public rhetoric about ending the "endless wars." Around the time Esper said this, the president tweeted: "Bringing soldiers home!"
A few hours later, the New York Times reported that "Trump is leaning in favor of a new Pentagon plan to keep a small contingent of American troops in eastern Syria, perhaps numbering about 200, to combat the Islamic State and block the advance of Syrian government and Russian forces into the region's coveted oil fields." The Washington Post confirmed that reporting.
We've seen this movie before. Ten months ago, Trump abruptly announced the complete, immediate withdrawal of U.S. forces from Syria - prompting Jim Mattis to resign in protest as defense secretary - only to back off to quell a public outcry from hawkish allies on Capitol Hill.
Just as he did last winter, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) has been a major force behind moving Trump away from what he initially announced - chastising him initially and then praising him for changing course.
In February, a dozen senators signed a letter drafted by Graham that said troops should remain in Syria. "I agree 100%," Trump wrote in black Sharpie on the letter.
This time, the backlash from Republicans on Capitol Hill has been even louder. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) called withdrawing from Syria "a grave strategic mistake" in an op-ed for The Post on Friday.
Graham said a conversation he had with Trump over the weekend gave him fresh optimism the president can broker a solution guaranteeing security for the Kurds. Appearing on Fox, the senator said Trump is prepared to use U.S. air power over a demilitarized zone occupied by international forces and that will ensure Islamic State fighters do not "break out."
The administration remains eager to demonstrate that Trump is keeping his promises. Perhaps that's why the commander of American forces in Afghanistan announced at a news conference Monday that there are 2,000 fewer U.S. troops in that country than a year ago. Gen. Austin "Scott" Miller, the commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan, said the drawdown occurred "unbeknown to the public" as troops who finished their deployments were not replaced.
The G-7 announcement is also instructive: Trump blamed his reversal on Democrats and the media, but behind closed doors, several aides and allies said that Trump changed his mind in response to pressure and frustration from his own party. "In a round of phone calls with conservative allies this weekend, Trump was told Republicans are struggling to defend him on so many fronts, according to an administration official," per a report by The Post's Toluse Olorunnipa, Josh Dawsey and David Fahrenthold. "The president was told repeatedly his G-7 decision made it more difficult to keep Senate Republicans in a unified front against impeachment proceedings."
Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney made matters worse when, while trying Thursday to defend the G-7 decision, he said Trump held up nearly $400 million in aid to push Ukraine to investigate Democrats.
Mulvaney may have further damaged his standing with Trump by saying during his "Fox News Sunday" interview that the president "still considers himself to be in the hospitality business." The Post report adds: "While several Trump allies said the comment was accurate, they said it was a bad idea for Mulvaney to make it in public. Other top Republicans, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, have begun to distance themselves from Mulvaney."
The Post report continues: "Privately, and occasionally in public, several Republicans said they were not prepared to defend the president from charges that he was engaged in self-dealing on the G-7 site selection. Rep. Francis Rooney (R-Fla.) said Friday that Trump should avoid even the appearance of impropriety that comes with holding a global summit at his private property. 'I think that would be better if he would not use his hotel for this kind of stuff,' he said. Rooney, who announced his retirement the day after his comments, also said he was considering backing Trump's impeachment over his handling of Ukraine policy."
Even before the impeachment inquiry began, Mulvaney was already on thin ice. "Top aides including Trump's son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner were in the process of contacting at least two potential replacements for the top West Wing job," per CNN. "These previously unreported efforts did not come to fruition, but underscore the weakness of Mulvaney's position even before his headline-generating performance in the briefing room last week. One person familiar with Mulvaney's thinking said the search came as Mulvaney himself was looking for an exit after 10 months in the role, though people close to Mulvaney have denied he wanted to leave."

Texto completo: KABUL — Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper traveled to Afghanistan on Sunday, in his first visit to the country since being confirmed as Pentagon chief amid uncertainty about the administration's strategy following the collapse of peace talks with the Taliban.
His unannounced trip came weeks after the lead US negotiator during the talks, Zalmay Khalilzad, met informally with Taliban leaders in Islamabad, Pakistan, raising the possibility that negotiations might eventually resume.
“The aim is to still get a peace agreement at some point, a political agreement. That is the best way forward," Esper said, according to a report from Reuters.
Ending the war in Afghanistan has been a focus for President Trump since he took office, and Khalilzad and Taliban negotiators finalized a deal “in principle" in September that laid out plans to make that happen.
But Trump called it off, pointing to an uptick in violence across Afghanistan and the death of an American soldier, along with 11 other people, in a Taliban-directed suicide bombing in Kabul.
Esper's arrival in Kabul came as Afghan government leaders delayed the planned announcement of preliminary results of last month's presidential election.
Both Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and his current partner in the unity government, Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah, have said they believe they had enough votes to win.
The Sept. 28 vote was marred by widespread misconduct and accusations of fraud.
Officials said the announcement of preliminary results has been delayed due to problems with the transparency of the process, delays in transferring ballot papers, and delays in transferring data from a biometric system into the main server.
With Washington's strategy unclear, the US-led mission in Afghanistan has continued its campaign to target and kill the Taliban at levels not seen since the height of the war.
But the increase in operations has not been without a cost. More than 1,000 civilians were killed in the last four months, the United Nations said.
On Friday, a suicide bomber killed more than 70 people at a mosque in Nangarhar province.
Esper, a futurist who is trying to focus the Pentagon on confronting China and Russia, is instead now dealing with the hasty retreat of US forces from northern Syria and a new deployment of 2,000 troops to Saudi Arabia in an effort to curb what the White House sees as a growing threat from Iran.
Some of the troops may withdraw to Iraq, Jordan, Europe, or the United States, officials said at the time.
In a post on Twitter on Sunday that misstated Esper's surname, Trump wrote:
“Mark Esperanto, Secretary of Defense, 'The ceasefire is holding up very nicely. There are some minor skirmishes that have ended quickly. New areas being resettled with the Kurds.' USA soldiers are not in combat or ceasefire zones. We have secured the Oil. Bringing soldiers home!"
He later corrected the spelling of Esper.
The quote Trump attributed to Esper could have come from a private conversation between them. But it appeared that it might have been a recounting of public comments made by Esper, who delivered his own assessment of what was happening in Syria during his Afghan visit.

Texto completo: The murder trial for former FSU clinical law professor Dan Markel found Sigfredo Garcia guilty of first-degree murder on Oct. 11. Throughout the five-year investigation, Garcia is the second of three suspects to be convicted.
Dan Markel was not only a professor at FSU and an established attorney, but also a father to two children. He and his recent ex-wife, Wendi Adelson, were divorced only a year prior to the murder, which took place at their home in Tallahassee.
The New York Times provided insight that prosecutors speculated Wendi Adelson and her immediate family hired hitmen to carry out the murder. Adelson was eager to relocate their children, yet Markel stood in the way. Conflict between the separated parents and corresponding families ran high and after the couple's divorce. Markel even asked the court to restrict Wendi's mother, Donna Adelson, from being with his children unsupervised.
Currently, the Adelson family does not face any charges. However, the evidence presented by the prosecution did point to gang members Luis Rivera, Sigfredo Garcia and Katherine Magbanua.
In 2016, Luis Rivera pled guilty to the murder of Dan Markel in an attempt to avoid the death penalty. He confessed that Garcia offered him $35,000 to come along for the job. The duo were long-time friends who were both affiliated with the South Florida Latin Kings. Therefore, Rivera and Garcia traveled to Tallahassee to complete the task. Despite Rivera's testimony against Garcia, he pleaded for his innocence and avoided the death penalty with a life sentence in prison.
Sigfredo Garcia and Katherine Magbanua's trial began on Sept.23 and lasted for 11 days. The verdict resulted in Garcia's long-awaited conviction and a mistrial for Magbanua. Katherine Magbanua is set for case management on Oct. 22 and deliberation as to whether she took part in arranging the hit on Dan Markel will continue.
The investigation found she was linked to the Adelson family through Wendi's brother. Charlie Adelson and Magbanua were dating at the time of Markel's murder and she is suspected to have coordinated the murder-for-hire. She's continued to deny any involvement in the murder yet holds a strong opinion that Charlie Adelson should be further questioned.
Although the Adelson family remains innocent, Rivera testified that it was both Donna and Charlie who paid $100,000 to have Markel murdered. This was said to be motivated by a court ruling that denied Markel's wife from relocating their children to Coral Springs back in 2013. Wendi Adelson was distraught by the decision and prosecutors argued that Markel was murdered to solve this problem.
As accusations persist from all directions, Dan Markel's family begins to find closure in that Rivera and Garcia have been arrested. The victim's family and friends remain present in every day of trial in hopes for justice to be served.
"After waiting five long years, we are relieved that at least one of the people responsible for Danny's murder was convicted today," Markel's parents included in their statement. Following Garcia's sentencing last Friday, Markel's parents felt slight relief, yet insist Katherine Magbanua is guilty as well. The family stated that "justice was only partially served" and are confident she will be charged as a co-conspirator.
Sigfredo Garcia has been convicted of killing FSU law professor Dan Markel in 2014 and has been sentenced to life in prison.

Jonathan Groff shows childhood video on 'Late Show with Stephen Colbert'

Texto completo: On "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" Monday night, actor and Lancaster County native Jonathan Groff showed a childhood video of himself dressed as Mary Poppins for Halloween.
Groff appeared as a guest on Colbert's CBS talk show right after Julie Andrews, who starred in the 1964 Disney film "Mary Poppins." Groff said he watched a video of the movie "every day" when he was little, hence his choice of Halloween costume when he was 3.
A star of the Netflix FBI drama “Mindhunter,” Groff is currently performing to good reviews in an off-Broadway revival production of the musical “Little Shop of Horrors.”
And Groff's childhood obsession was a precursor to his becoming a member of the Disney family himself. The Ronks native reprises his role as the voice of Kristoff in Disney's animated “Frozen 2,” premiering in theaters next month.
A two-time Tony Award nominee, Groff, 34, graduated from Conestoga Valley High School and performed in local theater before gaining fame in Broadway’s “Spring Awakening.”
On Colbert's show, Groff said one thing that attracted him to the "Little Shop" revival was the director, Michael Mayer, who previously directed Groff in "Spring Awakening" on Broadway in 2006.
Groff previously appeared on Colbert’s talk show in 2015, while appearing as King George III in the Broadway hit musical “Hamilton,” and again in 2017 to talk about his role of FBI serial killer profiler Holden Ford in what was then “Mindhunter’s” first season.
“Little Shop” opened Thursday, and Groff’s performance earned kudos from several theater critics. Ben Brantley of the New York Times writes that Groff “is generating major nerd charisma” in the role of Seymour, a nebbish who works in a Skid Row plant store and gains fame in caring for a strange, man-eating plant.
“Groff charts a precise evolution of a man becoming drunk on the prospect of world renown,” Brantley writes, “which, this being a musical comedy, happily parallels a performer unbending into the liberation of good old, show-off showbiz.”
And A.D. Amorosi of Variety praises the performances of Groff and his co-star, Tammy Blanchard as Audrey, the girl of Seymour’s dreams, as “subtle comic presences and supple, dramatic vocalists, ensuring that in this new production there’s something lovely at work, something devoid of the usual camp, schmaltz and quirk of ‘Little Shop.’”
Over the past two months, Groff has also made talk show appearances on “The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon,” “The Late Late Show with James Corden” and “Live with Kelly and Ryan.”
Next Monday, Groff is also set to appear at the Drama League's 36th annual benefit gala at The Plaza in New York City. The gala is honoring Broadway and TV performer Sutton Foster, of whom Groff has been a fan since he was a teenager and with whom he performed in 2017 at Lincoln Center.
Groff co-starred in “Looking” on HBO, and had a recurring role on Fox TV’s “Glee" and has also appeared in such films as “American Sniper” and “The Conspirator."

MSNBC commentators defend Hillary Clinton’s smear of Tulsi Gabbard

Texto completo: Hillary Clinton sycophancy runs deep enough in the cable news circuit that certain MSNBC talking heads are defending her baseless assertion that Rep. Tulsi Gabbard is a Russian agent.
It would be bad enough if it were just this, running interference for an unsubstantiated allegation of treason leveled against a United States combat veteran. But the thing that makes these MSNBC pundits stand out is that they can’t even get the facts straight.
Clinton alleged in an Oct. 17 interview that the Russians “got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and [they are] grooming her to be the third-party candidate. She is a favorite of the Russians."
Don't let anyone gaslight you on this: Clinton said explicitly that the Russians are "grooming" an agent in the 2020 Democratic primary. She did not say merely that a Democratic candidate is being used as a hapless dupe. "Grooming" is a very specific and sinister word.
Later, on Oct. 18, Clinton's spokesman was asked directly whether the two-time failed presidential candidate was referring specifically to Gabbard.
“If the nesting doll fits," said Nick Merrill.
Later that same, Gabbard pushed back, finally, tweeting from her official account, “Great! Thank you [Hillary Clinton]. You, the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long, have finally come out from behind the curtain.” The congresswoman also released a video hitting back at Clinton over the baseless conspiracy theory.TweetEmbarrassingly enough, the timing and details of the Clinton vs. Gabbard feud have proven too complicated for certain NBC and MSNBC personalities to comprehend.
MSNBC contributor and Washington Post columnist Jonathan Capehart, for example, claimed Saturday that Clinton did not "name names” when she alleged the Russians are "grooming" the Hawaii representative.
Yet, "Congresswoman Gabbard was like, 'Me! Me! Me! Me!,'" he added, comically raising his hand like an overeager student.
Again: Clinton's spokesman confirmed the Hawaii congresswoman was the target of the "grooming" remarks.
Amazingly, Capehart is not the only talking head whose trenchant analysis this weekend of Clinton’s smear of Gabbard confused the timeline of events.
"When Hillary Clinton says there's a Russian asset, doesn't say anybody's name, and Tulsi Gabbard goes, 'How dare you call me a Russian asset?'" NBC News’ Jonathan Allen said.
Am I missing something? Do these people not know that Gabbard’s pushback came after Clinton’s aide confirmed for the record that the congresswoman was the intended target of the former secretary of state's comments?

"One thing that was interesting about Tulsi Gabbard's response, I mean, she went after Hillary Clinton strong, she said she wasn't going to run as a third party candidate, she never denied being a Russian asset," said MSNBC regular Kimberly Atkins. "That was the one aspect that was missing from her response, which you think that would be in the first line or two. It was not there."

Yes, why can’t you answer whether you have stopped beating your wife? What are you hiding?

If these people cannot even get the timeline of events correct, what are we to think of their comments on this and other matters?

Texto completo: Dos senadores republicanos han expresado en los últimos días que se plantean apoyar el proceso que echaría al presidente Donald Trump de la Casa Blanca , en caso de que la Cámara de Representantes vote primero a favor. Esto hace que el llamado “muro rojo” de apoyo al mandatario se empiece a resquebrajar en el Congreso, a posar del sólido respaldo de las bases del partido.
Además, dentro del partido republicano también han surgido fuertes oposiciones a acciones polémicas del presidente como la retirada de las tropas estadounidenses del norte de Siria o intención (luego cancelada) de celebrar la Cumbre del G-7 en una de sus propiedades. Hasta ahora han sido dos los funcionarios republicanos que han alzado públicamente la voz contra el presidente.
Uno de ellos es el senador Lindsey Graham, de Carolina del Sur , que este lunes en una entrevista en Axios TV expresó una raro enojo por el comportamiento del presidente. Graham, uno de los más acérrimos aliados del presidente, aseguró que respaldaría el impeachment si se demuestra que el presidente se saltó la ley.
Por su parte, Mitt Rommey, senador por Utah , fue más allá en la entrevista con el medio ya que incluso enumeró los motivos para destituir al presidente de su cargo. Rommey sí que está entre los republicanos más críticos del presidente. De hecho, fuentes cercanas al senador dijeron a Axios TV que sería de los primeros en votar para condenar a Trump.
Trump sabe que el apoyo de un republicano moderado como Rommey a una hipotética destitución podría alentar a otros colegas de ideas afines a seguir sus pasos. El Washington Post y The New York Times coinciden en que esta teoría parece haber asustado al presidente, que el pasado fin de semana dio marcha atrás en su intención de celebrar la cumbre del G-7 en su resort de Florida .
Para que el impechament salga adelante en el Senado, tras su aprobación en la Cámara Baja. 20 republicanos deben unirse a los 45 demócratas del Senado y a dos independientes para conseguir al menos los 67 votos que echarían a Trump de la Casa Blanca. Hasta ahora, Axios solo ha identificado a ocho republicanos de la Cámara Alta que podrían votar en contra del mandatario.

An assessment of Trump's Syria pullback: a misstep or a credibility calamity?

Texto completo: As the bloody consequences of President Trump's recent actions in Syria continued to ricochet across the region, experts back home clashed over what it all meant. Was his sudden decision to withdraw troops from the country a historic error that would gravely damage American credibility? Or was it just another misstep in America's foreign policy in a tumultuous region?
Early Monday morning, dozens of American military vehicles drove out of Syria and protesters gathered to register their alarm and anger, hurling rocks and potatoes at the departing tanks, according to The New York Times.
“The Americans are running away like rats!" one protester shouted.
At the very least, many experts agreed that Trump's actions were reckless.
“No one has a silver bullet for what should happen in northeastern Syria," said Peter Krause, a professor of political science at Boston College and author of the book “Rebel Power: Why National Movements Compete, Fight, and Win." But, he said, the president's hasty move and “the seeming lack of foresight or coordination" involved would lead to a string of negative consequences for the region and for the United States.
The main repercussion for the United States, he said, is “first and foremost this whole concept of American credibility."
Earlier this month, Trump ordered the withdrawal of the roughly 1,000 American troops along the Syrian border who were acting as default peacekeepers between Turkey and Kurdish forces. The move left those Kurdish forces, vital American allies in the fight against ISIS, abandoned and facing brutal attacks from Turkey.
The withdrawal has been widely condemned as a gift to such US foes as Iran, Russia, and Syria's President Bashar al-Assad, all of which seek to fill the power vacuum. The House passed a bipartisan rebuke of Trump's action, and Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader of the Senate, wrote a critical op-ed in the Washington Post calling the withdrawal “a grave strategic mistake."
Many scholars and diplomats agreed, emphasizing that it would hurt America's ability to make promises in the future.
“The US had committed to the Kurds, had worked with the Kurds," Krause said. “They pulled out with basically no warning. That's not exactly holding to your word."
But, Krause said, the concept of credibility is nuanced and can be broken into two distinct parts. First, capability — if a country says it will do something, can it practically achieve it? The capabilities of the United States have not dwindled because of the withdrawal of troops from Syria, he said; so that aspect of American credibility remains intact.
The second part, he said, is believability — if a country says it will do something, will other countries believe it? It is this aspect, in Krause's view, that has taken a significant blow from the abandonment of the Kurdish forces.
Other experts agreed that while the American military's capacities remain the same, its diplomatic leverage has diminished.
Trump has “earned the reputation of a leader who does not keep his commitments and who leaves our friends when the going gets tough," Nicholas Burns, a career diplomat and former ambassador who teaches at the Harvard Kennedy School, wrote in an e-mail from Australia. “He has done enormous damage to our reputation globally."
Some scholars said that while an eventual withdrawal from the area was not a bad idea, Trump moved with reckless haste.
“US withdrawal is in principle a good decision, but the modality has been entirely wrong-headed: too abrupt, leaving allies in the lurch and enabling the Turkish invasion," Valentine Moghadam, a professor of sociology and international affairs at Northeastern University, wrote in an e-mail.
One of the most prominent concerns among diplomats and scholars is that the United States will struggle to form alliances with other countries in the future and will be forced to face down challenges alone.
“Everybody is watching, and everybody is seeing that the US is the one who gives up on its allies," said Ibrahim Al-Assil, a scholar at the Middle East Institute. Already Russia has swept into northeastern Syria, streaming video from an abandoned US base where Pringles and animal crackers were left by the Americans in their swift departure, according to The New York Times. The message to onlookers is clear: The United States abandons its friends. Russia sticks around.
By Assil's count, the Trump administration was the third successive administration to weaken American credibility in the region, which had already suffered from George W. Bush's bungled Iraq War and Barack Obama's failure to quickly respond to Syria's crossing of his “red line" by using chemical weapons.
“What's going on now is very bad, but it didn't start now," Assil said.
As for whether the damage would last, some scholars questioned predictions of long-term catastrophe.
“I think that the claims of this doing irreparable damage to our credibility are greatly overstated," said Andrew J. Bacevich, the president of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft.
Bacevich said the Trump administration's treatment of the Kurds in this instance was “disgraceful." But he pointed to nearly a hundred years of betrayals and realignments internationally, including the United States turning on Chiang Kai-shek, the Chinese Nationalist commander who had helped fight World War II, in the late 1940s; John F. Kennedy's betrayal of the Cuban rebels whom the United States had trained, in the 1960s; and the US abandonment of the South Vietnamese after the Vietnam War appeared to be unwinnable.
It was not even the first time that the United States had abandoned the Kurds, one of the largest ethnic groups in the world without a state.
“This is not an unprecedented episode in American statecraft," Bacevich said. “In every instance, it was possible to rebuild American credibility. You do that by not making a habit of betrayal."

Texto completo: It was remembered as Rudy Giuliani's finest moment.
It was the afternoon of Sept. 11, 2001. The twin towers were gone. Thousands dead, many thousands more presumed killed. The United States, and New York City in particular, was gripped with fear.
Giuliani, in the final months of his eight years as mayor of New York City, was discussing the attacks at a news conference. All eyes in the nation, maybe the world, were on him.
"The city's going to survive, we're going to get through it," said the grim-faced mayor. "It's going to be a very, very difficult time. I don't think we yet know the pain we're going to feel when we find out who we lost. But the thing we have to focus on now is getting the city through this and surviving and being stronger for it."
Eighteen years later, Giuliani was in a very different mode as he embarked on a media blitz to defend President Donald Trump amid the escalating Ukraine scandal. The former mayor accused Fox News White House correspondent John Roberts of providing "distorted" coverage and called former Vice President Joe Biden "Slimy Joe." He performed a mock impersonation of U.S. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J.. He sparred with liberal radio host Christopher Hahn on Laura Ingraham's Fox TV show.
"Shut up, moron. Shut up. Shut up," Giuliani told Hahn. "You don't know what you're talking about, idiot."
To some who have known him for decades, that's the same Giuliani they remember.
"He was always a malicious f---," said Fernando Ferrer, the borough president of the Bronx from 1987 to 2001.
But to many others, the Rudy Giuliani of the Donald Trump era — first as a campaign surrogate and now as the president's personal attorney and investigator — has been far from the calm and measured figure who helped lead the nation through the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. He has embraced the president's "witch hunt" language and been widely mocked for his erratic and sometimes contradictory television appearances.
His aggressive defense of Trump in the face of impeachment has left many Americans, including some of his own former campaign and mayoral staff, wondering how "America's Mayor" has gambled his legacy to serve as an attack dog for a deeply unpopular president and push a widely discredited claim that has become the focus of a House impeachment inquiry.
Giuliani's role as Trump's arch-defender has also raised questions about the business dealings of a man who once pleaded poverty but since entering private life has amassed millions through speeches, security and legal services and, according to reports, relationships with Russian oligarchs, Ukrainian investors and the Qatari government.
Now Giuliani, once known as a corruption-busting prosecutor who brought down mob figures, is being investigated for his overseas business dealings by the Southern District of New York, the office he once commanded. Two Ukrainian-born associates of Giuliani's, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, were indicted last week on charges of funneling foreign campaign contributions to a Super PAC supporting Trump.
Parnas and Fruman also helped connect Giuliani with figures in Ukraine in his quest to dig up dirt on Trump's Democratic rival Joe Biden, according to multiple reports.
Giuliani, who could not be reached for comment, was not charged and has not been accused of criminal wrongdoing.
Giuliani seen as defender and 'conspiracy nut' Reactions from Giuliani's former associates about his new role as Trump's defender-in-chief run the gamut from dismay to full-throated support. Giuliani has squandered the sense of goodwill he engendered after he led the city following the 9/11 attacks, one camp says. The other says the ex-mayor is doing the job the media won't: exposing corruption among Democrats and revealing that the years-long investigation into Russia's role in the 2016 presidential race was a witch hunt targeting Trump.
"He's not doing anything that he hasn't done his whole career," said longtime Giuliani ally and former New York City police commissioner Bernard Kerik, who in 2010 was sentenced to four years in federal prison after admitting he used his position to get a company to pay for renovations of his home. "He's very aggressive. He's a very smart attorney. He is defending his client the best way he sees fit. If I was in the president's position, I wouldn't want anyone else in that position over him."
Walter Mack is an attorney who worked under Giuliani in the U.S. attorney's office as chief of its organized crime unit, and later as a deputy police commissioner during Giuliani's first term as mayor. Giuliani ousted him from both jobs. Giuliani canned him the first time after Mack openly criticized him for seeking too much publicity, which The Village Voice's Tom Robbins in 2006 compared to "trying to tell Donald Trump to stay out of tabloid gossip columns."
Giuliani's mayoral predecessor, David Dinkins, hired Mack as deputy police commissioner in 1994, a gig he lost one year into Giuliani's mayoralty. Mack still remembers being dispatched twice, but said he's not going to criticize his former boss.
"I think he's taken some risks but you do that as a defense lawyer for a client," Mack said. "You take risks if you think it's going to serve your client's interests ... His job is to defend the president."
Ken Frydman counts himself among the former Giuliani associates who is now appalled at his behavior. Frydman, press secretary for Giuliani's 1993 mayoral bid, went public with his disenchantment in an Oct. 7 op-ed in The New York Times criticizing Giuliani's defense of Trump.
Giuliani "cleaned up the city" and made it safer, creating a legacy that is at risk now because of his representation of Trump, Frydman said. In his media appearances defending the president, Frydman said, Giuliani is not acting like the mayor he knew.
"He sounded like Trump and he looks like a right-wing conspiracy nut. He's shuffling papers and he's screaming and he's yelling," Frydman said in an interview. "The guy I worked with was measured and a master of message control and discipline."
Mack, while defending Giuliani, echoed Frydman's thoughts on how Giuliani appears when he's defending the president on Fox News. If he ran into Giuliani today, Mack said, he'd ask him whether he's OK.
"I'm concerned about him," Mack said. "I think some people are worried about whether he's too much into this."
Kerik brushed aside any worries about Giuliani's state of mind.
"I know Ken thinks he's lost his f---ing mind," Kerik said. "But in reality, as somebody that's talked to him regularly, I probably talk to him every other day, I don't see anything different about him other than the fact that he's much more vocal today."
A 'mean man' Giuliani, who made headlines as a mob-busting, tough-on-Wall Street prosecutor after he was appointed U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York in 1983, captured New York City Hall in 1993 by ousting Dinkins (who had defeated Giuliani four years prior). He was the first Republican elected mayor of the city in nearly 30 years.
Democrats who dealt with him during his mayoral term do not share Frydman's sentiment that Giuliani has changed since his days at Gracie Mansion.
Council members who served during Giuliani's reign say they are flummoxed by this idea that the Giuliani they see on Fox News defending Trump is a different Giuliani than once led New York City.
"Rudy's a mean man," said Sal Albanese, a Brooklyn councilman for 16 years. "He's been a mean man, unethical man, a liar, his entire career."
Albanese and Ferrer, the former Bronx borough president ticked off a list of controversies they said show Giuliani's true character: falsely alleging a youth commissioner appointed by his predecessor of a crime; hiring the unqualified son of a political buddy to run the city's Housing Development Corporation; myriad divisive comments about the city's black community; and hiring Kerik.
Albanese acknowledged Giuliani seems "more unhinged" now, but said the Rudy he sees on Fox News is the same Rudy he tussled with at New York City Hall.
"His core is still there," he said. "The ends justify the means, authoritarian streak, constantly lying, distorting, dissembling — that was always there. And unfortunately, he's got Trump's ear."
Ruth Messinger is the former Manhattan Borough Council President who unsuccessfully challenged Giuliani in the 1997 mayor's race. Messinger said Giuliani's former associates who see a change in him now remember his corruption-busting early days as mayor, and his steady leadership in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, but not much in between. From the last year of his first term through his second, Messinger said, Giuliani did not use his political skills for the good of New Yorkers.
"The idea of a crusader, somebody against corruption, somebody who's determined to shake things up and produce results, was not a throughline for his years as mayor," Messinger said.
National spotlight after 9/11 Giuliani, who won his first mayoral race in 1993 in a squeaker then won re-election by a wide margin, saw his popularity dip toward the end of his second term as mayor. In 1998, a New York Times/CBS News poll said nearly two-thirds of New York City voters approved of Giuliani's job performance. By April 2000, his job approval dropped to 45% in the same poll.
The 9/11 attacks brought Giuliani national recognition and he saw his approval rating skyrocket. He became a national star, and for a while he was the front-runner to win the Republican nomination for president in 2008, leading John McCain by 17 points in a November 2007 Wall Street Journal poll.
But his campaign to win The White House was a disaster, with Giuliani conceding the important early-voting states like Iowa and New Hampshire to focus instead on winning Florida. He finished third there and ended his campaign.
His popularity has flipped since his high point after the Sept. 11 attacks, when 61% of people polled by NBC and the Wall Street Journal viewed him as "very positive." Now just 12% view him as "very positive," according to the poll.
Frydman described Giuliani as a "Diet Coke and pizza guy" when he worked for him. But since leaving office, he has been much more indulgent.
In 2001, in the middle of his divorce from Donna Hanover, Giuliani claimed through a lawyer that he had just $7,000 in assets. His wealth has grown considerably since then. This summer, legal proceedings for Giuliani's third divorce, from Judith Giuliani, revealed he spent $7,131 on fountain pens alone, according to the New York Times.
Giuliani's rise from the financial ashes was fueled by his post-mayoral consulting firm and his highly lucrative speech-giving gigs. Between January 2006 and February 2017, he earned $9.2 million from those gigs, according to the financial disclosure form he filed in advance of his ultimately failed 2008 presidential bid.
In May 2006 alone, he made $1.3 million total from 20 speeches to the City of Winnipeg, Shore Memorial Health Foundation, Merrill Lynch & Co. and more.
Giuliani owns or co-owns numerous luxury properties in New York and Florida.
He purchased a 10th floor apartment on East 66th Street for $4.77 million in 2002, the year before he married Judith. The couple spent $3.2 million in 2004 to build a mansion in Southampton, property records show. The four-bedroom home overlooks the Southampton Hunt & Polo Club.
Their two Palm Beach homes are a few miles from Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club. The Giulianis bought a two-bedroom condo at Palm Beach Towers for $410,000 in 2004 and a two-bedroom condo on South Lake Street Drive set them back $1.4 million in 2010.
The Lake Street Drive condo is on the market for $3 million.
At 75 years old, Giuliani is most likely in his final act in public life. It may be his biggest and, depending on how the impeachment inquiry turns out, could overshadow his achievements as mayor. But he is most likely to have his legacy tied to Trump, said Fred Siegel, a former political adviser to Giuliani who wrote about him, "The Prince of the City: Giuliani, New York, and the Genius of American Life."
"The other things are there — the reduction in crime, the reduction in welfare, his achievements as a prosecutor. But this is a whole other ball of wax, to use a tired expression. The whole future of the country is on the line," said Siegel, now a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute. "It's hard to imagine it's not going to have profound impact on how we see him down the road."

Texto completo: President Trump is right: The deep state is alive and well. But it is not the sinister, antidemocratic cabal of his fever dreams. It is, rather, a collection of patriotic public servants -- career diplomats, scientists, intelligence officers and others -- who, from within the bowels of this corrupt and corrupting administration, have somehow remembered that their duty is to protect the interests, not of a particular leader, but of the American people.
Fiona Hill, Michael McKinley and the whistle-blower who effectively initiated the impeachment investigation -- when these folks saw something suspicious, they said something. Their aim was not to bring down Mr. Trump out of personal or political animus but to rescue the Republic from his excesses. Those who refuse to silently indulge this president's worst impulses qualify as heroes -- and deserve our gratitude.
Throughout the Trump presidency, there has been a trickle of fed-up individuals willing to step up and protest the administration's war on science, expertise and facts.
In July, Rod Schoonover left his job as an analyst for the State Department after the administration blocked the submission to Congress of his report on the national security implications of climate change.
In July 2017, Joel Clement, formerly the director of the Office of Policy Analysis at the Interior Department, filed a whistle-blower complaint alleging that the administration had reassigned him to an accounting position in retaliation for publicly speaking out on the potential dangers of climate change to Alaska Native communities.
In August, Lewis Ziska, a veteran plant physiologist with the Agriculture Department, quit in protest over the administration's efforts to bury his findings about the negative impact of rising levels of carbon dioxide on the nutrient content of rice. "You get the sense that things have changed, that this is not a place for you to be exploring things that don't agree with someone's political views," Mr. Ziska told Politico at the time. "That's so sad. I can't even begin to tell you how sad that is."
With an impeachment inquiry underway in the House, the risks of breaking ranks with the president are higher than ever. Mr. Trump prides himself on punching back against perceived enemies, publicly suggesting that "spies" and "traitors" and people who turn "rat" deserve to have their lives and their families destroyed. Small wonder that few congressional Republicans have dared express even gentle concern over Mr. Trump's increasingly erratic behavior.
But still the patriots come. Top of the list, of course, is the still-anonymous whistle-blower who touched off the impeachment drama by registering his concerns about Mr. Trump's clandestine effort to pressure Ukraine into conducting investigations that would benefit his re-election campaign. The concerns enumerated in the complaint have since been verified and magnified by multiple administration insiders, despite the White House's stonewalling mandate.
On Monday, Congress heard from Ms. Hill, the former top national security adviser on Russia and Europe, who detailed how Mr. Trump had done an end run around his own national security team, putting Ukraine policy in the hands of unqualified dilettantes like Gordon Sondland, whose $ 1 million donation to the Trump inaugural basically bought him the title of ambassador to the European Union, and Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer and favorite henchman.
On Wednesday, Mr. McKinley, a top adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo until this month, told Congress that he'd resigned in frustration over the administration's disparaging and shunting aside career diplomats, as well as its using ambassadors overseas to advance the president's re-election aims. (He put it more diplomatically, as one would expect.)
A week and a half ago, Marie Yovanovitch, the former ambassador to Ukraine, testified that Mr. Trump prematurely recalled her in May, allegedly as a result of a whisper campaign by Mr. Giuliani and some of his associates, two of whom were arrested Oct. 9 on federal charges of violating campaign finance laws. "I do not know Mr. Giuliani's motives for attacking me," Ms. Yovanovitch told lawmakers. "But individuals who have been named in the press as contacts of Mr. Giuliani may well have believed that their personal financial ambitions were stymied by our anti-corruption policy in Ukraine."
Presumably, Ms. Yovanovitch, a veteran diplomat and actual expert on Ukraine, had also proved an annoying hindrance to Mr. Giuliani pursuing his shadow agenda.
Right on cue, Mr. Trump's lackeys are responding to such breaches of fealty by going on the attack. In a media briefing on Thursday, the White House acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, dismissed the witnesses who had spoken to impeachment investigators: "What you are seeing now, I believe, is a group of mostly career bureaucrats who are saying, 'You know what, I don't like President Trump's politics, so I'm going to participate in this witch hunt."'
That may be what Mr. Mulvaney hears when he listens to these men and women. But many, many others will hear veteran public servants appalled by an administration that continues to subvert the public interest to the whims of a president who has mistaken himself for a king.
This is Mr. Trump's deep state. For the sake of the nation, the American public should be clamoring for more patriots to join the conspiracy.

Texto completo: Even before Disney, Reiniger told fanciful stories in animated films with her hand-cut paper silhouettes.
This article is part of Overlooked, a series of obituaries about remarkable people whose deaths, beginning in 1851, went unreported in The Times.
A decade before Walt Disney Productions came into existence, making its name synonymous with animated films, there was another pioneer of the art form -- Lotte Reiniger.
Reiniger's filmmaking career spanned 60 years, during which she created more than 70 silhouette animation films, including versions of "Cinderella," "Puss in Boots" and "Hansel and Gretel." She's perhaps best known for her 1926 silent film "The Adventures of Prince Achmed," a fantastical adaptation of "The Arabian Nights" that was among the first full-length animated features ever made.
Charlotte Reiniger was born on June 2, 1899, in the Charlottenburg district of Berlin to Karl and Eleanor (Raquette) Reiniger. She studied at the Charlottenburger Waldschule, where she learned about scherenschnitte, the art of cutting shapes and designs in paper with scissors. The art form originated in China and later became popular in Germany.
Reiniger cut silhouettes of people, including her family members.
"I began to use my silhouettes for my playacting, constructing a little shadow theater in which to stage Shakespeare," she wrote in 1936 in Sight and Sound magazine.
At first she wanted to be an actress, but that ambition changed when, as a teenager, she encountered the film director and actor Paul Wegener after a lecture he had delivered in Berlin on the possibilities of animation in cinema. Fascinated by his films, like "The Student of Prague" (1913) and "The Golem" (1915), she persuaded her parents to enroll her in a theater group at the Max Reinhardt School of Acting, where Wegener taught.
For fun she cut silhouettes of the actors in the group. Wegener was impressed.
He soon enlisted her to help with his 1918 film, "The Pied Piper of Hamelin," an adaptation of the folk legend about a man who is hired to play his magic flute to lure away rats from a German town. When the town refuses to pay him for his services, the piper plays another tune to hypnotize the children and lead them out of the town, never to be seen again. Wegener had Reiniger help him animate wooden puppet rats for the film.
"I now had one desire -- to make films," she wrote.
Her work with Wegener led to her admission to the Institute of Cultural Research in Berlin, where she met the art historian Carl Koch. He would become her husband and a collaborator on her films.
Their first animated short was "The Ornament of the Heart in Love" (1919), about two lovers, both ballet dancers, and a morphing ornament between them that represents their emotions.
The expressive qualities of her work caught the attention of a patron, the banker Louis Hagen, who owned a film company and was looking to invest in new talent. Hagen invited her and her team of producers and designers to use his studio in Potsdam, Germany, where they worked on "Prince Achmed," their first feature-length film.
Music, perhaps counterintuitively, was vital to the silent film, and the team worked early on with the composer Wolfgang Zeller, who made sound effects with flute notes and a glockenspiel. The team then filmed their scenes to the music, the notes driving the action and punctuating it with emotion.
Reiniger's editing was meticulous. Starting with more than 250,000 frames, she and her crew used just over 100,000 in the film, which ran for an hour and 21 minutes, each second requiring 24 frames. It took three years to complete, and premiered in the Volksbühne, or People's Theater, in Berlin, when Reiniger was 27.
The film showcased the fantastical potential of animation. A prince defeated an army of demons to win over a princess. Birds battled witches and sorcerers. Horses flew.
The French film director Jean Renoir saw "Prince Achmed" on its opening night in Paris, and later recalled that he wanted to tell her, "You have fairy hands."
Reiniger designed a complex process to make her films. She cut each limb of each figure out of black cardboard and thin lead, then joined them together with wire hinges. For research, she spent hours at the Zoo Berlin, watching how the animals moved.
Beginning with "Prince Achmed," she also created an early version of the multiplane camera, which gave two-dimensional animation a hitherto unexplored depth, movement and complexity. She called her device a tricktisch, or trick table.
Reiniger described her process this way: "Figures and backgrounds are laid out on a glass table. A strong light from underneath makes the wire hinges disappear and throws up the black figures in relief. The camera hangs above this table, looking down at the picture arranged below."
After taking a photograph, Reiniger and her team moved the figures into their next position and photographed the scene again. "The important thing," she wrote, "is to know how much to move the figures so that a lifelike effect may be obtained."

In reviewing her "Cinderella" for The New York Times in 1928, Charles Morgan wrote, "The small black shapes laugh at you from a world of their own into which naturalism makes no laborious entry!"
When Hitler was in power, Reiniger and her husband left Germany for France, Italy and England, where they collaborated with other puppeteers, funders and artists before returning to Berlin in 1944 to look after Reiniger's mother. In 1948 they moved to London, where they joined a nearby artists' colony. Reiniger then directed a series of short children's films for the BBC.
Her husband died in 1963, and she stopped making films. But in 1972 she was recognized with the Golden Reel Award at the Berlin Film Festival for her contributions to German cinema. Two years later, the Goethe Institute sponsored her on a lecture tour of Canada and the United States.
"A Reiniger revival swept North America," the Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail wrote.
The tour inspired her to make a few final short films, including "The Rose and the Ring" (1979), a 24-minute adaptation of the 1854 satirical work of fiction by William Makepeace Thackeray, and "Düsselchen and the Four Seasons," a two-minute film completed in 1980. She died on June 19, 1981, in Dettenhausen, Germany. She was 82.
Though The New York Times did not take note of her death at the time, the Times film critic A.O. Scott recalled her in a 2018 article about the unsung women who had advanced the art of filmmaking.
Praising Reiniger's "blend of whimsy and spookiness," Mr. Scott wrote that her "dreamy images that seem to tap right into the collective unconscious suggest both an antidote to Disney and a precursor to Tim Burton."

Texto completo: INDIANOLA, Iowa — Senator Elizabeth Warren said Sunday she will release a plan in a “few weeks" laying out how she would pay for her ambitious health care proposal, following criticism from Democratic rivals over her refusal to answer questions about whether middle class taxes would increase to fund “Medicare for All."
“What I see though is that we need to talk about the cost," Warren said at the end of a town hall attended by hundreds at Simpson College, just south of Des Moines. “And I plan over the next few weeks to put out a plan that talks about specifically the cost of Medicare for All and specifically how do we pay for it."
The Democrat from Massachusetts faced fierce attacks at last week's debate over her vagueness about what additional taxes on middle class Americans would be necessary to provide a government-funded universal health care system. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who wrote the Medicare for All bill endorsed by Warren, did not come to her defense at the Democratic debate in Ohio, saying it was “appropriate" to concede that additional middle class taxes would be needed to fund it.
Former vice president Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Ind., continued to criticize Warren in the days afterward, with Biden saying she needs to “tell the truth" about her plan.
Warren told the Iowa crowd Sunday that 10-year estimates of the cost of Medicare for All vary by “trillions and trillions of dollars" and that her team is hard at work attempting to figure out the best way to raise revenue to fund the sweeping transformation of the nation's health care system. The Globe reported last week that her campaign team has been in touch with at least one economist about funding options for the plan before Tuesday's debate.
“This is something I've been working on for months and months, and it's just got a little more work until it's finished," Warren said Sunday.
She told reporters after the event that “nothing's changed" about her support for Medicare for All and that she has been “working for a long time" on figuring out the best way to pay for the plan. Warren brushed off questions about why she endorsed the plan before she figured out how to pay for it or how much it would cost.
“I've been working on how to get the exact details to make that work," she said.
Warren also defended her focus on the overall costs of health care to middle class Americans, saying those costs are what voters bring up to her in the lengthy photo lines she holds after every event.
“What they talk about is how the cost of health care is crushing," she said.
Warren's allies have said that the senator is avoiding handing Republicans a video clip of her endorsing higher taxes on the middle class, a clip that would be misleading given that they believe Medicare for All would save those people far more in health care costs than they would owe in additional taxes.
Reporters, debate moderators, and her rivals have attempted for weeks to get Warren to concede that taxes would have to go up on the middle class to pay for a universal health care system. The senator has instead pivoted to the overall cost of the plan, pointing out that middle class people would spend less on health care overall because they no longer would be responsible for premiums or co-pays.
Warren did not answer a reporter's question Sunday about whether her plan would include a new tax that affects middle class people.
Some of Warren's fans at Sunday's event said they were happy that the senator known for having “a plan for that" will finally release one for paying for one of the most transformative policies she has endorsed.
“I appreciate that she's going to share how she plans to have it paid for," said Tabitha Doherty, a 19-year-old Simpson College student who attended Warren's town hall and supports her in the Democratic primary.
Doherty said she was initially “afraid of" Medicare for All but has since come around to it. “I think it's a big issue because Medicare for All will affect everyone," she said.
Only 42 percent of Democrats strongly favor a Medicare for All system, according to a recent Kaiser Family Foundation poll.

NASA concept can get idea off ground

Texto completo: When the space shuttle blasts off, two-thirds of its fuel is consumed in the first 20 minutes of flight. The remaining amount powers the shuttle for up to two weeks, including re-entry and landing.
The phenomenon at play: escape velocity. Scientists describe the concept as the amount of force required to break free from the gravitational pull of the current state.
As you can imagine, escape velocity is certainly a concept that goes far beyond bespectacled physicists in lab coats.
Any time we want to effectuate change, we face the gravitational pull of the status quo.
Back to physics, we know that a body at rest stays at rest without disruptive might. So whether you're launching an industry-defining startup or you're trying to institute a process shift on a factory production line, getting your new idea off the ground and in motion requires intensity and force. Rockets don't glide off the launchpad, after all.
Having started a dozen companies myself and invested in nearly 100 more, I can tell you that startups face intense gravitational pull.
I've learned that the entrepreneurs who succeed are not necessarily smarter or better funded, but rather they're able to cultivate tremendous energy in order to blast their ideas into orbit.
The change effort in front of you may be to land a job promotion, improve safety conditions in your community, or get your family to go vegan. You may be trying to open a new office in Europe, launch a marketing campaign, or write new cybersecurity protocols. Any change is hard and our human nature is to resist it. However, the biggest risk we face isn't trying to launch change but rather it's the catastrophic risk of standing still.
Just like the space shuttle launch, your own escape velocity will consume a lot of your energy reserves. But just on the other side of today's gravitational pull is tomorrow's biggest opportunity. And don't forget, even if you burn most of your fuel during liftoff, the energy required to continue is dramatically reduced once the change effort is off the ground. If you're in the midst of any kind of launch, you're likely expending energy at an uncomfortable rate.
Instead of getting discouraged, realize that you're probably getting close to that joyful transition into orbit.
With escape velocity in mind, don't let up on the throttle one bit. Stay strong, forge ahead, and power through it. Before long, you'll be enjoying the wide open view of success while cruising along in comfort.
3, 2, 1... blast off!

The legacy of 'Natural Born Killers'

Texto completo: It's been 25 years since Oliver Stone's "Natural Born Killers" caused a stir when it hit theaters, but the violent tale of lovers-on-the-run mixed with a vicious media satire still feels controversial today.
Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis play a young couple on a wild crime spree that winds up making them the center of a worldwide media storm. The film's outrageous style, mixing film formats with a high-density editing strategy, made it visceral and shocking.
As Times critic Kenneth Turan put in his original review, the film is "both audacious and astonishing, a vision of a charnel house apocalypse that comes close to defying description."
Much as with the recent concern around real-world violence and the release of "Joker," there was much consternation in the media that "Natural Born Killers" would set off copycat crimes.
A lawsuit essentially attempting to treat the movie as a faulty product, claiming that Stone and Warner Bros. were responsible for a young couple's multistate crime spree, dragged on in the courts for years before eventually being dismissed.
Among the many sources of intrigue surrounding the movie, the film's original script was written by Quentin Tarantino -- he ultimately received a story credit on the finished film -- before being rewritten by Stone, Richard Rutowski and David Veloz. In a small irony, "Natural Born Killers" cinematographer Robert Richardson has shot Tarantino's last few projects, including this year's "Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood."
Stone and Lewis recent spoke separately about the movie.
"I think it was a special movie," said Stone. "There's nothing quite like it. It's one of a kind."
Where did the style of the movie come from, mixing formats and with the extreme editing style? Did it feel like an extension of what you had already been doing on "JFK" and some of your other films?
Stone: We always tried to adapt the style to the subject matter. The reason for "Natural Born Killers" being so extreme was because of the time that it was made, in the early '90s, seemed to me a time of excess and a new change in the cultural environment, in the sense of sensationalism and violence promoted by the major media in a way that has never been done before. ...
The news was becoming oriented toward the sensational, whether it be violence or the growth to a war, the constant beat of the drum to create a tabloid headline. Staid old papers started to change, a woman would cut off her husband's penis and that would make the front page of The New York Times or The Washington Post.
You've all always talked about the movie as a satire or critique of the media, but it so often was received as being some kind of treatise on screen violence. Why do you think there was that disconnect?
Stone: You'd need to go to psychology classes for that. America is very literal. Violence, literal. I mean I'm a guy who was in Vietnam, I did combat films that were called very realistic, "Born on the Fourth of July," "Platoon," "Salvador." And then how can you believe that (in "Natural Born Killers") the bullets could do this or a knife could go through a window? This is ridiculous. Can't you see it's tongue in cheek, can't you see we're making fun of it? They couldn't.
Lewis: Oliver never makes something that says one thing. I mean, (the film) is insanely intelligent and layered. So that combination I knew was going to be really interesting and provocative. But here's what was wild: When me and Woody did the press -- and by the way, I was new to press junkets, I wasn't that versed -- I never felt so much disdain and animosity expressed to us actors from journalists. I mean, those interviews, they hated us. They hated the movie. And then you look at it in hindsight, you go, that's Oliver Stone antagonizing, prodding.
Does the movie still have something to say to us now?
Stone: Younger people still do tell me that. People say it's on the pulse of now. I mean, one of the lines in the movie is, "The future is murder." That's one of three Leonard Cohen songs that we used. It seems like a war mentality and violent mentality is in the air. Americans now -- how many bombing missions do we run? How many remote wars do we fight? Doesn't it come home to roost?
That's the whole point of it. There's violence in our system, there's bloodshed in our bloodstream and it's not expected to come home in America.
Lewis: If I'm being honest, as an actor I developed and got to play and do all these improvised things and had my ideas encouraged. But the outcome, I didn't know what to think about the movie actually. The animosity that I was faced with, particularly being a female, the wild one, the sociopath as a female, I think that messes with people. Like I talked with Woody, he didn't get labeled crazy for years to come.
So as far as the themes of what "Natural Born Killers" was posing and making a statement on, absolutely they are as relevant today as they were. I felt like the movie was actually ahead of its time. One of those you catch up to. And that's what's amazing about an Oliver Stone, about radical thinkers, society has to catch up to what he was posing at the time.
With "Joker," there has been a lot of concern as to whether that film will incite violence. Are you surprised that's a conversation we're still having?
Stone: Not at all. I think it also applies to the fact that Trump resembles the Joker, so they're making that allusion.
But in particular with our current moment, with the rash of mass shootings and the air of violence in the culture, does that give you any pause?
Stone: Why don't we blame it on our Pentagon and all of our military budget and the trillion dollars that we invest in all the wars and occupying the whole planet and inciting people to fight, fight, fight on our televisions? That's what you should blame, the mentality of violence in the air.
How is a movie going to kick off this kind of violence? You're most likely to see some kind of shooting, some kind of episodic TV cops show, murder story. Bad guy gets killed, the good guy wins. The usual fiction.

Nadia Vellam, T's photography and video director, oversaw the shoots for all of this issue's cover stories, as well as the front-of-book features.
Isabel Wilkinson, T's digital director, worked on the online presentation of this issue, including the interactive landing page of our cover stories. The writer Alice Gregory met with Nicolas Ghesquière, the artistic director of the storied French fashion house Louis Vuitton,
five times to report her profile (Page 112), eating with him at a restaurant in Paris in a building that was once the home of the writer Voltaire and attending Louis Vuitton's cruise 2020 after party at MoMA PS1 in Queens, N.Y. "He was extremely generous with his time," she says, "which isn't always the case when you're profiling famous, busy people -- for understandable reasons." What struck her most during these meetings was Ghesquière's almost writerly ability to precisely communicate his ideas in conversation as well as in clothing. But Gregory has long understood the designer's talents. Among the most-worn garments in her wardrobe is a black wool sweater from one of his collections as the artistic director of Balenciaga from 1997 to 2012. "It's full of holes now," she says, "but over 10 years later, I still wear it multiple days a week in the winter."
The South African photographer Pieter Hugo found Ghesquière equally personable. "It can be a challenge to break through that veneer, to find something that's vulnerable," he says of capturing famous subjects. "But he was incredibly genuine." Hugo took the designer's portrait at the Parc Floral de Paris, a sprawling botanical garden, and continued the naturalistic theme in the accompanying editorial. Together with the English stylist Melanie Ward, he shot a selection of pieces from Louis Vuitton's 2020 cruise collection in the overgrown gardens of Alder Manor, a 72-room mansion in Yonkers built by the copper magnate William Boyce Thompson in 1912. "The clothes are emblazoned with incredible details and decoration, with nods to Gotham superheroes," says Ward of the collection. -- Alice Newell-Hanson

Texto completo: A day earlier, Mr. Rooney became the first House Republican to indicate that he was willing to consider supporting articles of impeachment.
WASHINGTON -- Representative Francis Rooney, Republican of Florida, who has refused to rule out voting to impeach President Trump, said on Saturday that he would not be seeking re-election.
Mr. Rooney, who first won his district in southwest Florida in 2016, said on Fox News that he believed he had accomplished what he wanted to do in Congress and had grown frustrated with aspects of legislative service.
Asked if he was interested in a third term, Mr. Rooney said, "I don't really think I do, and I don't really think I want one."
"I've done what I came to do," he added, noting that he also wanted to set a model in the House for adhering to term limits.
A day earlier, Mr. Rooney became the first House Republican to indicate that he was willing to consider supporting articles of impeachment over the president's attempts to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rivals, but he said on Saturday that his decision to retire was unrelated. (He emphasized to reporters that the allegations did not rise to the level of the Watergate scandal.)
"I'm going to do at all stages what I think is right to do," Mr. Rooney told reporters on Friday when asked if he was more outspoken because he was considering retirement. "You've got to do the right thing at every stage. Whether I run again is a totally different can of worms, that has to do with family things, business, wanting to do some different things."
"This is kind of a frustrating job for me," he added. "I come from a world of actions, decisions, putting your money down and seeing what happens. This is a world of talk."
As a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. Rooney has had access to the closed-door interviews conducted during the open impeachment inquiry, which has brought a parade of career diplomats and senior officials to the Capitol to give hourslong testimony. A former ambassador to the Holy See, he defended the career diplomats who have testified, telling reporters on Friday that "it's painful to me to see this kind of amateur diplomacy, riding roughshod over our State Department apparatus."
He also offered some of the bluntest criticism of a top White House official's efforts to walk back earlier statements saying that Mr. Trump had sought a quid pro quo in withholding American aid from Ukraine.
"I couldn't believe it -- I was very surprised that he said that," he said, referring to the president's acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney.
"It's not an Etch a Sketch," he added, miming the gesture that erases the toy board.
He acknowledged that some of his Republican colleagues had concerns about incurring Mr. Trump's wrath, as the president continues to lash out at outspoken conservative critics like Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah.
But Mr. Rooney said he had no such reservations, noting, "I didn't take this job to keep it."
"What's he going to do to me?" Mr. Rooney said of the president. "I mean, he could say bad things, but it just is what it is. Let's just let the facts speak."
"I want to get the facts and do the right thing," he added, "because I'll be looking at my children a lot longer than I'm looking to anybody in this building."
Mr. Rooney, a businessman and one of the wealthiest members in Congress, has long been a part of the Republican establishment.
One of the subsidiaries of Rooney Holdings, the company Mr. Rooney and his family started in 1984, has been responsible for the construction of the presidential libraries for Presidents George and George W. Bush in Texas, football stadiums for the Dallas Cowboys and Houston Texans, the Capitol Visitor Center in Washington, and the Walter Reed Army Institute for Research outside the capital.
But he has also cultivated a reputation as one of the few elected Republicans who acknowledges the science of climate change and has pressed for a tax on carbon dioxide pollution to address the problem.
In September, the House passed a bill he wrote that would ban offshore drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico -- something he said on Saturday he had not been able to achieve when Republicans controlled the House.
Mr. Trump won Mr. Rooney's affluent district, which includes Fort Myers, Naples and Marco Island, by more than 20 points in 2016.
Asked in an interview on Friday with The New York Times about reaction from constituents over his criticism of the administration, Mr. Rooney said, "They don't understand how anyone could say anything remotely at variance with President Trump."
"I'm sorry," he said, "but I'm just going to call 'em like I see 'em."

Media meltdowns and political polarization: Joel Kotkin

Texto completo: The mainstream media increasing appears much like the classic tale of the boy who cried wolf so often that when the wolf showed up no one believed him.
Similarly, since the bust of the Mueller report, and the evaporation of countless other “blockbuster” exposés, the media’s credibility in the ongoing impeachment saga is now widely doubted, even if this time they may actually be right about presidential misdeeds.
This divide can be seen in public perceptions of the news media. Although somewhat improved from its low point in 2016, only 40 percent of Americans, according to Gallup, trust the media, compared to over 50 percent in 1999. As befits the media’s increasingly partisan stance, the small improvement over 2016 comes almost entirely from Democrats. Only 15% of Republicans and barely a third of independents now trust media compared to nearly 70% of Democrats.
Once the news business had enough sense of propriety and professionalism to at least maintain an appearance of objectivity. There’s ample reason, as Glenn Reynolds suggests, to see many mainstream journalists as little more than “Democrats with bylines,” willing participants in what long-time leftist and fiercely anti-Trump reporter Matt Taibbi describes as the upper bureaucracy’s “permanent coup” against Trump. If this “coup” now actually succeeds, it will be one that will simply accentuate hostility to the media among a large segment of the population.
Media faces an economic crisis
No president has suffered such total opposition from powerful media. In his first year in office, stories about Trump were 62 percent negative, notes Pew, almost three the rate for Obama and more than twice that for George W. Bush, certainly no media favorite. His positive coverage was barely 5 percent, one eighth that enjoyed by President Obama. Some have thrived from naked partisanship, including an increasingly aggressive series of pro-Trump outlets. The New York Times, de facto leader of the anti-Trump media lynch mob, has seen its subscriptions burgeon, notably online.
But the Times enjoys a unique status with upper-class, educated readers. In contrast the mass audience seems to be turned off with the non-stop political haranguing. The almost comically anti-Trump CNN has seen its ratings drop so far that it now trails not only primetime leaders Fox, but has fallen to 15th behind ESPN, Hallmark Channel, History, TBS and others. Overall, all forms of media — television, radio, newspapers — have been suffered double-digit drops since 2016, according to Pew.
The timing couldn’t be worse, given the economic decline of traditional media stemming from the shift to online. Google alone made $4.7 billion last year from news publishers whose industry continues to shrink, losing an estimated 40 percent of its 2001 job base.
The collapse is most evident on the local level, including local television stations whose ratings have plummeted. Over 1,800 local papers have gone out of existence since 2004, notes a recent University of North Carolina study, and many more have stripped their staffing levels, creating numerous “news deserts” across the country.
The decline in local coverage, suggests the Nieman Lab at Harvard, has been filled by national partisan online media, giving ever more influence to media based in New York, Washington and San Francisco.
The new sociology of media
In the past independent, or at least quirky, voices could emerge from the hinterlands. When I was a young reporter, papers like the Kansas City Star, the Louisville Courier and the old Los Angeles Herald Examiner were well-staffed, great dailies that not only covered news, but often with a very different perspective than the large coastal media.
Even in places like New York and Washington, the editorial workforce has been transformed, in part because of high housing costs. The journalist of the 1980s was often a middle-class homeowner who could afford to live in the suburbs of New York and Washington. My neighbor at the Washington Post was a hard-drinking Italian working-class guy whose brother was a Baltimore cop.
Today that kind of working-class journalist has been replaced by younger reporters who often hail from elite universities. These young journalists, as Obama speechwriter Ben Rhodes noted, did not have to cover city councils and other boring local minutiae, leaping directly from graduate school into major newspapers and radio and television outlets. They may be good test-takers, but literally know nothing about the real world that people unlike themselves inhabit.
Overall, the new breed of reporters almost universally follow the progressive party line. In 2018, barely 7 percent of U.S. reporters identified themselves as Republicans; some 97 percent of journalists’ political donations go to Democrats.
But the new class order in journalism is not just a problem for conservatives. The gaping chasm between the elite journalists and working-class people, suggest left-leaning sociologists John Russo and Sheri Linkon, leads reporters to blame small-town residents and rural people for Trump without taking time to actually examine their voting behavior, life experience and attitudes.
Ahead: A troubled future
It was widely hoped the internet would forge an ever more diverse media. Yet, so far, we see a sad trend to homogeneity. This is likely to get worse as the tech oligarchs expand their control of media pipelines and continue to purchase major publications that were once proud exemplars of independent American journalism.
This takeover could become downright scary, particularly if there is a change of parties in Washington. There are growing calls, notably in The New York Times, to have Washington limit media that might appeal to the unhinged elements of the alt-right; progressives in some states, including New Jersey, have even called for the creation of state-supported media, not exactly something healthy for a democracy built on free speech and open discussion.
Many in media hope non-stop impeachment coverage, or continued unraveling of Trump’s inner circle, will both revive their fortunes and expel the hated Trump. The murky events in Ukraine also could undermine the credibility of the fledgling pro-Trump media, which could lead to even greater media homogeneity.
The emerging impeachment saga is likely to accelerate not only the alienation of much of the population from the press, but also create challenges for our democracy. With the demise of press diversity and openness, readers will be increasingly faced with a media that barely hides its prejudices, but instead offers largely alternative realities that may be only occasionally real and rarely edifying.

Texto completo: In 2017, the Economic Development Authority brought in almost a third of its revenue from Grow NJ program fees, or $13.2 million.
"What happened is that the public paid for the EDA's fees. That money is money that the public was deprived of."
Jim Walden
Task force special counsel
New Jersey continues to probe potential conflicts of interest in the state's corporate tax break programs, and whether or not businesses misrepresented information in order to win millions of dollars from two recently expired programs now being investigated by federal and state authorities.
Audits and reports found that the state agency doling out billions of dollars in tax breaks to companies didn't have the processes in place to adequately vet applications and spot red flags, and raise questions about information companies certified as true in their applications and whether lobbyists registered with the state when required.
The agency granting the lucrative tax breaks, the Economic Development Authority, relies on fees from the applications to help boost the government body's budget, which is self-funded and doesn't rely on state appropriations. The fees get larger if an application is approved, which creates an unhealthy incentive and potential conflict of interest, according to lawyers on a task force created by Gov. Phil Murphy.
"Part of that funding stream is the approval of applications that require diligence and require a gatekeeper," said task force special counsel Jim Walden at a hearing Thursday.
In 2017, the EDA brought in almost a third of its revenue from Grow NJ program fees, or $13.2 million. In previous years, the agency collected an average of 15% of its revenue from the program's fees.
If an application is approved, a company must pay 0.5% of the award up to $500,000, and again for when the tax break is actually issued. Companies then pay a service fee up to 2% of the tax credit up to $75,000. A company pays up to $5,000 to apply for a tax break.
Walden noted that the EDA underwriters he interviewed all said the fees did not cause them to approve an application, and they do not receive any bonuses for approvals.
The Philadelphia 76ers basketball team, which won a close to $80 million tax break to build a new practice facility in Camden, is the only company that included the fees it paid in its calculation that determined the size of its tax break.
"What happened is that the public paid for the EDA's fees," Walden said. "That money is money that the public was deprived of."
False statements Refrigeration distribution company Rainforest Distribution, which won a $2.4 million tax break in 2016, appeared to misrepresent information on its application to the Economic Development Authority, according to evidence presented Thursday at a hearing led by the task force.
The Queens-based company certified to the Economic Development Authority that it was considering moving to either Bayonne or Orangeburg, New York. In order to win a New Jersey tax break, a company has to prove it wouldn't move to New Jersey if it didn't have the tax break.
Emails between Rainforest Distribution employees and a consulting firm it hired, CBRE, suggest that Rainforest did not seriously plan on locating in Orangeburg.
Rainforest CEO Alexander Ridings, who was the CFO at the time the company submitted its application, admitted during Thursday's hearing the company had no serious intention of moving to Orangeburg. He said a commercial real estate firm the company hired, CBRE, asked for detailed information and reasons about why the New York site would also fit the company's needs.
Emails between CBRE and Rainforest employees show a CBRE employee named Susan Harte asking for a "lower cost option than NJ" and advised the company not to submit the draft lease Rainforest had from the Bayonne location. The company did not have a draft lease from Orangeburg. Harte asked Rainforest to submit a different document to the EDA "as it shows we are not so far along."
Ridings said he did not understand how this information would be used in Rainforest's application, and that it was the first time he was dealing with a commercial real estate firm and applying for a tax incentive. Special counsel Walden noted that Rainforest would have probably still been eligible for the tax break even if it just listed its previous location in Queens on its application.
"Effective October 16, 2019, Susan Harte, who previously served in our Location Incentives Group, is no longer employed by CBRE," CBRE said in a statement. "CBRE takes great pride in its reputation for upholding the highest ethical standards, which we demand from each of our 90,000 professionals around the globe."
Task force lawyers also read emails between Harte and EDA employees, and asked if the messages should be considered lobbying. Stephanie Olivo, the director of compliance with the state campaign finance agency, said yes. Harte does not appear to have registered with the agency.
"If special interests are not disclosed, there's the possibility the special interests are using illegal means to get their way," Walden said. Registering means "at least there's a breadcrumb trail."
The New York Times found that over five years, a dozen companies listed the same New York address at Blue Hill Plaza as the location they were considering moving to if they didn't win a New Jersey tax break.
The FBI and Philadelphia prosecutors are among a handful of entities investigating the two corporate tax break programs meant to boost job growth and development, Grow NJ and Economic Redevelopment & Growth (ERG), according to the Philadelphia Inquirer.
A Senate panel is also considering replacement programs for Grow NJ and ERG, which expired earlier this year. An ethics committee dismissed a complaint filed by advocacy group Working Families earlier this week that alleged the committee was stacked with members with connections to insurance executive and power broker, George Norcross.
Norcross is tied to companies that won $1.1 billion of the $1.6 billion worth of tax breaks awarded in Camden, according to a ProPublica and WNYC investigation. The news outlets also found that lawyers from Parker McCay had an outsized role in the crafting of the Economic Opportunity Act, which created the revamped tax break programs. Parker McCay is led by Norcross' brother, Philip Norcross, and also represents many of the companies that won tax breaks.

Texto completo: State official says he flagged the optics of son's Ukraine work in 2015
A career State Department official overseeing Ukraine policy told congressional investigators this week that he had raised concerns in early 2015 about then-Vice President Joe Biden's son serving on the board of a Ukrainian energy company but was turned away by a Biden staffer, according to three people familiar with the testimony.
George Kent, a deputy assistant secretary of state, testified Tuesday that he worried that Hunter Biden's position at the firm Burisma Holdings would complicate efforts by U.S. diplomats to convey to Ukrainian officials the importance of avoiding conflicts of interest, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of confidentiality rules surrounding the deposition.
Kent said he had concerns that Ukrainian officials would view Hunter Biden as a conduit for currying influence with his father, said the people. But when Kent raised the issue with Biden's office, he was told the then-vice president didn't have the "bandwidth" to deal with the issue involving his son as his other son, Beau, was battling cancer, said the people familiar with his testimony.
The testimony by Kent offers a reminder that as Democrats probe President Trump's alleged actions in pressuring Ukraine to dig up compromising information on Biden, the impeachment inquiry also threatens to keep alive questions about the former vice president's handling of his son's foreign work at a precarious moment for his 2020 presidential campaign.
Kent, who also testified about how Trump's associates raised unfounded allegations about the former ambassador to Ukraine, is the first known career diplomat to raise concerns internally in the Obama administration about Hunter Biden's board position. The Washington Post has previously reported that there had been discussions among Biden's advisers about whether his son's Ukraine work would be perceived as a conflict of interest, and that one former adviser had been concerned enough to mention it to Biden, though the conversation was brief.
During his testimony this week, Kent did not name the Biden staffer he said he communicated with, according to people familiar with his remarks.
Although many of Trump's charges regarding Hunter Biden have been unfounded, the elder Biden has faced questions about why he didn't anticipate concerns about potential conflicts of interest as he took a leading role in carrying out U.S. policy toward Ukraine. Polls show Biden with an advantage over Trump in a potential general election matchup, and Biden has sought in recent days to focus attention on the actions of a president many Democrats see as corrupt and unfit for office.
A former senior Biden national security aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, had no recollection of hearing about Kent's concerns, and also never heard a concern raised by the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine at the time. The first time the aide recalls Hunter Biden's involvement surfacing as an issue was in December 2015, when the vice president traveled to Ukraine to deliver an anti-corruption speech and the New York Times wrote about his son's role. Hunter Biden's board appointment had been publicly announced the previous year and reported by the media at the time.
The aide said that Hunter Biden's position had no substantive impact.
"I don't understand what the optics thing means other than someone thinking it looked bad in a political way," the aide said. "Did it have any effect on U.S. policies, either on what we were doing or what the Ukrainians were doing? It didn't. . . . In the aggregate it didn't have any discernible effect."
The aide said that Joe Biden was dealing with a lot during Beau Biden's bout with cancer, but that it had a minimal impact on his work.
"Day-to-day, the vice president was at work and he was pretty focused," the aide said. "Does that mean it's inconceivable that someone said, 'Hey, look, it's not the time to raise a family issue?' I guess it's conceivable. But I never saw evidence he wasn't capable of doing the VP role and dealing with his family at the same time."
Andrew Bates, a Biden campaign spokesman, said in a statement that "on Joe Biden's watch, the U.S. made eradicating corruption a centerpiece of our policies toward Ukraine."
Hunter Biden joined the board of the Ukrainian gas company - headed by a former government minister investigated for possible corruption - in 2014, at the same time his father was leading U.S. efforts to crack down on corruption in that country.
The issue has erupted in recent weeks amid revelations about a July 25 phone call in which Trump asked Ukraine's president to "look into" the Bidens, particularly whether Joe Biden pressured Ukrainian officials to fire a prosecutor whose office had been investigating Burisma. The Democrats' impeachment inquiry is seeking to determine whether Trump withheld military aid and diplomatic support to Ukraine in an attempt to get information to use against Biden.
Trump and his allies have made the unsubstantiated claim that Biden pressed for the prosecutor's firing to protect his son. In fact, according to former U.S. officials and Ukrainian anti-corruption activists, the investigation of Burisma was dormant at the time. And Biden, adding to the calls from others in the U.S. government and Western institutions, was urging Ukraine to tap a new prosecutor who would be more aggressive in combating corruption.
Biden has said that he never spoke with his son about his dealings with Ukraine and has said that he only learned of his position on the Burisma board when he read about it in news reports.
Hunter Biden told ABC News in an interview this week that he did "nothing wrong at all" but that he showed "poor judgment" in accepting the position on the Burisma board.
Joe Biden told reporters Wednesday that he wouldn't have changed anything about his actions, including discouraging his son from joining the board, and said he had no regrets.
"No. No, I don't," he said. "Because I never discussed with my son anything having to do with what was going on in Ukraine. That's a fact."
Biden has pledged that, if president, no one in his family would have "any business relationship with anyone that relates to a foreign corporation or foreign country." During the presidential candidates debate Tuesday night, he twice dodged a question about why he did not have a similar policy as vice president.
But on Wednesday, he said his new policy was developed not because of anything Hunter Biden did but because of the actions of the Trump family.
Daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, hold senior White House jobs, while Trump has retained ownership of his real estate business, which is being run by his sons and has been the subject of lawsuits alleging that the company has been a conduit for foreign governments to enrich Trump in violation of the Constitution's emoluments clause. On Thursday, the White House announced that Trump had awarded the 2020 Group of Seven summit of world leaders to his golf resort near Miami, using his public office to direct a large contract to his private company.
"In my White House, none of my children or family have offices at the White House," Biden said. "They will not be invited to sit in significant meetings of a Cabinet-level post and they will have no foreign investment, and the reason to do that is not because of anything that went on in our administration. It is because of what Donald Trump has done. He has so debased the standard of what constitutes ethical behavior that the next president has to make it absolutely clear - absolutely clear - this will not happen again."
Biden's campaign has been attempting to move past any discussions about Hunter Biden, and his team considers most questions having already been addressed. Biden aides also pointed toward the debate Tuesday night, where no candidate criticized Biden on the issue, as a sign that it is not resonating on the campaign trail.
"It's been asked and answered," Kate Bedingfield, his deputy campaign manager, told reporters after the debate. "Democratic voters know that these lies are not getting traction and it's not the conversation they want to hear. And I think that was reflected in the fact that it was not a significant piece of the discussion."

Texto completo: For millions of listeners, Lizzo's hit "Truth Hurts" has been more than just the No. 1 song in the country, the position it held on Billboard's Hot 100 chart for six weeks this summer and fall.
An ebullient anthem of empowerment, the song has thoroughly penetrated pop culture, appearing in online memes by everyone from teenage TikTok users to Hillary Clinton. "Truth Hurts" has also introduced Lizzo as a new kind of star: an outspoken, body-positive woman of color, who is expected to be a major contender at next year's Grammy Awards.
But who wrote the song?
That question has been quietly in dispute for months. The song's official credits list four writers: Lizzo, whose real name is Melissa Jefferson; Ricky Reed, her primary producer; Tele, another producer; and Jesse Saint John. But a pair of songwriting brothers, Justin and Jeremiah Raisen, say they were involved in an early writing session with Lizzo that adapted a tweet into the song's signature lyric - "I just took a DNA test, turns out I'm 100% that bitch" - and were denied credit. The brothers are careful to praise Lizzo as a singular and inspiring force. "What she is doing for culture is unlike anything we've seen a modern pop star do, maybe ever," they said in an interview. But as their efforts to obtain credit - as well as a share of the royalties for what may well become a multimillion-dollar song - have dragged on without resolution, they decided to speak out.
"It's not fair that we were not included," said Justin Raisen, who has developed a specialty working with female artists like Sky Ferreira, Charli XCX and Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth.
Cynthia Arato, a lawyer for Lizzo, strongly denied the Raisens' claim.
"The Raisens are not writers of 'Truth Hurts,'" Arato said in a statement. "They did not collaborate with Lizzo or anyone else to create this song, and they did not help write any of the material that they now seek to profit from, which is why they expressly renounced any claim to the work, in writing, months ago."
Reed declined to comment.
Credit disputes are common in the music industry, but do not often become public. In the case of "Truth Hurts," the disagreement involves a crucial part of Lizzo's persona and brand - she has applied for a trademark for the phrase "100% That Bitch," and sells T-shirts on her website featuring those words.
For an industry that has already been shaken by controversial copyright cases, like the multimillion-dollar jury verdicts over Robin Thicke's "Blurred Lines" and Katy Perry's "Dark Horse," the "Truth Hurts" episode raises another knotty question: Who has the right to claim authorship over even small phrases in a song, when multiple people were "in the room" when they were created?
According to the Raisen brothers - who grew up as rock fans on Long Island and are new part of the songwriting and production circuit in Los Angeles - they held a joint songwriting session in April 2017 with Lizzo and two other writers, Saint John and Yves Rothman.
While the five of them worked on a song called "Heathy," the brothers said, Saint John pulled up a meme on his phone based on a tweet that read: "I did a DNA test and found out I'm 100% that bitch.' They all laughed, and Jeremiah said that he suggested including the lyric in the song.
Lizzo sang it almost identically to the way those words appear in "Truth Hurts," as demonstrated in a recording from the session that the brothers shared with The New York Times and later posted on Instagram. Jeremiah also said he helped write the melody for "Healthy," including the "DNA test" line.
(In another complication to the song's origins, the woman who wrote the tweet, a British singer who goes by the name Mina Lioness, has complained bitterly that she, too, deserves credit.)
Danny Riordan, an aspiring songwriter and friend of the Raisens who said he was present for part of the "Healthy" session, remembered the excitement in the room as the song boomed over the studio speakers.
"Everyone was like, 'Oh my God, this is going to be huge,' " Riordan said.
Five months after the session that produced "Healthy," "Truth Hurts" was released, and the Raisens said they were surprised that Lizzo's song contained the "DNA test" line but without credit given to them or Rothman.
"There was a bittersweet emotion, because deep in our hearts we know that we were a part of this song," Jeremiah Raisen said. "We should feel validated but we're not."
The Raisens said they began their campaign shortly after, seeking 5% each of the songwriting royalties from "Truth Hurts." As the song climbed to No. 1 this summer, the brothers took up something of a vigilante campaign on social media, posting congratulatory messages to Lizzo while also aggressively arguing their case.
But the Raisens' case may be complicated by the fact that they rescinded an earlier claim over "Truth Hurts" through their publisher, Kobait, which Lizzo's representatives believe should bar them from pursuing the matter further.
Lizzo's representatives do not contest that the session yielded "Healthy" and its "DNA test" line. The crux of the disagreement is who did what: The brothers say the session was conducted with the understanding that all parties were contributing to the resulting work, and that Lizzo's vocal was tailored to the instrumental track they created. Lizzo's representatives say the Raisens were not involved in creating Lizzo's vocal line and so have no claim to it now.
But the law may favor the Raisens on this point, said Don Gorder, the chairman of the music business and management department of the Berklee College of Music in Boston.
"Copyright law says that if a work is created and it's clearly the intention of all the people who contributed that it's merged into a whole," Gorder said, "that they are all equal owners of the song unless they agree otherwise."
As part of their campaign, the Raisens commissioned an opinion from a musicologist, who concluded that "Truth Hurts" has "some strikingly similar lyric and musical elements to those in 'Healthy,'" and that Lizzo's hit "would not exist in its present form without the existence of and the borrowing from 'Healthy.'"
Lizzo's representatives portray the Raisens' claim as a common hazard for artists with a big hit, and say that theirs is baseless. After six weeks at No. 1, "Truth Hurts" finally fell to second place on Billboard's Hot 100 chart on Monday, replaced by Travis Scott's "Highest in the Room."
"Although it has become all too commonplace for successful artists to be subjected to these type of opportunistic claims," Arato said, "it is nevertheless disappointing that after all of her hard work, Lizzo has to respond to this specious claim."
The disagreement over "Truth Hurts" may involve another precious currency: a Grammy. Although the song is 2 years old, Grammy rules allow it to be nominated for next year's awards because it was part of a 2019 album - it was added to "Cuz I Love You" as a bonus track - and had not been previously submitted. (The song's popularity exploded this year thanks in part to TikTok memes and a prominent Netflix placement, and as Lizzo's public appearances established her as a charismatic new star.)
At the Grammys, "Truth Hurts" is under consideration for both record and song of the year, and Lizzo is considered a leading candidate for best new artist. Nominations will be announced Nov. 20.

Texto completo: NEW YORK - Lizzo's breakthrough tune, "Truth Hurts," which spent six weeks on top of Billboard's Hot 100 chart this year, features the signature line:"I just took a DNA test/ Turns out I'm 100 percent that b----." The lyric originated from a 2017 tweet by singer Mina Lioness and was turned into a meme, which was then used in Lizzo's song "Healthy," created in 2017.
The songwriting brothers Justin and Jeremiah Raisen, who worked on "Healthy," claim say they deserve writing credit on "Truth Hurts" since the song borrows from "Healthy," a tune they co-wrote.
The songwriters credited on "Truth Hurts" are Lizzo, Ricky Reed, Tele and Jesse Saint John. "Truth Hurts" was originally released in September 2017 but got a boost this year after it was featured in the Netflix film "Someone Great."
"After reaching out to Ricky Reed and Lizzo's team about fixing it, we put the song in dispute in 2017 when it came out," Justin Raisen wrote Tuesday on Instagram. "We've tried to sort this out quietly for the last two years ... but were shut down every time."
Lizzo's lawyer Cynthia Arato said in a statement: "They did not collaborate with Lizzo or anyone else to create this song, and they did not help write any of the material that they now seek to profit from, which is why they expressly renounced any claim to the work, in writing, months ago."
The New York Times reported that the Raisens rescinded an earlier claim over "Truth Hurts" through their publisher, Kobalt.
"The last thing we want to do is throw any negativity toward Lizzo's momentum and movement as a cultural figure. If we believe in what she's preaching, believing in ourselves & our own voices is something we thought she'd understand," Justin Raisen wrote.

Ousted: Country music star Gretchen Wilson, whose hit song, "Here for the Party," features the lyrics, "And I ain't leaving till they throw me out," was ousted from a New Mexico hotel last weekend over noise complaints. A Las Cruces police spokesman said Wilson, 46, and other guests had "worn out their welcome" at the Hotel Encanto de Las Cruces and they helped security remove them. The musician tweeted the hotel asked her to leave "in the middle of the night for no reason." She also called on Twitter followers to "band together to put Hotel Encanto out of business."
Podcastland: TV powerhouse Shonda Rhimes ("Grey's Anatomy," "Scandal") is moving aggressively into the burgeoning podcast world, inking a three-year deal between her company, Shondaland, and iHeartMedia. In a statement, Rhimes said she welcomed the opportunity to expand Shondaland's storytelling into the growing medium, which she praised for a unique sense of boldness and intimacy.
Homicide update: "Tarzan" actor Ron Ely's wife, Valerie Lundeen Ely, 62, was stabbed to death in their California home by their 30-year-old son, Cameron Ely, who was then shot and killed by sheriff's deputies, authorities said.

FACEBOOK CO-FOUNDER, WHO WANTS COMPANY BROKEN UP, LAUNCHES ANTI-MONOPOLY FUND

Texto completo: Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes, who has called upon the federal government to break up the social-networking giant he helped create, on Thursday launched a new $10 million fund aimed at taking on the influence of corporations in politics and rebuilding civic power.
The Anti-Monopoly Fund (AMF) is part of Hughes' Economic Security Project. According to the group, the AMF will "fill a need of directing resources to organize and expand the efforts of groups that are already working on creating fair markets and implementing smart anti-monopoly enforcement and policy."
In a statement, Hughes said the AMF is being created "at a pivotal moment where cultural and political momentum are aligned to rein in the unchecked behavior of Big Tech," but that the fund would also put its attention toward powerful industries outside of the tech sector.
"There is also a need and opportunity to take meaningful action on monopoly power across industries that's led to corporate interests in the driver's seat of our political and economic system for far too long," Hughes said.
Hughes garnered widespread attention when, in May, he wrote a lengthy piece for the New York Times arguing that U.S. federal regulators need to break up Facebook. Among the reasons Hughes gave for his position was Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's 60% ownership of the company's voting shares, which Hughes argued gives the Facebook founder "unprecedented and un-American" power to establish the policies and direction of the company.
The AMF has already signed on some notable backers, including George Soros' Open Society Foundation, the Ford Foundation, the Knight Foundation and Redwood City-based Omidyar Network, which was started by eBay founder Pierre Omidyar.
According the the AMF, the fund is set up to operate only until March 2021. By using such a finite time frame, the group will be able to "remain agile in strategy and resource allocation," AMF said in a statement.
Facebook didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Hughes' new fund.

The Associated Press
CLEVELAND - A jury was seated Thursday for the first federal trial on the opioid crisis, but the push to settle the case before opening arguments next week continued, with company officials expected to gather for further talks.
U.S. District Judge Dan Polster had ordered executives for the companies that are defendants to appear in Cleveland today for continued negotiations, a person with knowledge of the negotiations told The Associated Press. The person was not authorized to disclose information about ongoing negotiations and spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Opening arguments are scheduled for Monday, with two county governments arguing that the companies engaged in a conspiracy that has ravaged their communities, while the companies say they complied with the law and supplied only drugs that doctors prescribed. The companies say they followed the law.
The drug distribution companies AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal Health and McKesson - and manufacturers Teva and Johnson & Johnson - have the outlines of a settlement to thousands of opioid-related lawsuits that could be worth $50 billion over time.
Under the proposed terms, which could change, the three distributors would pay a total of $18 billion over 18 years; Johnson & Johnson would chip in $4 billion over time; and Teva would contribute an estimated $15 billion worth of overdose antidotes and treatment drugs.
An additional $14 billion would come from distribution of those drugs, based on calculations of how much a distributor could charge for them, according to people with knowledge of the deal who were not authorized to disclose information and spoke on the condition of anonymity.
The deal is being worked out with a group of state attorneys general. Samantha Fisher, a spokeswoman for the Tennessee attorney general's office, confirmed a $50 billion settlement framework that was first reported by The New York Times.
The settlement, if finalized, would apply to more than 2,000 lawsuits across the country. But the pressure of a more limited federal trial is a key in the push toward striking a deal.
All three distributors and two Teva subsidiaries are among the defendants in the Cleveland trial on claims of Ohio's Cuyahoga and Summit counties.
Johnson & Johnson was in the case before settling earlier this month in a deal worth more than $20 million. Three other drugmakers also settled with the Ohio counties. A fourth, OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma, is trying to reach a settlement of all opioid lawsuits through bankruptcy court.
Distributor Henry Schein and the Walgreens pharmacy chain are also in the Cleveland case but have not been reported to be part of a bigger settlement.
Polster, for the second day in a row, denied a request Thursday from defendants to delay the trial because of reports of a settlement offer.
The jury was seated in less than two days despite a challenge of picking from a pool from counties in the Cleveland area that have been hard hit by the opioid crisis. Federal data shows that from 2006 through 2012, the area received more doses of opioids per person than the national median.
Counting both strong prescription painkillers and drugs such as heroin and illicit fentanyl, opioids have been linked to more than 400,000 deaths in the U.S. since 2000.

Texto completo: "Modern Love" may be sappy, corny and sentimental - but the upcoming streaming series is also hopeful and believes that everyone can be happy if they want to be.
The anthology, which premieres all eight episodes on Amazon Prime Friday, follows a different love story in each Big Apple-set installment based on stories in The New York Times romance column of the same name.
In one, Tina Fey and John Slattery play characters trying to avoid a divorce; another puts John Gallagher Jr. and Sofia Boutella in the middle of a messy first date. Dev Patel and Catherine Keener dive into their long-lost loves in a third. Some stories are sweet and simple, others heartbreaking. But each tells a story of love.
"A lot of us walk around right now - I know I do - with walls up because there's so much coming at us and so much of it is surprising in its unpleasantness and its vitriol and its constancy," said Anne Hathaway, who plays a bipolar woman trying to keep Gary Carr's character around long enough to show her best side.
"So I like that this is ... a nice little anthology, it's not the magic bullet that's going to save humanity - but it is nice to be in a space where you don't have to work so hard to protect yourself.
"In any other year, that's a really depressing take. But in 2019, it sounds like a pretty good time," she said.
That may sound simplistic, but it's also refreshing that entertainment shows don't have to look like the real world. Viewers can watch the news for the news and the rest of TV can be escapism.
In "Modern Love," there's no talk of politics, religion or sports. Each love story exists in its own little bubble.
"Now is the time to make a show with a dose of optimism," creator John Carney told the Daily News. "Everything ... seems like quicksand and we're sinking a little bit. Those bonds with the people we love are the only things we've got."

Texto completo: "Great Performances: Grammy Salute to Music Legends," 9-11 p.m., PBS. "I had no idea (songs) would last this long," Valerie Simpson says. Or that singers would last. Simpson, 74, is in great voice; so are other honorees — Dionne Warwick, 78; and Sam Moore, 83. Songwriters Lou Adler, 85, and Johnny Mandel, 93, show up. But PBS isn't afraid to get heavy (Rival Sons with a great Black Sabbath tribute) or funky (George Clinton).
"Modern Love" debut, any time, Amazon Prime. Anthologies — once big on TV — are being revived by Prime. Last year was "Romanoffs;" now is a delightful mix of eight stories, taken from true-life essays in the New York Times. Not all involve romantic love — the first has a doorman's fondness for a young woman; the seventh has a gay man's feelings for his adoptive child and the birth mother. Andrew Scott and Olivia Cooke are great in that one; so is Anne Hathaway in the third, as a bipolar woman.
"The Blacklist," 8 p.m., NBC. The brilliant two-part opener left two loose ends: The sly crook called Louis T. Steinhil (an anagram for "illusionist") faked a suicide and escaped; the cunning Katarina Rostova moved into an apartment next to Liz ... who doesn't know this is her mother. Meanwhile, Aram goes undercover in a society of rich thrill-seekers who watch violence.

Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff: Facebook Is Built on Lies, Break It Up

Texto completo: Marc Benioff, the chairman and co-CEO of Salesforce and possibly America’s most woke billionaire, believes the U.S. government should do what many scholars and critics have called for and break up Facebook—a hugely profitable company that Benioff blasted as morally bankrupt and unscrupulous.
“Facebook is the new cigarettes. It’s addictive. They’re after your kids,” Benioff told CNBC’s Jim Cramer on Wednesday, part of a battery of interviews Benioff did ostensibly in support of a new book—and to promote his vision of a new type of “compassionate capitalism” that he outlined in a New York Times op-ed on Sunday—that became a ringing, stinging critique of his fellow (but much more powerful and evidently far less woke) billionaire tech mogul’s company.
SEE ALSO: What Breaking Up Facebook Would Entail, According to Experts
Facebook lacks “a commitment to trust and truth,” Benioff added, echoing a call made in March by U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, one of the frontrunners for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, that the company has amassed too much power. “Facebook should be broken up. They’re using these assets [that is, its users’ data] in a way to further manipulate even more people.”
Benioff went further. He blasted Facebook for its technique of scooping up other companies—Facebook properties WhatsApp and Instagram are only the most prominent—and merging those companies’ data into Facebook’s own massive trove of information about its 1.59 billion-plus users. And he’s not so keen on Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s continued insistence that political ads containing outright lies can appear on the social network.
Facebook has, for almost a decade, been in some form of trouble with the government and yet has not changed its behavior. Facebook negotiated a consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 2011, after agreeing that it had mishandled user data and misled users about privacy.
In July of 2019, following the Cambridge Analytica scandal (and allegations that fake news spread on Facebook helped swing the 2016 election to Donald Trump and sparked genocide in Myanmar), Facebook agreed to pay the FTC $5 billion for violating the consent decree. Meanwhile, the company continues to post record profits—and, according to Buzzfeed News, appears to enforce its own policies erratically and unequally.
This has fueled growing demands in Congress and elsewhere for the government to wield its anti-trust powers and do to Big Tech—a broad rubric generally meant to include the “Big 5” of Apple, Facebook, Google, Amazon and Microsoft—what it did to the telephone, oil and steel monopolies at various times in the 20th century: either break up the companies to diffuse their power or use regulation to blunt it.
In a speech given at Georgetown University on Thursday, Zuckerberg said he briefly pondered banning Facebook ads but decided not to, erring on the side of “more expression” or more speech. (At the same time, Facebook has deplatformed some speakers, mostly notably Alex Jones and InfoWars, for spreading false claims.)
Benioff told CNN that there was “no question” he would ban ads that contained lies and also highlighted what others have identified as the heart of the matter—Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which indemnifies internet companies from responsibility for speech on their platforms.
As for what a “broken up” Facebook would resemble—or who would do it—Benioff did not say. But “[o]n these platforms, it’s well documented what’s happening,” he told CNN. “And this cannot continue. It is deeply affecting our society.”
We need a new capitalism that is more fair, equitable & sustainable that values stakeholders as importantly as shareholders. Business is the greatest platform for change where purpose can rise above profit & we focus on improving the state of the world. pic.twitter.com/FpZ4yryobF

At White House meeting, insults fly and tempers flare

Texto completo: Washington • You know a White House meeting has gone off the rails when the president of the United States and the speaker of the House cannot agree over the precise insult one called the other.
According to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, President Donald Trump called her a “third-grade” politician during a combative meeting with congressional leaders of both parties on Wednesday about the worsening situation in northern Syria. White House officials and Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., the Senate minority leader, said Trump actually called Pelosi “third-rate.”
At one particularly tense moment, Pelosi informed the president that “all roads with you lead to Putin,” referring to Vladimir Putin, the Russian president.
And so, on Day 1,000 of his presidency, that is where things stand between Trump and Pelosi, who have a fraught history of derailing meetings shortly after pledging to work together, including one in January, when the president abruptly stood up, said “bye bye,” and stormed out. A meeting in May basically ended before it began.
The roughly 20-minute meeting on Wednesday, the first since Democrats began an impeachment inquiry of Trump, was a new low, according to the recollections of several Democratic officials who shared details of the meeting. The White House did not dispute their accounts.
Trump began the proceedings in the Cabinet Room by making it clear that he did not want to be there.
“They said you wanted this meeting,” Trump told the congressional leaders. “I didn’t want this meeting, but I’m doing it.”
Several lawmakers replied that White House officials had reached out to them in efforts to brief them on the administration’s Syria policy.
Trump then began a speech about a “nasty” letter he had sent to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, which he said was proof that he had not given the Turkish leader a green light to advance Turkish forces into Syria. Trump then directed Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California, the Republican House minority leader, to pass copies of the letter around the table.
#Turkey President's office confirms to @bbcturkce that when President #Erdogan received #Trump's letter, he "thoroughly rejected it, threw it in the bin" and launched the #Syria operation the same day. His mind was already made up to move in; letter was reportedly the final straw pic.twitter.com/pHaiyF5skG
— Mark Lowen (@marklowen) October 17, 2019
The letter to Erdogan, which began with the sentence “Let’s work out a good deal!” was dated Oct. 9, or three days after the two leaders discussed the departure of U.S. forces from the area.
A short time later, Pelosi told the president that the House had passed a bipartisan resolution with overwhelming Republican support that condemned his acquiescence to a Turkish assault against the Kurds, who have been crucial American allies in the fight against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS.
Schumer tried to appeal to Trump as a fellow New Yorker who lived through the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
“I told the president, being from New York,” Schumer said to reporters shortly after the meeting, “we’re particularly aware of the problems that terrorism that an organization like ISIS can create. And the fact that someone no less than Gen. Mattis has said that ISIS has been enhanced, that the danger of ISIS is so much greater, worries all of us.”
At Schumer’s mention of Jim Mattis — who quit last year as Trump’s secretary of defense to protest the president’s decision to pull American troops out of Syria — Trump began denigrating the retired four-star general’s approach to combating terrorism in the Middle East.
Mattis was “the world’s most overrated general,” Trump told the group. “You know why? He wasn’t tough enough. I captured ISIS. Mattis said it would take two years. I captured them in one month.”
The conversation, several Democratic officials said, only devolved from there, and reached a fever pitch after Pelosi told the president that Russia, which has quickly stepped in to fill the void left by U.S. troops in Syria, “has always wanted a foothold in the Middle East.” It was at this point that she told Trump that all roads with him led to Putin.
At another point, Trump told Pelosi that he cared more about defeating terrorism than she did.
“I hate ISIS more than you do,” the president declared.
“You don’t know that,” the speaker replied.
What happened next is now a matter of ammunition by both the Democrats and the White House.
“You’re just a politician,” Trump said to Pelosi.
“Sometimes I wish you were,” Pelosi shot back.
Schumer interjected, telling Trump that name-calling was not necessary.
“Is that a bad name, Chuck?” Trump asked, then turned to Pelosi. “You’re not a politician, you’re a third-grade politician.” (Or “third-rate,” depending on which politician was doing the retelling.)
Pelosi stood up to leave, but then sat back down. At this point Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., the House majority leader — who later said he was “deeply offended” by the president’s treatment of the speaker — said it was time to go.
“This is not useful,” Hoyer said as he and Pelosi made for the door.
“Goodbye,” the president responded. “We’ll see you at the polls.”
In the hours afterward, Democrats and the White House leapt to promote their side of the story and take shots at each other. Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary, said the president had been completely in control during the meeting with lawmakers.
“The president was measured, factual and decisive, while Speaker Pelosi’s decision to walk out was baffling, but not surprising,” Grisham said in a statement. “She had no intention of listening or contributing to an important meeting on national security issues. While Democratic leadership chose to storm out and get in front of the cameras to whine, everyone else in the meeting chose to stay in the room and work on behalf of this country.’’
By early evening, Trump had posted on Twitter the official White House photos of the meeting. One showed Pelosi standing up to speak to him, which Trump characterized as an “unhinged meltdown.”
Pelosi used “meltdown” to describe Trump’s behavior as well.
Another photo of the session showed a close-up of Democratic lawmakers looking pained as the meeting went on.
“Do you think they like me?” Trump wrote.

Texto completo: NEW YORK - Scotty Bowers, a self-described Hollywood "fixer" whose memoir offered sensational accounts of the sex lives of such celebrities as Katharine Hepburn, Cary Grant and the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, has died. He was 96.
Bowers' agent, David Kuhn, said he died Sunday of natural causes at his home in Los Angeles.
A native of Ottawa, Ill., Bowers was a Marine who served in the Pacific during World War II and moved to Los Angeles after the war ended. He found work in 1946 at a gas station on Hollywood Boulevard, and later contended his life changed when the actor Walter Pidgeon drove up in a "shiny" Lincoln two-door coupe and asked, "What are you doing for the rest of the day?"
"The gas station was the portal that eventually took me into an exclusive world where high-class sex was everything," Bowers wrote in "Full Service: My Adventures in Hollywood and the Secret Sex Lives of the Stars," published by Grove in 2012.
Bowers switched jobs from gas attendant to bartender and was welcomed, however discreetly, into the Hollywood underground and party scene. He kept planned assignations in his head, not on paper, and managed to avoid both vice squads and the tabloids in a more censorious, pre-TMZ world. In "Full Service," he told some of the industry's most shocking stories since Kenneth Anger's notorious "Hollywood Babylon."
At a time when Hollywood nicknames included "Duke" (for John Wayne) and "Bogie" (for Humphrey Bogart), Bowers was known as "Mr. Sex." He wrote of orgies with Cole Porter, "sexual mischief" with Grant and actor Randolph Scott, giving Vivien Leigh "orgasm after orgasm" and affairs with J. Edgar Hoover and Spencer Tracy. He also alleged that he found partners for everyone from Hepburn and Grant to the Duke and Duchess of Windsor.
"His idea of good clean fun included drilling a peephole in the gas station's bathroom," The New York Times' Janet Maslin wrote in 2012, "exercising his healthy libido so fully that he sometimes needed an ice pack to recuperate, and providing fake college girls to serve as the real college girls cited in Alfred Kinsey's scientific sex studies."
Bowers was the subject of a 2018 documentary, "Scotty and the Secret History of Hollywood," directed by Matt Tyrnauer.
Critics were skeptical, and Tracy biographer James Curtis dismissed Bowers as "full of glib stories and revelations, all cheerfully unverifiable." But he also had numerous defenders, including the writer Gore Vidal, to whom Tyrnauer dedicated his film.
"Scotty doesn't lie," Vidal wrote in a blurb for the book, "the stars sometimes do - and he knows everybody."
Bowers would allege that he had adult encounters since age 11, when a Catholic priest in Chicago would pay $1 for favors. He finally settled down in the 1980s, writing that the AIDS epidemic meant that "it was too unsafe a game to play anymore," and married speech therapist Lois Broad in 1984. Bowers waited decades to tell his story in part because some of his alleged former clients and lovers were still alive.
"I've kept silent all these years because I didn't want to hurt any of these people," Bowers told the Times in 2012. "And I never saw the fascination. So they liked sex how they liked it. Who cares?"

Texto completo: Google and other Big Tech companies are rushing to establish a new protocol, called DNS over HTTPS ("DoH"), that could open the internet floodgates to child pornography, drugs, malware and other illegal activity and enable perpetrators to hide behind new privacy shields.
As a retired child safety and cybercrimes police detective, I have dedicated my career to helping children by pursuing, apprehending and prosecuting child predators. I am urging Google and the other proponents of this plan to slow down, think this through and respond to questions from law enforcement and federal authorities about the dangers of this plan.
Parents do not need dangerous new gateways through which their children can be exposed to predators, pornography, cyberbullies, school violence and drug dealers.
Already, as a recent New York Times investigation found, tech companies have reported 45 million online photos and videos of children being sexually abused this year — more than double what they found the previous year. And the number keeps growing. Now is not the time to make it even easier to spread this filth and hide behind Google’s shield.
Child-safety experts at the internet Watch Foundation (IWF) are warning the so-called privacy changes could have a "catastrophic impact" by exposing child victims to some of the worst practices on the internet.
As the IWF notes, Google’s plan would mean that criminals could soon have countless new ways to bypass safeguards that child safety groups, cybersecurity experts, internet service providers and government agencies have developed. These changes could allow child predators to directly interact with children and then disappear, leaving law enforcement no means to find the offenders.
Antitrust investigators with the House Judiciary Committee have also sent a letter to Google asking the company to address serious concerns about the plan.
Specifically, the plan causing so much concern involves the internet Domain Name System (DNS), which makes the web work by connecting websites to unique addresses on the internet. Thanks to the DNS, which is often called "the phone book of the internet," a user can type in a website name and end up exactly where they want to go.
But the change could hide user requests, strengthen encryption, enable criminals to bypass essential filters like parental controls and make abusive material freely accessible. This would come at the same time that online child-abuse groups are sharing images of ever younger children and more extreme forms of abuse. The groups use encrypted technologies to teach pedophiles how to carry out the crimes and how to record and share images of the abuse worldwide. We cannot afford to give them new tools for hiding out.
Three specific questions need to be addressed: How will law enforcement be able to track online predators who collaborate through private email services and meet at a website to sexually exploit our children?
Will law enforcement still be able to track domestic terrorists such as school shooters who collaborate on certain websites they visit to obtain their information?
With millions of schools using Google Chromebooks, will this new protocol enable bypassing school filters such as Go Guardian and Securely that help keep our children safe?
In the pursuit of greater privacy, we must not jeopardize safety. We must fully evaluate the dangerous impact these changes could introduce. We must ensure that tech companies are implementing well-informed, responsible updates that strengthen, not diminish our children’s interaction with the online world.
Detective Richard Wistocki (Ret.) was a law enforcement officer for 30 years, including over two decades as an internet crimes investigator with the Naperville Police Department. As a cybercrimes detective and child safety proponent, he educates law enforcement, parents and students on responsible digital activity.

Texto completo: COLUMBUS – Comedian Ron "Tater Salad" White, who first rose to fame as the cigar-smoking, scotch-drinking funnyman from the Blue Collar Comedy Tour phenomenon, has long since established himself as a star in his own right.
Over the past 15 years, White has been one of the top-grossing stand-up comedians on tour in the country. His comedy recordings have sold more than 14 million units (solo and with the Blue Collar Comedy Tour), he's been nominated for two Grammys, he was featured in the Cameron Crowe Showtime Series "Roadies," and he even authored a book that appeared on the New York Times Bestseller List.
CAPA presents Ron White at the Palace Theatre (34 W. Broad St.) at 8 p.m. Friday, March 13. Tickets are $50.25 and $60.25 and can be purchased in-person at the CAPA Ticket Center (39 E.

Josh Radnor Brings Indie/Folk Music Project to the Lincoln COLUMBUS – Star of the TV sitcom "How I Met Your Mother" and the film Happythankyoumoreplease, Bexley native Josh Radnor returns to Columbus to perform a benefit concert in support of Friends of the Drexel with music project Radnor & Lee, his indie-folk music duo with singer/songwriter Ben Lee.
Friends of the Drexel present Radnor & Lee at the Lincoln Theatre (769 E. Long St.) at 8 p.m. Tuesday, Oct. 22. Tickets are $25 and can be purchased in-person at the CAPA Ticket Center (39 E. State St.), online at www.drexel.net, or by phone at (614) 469-0939 or (800) 982-2787.

Friends for over a decade with a shared interest in spirituality and philosophy, Josh Radnor and Ben Lee had always said they should write a song together. One song turned into ten, and Radnor & Lee was born. After their first live show, a friend described their music as "the intersection of pop and prayer." Upon hearing this, their producer Ryan Dilmore dubbed them "singer-psalmwriters." The duo's 2017 self-titled debut album features 11 songs that are in turn witty, hopeful, yearning, joyful, searching, and meditative.
American actor, filmmaker, and musician Josh Radnor is best known for portraying Ted Mosby on the popular Emmy Award-winning CBS sitcom "How I Met Your Mother." He made his writing and directorial debut in 2010 with the comedy/drama Happythankyoumoreplease, winning the Sundance Film Festival Audience Award and being nominated for the Grand Jury Prize.
Classic Albums Live to Perform The Beatles' Abbey Road COLUMBUS – Celebrating its 50th anniversary in 2019, The Beatles' eleventh studio album, Abbey Road, features the final recording sessions with all four original members of the British supergroup. Classic Albums Live will perform the 12x Platinum-selling album in its entirety, note-for-note and cut-for-cut, including megahits "Come Together," "Here Comes the Sun," and "Something."

Critically-acclaimed cover experts, Classic Albums Live, is a concert series based in Toronto, Ontario, in which musicians perform classic albums in their entirety track by track. The series was founded in 2003 by Craig Martin, a musician who had previously produced a series of boutique cabaret shows as well as composed music for television and film.
The musicians go to great lengths to faithfully recreate every sound on the original album. They have performed with orchestras, sitarists, choirs, and schools. The shows are treated like recitals with the album being performed in its entirety followed by a "greatest hits" set of the featured artists.
Wilco to Play the Palace COLUMBUS – Over the past two-plus decades, Wilco has won multiple Grammy Awards and released 10 studio albums as well as a trio of albums with Billy Bragg, penning music to lyrics by Woody Guthrie.
They have founded their own record label (dBpm Records) and festival (Solid Sound), and 2020 sees them curating Sky Blue Sky, a destination concert experience in Mexico, for the first time. The Chicago sextet continues to be regarded as a live powerhouse, as described by NPR, "To see Wilco on stage is to hear the best of the best."

A Dozen Democrats on the Debate Stage

Texto completo: Readers offer both praise and criticism, suggesting how some questions could have been handled better.
To the Editor:
Re "Race Takes Turn as Warren Faces Barrage Onstage" (front page, Oct. 16):
After watching all the Democratic debates, I am left with the following sentiments that I believe are shared by many Democrats:
My heart is with Bernie Sanders because what he says about America and what needs to be done is absolutely true. My head is with Elizabeth Warren because she is Bernie lite, a progressive who is more electable than Bernie since she is less scary to suburban Republicans and independents. And my fear puts me with Uncle Joe, because he may be most likely to beat President Trump in the swing Rust Belt states, and the thought of four more years of Trumpism is unspeakable.
But I felt the same way about Hillary Clinton and look how that turned out.
The others do nothing for this 65-year-old longtime Democrat. So how do I vote? I don't know.
Shelly B. Kulwin

To the Editor:
What struck me most about Tuesday night was how articulate all of the candidates were in expressing their positions compared with the muddled thoughts and language we've heard from President Trump ever since he appeared on the national stage.
I watched the debate in a venue sponsored by supporters of Pete Buttigieg. He had some good moments. Then I wondered how he would stack up against Mr. Trump one on one: Would Americans appreciate Pete's depth and calm or rally to re-elect the pompous bully Trump?
The most important thing that Americans can do next fall is to unite behind the eventual Democratic nominee. Impeachment is a long shot; let's make sure that Mr. Trump does not win a second term, and let's end this national nightmare!

To the Editor:
Re "Biden Defends Son Hunter at Debate, Saying Focus Should Be on Trump" (nytimes.com, Oct. 15):
In the Democratic debate, in defense of himself and his son, Joe Biden said: "My son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong." It seems to me, and perhaps to many in the country, that Mr. Biden's tepid response to President Trump's attacks intimates that indeed all may not be kosher with their respective behavior in Ukraine.
A more full-throated response from Mr. Biden might have been: "Mr. President, I, together with much of the country, am sick of the repetitive lies and insults that you are slinging at me and my son Hunter. If you have clear factual evidence, then I invite you to bring it forward so that the country may judge it on its merits. Otherwise, I ask you respectfully to shut up and move on."
In this way, perhaps the air could be cleared, and an election won.
Craig W. Snyder
Jamesville, N.Y.
To the Editor:
It's a shame that Elizabeth Warren isn't as frank as Bernie Sanders. For countries with single-payer health care systems, taxes are indeed a little higher, but the net benefit is much greater, as Bernie pointed out. Just tell the facts and move on. By refusing to yield on this question, she does herself and her cause a big disservice.
Travis Stasney
Vancouver, British Columbia
To the Editor:
The reason Elizabeth Warren doesn't outright say taxes may go up for universal health care but overall costs for the public will go down is not that she doesn't trust the American people; it's that she doesn't trust the politicians sharing the stage with her, and she doesn't trust the media covering the event.
And she shouldn't trust them, because they will warp her message and make it into a gotcha moment. Instead of focusing on the "costs will go down," they will focus on taxes going up. The Democrats should not be providing the Republicans with their talking points, especially when based on mischaracterizations. Ms. Warren was smart not to fall into that trap.
Michael Boyle
Boston
To the Editor:
Re "How to Prepare a Debate Zinger That Doesn't Sound Prepared" (nytimes.com, Oct. 15):
Are zingers and "biting quips" now an essential responsibility of presidents? Indeed, should voters even consider onstage debate skills as relevant to government leadership?

2020 Democrats slam Trump on Syria and Kurds but struggle to come up with alternative

Texto completo: All 12 candidates onstage at Tuesday night's Democratic debate agreed that President Trump’s decision to withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria was a major policy blunder, but they lacked any clear plan to deal with the aftermath of the Turkish invasion.
Asked if he would send troops back, former Vice President Joe Biden dodged the question, instead criticizing Trump’s decision as “the most shameful thing that any president has done in modern history” in terms of foreign policy.
When Cooper repeated the question, Biden again gave a non-answer and seemed to echo Trump’s response, which is to sanction Turkey and pressure President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. “Turkey is the real problem here,” Biden said. “And I would be having a real lockdown conversation with Erdoğan and letting him know that he's going to pay a heavy price for what he has done now.”
“We need to work with our allies, to work with Turkey and bring them out. This is an outrageous thing that happened here,” said Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar. “And what do we do now? We continue that humanitarian aid, but then we work with our allies to say 'Come back, Turkey, and stop this.'”

Texto completo: A women's advocacy organization is demanding that the Democratic National Committee cancel the next presidential debate unless one of its co-sponsors, NBC News, fires its leadership.
The call for the network to "clean house" comes in light of the recent revelations from former reporter Ronan Farrow's new book Catch and Kill.
“The DNC needs to make it clear that they support survivors of sexual abuse and cancel the upcoming 2020 Democratic presidential primary debate on MSNBC until Comcast and NBC News take clear steps to clean up the toxic culture that exists across their networks,” Shaunna Thomas, the co-founder and executive director of UltraViolet Action, said in a statement on Tuesday, according to the Wrap.
Thomas later referenced Farrow's reporting, which alleged that network executives knew about the allegation that former Today host Matt Lauer raped a subordinate at the Sochi Olympics in 2014. The former NBC reporter also alleged that the network squashed his reporting on disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein in part at his own request.Tweet"These initial reports demonstrate that NBC’s current leadership is either unable or unwilling to take appropriate steps to combat the culture of sexual abuse at the networks. These are problems that can only be solved by significant structural and cultural changes at MSNBC, NBC News, and its parent company, Comcast,” Thomas's statement went on. “The DNC must stand with survivors and pull the upcoming democratic presidential primary debate from MSNBC until Comcast takes clear steps to clean house at NBC News.”
A Washington Post spokesperson confirmed that the outlet still plans on hosting the November debate with MSNBC.
UltraViolet Action has previously called on NBC to fire network president Noah Oppenheim prior to its calls for the DNC to demand action.

Two presidential candidates voice support for drug decriminalization at Democratic debate

Texto completo: Marijuana Moment is a wire service assembled by Tom Angell, a marijuana legalization activist and journalist covering marijuana reform nationwide. The views expressed by Angell or Marijuana Moment are neither endorsed by the Globe nor do they reflect the Globe's views on any subject area.
Two Democratic presidential candidates said Tuesday they support decriminalizing opioids to combat the country's drug epidemic, marking the first time the issue of removing criminal penalties for possession of illicit substances beyond marijuana has been seriously discussed on a presidential debate stage.
During the 2020 primary debate in Westerville, Ohio, entrepreneur Andrew Yang was asked about his previously expressed support for decriminalizing opioids such as heroin.
“We need to decriminalize opioids for personal use. We need to let this country know this is not a personal failing. This was a systemic government failing," he said. “Then we need to open up safe consumption and safe injection sites around the country because they save lives."
He also said that “we have to recognize [addiction] is a disease of capitalism run amok."
“There was a point where there were more opioid prescriptions in the state of Ohio than human beings in the state of Ohio, and for some reason the federal government thought that was appropriate," Yang said, noting that Ohio sued OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma for its role in the crisis.
The suit called on the company to pay a “two percent fine [compared to their profits] and they killed tens of millions of Americans — eight an hour," Yang said.
“If the government turned a blind eye to this company, spreading a plague among its people, then the least we can do is put a resource into work in our communities so that people have a fighting chance to get well, even though this is not a money problem. We all know this is a human problem. Part of helping people get the treatment that they need is to let them know that they're not going to be referred to a prison cell, they will be referred to treatment and counseling."
Former US Representative Beto O'Rourke was also asked to weigh in on whether decriminalization is a part of the solution to addiction and overdose issues.
“Yes it is," O'Rourke said. “For many of the reasons that Mr. Yang just described."
The former congressman cited stories he's heard from voters during his campaign, saying that the experiences of veterans who purchased heroin after being prescribed opioids by the US Department of Veterans Affairs highlighted the need for drug policy reform.
“Now imagine if that veteran, instead of being prescribed an opioid, had been prescribed marijuana because we made that legal in America, ensured the VA could prescribe it, expunge the arrest records for those who'd been arrested for possession, and made sure that he was not prescribed something to which he would become addicted," O'Rourke said.
His comments about cannabis earned praise from Yang, who could be heard saying, “Yes, preach Beto" while the O'Rourke made his case.
O'Rourke, US Senator Kamala Harris, and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro agreed during the debate that pharmaceutical companies should be held accountable for their role in the opioid crisis.
In a follow up question about candidates' health, a moderator directed her inquiry at US Senator Bernie Sanders, who recently had a health scare. US Senator Cory Booker interjected to jokingly note that “Sanders is in favor of medical marijuana. I want to make sure that's clear as well."
“I do," Sanders said. “I'm not on it tonight."
South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg and US Representative Tulsi Gabbard have stood out among the Democratic pack as being vocally in favor of drug decriminalization that extends further than marijuana.
But while Sanders made history by becoming the first major presidential candidate to back cannabis legalization in 2015, he's resisted supporting broader decriminalization, stating that he's “not there yet."
That said, Sanders — as well as US Senator Elizabeth Warren — have backed other harm reduction policies, such as legalizing safe injection sites where those suffering from addiction can consume illicit substances under medical supervision.

Resumen: Joe Biden still has an edge in national polls in the Democratic presidential field but at Tuesday's debate, 2020 hopefuls focused on Elizabeth Warren.

Texto completo: Meet the new front-runner: Elizabeth Warren.
National polls still show Joe Biden with an edge over the rest of the Democratic presidential field, but the folks most intensely attuned to the contest – that would be the rivals competing for the nomination – were targeting Warren Tuesday night at the fourth of the Democratic debates.
Flattering, perhaps, but a focus that she never had to handle in the previous debates, and one that sometimes put the Massachusetts senator on the defensive as she dodged questions about whether her Medicare for All plan would result in higher taxes on the middle class and if her proposed “wealth tax” could fly.
“I understand that this is hard, but I think as Democrats we are going to succeed when we dream big and fight hard, not when we dream small and quit before we get started,” Warren declared. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar responded with a pointed “reality check” on Warren. “I'm sorry, Elizabeth," Klobuchar said, although she didn't really sound sorry. "I think we need to be honest here and tell the American people where we’re going to send the invoice. "
Winners and losers: Klobuchar, Buttigieg land some punches; billionaires on defense
The debate didn’t fundamentally shape or reshape the Democratic race, perhaps something not even a forum that stretched for more than three hours could do. But the more frontal challenges to Warren on various issues by almost everyone else – Klobuchar, South Bend (Ind. ) Mayor Pete Buttigieg, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke, California Sen. Kamala Harris, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, entrepreneur Andrew Yang – came amid new questions about whether Biden could be deposed as the moderate alternative to the party's liberal heroes, Warren and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.
And Sanders had a prize in his pocket that could boost him, rather than Warren, among voters on the left. During the debate, he teased that he would have a "special guest" at a campaign rally in Queens on Saturday. That turned out to be New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, as The Washington Post quickly reported, one of the party’s most influential young liberal voices.
All of the presidential candidates arrived on stage at Otterbein University in Ohio with things to prove: Biden about his family’s ethics. Sanders about his personal health. Warren about her political electability. And the other contenders, now polling in single digits, about whether they could break through – in some cases, whether they could even qualify for next month's debate, where the thresholds on fundraising and poll standing get higher.
And when the debate was over?
Warren didn’t wilt. She was unshaken in responding to the attacks, though she never directly answered when Buttigieg demanded, "yes or no," on whether her Medicare proposal would force her to raise taxes on the middle class. She did promise not to sign a bill that would raise overall health care costs for Americans. And she had a rejoinder ready when Buttigieg promoted his plan, which he calls "Medicare for all who want it. " She dubbed it "Medicare for all who can afford it. "
Sanders didn't slow down. That was an issue in the wake of the heart attack that the 78-year-old suffered a little more than two weeks ago on the campaign trail, prompting doctors to insert stents in his heart. He showed more flashes of humor than usual. When Booker noted that Sanders supported medical marijuana, Sanders joked, "But I'm not on it tonight. "
Biden didn't flinch. He defended his son, Hunter – but it probably won't be for the last time. The first question Biden got from the moderators was about the business interests his son, Hunter, pursued in Ukraine when Biden was the Obama administration's point person on Ukraine. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Biden or his son, but Hunter has acknowledged that may have reflected poor judgment on his part. "My son's statement speaks for itself," Joe Biden said not once but three times –not a particularly informative response and one that didn't address whether his own judgment might also have been flawed.
The political landscape for the debate was defined by this core question: Which candidate would be best able to defeat President Trump? That was the case Biden repeatedly tried to make for himself. He touted his age as a sign of wisdom and his experience as invaluable. "I'm the only one on this stage that has gotten anything really big done," he said, citing the Violence Against Women Act and other legislation he helped enact while a senator from Delaware.
That got Warren's attention. In the wake of the Great Recession, she noted, she had been instrumental in creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an idea she said skeptics had dismissed as unrealistic. Biden jumped in, saying he had rounded up votes for it. "Let's get that straight," he said.
Warren made it clear that wasn't how she saw it. Speaking slowly and with deliberation, she replied: "I am deeply grateful to President Obama, who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law. "
Sanders fired back at Biden, too. "I say this as a friend," he said, "but you got the Iraq war done. "
Biden vs. Warren: Two rivals debate whether party should strive for pragmatism or sweeping change
The stage was crowded with a dozen Democrats, the biggest debate to date, sponsored by CNN and The New York Times. Warren scored an overwhelming win by one measure: Who got the most time to speak, in large part because the moderators repeatedly gave her time to respond to attacks. In the end, she spoke for close to 23 minutes, far longer than Biden, a distant second at about 16-1/2.
Which seems only fair. After all, she is, apparently, the new front-runner.

Texto completo: Pembroke is a nice place to live.

In fact, there's no place better in the Granite State.
So says Reader's Digest in its November 2019 edition, which featured this headline: “50 Nicest Places in America.”
A town or city was chosen in each of the 50 states, with a city in Ohio called Columbiana finishing first in the country.
Resident Kellie Cholette nominated Pembroke for the honor, writing to the magazine, “This town is just a very tight-knit community and everyone I've met has been the nicest.”
The process included a nationwide search and more than 1,000 entries, which all had a common characteristic, a required criteria needed to make the cut: “Where people are kind and civility is winning,” according to Reader's Digest.
Once the nominations had been submitted, Reader's Digest editors and a panel of judges that included journalist David Brooks selected their favorite entries. Before anyone cries bias, that would be New York Times op-ed columnist David Brooks, not Concord Monitor science columnist David Brooks.
A nationwide poll attracted more than 45,000 votes, and Pembroke emerged as the winner in the Granite State, according to Reader's Digest.
Cholette's nomination letter said she and her significant other discovered nothing but kindness and camaraderie after they moved to Pembroke, writing, “My fiance and I were having a hard time viewing the fireworks from our house. Our neighbors spotted this and instantly got chairs out for us to sit with them.”
Cholette also cited the warmth surrounding Pembroke Old Home Day, an annual summer event with an array of activities: live music, hayrides, inflatable slides, bouncy houses, arts and crafts, mini-golf, tractor pulling, basketball tournaments, antique cars and those aforementioned fireworks.
Wrote Cholette, “We also have an old man about 80 years old that goes around streets near him and takes out your trash barrels if you forget and then will put them back once the garbage men come around.”
The town is home to a couple who adopted two neglected boys from a Ukrainian orphanage and addressed their developmental challenges before adopting two more; and a lawn-care professional who heard about a single mother's fight against cancer and began mowing her lawn in the summer and plowing her driveway in the winter. No charge, of course.
The Monitor wrote about Bridget Kelley Nafranowicz and her plowing and mowing angel, Bob Caruso, in February.
Elsewhere, Cholette mentioned nearly $20,000 that was raised through local donations after a family's home was destroyed by fire.
Cholette also cited a pair of Pembroke Academy sports teams as further proof that her town deserved to win.
The boys' basketball team won the state championship without any player averaging more than 17 points per game.
Player Sean Menard told the Monitor last winter, “We've got four or five guys who can put up 20 shots in a game. But we like to give up shots for the other person.”
And when the school's cross-country coach was diagnosed with cancer, her runners organized a 5-kilometer run to help pay her medical bills, an event that was held annually for three years, until the coach died.
A critic on a message-board cited the opioid crisis and addiction as a drawback to the town, but that's a problem affecting large sections of the country.
The rest of the messages were overwhelmingly favorable. And while many towns in New Hampshire have their own warm and welcoming Old Home Day celebrations, Cholette's nomination had enough good stories to propel Pembroke to the top of the family magazine's rankings.
And for good reason, residents said.
“I have lived in Pembroke for most of my life,” wrote Jonna Gaskell. “I've raised my children in this town and my husband is a police officer in this town. I could not be any prouder of each and every person that lives here. It is a tight-knit community.
“It is family.”

Allred fires back at 'She Said'; The attorney defends the use of secret settlements in sexual harassment cases.

Texto completo: On Sunday, Lionsgate held a "tastemaker" screening of its new film "Bombshell," about the women who called out sexual harassment at Fox News. It was a typical awards season event, featuring a Q&A with the movie's stars -- Charlize Theron, Nicole Kidman and Margot Robbie -- and a guest list peppered with influencers whose endorsement might help give the film traction. Taylor Swift was there -- though few actually laid eyes on her -- as was actress Cara Delevingne, Rodarte co-founder Laura Mulleavy and lawyer Gloria Allred.
On the surface, Allred's appearance at the Hollywood screening made sense. She has represented dozens of women who have sued powerful men for sexual harassment, though none who publicly spoke out against former Fox News chairman Roger Ailes or network host Bill O'Reilly.
But in the past month, Allred's reputation as a feminist crusader has come under scrutiny. In their new book "She Said" -- and a subsequent podcast episode of The Daily -- New York Times journalists Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey have raised questions about whether the attorney truly has her clients' best interests at heart. Through their reporting, the journalists argued that Allred was actually part of the problem instead of the solution, pressuring clients to accept secret settlements instead of publicly speaking out against their accusers in court.

In the case of Harvey Weinstein, Kantor and Twohey found, Allred's firm negotiated a $125,000 settlement for one actress in 2004 -- 13 years before Weinstein's pattern of alleged predation came to light.
But at the "Bombshell" event, Allred said she was unbothered by the negative press. "It hasn't been intense for me at all. I know what I'm doing is right," she said, moments after posing with two middle-aged female party guests who had asked for a photograph.
"I felt that, frankly, the New York Times reporters seem to be new to the issue of confidential settlements," she continued. "I do understand they have a different role than I have. Reporters want to know everything, because that's their job. I don't criticize them, because that's their job. But my job is not to be a member of the press. My job is to put my client first."
In response to Allred's comments, Kantor and Twohey said that they had spent more than 2 1/2 years investigating confidential settlements and found "that while they can provide victims of sexual abuse with financial recompense and privacy, they also allow alleged predators to repeatedly cover their tracks and go on to reportedly hurt others," the reporters wrote in an e-mail. "We are watching closely as legislators in California and elsewhere pursue alternative ways for victims to receive financial recompense that don't enable predation."
Allred insisted -- as she did in a Los Angeles Times op-ed last week -- that she never pressures her clients into accepting settlements. Her job, she said, is to outline the benefits and risks of every option: Do you want to file a public lawsuit and litigate for four or five years -- and maybe the jury will side with you? Or do you want a confidential settlement that does not require you to testify in court but may also prohibit you from speaking publicly about the allegations? (Those who enter into such settlements are still able file criminal complaints with the police.)
Most of her clients, Allred said, go the settlement route.
"So yeah, the press is like, 'That's not right. They're not helping other women,' " Allred said. "Women are really always socialized to put everybody else first. Put your children first, put your husband first. When do they get to put themselves first? If they can do a confidential settlement, why don't they get to do that?
"I don't want women to feel that they always have to sacrifice themselves for something called the greater good. They get to have the greater good for themselves too. They get to have the money to pay their therapy bills and their medical bills and maybe start a new chapter and also have their privacy and go on. They get to make that decision. They're adults."
But doesn't Allred stand a great chance of benefiting financially if her clients accept a settlement? In the case of the Weinstein accuser, Kantor and Twohey reported, Allred's firm kept 40% of the client's $125,000 payment. The attorney responded by saying there was not always a financial upside, pointing out that if a case took five years to get to trial, "maybe we'd get a larger verdict."
"There's nothing wrong with being paid to represent a client," she said. "They get paid to write their stories for the New York Times, last time I checked. They didn't do it for free, did they? I don't criticize them because they're getting paid to do a story or sell their book. Fine, God bless them. I hope they make a lot of money. But unfortunately for them, they don't understand the practice of law. They're like, 'We're shocked there's gambling in Casablanca!' They didn't say that, but that's it in essence."
Still, even if a client opts for a settlement -- doesn't it ever bother her that the silence might allow a perpetrator to continue a pattern of harassment?
"I'm not in control of whether they engage in that behavior or not," Allred said. "When they've had to pay the cost of [their wrongdoing] in the settlement, usually it's a teaching moment for them. It doesn't mean they'll never do it again, but it's something for them to think about.
"And I always believe -- and I said this about O.J. Simpson many years ago -- he will be the cause of his own destruction. That's what happened with Bill Cosby. That's what happened with Harvey Weinstein. That's what happened with Jeffrey Epstein. R. Kelly. It's within them. They will fall." Allred would not comment on the New York Times reporters' revelations about her daughter, attorney Lisa Bloom. In "She Said," Kantor and Twohey publish a memo written by Bloom in which the lawyer laid out a strategy to attack Weinstein accuser Rose McGowan, noting she felt "equipped to help [him] against the Roses of the world, because I have represented so many of them." (Bloom subsequently released an apology on her Twitter account, thanking the New York Times journalists and Ronan Farrow for forcing her to "confront the colossal mistake" she made in working with Weinstein.)
"She speaks for herself," Allred said of her daughter. "She said it was a mistake to represent [Weinstein]. Whatever she decides, I love her. She's a great attorney."
As for "Bombshell," which Lionsgate has set for a December release, the lawyer said she thought filmmaker Jay Roach "did a very good job with it," creating a film with a documentary-like feel that showed the conflict female employees who have been harassed in the workplace often experience.
"Often the press says, 'Why don't they come out, why don't they have a voice, why don't they tell the story?' Well, there are lots of reasons," Allred said. "I have no doubts [when a client takes a settlement] because I know I've helped my client and helped them have a new life. I get these emails all the time -- 'Thank you, and here's what I'm doing with all of this. I'm saving. I'm sending my kids to college. I'm going to college. I've started my own business. I'm getting all my therapy. I feel empowered.'
"I feel very encouraged by all of that. I know I'm doing the right thing. It doesn't matter whether the public knows. The public doesn't understand that I put the individual first."

Texto completo: The man was shooting at a second man when two plainclothes officers on patrol encountered him, officials said.
A man who was released from prison last week was in critical condition late Tuesday after being shot multiple times by police officers who were on patrol in Brooklyn when they encountered him firing at a second man, the police said.
The episode occurred just before 8 p.m. near Baltic and Hoyt Streets outside the Gowanus Houses public housing complex, the police said.
Two plainclothes police officers in an unmarked car were patrolling the area, on the edge of the Boerum Hill neighborhood, when they saw one man shooting at another, the police said.
"The officers immediately identified themselves as police, and gave multiple orders to drop the weapon," Terence A. Monahan, the Police Department's chief of department said at a news conference late Tuesday. When he failed to do so, Chief Monahan said, "both officers fired numerous rounds" at the man, striking him several times.
The man, whose name was not immediately released, was taken to Brooklyn Hospital Center in critical condition, the police said.
The officers, part of an anti-crime unit, were not hurt but were taken to NewYork-Presbyterian Brooklyn Methodist Hospital for a routine evaluation, the police said.
A 9-millimeter handgun and shell casing were recovered at the scene, Chief Monahan said, adding that the officers involved in the shooting would need to be interviewed to determine whether the man had fired at them.
Chief Monahan said that the man who was shot had been released from prison last week and was on parole after serving a five-year sentence for robbery. He has "an extensive criminal history, including multiple violent felony convictions" that he had been on parole for in the past, the chief said.
The police were still looking for the second man involved in the initial shooting episode, officials said.
At about 10 p.m., before Chief Monahan addressed reporters, a stretch of Baltic Street with the housing complex buildings on either side was blocked off by police tape and vehicles, as officers flooded the block and helicopters buzzed overhead.
Elvis Peguero, the owner of the Los Tios Deli Grocery on Hoyt Street, said he had heard "a lot of shots" -- as many as 20, he guessed -- just before 8 p.m. in what sounded like volleys coming from both sides of Baltic Street. Within minutes, he said, police officers were swarming the area.
Apartment courtyards on either side of Baltic Street were also taped off, and some residents of the complex said they had been locked out of their buildings with no word on when they would be allowed back inside.
Shortly after 10:30 p.m., a line of officers, some in riot gear and some leading police dogs, walked across a courtyard south of Baltic Street facing the shooting site.
Shanduke McPhatter, a Brooklyn anti-gang activist, said that he personally knew the wounded man, but he declined to offer his name without the family's consent.
"The family is a family that helps the community," Mr. McPhatter said. "The family is a family that has been out here mediating conflicts and helping provide resources for this community."
He said it was important to get an accounting of the police response to whatever happened.
"We just want to get the facts, and that's what we're focused on," Mr. McPhatter said.

A BREAKDOWN OF THE 4TH DEBATE; 12 Democrats prepare to take stage; Ohio city hosting presidential candidates ready for historic night

Texto completo: WESTERVILLE, Ohio - Tuesday is poised to be a historic night in Ohio. Twelve Democrats will take the stage on Tuesday for what experts say is the largest gathering of presidential primary candidates for a debate in U.S. history.

The fourth Democratic debate is happening in Westerville, a Columbus suburb with about 40,000 residents. Democratic organizers said the city was chosen because it illustrates a trend they're hoping to highlight for 2020 - college-educated voters in fast-growing suburbs leaving the Republican Party. As an example they cite Westerville's voting record in the 2012 and 2016 elections. The city bucked the state and chose Republican Mitt Romney over President Barack Obama, then did the same thing when it went for Democrat Hillary Clinton over President Trump.

Westerville is wealthier than Ohio as a whole. The median household income was $86,466 in 2017, according to U.S. Census data. The city is overwhelmingly white, and just more than half of residents older than 25 have a college degree. The city's largest employers are JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A., Mount Carmel Health System, and Otterbein University, the site of the debate.

Otterbein is a private liberal arts school with 3,000 undergraduate and graduate students. The school also is where former Gov. John Kasich, a one-time Westerville resident who still lives nearby, happens to have an office where he films appearances for his paid contributor gig with CNN.

Mr. Kasich, who's no stranger to the debate stage after challenging President Trump in the 2016 Republican primary, won't be anywhere near Tuesday's event. He'll be in New York promoting a new book.

Twelve candidates qualified for the debate based on polling and fund-raising: former Vice President Joe Biden; New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker; South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg; Julian Castro, former U.S. secretary of housing and urban development; Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard; California Sen. Kamala Harris; Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar; former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke; Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders; billionaire executive Tom Steyer; Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren; and businessman Andrew Yang.

Ms. Gabbard and Mr. Steyer will join the stage after failing to qualify for the last debate. It will be Mr. Steyer's first appearance in a debate.

Absent from the stage? Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan, who addressed Democrats at the party's state dinner Sunday night but failed to qualify for the debate in his home state. He said he expects to do media appearances in the state while his colleagues focus on debate prep.

The fourth debate marks the first time the candidates are gathering since the U.S. House launched an impeachment inquiry against President Trump. The event that spurred the process was a whistleblower complaint about the President asking Ukraine to dig up dirt on Mr. Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, who sat on the board of an energy company in that country while the elder Biden was in the White House. Mr. Biden, who had been reticent on the subject of removing the President from office, said last week the President should be impeached.

It's also the first time the candidates are meeting since Mr. Sanders suffered a heart attack in Nevada. Mr. Sanders, 78, has since slowed down on the campaign trail, but has been dogged by questions about his age and health. If elected, Mr. Sanders would be the oldest president in U.S. history.

While several of the top-tier candidates already have qualified for next debate, Ms. Gabbard barely managed to make the Westerville event, and may not make the cut going forward. She threatened to boycott the debate to send a message to the Democratic National Committee about qualifying standards that some candidates have criticized as arbitrary.

The debate begins at 8 p.m. and will last roughly three hours. Hosted by CNN and the New York Times, it will air on the cable news network and the Times' website.

The moderators are CNN anchors Anderson Cooper and Erin Burnett and Times national editor Marc Lacey.

If you want to see it live and don't have a ticket, you're out of luck. The Ohio Democratic Party already has distributed several hundred tickets to the event, and was unable to accommodate the nearly 30,000 people who requested them.

A Quinnipiac University national poll of 505 Democratic and Democratic-leaning independent voters released on Monday had Ms. Warren and Mr. Biden locked in a tight race for the nomination - 30 percent to 27 percent, respectively.

That's well within the poll's margin of error of plus or minus 5.3 percent.

Mr. Sanders came in third with 11 percent. He lost 5 points since the university's last poll while both Ms. Warren and Mr. Biden gained a point.

For Senator Warren, the third straight time essentially tied at the top is the charm, polling analyst Tim Malloy said. Her candidacy clearly has staying power going into the debate.

Texto completo: Among the more unpleasant outcomes of life in the age of Trump are heightened attacks against journalists.
From the president's oft-repeated cry of "fake news" to describe accurate reporting he disagrees with to threats against reporters to actual violence, there is a lack of understanding and appreciation for the watchdog role journalists play in our complicated society.
The free press, protected in the First Amendment, is essential to ensure government operates in the open with the best interests of the people in mind. When top officials encourage -- either overtly or with a sly wink -- constant attacks on the press, our system is put at risk.
The problem seems to be escalating, in ways large and small. Over the weekend, a passenger on a United Airlines flight snapped a photograph of a man boarding the flight wearing a T-shirt with the words, "Rope. Tree. Journalist. Some Assembly Required."
Despite the ability of airlines to police the clothing of passengers and require them to, for example, turn shirts inside out, the man was allowed to board the plane, no questions asked. Yet the shirt is advocating lynching reporters. Murder.
Over the same weekend, an even more disturbing incident occurred, as news reports described a video showing a fake Trump figure killing his media opponents -- shooting, stabbing and otherwise decimating members of the press as well as political figures such as Barack Obama and the late
John McCain and celebrities like Kathy Griffin and Rosie O'Donnell. The video was shown at a conference held by a pro-Trump group at his Miami resort.
The New York Times obtained a copy of the violent video, which has been condemned by the White House and was not a part of the official conference, organizers say. More than a year old, the video did not rise to prominence until it was shown at the American Priority conference. Donald Trump Jr. and former White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders were among those attending.
Apparently, the video adapts a scene from the movie Kingsman: The Secret Service, placing the president's head on a killer's body as he mows his way through the so-called Church of Fake News. It is graphic, ugly and dangerous -- it is far from uncommon for would-be shooters to view such videos as a tacit permission to kill.
What the video is not, however, is surprising. We are living in a time where disregard for the importance of solid journalism is thriving. From jeering at rallies, it is hardly a giant leap to threatening to lynch reporters or silence them en masse.
Locally, we are more fortunate -- our readers appreciate the importance of focused, watchdog journalism. In most cases, that is. But we can't talk about threats against reporters without mentioning what is happening in Rio Arriba County. The weekly Rio Grande Sun, always scrappy and out for the little guy, has reported accurately on misdeeds in the county sheriff's office.
As a result, Sheriff James Lujan and others appear to be targeting the paper. The American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico has filed a tort claim on behalf of reporter Tabitha Clay, stating that county employees and officials have retaliated against Clay since last May. That's when her article about former Deputy Jeremy Barnes tasing a high school student in the chest was published.
The claim alleges three incidents of retaliation, including deputies parking outside Clay's home in Santa Fe County and denying her access to the Rio Arriba County Courthouse with her reporting tools. This sort of reaction to reporting is dangerous, especially considering Barnes is facing criminal charges in connection with the tasing of the student. He was not the kind of deputy Rio Arriba officials should want patrolling their streets. And it's the job of reporters like Clay to point that out, keeping the broader public safe.
When journalists do their jobs, the people of this nation are more informed about what is going on. The only people who want journalists kept quiet are those with something to hide. That's true all the way from the White House to the Sheriff's Office in Rio Arriba County. Threats against journalists threaten everyone.

Housing, human dignity and a ‘state of emergency’

Texto completo: The push by Los Angeles officials to get Governor Newsom to declare a State of Emergency over homelessness is like a warning light flashing.
It draws our attention to a massive problem that people closed their eyes to for too long. But like any flashing light, the “State of Emergency” idea only helps us see part of the problem but not the whole—and ultimately it would deepen the quagmire and probably result in bigger and worse emergencies later.
Where the idea points in the right direction is easy to see: proponents of the State of Emergency rightly say it would streamline red tape on construction, reduce and shorten building approval processes, and block the frivolous use of environmental review to delay housing construction. That’s needed.
But let’s face it, here’s what’s really happening: First California passes laws that generate the crisis, then we declare a state of emergency to bypass those laws. But as a State of Emergency exemption, it’s an ad-hoc fix. It doesn’t address the systemic problem with the laws it sidesteps, and in fact it politicizes the whole situation further by allowing sensible construction only if political support for a formal Emergency can be cultivated.
But it gets worse. Some of the people who favor a State of Emergency also favor a so-called “legal right to shelter” which would create a basis to sue governments if they don’t directly provide housing to the poorest citizens. This would permanently turn the homeless into wards of the state and enrich those who would litigate on their behalf.
The homeless are indeed “victims of the system,” but not the system that most people think of. They are not victims of a free market in housing, because California has built a regulatory system that killed a free market in housing at all but the top price levels. Middle-income Californians are squeezed by this, too, but the most vulnerable Californians are pushed out on to the streets. The bottom rungs of the housing market ladder—where economically marginal citizens could once afford a place to live—have effectively been removed by bad public policy.
Let me give examples from a study soon to be published by the Independent Institute.
Los Angeles currently bans any housing other than detached single-family homes on about 75 percent of its residential land. Whereas in 1960 Los Angeles was zoned for up to 10 million people, by 1990 the city “had downzoned to a capacity of about 3.9 million, a number that is only slightly higher today,” according to the New York Times.
Then there are so-called “prevailing wage” (read: union scale) laws. Prevailing-wage mandates increased average California construction costs for affordable housing projects by between 10 percent and 25 percent, according to a May 2017 report from the California Center for Jobs and the Economy. In areas such as Los Angeles, PLAs could hike market-rate housing prices by as much as 46 percent. Then there are the endless faux-environmental lawsuits against residential construction, which are invited and inadvertently enabled by the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). And the list of anti-housing obstacles goes on.
What the homeless really need is a residential construction market that operates by normal rules that induce entrepreneurs to build housing all the way up and down the price spectrum—not just at the top where they can afford to overcome the regulatory and NIMBY hurdles. Don’t give the homeless a “right to shelter” by government; instead, give property owners a “right to build residential housing” on land they own. No, this would not eliminate restrictions on residential building, but it would raise a much higher bar by which to justify them. A ballot initiative amending the California Constitution would be the way to achieve this potent reform.
Less dramatic reforms would make a difference, too.
Allow builders to give homeowners’ associations incentives to accept new construction, so as to counterbalance the disincentives that lead to NIMBYism. Stop suppressing housing through rent controls and so-called “affordable housing” mandates; these are the functional equivalent of taxes on housing development. What you tax you get less of. Another obvious change would be to put an end to the favoritism shown to unions through “prevailing wage” rules that swell construction costs. And why not abolish or at least vastly modify CEQA?
The people who care the most about the homeless are those who want to reintroduce a real housing market—and incentivize nongovernmental programs that treat people like people rather than like dependent clients.
How can we expect the homeless to rebuild their lives when government programs warehouse them like surplus merchandise, and when we kick the bottom rungs out of the housing market ladder so that even if they start getting themselves together, they can’t find a room or apartment they can afford to rent?

Texto completo: The push by Los Angeles officials to get Governor Newsom to declare a State of Emergency over homelessness is like a warning light flashing.
It draws our attention to a massive problem that people closed their eyes to for too long. But like any flashing light, the “State of Emergency” idea only helps us see part of the problem but not the whole—and ultimately it would deepen the quagmire and probably result in bigger and worse emergencies later.
Where the idea points in the right direction is easy to see: proponents of the State of Emergency rightly say it would streamline red tape on construction, reduce and shorten building approval processes, and block the frivolous use of environmental review to delay housing construction. That’s needed.
But let’s face it, here’s what’s really happening: First California passes laws that generate the crisis, then we declare a state of emergency to bypass those laws. But as a State of Emergency exemption, it’s an ad-hoc fix. It doesn’t address the systemic problem with the laws it sidesteps, and in fact it politicizes the whole situation further by allowing sensible construction only if political support for a formal Emergency can be cultivated.
But it gets worse. Some of the people who favor a State of Emergency also favor a so-called “legal right to shelter” which would create a basis to sue governments if they don’t directly provide housing to the poorest citizens. This would permanently turn the homeless into wards of the state and enrich those who would litigate on their behalf.
The homeless are indeed “victims of the system,” but not the system that most people think of. They are not victims of a free market in housing, because California has built a regulatory system that killed a free market in housing at all but the top price levels. Middle-income Californians are squeezed by this, too, but the most vulnerable Californians are pushed out on to the streets. The bottom rungs of the housing market ladder—where economically marginal citizens could once afford a place to live—have effectively been removed by bad public policy.
Let me give examples from a study soon to be published by the Independent Institute.
Los Angeles currently bans any housing other than detached single-family homes on about 75 percent of its residential land.

Texto completo: Targets of a doctored video edited to depict President Donald Trump shooting media organizations and political opponents are calling on Trump, his campaign and surrogates to denounce the video.
The video was played at a conference hosted by a pro-Trump group at his Miami resort last week, according to a report in The New York Times. It includes the logo for Trump's 2020 re-election campaign.
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis was scheduled to speak at the conference Friday night, but canceled because he had a conflict to attend the Miami-Dade Republican Party's Lincoln Day dinner held at the same Doral resort.
"He was in the green room waiting for about a half-an-hour," said Helen Ferre, spokeswoman for DeSantis. "The conference was running late and he had the Lincoln Day dinner event so he went to that instead."
DeSantis has not seen the video, Ferre said. "But if the video is what people say it is, then of course he would condemn it. He just doesn't condone violence of any kind, whether it is political or not."
In the video, which is an edited scene from the film "Kingsman: The Secret Service," Trump enters a "Church of Fake News" and opens fire on members of the congregation, who have various news organizations' logos or the faces of Democratic lawmakers and other critics superimposed onto their bodies.
Trump proceeds to shoot, stab and set fire to the late Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., 2020 presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., and 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and former President Barack Obama.
The video also shows House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who is currently involved in pursuing the impeachment inquiry into Trump.
Several news outlets are depicted being killed in the rampage, including Politico, NPR, HuffPost, The Washington Post, Slate and CNN.
The White House Correspondents' Association and CNN called on Trump to denounce the video.
"We have previously told the President his rhetoric would incite violence. Now we call on him and everybody associated with this conference to denounce this video and affirm that violence has no place in our society," Jonathan Karl, the president of WHCA, said in a statement.
"The President and his family, the White House, and the Trump campaign need to denounce it immediately in the strongest possible terms. Anything less equates to a tacit endorsement of violence and should not be tolerated by anyone," a CNN statement reads.
Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke said Sunday evening, "Last year, a Trump supporter sent bombs to CNN—and a shooter entered a church yesterday. This video isn't funny. It will get people killed."
An organizer for the conference confirmed that the video was shown, but denounced its showing as part of a "meme exhibit" with content submitted by third parties, according to The New York Times. "This matter is under review," said the organizer Alex Phillips.
Phillips also said on the conference's website it was "shocking" that the Times did not report on other portions of the conference, "Including our panel conversation LITERALLY condemning political violence while claiming to be upset over a meme that was not sanctioned, shown on stage, or approved."
Former White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders and Donald Trump Jr. were reportedly scheduled to speak at the same three-day conference where the video was played. According to The Times, representatives for the two said they did not see the video.
A spokesperson for the Trump campaign told The New York Times that the campaign was not involved in the creation of the video, and "we do not condone violence." White House Press Secretary said on Twitter Monday morning that Trump has not yet seen the video.

Texto completo: Sen. Martha McSally and Cindy and Meghan McCain each decried a violent video that depicted President Donald Trump slaying his tormentors, including the media and the late Sen. John McCain.
The video, shown at a pro-Trump conference last week at the president's Florida resort and first reported Sunday by the New York Times, has drawn widespread condemnation across the political spectrum for its violent — and clearly fake — imagery.
In the spoof, Trump lays waste to his critics gathered at the "Church of Fake News" with his fists, using fire and firing a gun. Trump stabs John McCain in the back of the neck in the video.
The White House, through Trump's press secretary, swiftly denounced the video and on Monday McSally, R-Ariz., followed suit.
"This video is outrageous and out of bounds," McSally said in a statement. "I condemn the use of Arizona Senator John McCain's image — along with the other political leaders and journalists — in the strongest possible terms. I am glad President Trump and his campaign condemned this reprehensible video. All Americans need to reject this kind of hateful rhetoric. We can disagree politically without degrading our culture with disgusting images like this. That's a value Sen. McCain taught us, and we need to remember it today."
In a Monday morning tweet, McCain's widow, Cindy McCain, said she was outraged by the video, which she said violated "every norm our society expects from its leaders."
McCain's daughter Meghan McCain used her seat on ABC's "The View" to speak against the video on Monday.
"People are saying this is free speech. You're being a snow flake. You're so sensitive," she said.
But the video's targets, many of them current office holders and political movements, are actually threatened, Meghan McCain said.
"How easy for all of you judging me that I'm offended and upset by the video. You try doing this when it's a member of your family has continued to have this happen over and over and over again," Meghan McCain said. "And it doesn't seem to matter to anybody in Trumpworld whatsoever. And you conservatives on Twitter, if this were the opposite, and it happened at an Obama event, you'd be screaming bloody murder. So stop."
Former Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., also weighed in on Twitter, referring to a gunman's 2017 attack on him and other Republican members of Congress who were practicing on a baseball field in Virginia. Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., was seriously wounded.
"For those of us who have seen a colleague shot, and have been shot at, there is no humor in this whatsoever," Flake tweeted.
The video superimposes various faces and media logos over internet memes to show Trump slaughtering his critics.
It uses footage from the 2014 film "Kingsman: The Secret Service" for a massacre at a church.
John McCain's appearance is a nod to the deep-seated enmity between the former six-term senator and the president. Their rivalry peaked in 2017 when a dying McCain, the 2008 Republican presidential nominee, gave his famous thumbs down to efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act.
Trump's anger at McCain has lingered even after McCain's death in August 2018 after a battle with brain cancer.

Texto completo: White House: Trump to watch violent parody, 'condemns it'
WASHINGTON -- The White House says President Donald Trump has yet to watch a graphically violent parody video that depicts a likeness of him shooting and stabbing opponents and members of the news media, but based on what he's heard, he "strongly condemns" it.
The parody was shown at a meeting of Trump supporters at his Miami resort.
The video portrays Trump's critics and media members as parishioners in a church fleeing his gruesome rampage. The fake Trump strikes the late Sen. John McCain in the neck, hits and stabs TV personality Rosie O'Donnell in the face, lights Sen. Bernie Sanders' head on fire and shoots or otherwise assaults people whose faces are replaced with news organization logos.
Trump's face is superimposed on a killer's body. Among the targets: former President Barack Obama, Black Lives Matter, Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters, Bill and Hillary Clinton and Rep. Adam Schiff, who is leading the impeachment inquiry of Trump.
White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham says in a tweet that Trump will see the video shortly and that, "based upon everything he has heard, he strongly condemns this video."
The video and its screening were first reported by The New York Times.
The "unauthorized video" was shown last week "in a side room" at an American Priority conference at Trump's Doral Miami resort, the event's organizer, Alex Phillips, said in a statement.
"This video was not approved, seen, or sanctioned" by the event's organizers, Phillips said.

Russia's Putin visits Saudi Arabia on Mideast trip
DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Russian President Vladimir Putin traveled to Saudi Arabia on Monday, meeting with the oil-rich nation's king and crown prince as he seeks to cement Moscow's political and energy ties across the Mideast.
Putin received all the trappings of a state visit, with a mounted guard escorting his limousine to King Salman's Al-Yamamah palace in Riyadh on his first visit to the kingdom since 2007.
In the intervening years, the Arab Spring roiled the wider Mideast as Putin would partner with Iran in backing Syrian President Bashar Assad in that country's still-raging war. Saudi Arabia unsuccessfully backed those trying to oust Assad.
But more recently, Russia joined OPEC in lowering their production beginning in 2017, the first such cut for the cartel in a decade.

Officer who shot naked man found not guilty of murder
DECATUR, Ga. -- A former police officer who fatally shot an unarmed, naked man was found not guilty of murder Monday but was convicted of aggravated assault and other charges that could send him to prison for more than 30 years.
Robert "Chip" Olsen's face turned red and he squeezed his eyes shut tightly as the verdict was read. His wife, Kathy Olsen, began sobbing and had to be led from the courtroom.
Olsen, now 57, was a DeKalb County police officer in March 2015 when he responded to a call of a naked man behaving erratically outside an Atlanta-area apartment complex. Shortly after arriving, he fatally shot 26-year-old Anthony Hill, an Air Force veteran who had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder.

Texas prison guard acquitted in death of inmate he threw down
ANGLETON, Texas -- A jury has acquitted a former Texas prison guard who slammed a handcuffed inmate to the ground so hard that the man's liver ruptured and he died.
The Houston Chronicle reports that Lou Joffrion was acquitted last month on aggravated assault charges in the 2017 death of David Witt, who had mental health issues.
Authorities say Joffrion, who was a sergeant at the Darrington Unit in Brazoria County south of Houston, picked up the 128-pound Witt and slammed him to the ground after Witt refused orders to return to his cell.
Joffrion's lawyer defended the use of force, saying whether it was excessive is "subjective."
Jennifer Erschabek of the Texas Inmate Families Association called the verdict "legalized brutality."

Protests erupt as Spain convicts separatists
BARCELONA, Spain -- Riot police engaged in a running battle with protesters outside Barcelona's airport Monday after Spain's Supreme Court convicted 12 separatist leaders of illegally promoting the wealthy Catalonia region's independence and sentenced nine of them to prison.
Police fired foam bullets and used batons against the thousands of protesters who converged on Josep Tarradellas Barcelona-El Prat Airport after a pro-independence grassroots group put out the call. Protesters fought back by throwing objects, spraying dark clouds with fire extinguishers, and breaking windows.
Regional emergency service SEM said 53 people were treated for injuries at the airport.
Police also clashed with angry crowds late Monday night in downtown Barcelona.

Hong Kong police say bomb targeted its officers
HONG KONG -- A homemade, remote-controlled bomb intended to "kill or to harm" riot control officers was detonated as they deployed against renewed violence in Hong Kong over the weekend, police said Monday, in a further escalation of destructive street battles gripping the business hub.
The "loud thud" Sunday night close to riot officers who had been clearing away a protester-built roadblock marked the first known use of an explosive during protests that started in June.
But despite spiraling violence, widespread vandalism and gasoline-bomb attacks by black-clad, hard-core protesters -- and repeated government appeals for people not to take their side -- the protest movement is still rousing determined support from more moderate demonstrators.

Dossier tell-all: The co-founders of a political research firm behind allegations about President Donald Trump's ties to Russia are writing a book.
Random House announced Monday that "Crime in Progress: Inside the Steele Dossier and the Fusion GPS Investigation of Donald Trump" will be published Nov. 26. The book was co-written by Glenn Simpson and Peter Fritsch.
Random House is calling "Crime in Progress" a "never-before-told inside story" about Trump and Russia and the investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russia during the 2016 election.
Fusion GPS helped compile the dossier, by former British spy Christopher Steele.

Texto completo: The judges rebelled against the literary prize's rules and awarded it to "The Testaments" and "Girl, Woman, Other."
LONDON -- Margaret Atwood and Bernardine Evaristo have both won this year's Booker Prize, it was announced at a ceremony on Monday, after the judges for the literary award rebelled against its rules.
"We were told quite firmly that the rules state you can only have one winner," Peter Florence, the chairman of the Booker judges, said at a news conference. But the "consensus was to flout the rules and divide this year's prize to celebrate two winners."
Evaristo, who won for her novel "Girl, Woman, Other," is the first black woman to win the Booker Prize. "I hope that honor doesn't last too long," she said in her acceptance speech. Atwood, who won in 2000 for "The Blind Assassin," was considered a front-runner this year for "The Testaments," the sequel to her 1985 dystopian classic, "The Handmaid's Tale."
It is not the first time the award has been shared. In 1992, Michael Ondaatje's "The English Patient" shared it with Barry Unsworth's "Sacred Hunger," but the prize's organizers then changed the rules to only allow one winner to avoid undermining either book.
Several judging panels had tried to split the prize since, said Gaby Wood, the Booker Prize Foundation's literary director, but settled on single winners after being told they had to.
The decision to rebel and award the prize to two writers this year was not taken lightly. The judges, who included the author Xiaolu Guo and editor Liz Calder, spent over three hours trying to pick a winner before asking if they could choose both. They were told they couldn't. The judges then -- to the Booker organizers' "horror," Florence said -- spent another "hour-and-a-half agonizing how to resolve the issue," before deciding it was the only result they wanted.
They were again told it was unacceptable. It was only at a third attempt, 30 minutes later, that the Booker Prize's trustees accepted the decision.
Wood dodged the question when asked if she supported the final result. "I support the mechanism by which the judges made their decision," she said. She then joked the judges would not be paid for their involvement, which included reading 151 submitted books.
For Atwood, the prize comes at a moment of renewed cultural relevance for "The Handmaid's Tale," which has sold more than 8 million copies worldwide in English. The novel was adapted into a hit television series on Hulu, and the story has taken on fresh political resonance, as women dressed as handmaids have flooded Congress and state capitols to protest new restrictions on reproductive rights. In "The Testaments," Atwood weaves together the stories of three female narrators in Gilead, a religious autocracy in what was formerly the United States.
Evaristo, an experimental writer who is well established in Britain but not widely known internationally, is a more surprising choice. In her eight works of fiction, Evaristo, who was born in London in 1959 to a white English mother and a Nigerian father, often explores the lives of members of the African diaspora. "Girl, Woman, Other" features a dozen characters, most of them black British women. It's written in a blend of poetry and prose, a hybrid that Evaristo calls "fusion fiction."
In an interview with The Times on Monday night, Evaristo said that the novel grew out of her frustration over the lack of representation in British literature.
"When I started the book six years ago, I was so fed up with black British women being absent from British literature," she said. "So I wanted to see how many characters I could put into a novel and pull it off."
The other novels on the shortlist included Lucy Ellmann's "Ducks, Newburyport," a 1,000 page novel about a middle-aged woman in Ohio reflecting on her life while baking, which unfolds almost entirely in a single sentence; Chigozie Obioma's "An Orchestra of Minorities," about a Nigerian poultry farmer called Chinonso who stops a woman from jumping to her death and falls in love with her; Salman Rushdie's "Quichotte," a retelling of "Don Quixote" that features a traveling salesman on a quest to win over a beautiful television host; and Elif Shafak's "10 Minutes 38 Seconds in This Strange World," a story about a sex worker in Istanbul who is murdered and left in the garbage on the outskirts of the city.
Compared to previous years, in which Americans were heavily represented, writers from the United States were scarce this year. The sole American on the shortlist is Ellmann, a native of Illinois who now lives in Scotland.
Evaristo and Atwood will split the prize money of 50,000 pounds, around $ 63,000, although the Booker, first awarded in 1969, normally delivers a sales boost. Anna Burns's "Milkman," an experimental novel about a woman during Northern Ireland's civil conflict, has sold over 500,000 copies since winning the prize last year.
The Booker is one of the literary world's most prestigious prizes. Past winners include Rushdie, who was shortlisted for this year's prize, as well as such literary heavyweights as Hilary Mantel and J.M. Coetzee. Atwood now joins Mantel, Coetzee and Peter Carey in the small club of authors to have won twice.

GOP should be learning from Charles Sandman's downfall

Texto completo: Vociferous Republican defenders of President Trump throughout his potential impeachment ought to remember the fate of Charles Sandman.
Sandman, a Republican congressman from New Jersey, was perhaps the single most vociferous defender of President Richard Nixon during the Watergate hearings. As described by the New York Times — and as I remember it, too, remarkably vividly, from my childhood — Sandman’s “strategy was to construe the evidence as narrowly as possible, require ironclad proof and propose benign explanations of information damaging to the President.”
Sandman ended up not only with egg on his face, but with his political career in shambles. After four terms in the House, the last of which was won with a whopping 66% of the vote, he was trounced for reelection in 1974, receiving only 41%.
His fate was a shame. He was a good man. An air navigator during World War II and a POW in a German camp for seven months, a former majority leader of the state Senate, and described by moderate New Jersey Gov. Tom Kean as “a man of warmth, compassion and unfailing good humor,'' Sandman paid the price for too avidly toeing the party line in the face of growing evidence of Nixonian perfidy.
So, so many Republicans falling all over themselves defending Trump might want to take a cue from that Watergate experience, and, well, run from the fate of the man who went by the name of the Sandman. Trump, just as Nixon, may be putting their careers at risk.
After all, more and more disturbing evidence emerges that Trump and his close associates acted in seemingly shady ways with regard to Ukraine, Turkey, and Russia. Trump is famously impulsive, not to mention heedless of warnings, of precedent, and of ordinary restrictions on behavior. Even more than with Nixon in 1973-1974, one can easily imagine that at least some of this evidence will turn into devastatingly irrefutable proof of high crimes.
The Republicans furiously defending Trump now may or may not be right about Trump’s innocence. Even if they are right, a little more measured judiciousness would hurt neither them nor Trump. And if they’re wrong, well, their political careers might be put to a sleep as deep as the Sandman’s.

Purple &amp; Bold: China, the NBA and the limits of basketball diplomacy

Texto completo: Editor’s note: This is the Monday, Oct. 14 edition of the Purple & Bold Lakers newsletter. To receive breaking Lakers news and the newsletter in your inbox, sign up here.
The NBA has a program called Basketball Without Borders, a community service initiative that has run camps in 27 different countries over the last two decades. The dream goes something like this: Through the game of basketball, diverse cultures can find some common ground.
But the world as we know it has borders — not just geopolitical lines on a map, but borders of ideology and values. And never have the limits of NBA diplomacy become more apparent than last week.
The Lakers and Nets unwittingly put themselves in the midst of an international incident this week because of a tweet. It’s a weird situation, especially given that the Chinese response has felt particularly outsized, but it’s highlighted what the limitations are for a game to be a unifying force in a world with endlessly complex divisions.
The NBA became so aware of the thorny nature of the politics of the situation that they shut down media availability for the entire trip. The Athletic reported that players, most prominently LeBron James, were wary of the onus for the NBA’s response to China’s actions being put on them, and asked to not be made available for questions. Rather than putting players in position to say something harmful either abroad or at home (like James Harden awkwardly apologizing to China for his general manager’s tweet), the NBA and the player’s association wanted avoid commentary “in real time,” at least until everyone was safely home.
It should be noted here that China is a country that tightly controls and restricts visas: Journalists, for example, require multiple references to just get in. Multiple times, the government kept the NBA in the dark as to whether they would even be allowed to participate in their events. A situation where the Chinese government harassed or detained a player for something they said while visiting abroad could have felt like a very real threat to the traveling contingent. If that’s the case, Adam Silver probably made a wise choice to keep them out of the line of fire.
But now that everyone is safely home, where does it go from here? The NBA would probably prefer this situation quietly goes away, and that they can continue their lucrative contracts in a country where basketball has been increasingly popular. The New York Times reported last week that the Chinese government was toning down rhetoric against the NBA — which make sense because the incident has drawn attention to their authoritarian handling of the Hong Kong protests. It’s bad diplomacy to cut off a league that’s well-liked in the country, disappointing fans locally and making observers abroad question whether they should do business there.
But it seems difficult to imagine this will go away soon. Next year, the NBA will be pressed to continue exhibition games in China: Which teams are going to want to go? Which teams are going to want their players subjected to questions about what it’s like to be the first teams to play since the international incident that briefly flared up tensions between the NBA and China? What do they think of how China handles Hong Kong (because in a year, a lack of knowledge on the situation will be a less convincing case)?
In absence of the voices of players and other NBA personnel who actually went to China, Steve Kerr’s voice stood out among people stateside who spoke on the issue. Well, “spoke” might be a strong word, but Kerr offered that it’s easier for NBA players and coaches to speak on social issues that are close to home. That’s understandable, and it does seem like an unfair burden to expect the NBA to set the example for all US-Chinese relations in all cases.
But it’s also true that the NBA’s reputation as a league that’s outspoken and unafraid to speak the truth on important issues is taking some hits.
As Kerr put it: “Using the game as a force for the greater good. I think those things are important, those values are important. Obviously, there are tremendous financial forces at play here — so how you reconcile all that, I don’t know.”
No one else in the NBA appears to know either.
In the interest of examining the issue, I’m dropping a lot of related reading down in the links.
BUT WHY TONIGHT?
If you’re surprised to see a Lakers-Warriors home game less than 72 hours after the Lakers last played in China, it’s hard to imagine that the Lakers are thrilled about it either.
It’s unclear if players will miss the game due to fatigue. It’s easy to imagine LeBron James, for example, sitting this one out, especially if Anthony Davis is unable to play following his MRI on his sprained thumb. Preseason games, it should be noted, are firmly under control of teams. But it’s also true that any team going to China is hard-pressed to squeeze six preseason games into its schedule.
Frank Vogel said earlier this month that he would be judicious when it came to divvying up time for the long preseason schedule: “I think they made a wise decision a couple years back to reduce it from 8 preseason games to six. Potentially could go even further down to four. I think each coach has an obligation to their team to make sure they’re being smart with their vets. Make sure they’re getting enough reps to learn their new teammates and the system. Get sharp, ready to play, but not overdo it.”

Texto completo: Twice near the start of the last Democratic presidential debate, George Stephanopoulos of ABC News tried to pin Elizabeth Warren down on whether her vision for Medicare for All would require a middle-class tax increase. Twice she didn’t answer him. It was the perfect opening for one of the other contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination to charge her with evasiveness and force her to reckon fully with the costs of her ambitious plans and the profound difficulty of enacting them. None of them took advantage of it.
Warren condemned the corruption of the political process by moneyed interests. I kept waiting for one of her rivals onstage to point out that before she swore off private fundraisers organized by rich donors, she depended on them for her two victorious Senate campaigns, raising enough cash to transfer $10.4 million in leftover funds to her 2020 presidential bid. But no one made a peep.
As she surged toward the front of the pack, the candidates in her wake watched politely for the most part, not confronting her with the tough questions that, if she faces Donald Trump in the general election, he’ll surely hurl at her. That has to stop.
At the debate this coming Tuesday night, they should grill her — and one another — with less delicacy than they have exhibited to date. Assuming that Trump lasts until November 2020, he’s going to use every potentially unflattering detail of his opponent that he can dig up, along with the usual heap of lies, to attack him or her. The nation can’t afford for those attacks to be successful. So now is the time, well before the voting in caucuses and primaries begins, to size up the various Democratic candidates’ hypocrisies, half-truths and vulnerabilities. Perhaps more important, it’s the time to discover how persuasively they can explain the parts of their biographies and records that cry out for some explanation.
I began this column by focusing on Warren because she seems to be the candidate with the most momentum at the moment and, based on the current state of play, she could very well be the nominee. But everyone in the relatively changeless Top 5 in the Democratic field — Warren, Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris and Pete Buttigieg — hasn’t been pressed by rivals on some matters that warrant more attention.
Buttigieg has made an argument for his youth — he’s 37 — as an asset, and he boasts of crucial executive experience from his seven years as mayor of South Bend, Indiana. But it’s a city so small that he won his second term with 8,515 votes. He’d probably need more than 65 million to ascend to the presidency. One of his rivals would be right to ask him: What should give Democrats confidence that he has that kind of jackpot in him? What gives him the confidence, especially given his strained relations with black residents of South Bend and the coolness of black voters nationwide to his candidacy?
Someone should pin Harris down on why her initial statements about Medicare for All were so contradictory, just the way Tulsi Gabbard, in a July debate, challenged her on aspects of her work as the district attorney of San Francisco and then as the California attorney general that don’t fit neatly under the “progressive prosecutor” mantle that she claims. Gabbard’s engagement of Harris on that issue stood out because few candidates poked that directly and forcefully at their rivals’ vulnerabilities.
Harris’ engagement of Biden, in a June debate, on the issue of federally mandated busing to desegregate schools stood out for the same reason. And it shed important light on both him and her. He struggled to respond effectively, demonstrating how dulled some of his political skills were, while she made subsequent comments that raised questions about just how divergent their positions really were. Democratic voters came to know both candidates better and to be able to assess them more accurately. And that’s the whole goal of these debates.
“Other than Harris going after Biden and Gabbard going after Harris, they have been very timid,” said Bob Kerrey, the former senator and Nebraska governor who ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1992. Part of that, he said, is the impossibility of a deeply substantive debate among 10 people, which is how many were onstage for each of the June, July and September debates. The coming debate will have 12 people onstage.
And timidity won’t do. “Trump will be well funded and ferocious,” Kerrey told me. “If a Democratic candidate wilts under the warm attention and criticism of another Democrat, they will not be able to stand up to Trump.” And if that criticism goes too far, bleeding into gratuitous nastiness, “the audience will discipline them,” he said. He mentioned Julián Castro’s obvious insinuation in the debate last month that Biden was in serious cognitive decline.
That went too far. It was counterproductive, because it didn’t bring to light something about a candidate that wasn’t accessible to voters. That was true as well of Eric Swalwell’s “pass the torch” hectoring of Biden, in a June debate, as a politician who was overstaying his welcome. Voters know that Biden is 76 and has spent more than four decades of his life in public office. Swalwell wasn’t exposing some secret that had been swept under the rug; he was just stamping his feet.
Many anxious, Trump-horrified Democrats take the view that the candidates should tread lightly on one another. “When we know that President Trump will be spending his money to discourage Democratic turnout more explicitly and underhandedly than in any other modern campaign, why would we want any candidate to spend time persuading Democrats of how bad other Democrats are?” asked Jack Markell, the former governor of Delaware. “The difference between all of the Democratic candidates is dwarfed by the difference between the Democratic candidates collectively and President Trump.”
Many of the readers who write to me agree with him or go even further: They want to see, hear and revel in nothing but loving encomiums about Democrats vying for the White House. Some of them believe that Hillary Clinton was badly hurt by her battle with Sanders in the last Democratic primary, and that we’re where we are as a result.
But her wounds would have mattered less if Sanders had rallied more enthusiastically to her side once she’d won the nomination. I urge the losers this time around to get in line pronto. And I think it’s extremely risky to spare the next nominee the sort of tough examination that will let us know if we’ve elevated the most broadly appealing, durable, fearsome Trump slayer.
The stakes could hardly be higher. Every day, new revelations about the Ukraine sordidness come to light. Every day, the president acts in impulsive, imprudent, unhinged ways. Maybe that means that any Democrat can beat him. But I’m a bit of a pessimist and cautious to a fault. I think it means that we cannot afford to pick the wrong person.
Everyone in that Top 5 has liabilities. It’s possible that Democrats would be on safer ground with any of the candidates below that tier — Amy Klobuchar, say, or Michael Bennet or Steve Bullock — who have won statewide elections in red, purple or purple-ish places. It’s also possible that Klobuchar, Bennet and Bullock lack the requisite spark and are bad fits for the moment.
The only way to know is to make sure there’s no premature coronation.
So Biden’s rivals onstage on Tuesday night should ask if him if anything that he and President Barack Obama did, or failed to do, inadvertently paved the way for Trump. I’d be fascinated, and potentially illuminated, by his response.
They should ask Warren how she can be sure that her morally just “wealth tax” will raise as much money and pay for as much as she says it will. And because she keeps stressing her passion for education, she should be pressed on how she swerved from past positions that essentially aligned her with Betsy DeVos to the opposite.
If she can’t answer the question well, let’s find out now, before it’s too late. If she can, she’s one step closer to wiping the floor with Trump.

Texto completo: En 2020, la comunidad latina romperá un nuevo récord y liderará a los grupos minoritarios con mayor poder electoral al sumar más de 32 millones de posibles votantes . A todos ellos, el único candidato de este grupo social, Julián Castro , les tiene un mensaje claro: registrarse e ir a votar.
En entrevista, Castro destaca el valor de los hispanos en los Estados Unidos y cómo esa fuerza electoral puede inclinar la balanza. Según los últimos datos del Pew Research Center, de 2016 a 2020, el número de votantes latinos aumentaría alrededor de cinco millones, lo que representará el 13% de los sufragios para elegir al nuevo presidente.
“La comunidad latina debe participar en la elección, no hay momento más importante que ahora” , expresó Castro. “Es claro que necesitamos reemplazar a este presidente, por un presidente que realmente considere la necesidad de crear oportunidades para todos, en un Estados Unidos que pertenece a todos”.
El exfuncionario de la administración de Barack Obama , tiene 45 años y expresa con claridad que una de sus prioridades –aunque no la única– son los inmigrantes en este país, considerando su propia historia, mejor dicho, la historia de su abuela, Victoria , quien migró de México a los siete años como indocumentada. La suya es la historia de millones de personas. Castro lo tiene claro y siente que tiene una deuda con ellos como político, pero sin dejar de lado que necesita convencer al electorado de que no solamente lucharía por ellos. No es un reto sencillo.
“Quiero representar a todos los estadounidenses, pero al mismo tiempo, considerando mi origen, me he dado cuenta de que… en este momento, muchos los latinos hemos sido objetivo de esta Administración y tenemos que hacer grandes cambios para asegurarnos, todos puedan encontrar sus oportunidades y alcanzar sus sueños”, expresó. “He estado enfocado particularmente en la visión de que en Estados Unidos todos cuentan y cada quien puede ser exitoso por su trabajo”.
La pregunta es obligada, quizá incómoda, pero obligada. ¿No cree que puedan verlo como un aspirante enfocado solamente en inmigración? En el diálogo que se desarrolla vía telefónica desde Texas, el demócrata respira, pero es contundente.
“No”, expresa escuetamente, para luego acotar: “He hablado de otros aspectos con el mismo énfasis que éste, he hablado de educación, de economía, del plan de salud, reforma policiaca… en los medios me enfocan como que estoy enfocado en inmigración, pero no es el caso” .
Su plataforma electoral es amplia y no comienza con inmigración, sino con un programa para protección de niños sin familia y sigue con el empoderamiento de los sindicatos , plan de justicia para granjeros , proyecto para proteger a las empleadas domésticas , plan económico para las familias trabajadoras , plan ambiental contra cambio climático y protección de especies, lucha contra terrorismo doméstico (como grupos supremacistas), atender a comunidades indígenas , reformar el sistema judicial , mejorar la educación y asegurar el derecho a la vivienda .
Castro cree que puede lograr un gran cambio para este país y pone su historia personal y política como ejemplo.
“He demostrado en toda mi carrera que soy ese tipo de líder y que tengo un gran plan” , insistió. “La comunidad latina es parte de esta dinámica y de las posibilidades de este país”.
Tras conseguir donaciones de 130,000 personas y obtener un apoyo del 2 por ciento en cuatro encuestas aprobadas por la Convención Nacional Demócrata entre el 28 de junio y el 1 de octubre, Castro logró su pase al cuarto debate, que será este martes 15 de octubre a las 8:00 p.m. del Este desde la Universidad de Otterbein, Columbus, Ohio, y será transmitido por CNN y The New York Times.
Es la gran oportunidad para este aspirante latino para convencer a más votantes de las primarias que debe ser el candidato presidencial en 2020, pero el reto es complicado, considerando que en las encuestas de intención de votos está lejos de los líderes: el exvicepresidente Biden, la senadora Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) –cada vez más cercana al puntero– y el senador Bernie Sanders .
Los esfuerzos de Castro y su equipo de campaña están enfocados no solamente en el evento de este martes, sino también en el próximo debate que será transmitido por MSNBC, en colaboración con The Washington Post, el 20 de noviembre desde Georgia.
Aquellos que ya tienen casi asegurado su pase son el exvicepresidente Biden, el alcalde de Indiana, Pete Buttigieg , la senadora Warren y el senador Sanders.
Los demás deben lograr 165,000 donantes únicos, incluidos 600 repartidos en 20 estados, y alcanzar el 3 por ciento en cuatro encuestas estatales o nacionales calificadas, además de lograr un 5 por ciento en dos encuestas estatales calificadas. Castro lucha por mantenerse en la carrera.
“Nuestra confianza es que mi campaña lo logre, tenemos hasta noviembre 12, es un gran desafío para todos los candidatos” , expresó.

Miss June frontwoman mixes med school with a degree in pop-punk

Texto completo: On the day I'm scheduled to interview New Zealand pop-punk band Miss June, Instagram targets me with a personality quiz that says it can tell me which member of the formidable foursome I am. The quiz declares me a “Chris."
When I reach Miss June singer/guitarist Annabel Liddell on the phone while she's on the road in the United Kingdom and ask what that says about me, she breaks into giggles. It means the quiz is broken, she says. Everybody so far has been a Chris.
It's not a bad thing to be Chris Marshall, the band's bassist, she assures me. “Nice guy, good hair!" she says.
People ask Liddell “all the time" if she's Miss June, but the band is named after the Brian Jonestown Massacre song “Miss June '75," and the name was picked in a rush. The band consists of Liddell, Marshall, guitarist Jun Park, and drummer Tom Leggett, and it formed “about four years ago." Liddell had a solo gig, realized she didn't want to do it alone, sprinted into the jazz school, found three guys who were willing to learn her songs quickly — and the lineup hasn't changed since then.
2019 has been a banner year. The fuzzed-out Kiwi band signed to New York's indie-playground label Frenchkiss Records, their debut LP's sizzling lead single “Best Girl" landed on The New York Times's exclusive Playlist, and the album, “Bad Luck Party," drew raves from all around the music blogosphere. On top of that, Liddell is set to graduate from medical school in New Zealand next month, right after the band comes home from its two-month tour across Europe and the United States.
The band will be playing tunes from “Bad Luck Party," and some unreleased new material too, when it brings the noise to ONCE in Somerville on Tuesday.
Q. How did you balance being a med student and a musician?
A. I've balanced it the best that I can. At the end of last year, I had really worked myself into the ground. Honestly, working all day, every single day, without fail. I was doing the best I could, and I have a great support network. My family and the boys in the band are really supportive.
Q. When you were in the depths of medical school, when did you find time to write?
A. So first of all, I had a two-year break from writing. That was during the time that I was doing all the academia. For med school, you have three years which are pretty much theory before you get in the hospital. I was working so hard, and I stopped writing, but then once I got into the hospital work, I found a lot of inspiration. My mind was more active. And so I used to keep my writing guitar in the same room as my study. I'd cram for a couple hours and then take a break, make coffee, and pick up the guitar as a break from studying.
Q. Is there a story behind your Twitter and Instagram handles, “@ihatemissjune?"
A. We were playing a gig, and a bunch of Jun's friends came to the show. They all made these T-shirts, and on the back of the T-shirts they wrote “[Expletive] Miss June," just as a joke. And they were moshing in the front, getting so into it with these “[Expletive] Miss June" T-shirts on! We thought it was really funny. Obviously, we couldn't make our Instagram handle “[Expletive] Miss June," so we went with “I Hate Miss June."
Q. Tell me about the way that the band writes songs. Are they mostly yours, is it a collaborative process?
A. In the early days of Miss June, I was very much doing the lion's share of the songwriting. I remember we had a conversation about it, where the boys were like, “We want to contribute more." And I'm like, “Cool. Let's try to do this more collaboratively." That's the newest sort of song for us. Some of those heavier songs like “Enemies" and “Aquarium" were riffs that Jun wrote on guitar and brought in, and then I put vocals on.
Q. What inspired “Best Girl?"
A. I am from a tiny island on the bottom of the Earth, and it has a very small population. Because of that constant close proximity with other people, it's really important to be supportive of each other. That's something New Zealand can struggle with a little bit.
I wrote “Best Girl" from the perspective of being a young female musician growing up in a small town. And basically just feeling the weight of expectation, and the patriarchal construct that says there's only room for one woman on the lineup, or there's only room for one girl in the band. And it's this mentality that forces us to compete with other women, and it's just not necessary or true. In my mind it's another form of oppression.
What I've been seeing recently is a lot of marginalized people, a lot of women, rising up and saying, “[Expletive] your old system, we're actually going to do our own thing." The song is about this pursuit of this goal that doesn't exist . . . “If I'm the best girl, I'll be happy, no one can win but me, I have to be the one." Which actually isn't true. There's enough room for everybody to succeed in their own right.

A violent parody video is circulating online. "Fortnite" disappeared into a black hole. And Panera Bread does indeed freeze its mac and cheese. Here's the news you need to know today.
But first, why do pirates wear eye patches? It’s completely reasonable to assume they wore patches to cover up lost or wounded eyes, but the actual reason is a lot darker. Yarr welcome.
A doctored video of Trump shooting critics is deeply disturbing
A fake, violent video that depicts President Donald Trump killing journalists and a number of his critics was played at a pro-Trump event at his Miami resort last week, according to a report in The New York Times. The White House says the president hasn't seen the video, but he does condemn the contents being reported. The fake video is hard to watch. In an edited scene from the film "Kingsman: The Secret Service," Trump enters a "Church of Fake News" and opens fire on members of the congregation, shooting, stabbing and setting fire to various news organizations' logos and political opponents, including Kathy Griffin, Hillary Clinton and the late Sen. John McCain.
Meghan McCain slammed a response from Stephen Miller on Monday after the senior Trump adviser argued the video was "free speech" rather than a call to incite violence. "One of the people in this video is my dad," she said. "This could inspire violence towards REAL people. "
'No justification': Family of Atatiana Jefferson demands justice
A Fort Worth police officer who fatally shot a black woman in her home while she played video games with her 8-year-old nephew resigned from the force and could face criminal charges, the interim police chief said Monday. Atatiana "Tay" Jefferson, 28, was shot in her home Saturday by Aaron Dean, a white police officer responding to a call from a neighbor who was concerned because her doors were open. On Monday, Jefferson's family demanded an independent investigation of the tragedy and prosecution of the shooter. Ashley Carr said her sister was killed by a "reckless" act. "There is simply no justification for his actions," she said.
Who was Atatiana 'Tay' Jefferson? Fort Worth woman killed by cop represented 'honor, integrity. '

Call your 'Fortnite'-obsessed friends and make sure they are OK
Avid “Fortnite” gamers around the world saw sun for the first time in weeks today, probably. Sunday, the hit video game was sucked into a virtual black hole, marking the end of Season 10 and leaving millions of gamers around the world confused (and, I’d imagine, scared). Video of “The End” shows what appear to be projectiles falling from the sky, followed by a black hole sucking up every single piece of the game, then going dark. The Twitter account for "Fortnite" features a single tweet: a live video feed of the black hole. Perhaps the most interesting thing about this event: It's not exactly clear when "Fortnite" will be available again. Everybody breathe.

When doing it for the 'gram TikTok goes wrong
A viral video labeled “exposing Panera” shared to TikTok – a trendy social media app favored by youths – unleashed a fury of criticism about how much of Panera Bread’s “clean” food is actually frozen. It may have also cost a woman her job. The clip, which has more than 6 million views, shows a Panera Bread worker placing a frozen bag of mac and cheese into a vat of boiling water and dumping it into a bowl. The response to the TikTok video was mixed: One called Panera "glorified hospital food," while another said, "Alright but it's GOOD hospital food. " Once the video went viral, the original poster said Friday on Twitter that she "lost (her) job for this video. "

Texto completo: Kathy Griffin and Meghan McCain called for action after a doctored video circulated online over the weekend, reportedly shown at a pro-President Donald Trump event last week at his Miami resort, that illustrates the president shooting a number of his critics including Griffin and the late Sen. John McCain.
"I'm depicted as being murdered by The President of the United States in this video," Griffin tweeted late Sunday. "The left, right & center left me hanging out to dry regarding the Trump mask photo. Please don’t let it happen again. No, this video isn’t a joke to his followers. And it will not be taken as such. "
Griffin was at the center of a national controversy in May 2017, when she posed for a photoshoot holding a mock bloody, severed head made to look like Trump had been decapitated. The comedian apologized at the time, calling the stunt "disturbing" and acknowledging she "went too far. " Following a brief federal investigation into Griffin, she later said the FBI protected her amid threats of violence.
More: Fake video of Trump shooting media and political opponents shown at conference: New York Times
The fake video, a clip taken from the 2015 action/comedy "Kingsman: The Secret Service," shows Trump's face superimposed atop actor Colin Firth's as his character opens fire on church patrons.
The edited version depicts various victims as media outlets, politically-active entertainers like Griffin and Rosie O'Donnell and Trump's political rivals like Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. , 2020 presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. , Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif. , 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and former President Barack Obama.
Meghan McCain slammed a response from Stephen Miller on Monday morning after the senior Trump adviser argued the video was covered by "free speech" and falls along the lines of controversial entertainment like the new "Joker" movie or heavy metal music, rather than a call to incite violence.
"No it isn't," McCain wrote. "One of the people in this video is my dad, sitting senators and congresspeople. Please don't insult me or them by insinuating this is anything like heavy metal. This could inspire violence towards REAL people. "
"The View" host also retweeted her mother Cindy's message on Monday, expressing outrage over the video.
"Reports describing a violent video played at a Trump Campaign event in which images of reporters & @JohnMcCain are being slain by Pres Trump violate every norm our society expects from its leaders & the institutions that bare their names," Cindy McCain tweeted. "I stand w/ (the White House Correspondents Association) in registering my outrage. "

Texto completo: Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders Sunday tamped down concerns about his recent heart attack, signaling a return to a heavy campaign schedule, and painting a contrast with his chief ideological rival, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).
"There's nobody who has run a more vigorous campaign than I did. And we're talking about three or four rallies a day and town meetings and so forth and so on, but I think after a short period of time, we'll probably be able to return to that," Sanders said in an interview that aired Sunday on ABC's "This Week." But Sanders added, "not the first day back."
Sanders (I-Vt.) told ABC anchor Jonathan Karl that doctors were okay with him returning to his hectic campaign schedule. He said he would release all his medical records "as soon as we can."
Sanders also appeared to take on Warren, who has been rising in national polling and in early voting states.
"There are differences between Elizabeth and myself," Sanders said. "We need a political revolution. I am, I believe, the only candidate who's gonna say to the ruling class of this country, the corporate elite, enough, enough with your greed and with your corruption. We need real change in this country.
"Elizabeth considers herself...to be a capitalist to her bones. I don't. And the reason I am not is because I will not tolerate for one second the kind of greed and corruption and income and wealth inequality and so much suffering that is going on in this country today, which is unnecessary."
Addressing his health, Sanders said that " 'heart attack' is a scary word." He said he underwent a roughly 45 minute procedure in which stents were placed in his heart, where an artery was blocked.
"It's a fairly common procedure, and people are back on their feet pretty soon, as is the case with me," Sanders said. "I think you gotta watch yourself, you gotta watch your diet, you got to be better at exercising, you gotta be more aware."
Sanders said he overlooked some symptoms leading up to his heart attack. "I was more fatigued, despite a heavy schedule, than I should have been. I wasn't sleeping as well as I should have been. Occasionally, I was a little bit wobbly."
"I should have put two and two together, and I didn't," Sanders said. "And I'm sorry about that."
Twelve Democratic candidates, including Sanders, will share a debate stage Tuesday night at Otterbein University in Ohio, to be co-sponsored by CNN and The New York Times.

Texto completo: In the ever-intensifying battle between red and blue, the consultants, fixers and self-serving media thrive, but America suffers.
Now we seem destined to face a graphic battle of extremes between Donald Trump and Elizabeth Warren, two self-styled populists best suited to exacerbating polarization while both sides toss around charges of “treason” and embrace the idea of an inevitable civil war.
I dream of a purple America where politics is civil and focuses on solving problems. The good news is that the country is actually far purpler than either red or blue. The most recent survey data shows that a majority of Democrats still consider themselves moderate or conservative while barely one in four see themselves as “very liberal”; among Republicans, despite Trump’s vaunted popularity, roughly 40 percent want their party to move closer to the center.
A wide base for purple politics
Political moderation is far more widespread than many suggest. Sarah Lawrence political scientist Sam Abrams, found, for example, that voters in the South are only slightly more conservative than those in the Northeast. Roughly as many consider themselves moderate as conservative, while a quarter describe themselves as liberal. Similarly, among residents of New England, long a bastion of progressives, barely 31 percent call themselves liberal while over a quarter identify as conservative and 43 percent moderate.
“Self-described moderates control the balance of power in all regions,” Abrams suggests. This is also the case, he notes, if you break down areas by rural, suburban and urban designations. Again, moderates dominate in virtually every category over both liberals and conservative.
So why extreme polarized politics?
Given these realities, how do we end up with choices, such as in 2016 and likely next year, that as Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse put it, are about as “popular as dumpster fires” among voters?
Some of the problem stems from record high alienation from the higher levels of government.
Barely 18 percent of Americans, for example, believe the federal government will do the right thing, a pattern common across all regions. The more powerful and least accountable the institutions — the media, academia and big corporations — the higher the level of distrust.
This has left our national politics largely in the hands of zealots, both right and left, and those for whom politics is often a profitable business. These are the forces driving the committed to ever more ideological hysteria.
Zealots, and those who make their livings from serving them, do not favor political collaboration across party lines. Groups that rally to the far right and left don’t want peaceful dialogue with dissenters. Indeed, the most intolerant of all our political “tribes,” notes one recent Atlantic study, are white social justice warriors, precisely the people who dominate the loud leftish Twitter fringe that drives the party base.
The Purple Tide could be just beginning
In contrast, purple politics would not exploit paranoia and hysteria but seek out practical answers to problems from transportation and housing to energy use and homelessness; it would follow essentially moderate policies that fit the largely suburban middle class.
This requires a new generation of leaders willing to break the ideological paralysis. Critically this includes the great GOP stronghold of Texas. In 2018 many longstanding Republican congressmen and other officials were defeated, as was nearly the polarizing Sen. Ted Cruz. To stem the bleeding, Republican strategist are seeking out more moderate, sensible politicians to deal with an increasingly purple electorate.
Fortunately for the Republicans in Texas, the Democrats seem to be accommodating this strategy by pushing the Texas party further to left, embracing such things as bans on fossil fuels, a mortal threat to their state’s boom. Some, notably in Austin, have adopted policies on homelessness modeled on San Francisco’s, with predictable results on the street that will make for fine GOP propaganda.
This hopefully temporary insanity manifests itself in onetime moderate Beto O’Rourke, who now favors such things as reparations for those arrested for marijuana possession, open borders, as well as essentially nationalizing zoning, a position first embraced by his fellow Texas Democrat, Julian Castro. Between them, these once touted young political stars barely muster 15 percent of the Texas Democratic primary vote, according to a recent poll.
Generally, in gaining public approval, moderate GOP governors do best, and dominate the ranks of the most popular figures in American politics. In contrast, those at the bottom tend to be outspoken progressives, including Gov. Gavin Newsom and similarly left-leaning politicians such as last place finisher Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont, although some particularly harsh conservatives, like Kentucky’s Matt Bevin also do poorly.
Political self-interest lies in the center
Purple politics, sadly, is not doing well in the Democratic Party’s presidential race. Elizabeth Warren, with her calls for a vast increase in federal power, as well higher taxes on the middle class, could drive a large number of middle-of-the-road and even working-class voters, including many minorities, to the GOP.
As the liberal columnist Jonathan Chait has observed, many new progressive stances now being adopted by Democrats — reparations, decriminalizing border crossings, health-care coverage to undocumented immigrants, eliminating energy production — are not likely to appeal to even moderate party members, much less independents.
For example, Medicare for all, embraced by Warren, is favored by barely 40 percent of the electorate. Proposals from Democratic candidates to eliminate private cars, end air travel and phase out red meat may not play well outside Manhattan, San Francisco and West Los Angeles. Already, notes The New York Times, the left shift is driving independents away from the party. Some 54 percent of all Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents prefer a more moderate than more liberal party.
The failures of more mainstream candidates, such as Joe Biden, Amy Klobuchar and John Hickenlooper, illustrate that the party’s left is far better organized than the center. They appeal, according to a recent YouGov poll, to bread-and-butter issues built around the safety net, jobs and prosperity that moderate Democrats care about.
But the more motivated, and well-organized activists embrace a less saleable agenda of draconian climate-change policies, virtually unregulated abortion and removal of barriers to undocumented immigration. Only the embrace of such extreme and unpopular positions can save the presidency of the clearly unbalanced and deeply unpopular Donald Trump.
Yet purple politics may regain its appeal particularly if Trump is reelected. At some point, the political class will have to recognize that most people don’t care much about “conservative principles,” “saving the planet” or massive schemes to assure “social justice” on the backs of middle-class taxpayers. They want competent government, not politicians who only represent money interests and the organized yammerers within their parties.
Despite the awful choice we are about to have at the top of the ticket, the good news that America is already essentially a purple country, dominated far more by moderation and common sense than the punditry suggests. What we need are political leaders capable of tapping into that reality, both for the own benefit and that of the country.

Texto completo: Como miles de neoyorquinos que supieron del asesinato de cuatro hombres desamparados en Chinatown, el empresario Hakki Akdeniz expresó su tristeza y recordó que él mismo vivió en las calles.
En una entrevista con The New York Times y PIX11, Akdeniz , de 39 años, dueño de la cadena local de pizzerías, Champion Pizza, contó que fue al lugar donde encontraron los cuerpo.
“Estaba sorprendido” , dijo Akdeniz. Ha vuelto en varias ocasiones para dejar flores y velar en memoria de los hombres muertos.
Además, deja una pila de pizzas frescas para otros desamparados en el vecindario.
Hakki Akdeniz wept as he left candles, flowers, & pizza at the crimes scenes. He own a pizza shop & feeds the #homeless every wk. He used to be homeless himself & never turns away the hungry. 4 homeless men were savagely beaten to death as they slept in Chinatown. @abc7ny pic.twitter.com/Xi1A84ei4v
— Lucy Yang (@LucyYang7) October 7, 2019
Akdeniz dejó una carta expresando simpatía por la comunidad y tristeza por no haber estado allí para proteger a los hombres que fueron asesinados.
Además de ser conocido por sus habilidades al preparar la pasta para la pizza, a Akdeniz se le reconoce su dedicación para ayudar a la comunidad de personas sin hogar.
“A menudo entrega rebanadas gratis en sus restaurantes y reparte comida y ropa todos los lunes y miércoles”, reportó PIX11. “Hace varios años, comenzó a pagar una tarifa mensual en un gimnasio local para permitir que varias personas al día se duchen, y regularmente lleva a los grupos a una barbería para que le hagan un corte”.
Akdeniz, originario de Turquía, ayuda a la comunidad de personas sin hogar, debido a su propia experiencia de no tener hogar cuando se mudó a los Estados Unidos en 2001.
Llegó a Nueva York con $240 dólares en su bolsillo , durmió en un motel de $30 dólares por noche , pero cuando se le acabó el dinero, dormía en las estaciones de metro.
“Tenía grandes esperanzas, un gran sueño. Tenía un objetivo” , dijo Akdeniz. “Pero a veces la esperanza no es suficiente para alcanzar su objetivo”.
Después de trabajar en pizzerías y ahorrar dinero durante varios años, a finales de 2009, Akdeniz abrió su primera sucursal en el Bajo Manhattan. Las cosas no fueron fáciles y a menudo dormía debajo de su horno para ahorrar dinero.
Ahora tiene siete sursales, cinco en Manhattan, una en Brooklyn y otra en Queens.

Storyteller Kimo Nevius entertains with music for a cause

Texto completo: Kimo Nevius is a man of many, many trilbies. In the early afternoon on the third Saturday of each month, he grabs one of those trilbies, along with guitar, harmonica and tablet loaded with song sheets, drives across the Central Valley to the Wailuku Coffee Co. on Market Street and starts his sound check. And at the stroke of 2, he gets going with his long-running series, The Coffee House Sessions: Music for a Cause.
The next two hours are filled with songs and talk story — all free. Whatever cash finds its way into the tip jar goes, 100%, to whatever the cause is that day: the construction of a new school and orphanage deep in the Democratic Republic of Congo; the nonprofit Books Through Bars, which sends free reading and educational materials to prisoners on the Eastern Seaboard; and Hale Kau Kau, the “House of Meals” serving the homeless and homebound out of St. Theresa’s Catholic Church in Kihei.
The haul to date exceeds $ 6,000, of which $ 1,000 and change was raised in a single day.
Typically, Nevius takes the 2 o’clock slot himself and at 3 turns the floor over to other talent of generous spirit. This coming Saturday, though, to celebrate the second anniversary of the Coffee House Sessions, the host is going it alone. The playlist, subject to change, includes the old standby “Man in a Hat” (what, not a trilby?), which has been out of the rotation for a while.
Nevius says he also has a couple novelties up his sleeve: “Wasting Away,” inspired, he says, by the Beatles, and the title track to his band’s upcoming release, “Celebrate! (Part 2).”
That new band, Promised Road, appears to be something of a work in progress. As Nevius confessed at last month’s Coffee House Session, it consisted at that point of him and his cat.
The recording industry being the shambles it is, Nevius releases his material mostly online. On kimo songs.com you’ll find a quite a mix. A cover of Bob Dylan (“With God on Our Side”) jostles carols for a troubled planet. Protest songs recall honorable leftie traditions going back at least to the Depression (remember “Joe Hill”?). If your news channel is Fox, you will for sure want to swipe left on “Puppet” (complete with red-white-and-blue cover art) and “Not My President.”
The Aloha State is the latest chapter in an odyssey that has covered almost as much of the globe as Capt. Cook’s. The son of an Episcopalian priest, Nevius was born in Columbia, S.C., but grew up in Oxford, Eng­land; Gettysburg, Pa.; Salt Lake City; Dhahran, Saudi Arabia; and Rome, where as a budding singer-songwriter he busked in the subway under the not-always-indulgent eye of the Italian police.
“The joke in the family,” he says, “was that Dad ran out of sermon topics every three years, so then we’d have to move.”
Two decades in New York City followed, where at first he shared a bedroom “the size of a small Cadillac, staring out at an air shaft.” Then he got married to Michelle Nevius, his co-author on two books that fold centuries of Big Apple social history into routes for architectural walking tours.
Then came 9/11.
“That attack made us think, ‘Life is short,’” says Nevius. “Everything can change in a moment. So, in 2007, after 20 years in New York, we moved to Maui. We’re very deliberative people. Six years is kind of overnight for us.”
The greenest of malihini, not yet adopted into the halau of the kumu hula to whom he owes his Hawaiian handle of Kimo (formerly James), Nevius was taking a noncredit course on local history at the University of Hawaii Maui College with Keli‘i Tau‘a when the class received a surprise assignment: Take some of the material you’ve learned, Tau‘a said, and turn it into a song.
“Many of the students were upset,” Nevius recalls. “But I took it as a challenge. I wrote ‘Maliko Gulch,’ about S.T. Alexander and H.P. Baldwin’s project to bring water from East Maui to the Central Valley so they could plant sugar cane there. Keli‘i, who’s a songwriter himself, though he hadn’t told us that, loved the song and took me under his wing.”
And so, a new phase of songwriting began, cresting last year with the release of the album “Rolling Down to Old Maui: New Songs About Old Hawaii.” Streaming audio is available online, but there’s also a physical package including a CD plus a 40-page companion book of lyrics and enlightening liner notes.
Several hard-chugging tracks tell of backbreaking work for meager pay on whaling ships and in the cane fields. Gentler numbers recall island royalty and companions in their ohana. “The Other Side of the World” strings together imaginary letters home from Capt. James Cook for a rueful farewell.
At the moment of truth, it’s amazing how much mutual misunderstanding can be packed into a single couplet. “We thought they thought we were heaven- sent,” Cook writes, speaking of the kanaka maoli. “I’m beginning to think we misread their intent.”
As a storyteller in song or speech, Nevius has an easygoing, by-the-campfire civility. Even when taking a stand against the toxicities of our day — mass shootings, global warming — he soft-pedals the righteous indignation.
“I guess I’m a bit of a fatalist,” he says. “I know I sing a lot about how hard life is. But at the same time, my outlook is that life can be pretty good if you don’t get too set in your ways.”

Texto completo: September snowstorm? Check. October snowstorm? Check. According to the 2017 Montana Climate Assessment, Montana will warm by about 10 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century. Does this year's early winter weather throw that scientific conclusion into doubt?
No. Climate and weather are related, but different, concepts. Climate is weather aggregated over time. Moreover, climate change means more extreme weather of all stripes, including cold snaps and blizzards. Recent studies have shown that, as temperatures warm in the Arctic, the jet stream brings cold air farther south.
Instead of taking the cold weather as a sign to relax about climate change, we should take it as another urgent warning of what is to come: more stress on our water supply, more wildfires choking our air, and more volatility for farmers and ranchers.
The early winter weather also holds another message: Montanans are good at anticipating and readying for inclement and unpredictable weather. That far-sightedness and pragmatism can also make us leaders on climate action.
I have learned a lot about preparedness from my sons' teachers, who are forever sending well-timed reminders to dress our children properly for the weather du jour—whether that's mud, a wintry mix, or snow.
In fact, even in summertime, the prescient teachers were already planting a seed to "please send snowsuits, mittens, boots, and hats every day during the winter months." They are persistent because they both love the children and respect the power of the weather.
We must not assume that the Earth will be lenient. I remember the hailstorm that defeated my family on last summer's backpacking trip — he blueberry-sized hailstones that pelted us on the head, the leg that ached beneath me as I contorted to stretch a too-small tarp over myself and my screaming kids.
My husband wrangled up the tent to shelter us. Suddenly, rain poured down, drenching the tent, inside and out. When the rain slowed, my two-year-old's folded-up pants drooped with hailstones, and his socks were soaked where the poncho had flagged.
As we jolted back down the trail toward home, I held my damp, warm, eerily still two-year-old inside my jacket. I talked to him and stroked his hair, but he wouldn't meet my eyes, as if he might never forgive me.
Greta Thunberg recently told world leaders, "If you choose to fail us, we will never forgive you." A New York Times OpEd accused Thunberg of attempting to short circuit the democratic process. But leadership with a sense of urgency is not at odds with democracy. Sure, climate change has been called a "super wicked problem," but complacency doesn't solve the problem.
Montanans know how to be ready. Let us get ready. Leaders: Take a page from the playbook of our state's schoolteachers. If you lead with commitment to our children, with foresight, and with businesslike action, you will be on the right side of history. If you lead with blind faith in the leniency of the Earth, you will deserve the next generations' disgust.

Texto completo: APPLETON – While attending Appleton West High School, Brad Smith never imagined he'd work for a big company. He thought he'd be a lawyer, a politician or a diplomat.
"I sometimes joke that, in fact, my job involves all three," Smith told the USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin in a phone interview to promote an upcoming book-release event at Lawrence University.
Now 60, Smith is president of a little outfit — you might have heard of it — called Microsoft.
He's been described by The New York Times as the tech giant's "elder statesman" and "a de facto ambassador for the technology industry at large." He oversees more than 1,400 executive staff in 56 countries, and has testified before Congress.
But it all started, he said, with the lessons and experiences he collected as an idealistic Appleton teenager.
"I've always felt that way," said Smith, a student body president, newspaper editor and school-play pig wrangler at Appleton West, who moved from Racine in eighth grade.
"I always thought of Appleton as my hometown."
Agitating and advocating The teenage Smith took a keen interest in the issues facing Appleton, Wisconsin and the wider world, and he debated everything — who should be president or what state policy should be on the ballot — with his mom, Barbara.
"My younger brother in particular ... would always say, 'Stop arguing with mom!'" he said. "And mother would say, 'We're not arguing. We're debating.'"
He brought that love for policy with him to school at Appleton West, where he was co-editor-in-chief of the newspaper, The Talisman, and student body president in his junior and senior years.
As a sophomore running to become student body president as a junior, Smith's chances seemed slim. His parents were "very, very supportive of everything I did," he said, but they "were really downplaying the whole election," because they didn't want to get his hopes up.
The evening the votes were counted, in spring 1975, Smith stayed out at the YMCA until 8 p.m. When he got home and told his parents he won — "I still remember, I got 61 percent of the vote," he said — they asked why he hadn't called them earlier with the good news.
"And I said, 'Gee I didn't think that you were that interested in the election,'" he said.
Smith was also part of a student-faculty council that included five faculty members and an administrator, working to improve school policies like the way the National Honor Society selected students or who had access to the hallway.
"I was always agitating or advocating for some kind of change in the local high school," he said.
Smith worked three evenings a week at Shopko his junior year, and later at Fleet Farm in the summer after his senior year. There, "I managed to drive a forklift into a ditch," he said, "but happily survived."
During his junior year, he made what he jokes was his "great theatrical debut" as the props director for the play "Li'l Abner."
"My job was to — among other things — drive to a farm near Hortonville and pick up a little piglet and bring it to the high school theater every evening, so it could appear in the play."
'Values that I grew up with' Part of growing up in Appleton, Smith said, was that you could hop on your bike and get anywhere in town.
"Your parents never worried about you," he said. "That was sort of the slice of middle America that Appleton embodied in the 1970s."
He remembers, as an eighth-grader, a summer of pedaling off to catch Appleton Foxes baseball games. In high school, the social scene was the Friday night basketball game and the dance afterward in the Appleton West gym.
If it was warm, you'd end up at Dairy Queen. If it was cold, Burger King.
"Maybe McDonald's, if you wanted diversity and you wanted to go to a third place," he joked. "But that was pretty much the range of places that we would go."
Smith said he's delighted by how much Appleton has grown, with restaurants and retail by the riverfront — which was "not ... a place where people went for anything." And he's happily noticed how much more ethnically and racially diverse it's become.
His parents moved away the summer after he graduated high school, he said, but he gets back about once a year for Microsoft's TechSpark program, which includes job skills training and computer science education in Brown and Outagamie County schools. Microsoft also partnered with the Green Bay Packers for TitletownTech, a startup and tech innovation lab.
And Smith has donated money to the Appleton Education Foundation and a fund for special projects at Appleton West. Part of his donations were used last year to enable the witch to fly in the "Wizard of Oz" musical production by Appleton West and Wilson Middle School.
"There's little things like that that I like to get back and see," he said.
He still keeps in touch, 42 years after graduating, with two of his former teachers at Appleton West: English teacher Vira Stoner and history teacher Thomas Fanning.
He credits Stoner's contemporary composition class for helping him place among the 10 percent of incoming freshmen at Princeton who tested out of the English requirement. And Fanning, who taught Smith constitutional and diplomatic history and was co-executive secretary of the student-faculty council Smith's senior year, "really encouraged all of us to think very broadly about what was going on around the world and learn from history," Smith said.
Stoner recalled to USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin that Smith was a force within the student body, "immediately very successful" in student government and debate club.
Fanning described Smith as intellectually curious and "very much student-minded, as far as the rights of students," he said.
"I taught for 32 years. Over a lifetime of teaching, you're blessed when you have students that just stand out," he said.
Smith's ongoing support of Appleton is "a small repayment on such a large debt," Smith said, to the place where he was exposed to the idea that you could accomplish anything if you were ethically grounded and worked hard enough.
"When I think of Midwestern values the way I was exposed to them in Appleton, I think of being friendly and outgoing. I think about being honest above all else. I think about showing respect for other people. I think of being plainspoken. And I think you find those values in other places too, but they are all values — those were the values that I grew up with."
'Tools and Weapons' Although Smith might have never imagined himself working for one of the most valuable companies in the world by stock market value, his life at Microsoft isn't too far from what he dreamed of as a kid: lawyer, politician or diplomat.
He quite literally is a lawyer, serving as Microsoft's chief legal officer, in addition to being president, since his appointment by CEO Satya Nadella in September 2015.
And Smith also travels around the world as a kind of politician or diplomat for Microsoft on the world stage, like attending the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, or meeting with government leaders to advocate for changes or defend Microsoft.
Smith recounts those experiences as a lawyer, politician and diplomat in the book he co-authored with Microsoft Director of Executive Communications Carol Ann Browne, "Tools and Weapons."
It's about the tech industry's responsibility to make sure technology like social media and AI is regulated and fostered to benefit people, instead of just pursuing growth at all costs.
Each chapter is rooted in a story — not just stories from Smith and Browne's advocacy around the world, but from history, as well.
"I think I learned at a relatively young age that people don't necessarily like to listen to a lecture but they love to listen to a story," Smith said. "I think this is something I learned in school. I think it's something that I learned going to church as a teenager. You could just watch the reactions of people around you, and you could see when people would sit up straight, perk up, and actually follow what you're saying."
You can see Smith speak about "Tools and Weapons" at the Lawrence University Music-Drama Center, 420 E. College Ave., from 9 to 10 a.m. Friday. Admission is free.

Texto completo: Reading the fine print in your credit card agreement probably isn't on the top of your to-do list.
Maybe it should be.
Think of it as a treasure hunt in search of hidden perks - freebies that can include trip cancellation coverage that reimburses you for airfare and hotels if you get sick, luggage delay insurance that pays for clothing and toiletries while you wait for your bags, or a refund on TSA Precheck membership fees.
"People look at the [annual percentage rate], rewards and annual fee, and that's about it" when selecting a credit card, said Bill Hardekopf, CEO of the card comparison site Lowcards.com. "They would be shocked to know that a lot of credit cards come with additional perks that don't cost anything."
These extras aren't widely advertised. "You have to dig for them," he said.
Travel-related benefits are common among travel reward cards - such as Chase Sapphire, Chase Ink Business Preferred, Bank of America Premium Rewards, Capital One VentureOne - and co-branded hotel and airline cards, such as the Chase World of Hyatt and United Explorer cards. Some cash-back cards offer the perks, too.
But those bonuses could soon become a lot harder to find following Citibank's recent decision to drop many of its long-standing travel benefits, industry experts said.
Citi's move "shocked me," said Curtis Arnold, founder of BestPrepaidDebitCards.com and Cardratings.com.
"The fact that one major issuer suddenly got rid of benefits they've had for years is alarming" and could have ripple effects in the industry, spurring other issuers to follow Citi's lead, he said.
Effective Sept. 22, Citi dropped trip cancellation/interruption coverage, car rental coverage, travel accident insurance, baggage delay and lost baggage protection, trip delay protection, roadside assistance and more on most of its cards.
Citi said the cuts were due to "sustained low usage" and were made "so that we can continue providing the key benefits that our customers use and value most at no additional cost."
(The bank also eliminated its Citi Price Rewind program, which refunded cardholders up to $200 per item if they found the item at a lower price within 60 days of purchase.)
For now, there still are plenty of travel perks being offered by other top issuers, including Chase, Capital One, Bank of America, U.S. Bank and others.
Terms and types of coverage vary depending on the card, with the best protections typically offered by premium cards that require excellent credit and carry higher annual fees.
To find out what coverage you may have, or if you are thinking about applying for a particular card, check the card issuer's website, scour the fine print in the card agreement or call customer service.
"The problem is some customer service reps will lack knowledge" about the programs, Mr. Arnold said.
While it may sound obvious, keep in mind that you'll have to pay for your trip with your credit card in order to take advantage of the coverage.
If you have multiple cards, be familiar with the side perks offered on each of them so that you can pick the best card to use when booking a particular trip.
Here's a rundown of some of the major offerings and how they work:
.Trip cancellation/interruption coverage. This reimburses you for nonrefundable travel expenses such as airfare and hotel charges in case of illness, injury, extreme weather or other factors that cause you to cancel your vacation or come home early. Reimbursement limits vary. For example, the Chase Hyatt card will pay up to $5,000 per trip, while the Chase Sapphire Preferred card reimburses up to $20,000. People who buy travel insurance can expect to pay from 4% to 10% of the cost of the trip, Mr. Arnold said, so having this protection through your credit card can save a bundle.
.Trip delay insurance. When your trip is delayed (usually at least six hours), this covers nonreimbursed expenses such as meals and toiletries, and sometimes lodging. For example, the Chase Sapphire Preferred card ($95 annual fee) will pay for meals and hotel if your flight, train or bus is delayed by at least 12 hours or requires an overnight stay, up to $500 per ticket.
.Baggage delay or loss coverage. This reimburses you a certain amount per day for clothing and toiletries if your luggage is delayed, or a lump sum if your bags are lost. The Chase Hyatt card pays for baggage delays over six hours, up to $100 a day for five days. If luggage is lost for good, it pays up to $3,000 per passenger.
.Travel accident insurance. This pays a certain amount for accidental death or dismemberment while traveling.
.TSA Precheck reimbursement. The precheck program allows expedited security screening on domestic and some international flights. Under this perk, cardholders are reimbursed for their five-year, $85 membership fee, or $100 for signing up for Global Entry. Global Entry gives travelers everything that TSA Precheck does, plus expedited entry through U.S. customs when returning from a foreign country.
.Auto rental collision damage waiver coverage. This credit card perk kicks in when you decline the rental car company's collision insurance and charge the rental cost of the vehicle to your card. The coverage may be secondary to your personal auto insurance, in which case you would have to file a claim with your insurer first and the card issuer would cover the deductible and miscellaneous fees.
In addition, many travel rewards cards don't charge foreign transaction fees, a big plus when traveling outside the U.S.
Before filing any claim with your card company, experts recommend contacting the card issuer to walk through the process so you're sure to submit the right documents.
And don't delay - typically, there's a time limit for filing that ranges from 30 to 45 days.

Texto completo: The Roy family weighs its options in the "Succession" season finale, while the Rose family's small-town saga continues in Season 5 of "Schitt's Creek."
What's on TV
SUCCESSION 9 p.m. on HBO. "Time for a blood sacrifice." That's the ominous message Logan Roy, the Waystar Royco chief executive and family patriarch, left viewers with in the final minutes of Season 2's penultimate episode. Having testified before Congress following an explosive whistle blower allegation against his company, Logan, his family and his close associates head to the family's Mediterranean yacht to plot their next steps. But who will take the fall to preserve the company? Logan will have to weigh which one of his children or loyal cronies is expendable, even as some suggest that it's his head that may have to roll.
WHY WE HATE 10 p.m. on Discovery. This new nonfiction series from the executive producers Alex Gibney and Steven Spielberg examines what drives human beings to hate. By looking at everyday examples of violent disagreements over sports, politics, race, religion and social beliefs -- both out loud and online -- along with mass atrocities like the Holocaust, the show works to unravel the science and the evolutionary basis behind destructive human behavior. It's tapped a team of experts, including scientists, an extremism expert and an international criminal lawyer. The filmmakers hope that by untangling this complex topic, people can better understand their own minds and work to keep hate from spreading.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
HIP HOP: THE SONGS THAT SHOOK AMERICA 12 a.m. Monday on AMC. There are certain songs throughout history that transcend into anthems, music that captures the current moment, but also propels it forward or challenges the status quo. Executive producers Ahmir Thompson and Tariq Trotter (also known as Questlove and Black Thought of the Roots) have selected six songs in hip-hop that have been pivotal to the evolution of American music and culture, including Kendrick Lamar's "Alright," Run-D.M.C.'s "Rock Box" and Queen Latifah's "Ladies First." The series kicks off with "Jesus Walks," Kanye West's meditation on rap music and religion, deconstructing its composition and revisiting its impact.
What's Streaming
SCHITT'S CREEK Stream on Netflix and Pop; Purchase on Amazon, iTunes, Google Play and YouTube. The latest installment of the Rose family's small-town saga comes to Netflix just months before its sixth and final season airs in January. The fifth season of this Emmy-nominated family comedy picks up with Moira, fresh off her movie shoot in Bosnia, using her showbiz expertise to plan a local run of "Cabaret," David and Alexis trying to grow and compromise in their relationships and Johnny getting more involved in the community through his business venture, the Rose Motel, with Stevie and Roland. Writing about the fifth season for The New York Times, Margaret Lyons noted that "the co-creators Eugene and Dan Levy -- father and son in life and on the show -- have created a sweeter, gentler world than ours; the problems are sillier and the solutions involve musical performances more often than the solutions in our dumb boring real lives seem to. Redemption is never more than 21 minutes away."

Anthony Davis sprains thumb, Lakers look tired in loss to Nets in China

Texto completo: The start of the sequence was something fans had been craving for months: As Anthony Davis corralled a defensive rebound, he sent an outlet pass sailing past the halfcourt line to a streaking LeBron James.
James ran under the rim for the lay-up … and missed it. He got his own rebound … and missed again right under the hoop.
Multiple blown lay-ups on one play is unusual to see from the 34-year-old star, but then again, it’s been an unusual trip.
Fatigue was the predominant trait of the Lakers in Saturday’s 91-77 loss to the Brooklyn Nets, the second of two exhibition games played under fraught geopolitical circumstances in China. The weight of international travel, atypical drama and playing their second game in three nights seemed to slow the Lakers down in Shenzhen: They scored just 36 points in the first half, looking listless against a Nets team that didn’t even suit up its best player, Kyrie Irving.
The most relevant portion of the night ended with some discouraging news: Davis, who made his first start at center in the team’s third preseason game, sprained his right thumb on a block. The Lakers ended up pulling him after one quarter, setting him up on the bench with a fresh wrap, and the new franchise centerpiece finished with just 6 points on 2-for-7 shooting.
The Lakers announced after the game that Davis would undergo diagnostic testing upon his return to Los Angeles, joining Kyle Kuzma, Quinn Cook and Jared Dudley as players who have been laid up with ailments recently.
No one else picked up the slack. James also played just one quarter, finishing with four assists and six points on 2-for-7 shooting including his misses near the basket. While team sideline reporter Mike Trudell shared that James spent much of the second half interacting with Chinese fans – thawing some of the chill that had set in earlier in the week between the NBA and the host country – he did little on the court to sate them.
The role players that have sparked some intrigue early did little to help blunt the impact of the star power outage. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Avery Bradley combined for 25 points, but required 25 shot attempts. Rajon Rondo, who started for the second consecutive game, had no assists and four turnovers in 16 minutes. JaVale McGee stood out in the first two exhibitions – on Saturday, he had a much more down-to-earth performance (9 points, 3 rebounds, 2 blocks). As a team, the Lakers shot just 33 percent, including 5 for 32 from 3-point range.
The small lineup with Davis at center struggled to create offense, but the Nets also struggled to score as well. After one quarter, a buzzer-beating 3-pointer by Alex Caruso had kept the Brooklyn lead to just 20-19 in a rock fight. While Davis has famously wished to play less center, he was a brutally efficient rim protector, getting a pair of blocks despite his injury.
Caris LeVert (22 points) helped pull Brooklyn back in pole position, putting on a well-rounded display after missing most of Thursday’s 114-111 Nets win that provided much more suspense. Taurean Prince added 14 points.
The Lakers were to fly back immediately Saturday, scheduled to reach Los Angeles late Saturday night or early Sunday morning. While the NBA decided Friday to not make media available for the rest of the trip, it seemed safe to assume the Lakers and the league welcomed the end of a whirlwind week that started with a flurry of outrage over Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeting in support of Hong Kong protests against the government.
The NBA has been under fire from both sides, as Chinese businesses pulled sponsorships and state-run television decided to blacklist the games. Back in the United States, the president was among the notable critics of the league for bowing to foreign interests. Shenzhen is just north of Hong Kong, giving rise to some concern that the Lakers’ second exhibition could have more tension than the first, but The New York Times reported that the Chinese government had asked the media and public to tone down the fiery rhetoric earlier in the week, soothing some of the angst.
The Lakers will play their first preseason game at Staples Center against the Golden State Warriors on Monday night. It’s unclear if any players will sit out on a short turnaround after a flight halfway across the globe.

GOP TARGETS LAMB, OTHER DEMS ON IMPEACHMENT

Texto completo: A trio of Western Pennsylvania Republicans in U.S. Rep. Conor Lamb's district, taking part in a nationwide effort by the GOP to slam swing-district Democrats for supporting the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, repeated misleading claims as they called the effort a "coup" and a "sham" on Friday in Beaver.
In a news conference in front of the Beaver County Courthouse, Southwest GOP Caucus Chair Sam DeMarco, Slippery Rock Mayor Jondavid R. Longo and state Rep. Aaron Bernstine echoed the president's rhetoric and cast doubt on the legitimacy of the whistleblower report at the center of the impeachment inquiry - though the whistleblower's account has matched up with new information that has emerged in recent weeks, including a transcript released by the White House.
The three officials framed the impeachment inquiry as an effort by D.C. elites - including Mr. Lamb - to subvert the will of the American people to remove the president Democrats had been trying to oust since before he took office. They said that the president did not commit a crime in his call with the Ukrainian president. Criminal activity is not required for an impeachment.
But they also issued a direct message to Mr. Lamb - the same message that the Republican National Committee has been sending to 60-plus other Democratic representatives in swing districts with ads and events: Get back to work.
"We call for this sham inquiry to end," Mr. DeMarco said. "We call for Conor Lamb to get back to working in a bipartisan fashion to move this region forward and do work on behalf of the American people."
Mr. Lamb's team responded that the congressman isn't distracted and isn't playing politics. Rather, he's focused on getting to the bottom of "why the guns and ammunition we sent to the Ukrainians were held up by this administration," said Lamb campaign manager Abby Nassif Murphy, referring to the inquiry's focus on whether Mr. Trump dangled hundreds of millions of dollars in aid in urging Ukraine's help in investigating the son of his political rival.
In response to the allegation that Democrats are putting bipartisan work on hold to focus on a political hit job, Ms. Murphy pointed out that the House has passed hundreds of bills - on issues such as protecting health care, strengthening pensions and requiring more background checks - that have since stalled in the Republican-controlled Senate.
Beyond citing the Democrats' political motivations as reason he's called the inquiry a "sham," Mr. DeMarco said the whistleblower report at its center was created by someone without firsthand knowledge of what occurred, while the White House-released transcript showed that "there is nothing there."
But according to a statement this week from the Office of the Inspector General of the intelligence agencies, "the whistleblower stated on the form that he or she possessed both firsthand and other information," and the inspector general didn't deem the complainant in possession of only "secondhand or unsubstantiated assertions."
And, according to a fact check by The New York Times, the whistleblower's account of Mr. Trump's conversation with the Ukrainian president ended up being a "quite accurate" summary of the White House transcript.
When asked if a president should be urging a foreign country to investigate a political rival, Mr. DeMarco said he knew Mr. Trump, as a president who was not previously a career politician, would be unconventional.
"Sometimes, he talks in certain ways or whatever," Mr. DeMarco said. "But again, no crime was committed. We may have felt that it was not the most polite thing to say, but at the same time, it wasn't a crime. It wasn't a quid pro quo."
While the mayor of Slippery Rock also said he saw no "quid pro quo," Mr. Bernstine, the state representative, praised the Trump administration for being clear and transparent in turning over documents, including the White House transcript of the Ukraine call. The White House has ignored requests for documents and subpoenas, with the president's lawyers going as far as to say there will be no cooperation with the impeachment inquiry.
Mr. Longo said the impeachment inquiry is simply D.C. elites waging war against "small-town USA," of which he's a resident. And that "unprecedented campaign of resistance," as Mr. DeMarco called it, included special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.
The Mueller investigation, Mr. DeMarco said, was a waste of two years and $40 million, all to find out there was no collusion and no obstruction. Mr. Mueller testified in July that his report did not declare that was no collusion, nor exonerate the president on the question of whether he obstructed justice.
When asked if he considered the entire Mueller investigation a sham, including the idea that Russia interfered in the 2016 election, Mr. DeMarco said no one has been able to prove that one vote was changed by Russian interference - and said the Russians "spent an insignificant amount of money buying some Facebook ads," some of which were in favor of Hillary Clinton.
The money behind Russian Facebook ads was less than $200,000; NPR reported in April that Russian operatives reached 126 million people on Facebook with organic content, including posts and memes.
The trio of Republican officials insisted that voters will side with the president in 2020, and are tired of the direction the Democratic party is moving.
One supporter, among the more than 30 who showed up at the rally carrying signs that read, among other things, "Trump 2020" and "Lamb the Sham," agreed that the inquiry will hurt the Democrats' chances in 2020.
Patty Jenkins, a self-described "actively involved citizen" from New Castle, said Mr. Trump is the first president who is "working for us."

Texto completo: Revisit the absurdist comedy of Noel Fielding and Julian Barratt, and catch Werner Herzog's conversations with the former Russian leader.
What's Streaming
THE MIGHTY BOOSH Stream on Hulu and Amazon. Before Noel Fielding was serving up baking banter and an impressive array of kitschy shirts on "The Great British Baking Show," he was one half of the outlandish comedy duo behind The Mighty Boosh. Fielding and his counterpart Julian Barratt created a colorful roster of characters and original skits and songs that became the basis for this BBC Three television series named after the troupe. The show, which aired for three seasons in the early 2000s, follows the misadventures of Vince Noir (Fielding) and Howard Moon (Barratt) as they investigate mutant science experiments at a zoo's secret lab, save the world from a demonic little old lady and explore another planet for the Fountain of Youth. Along the way, they stumble across new friends and foes, like a beast made of sandpaper, a terrifying green-skinned cockney man with a mint over his eye and a Baileys-drinking, lovelorn merman known as Old Gregg.
What's on TV
MEETING GORBACHEV 6 p.m. on History. Over the course of three in-depth interviews, Werner Herzog sat with Mikhail S. Gorbachev to talk about the Russian leader's diplomacy that helped bring an end to the Cold War. The dialogue between the German filmmaker and the former politician (now 88 years old) serves as this documentary's backbone, in which Herzog examines Gorbachev's legacy. In his New York Times review of the film, Ben Kenigsberg wrote that Herzog "seems less in his element as an interviewer than he is when parsing historical footage," but still manages to shape "the film into a study in how world events often come down to quirks of character and circumstance."
THE DNA OF MURDER WITH PAUL HOLES 7 p.m. on Oxygen. After spending more than two decades trying to catch the Golden State Killer, Paul Holes, an investigator with the Contra Costa County district attorney's office, finally got a break in the case when he thought to combine DNA collected at the crime scenes with genealogy websites. The innovative scheme, which involved creating an undercover profile on GEDmatch under a pseudonym, led to the arrest of Joseph James DeAngelo. Holes has since retired, but he's gone on to use his expertise to help with existing cold cases as a co-host on the podcast "The Murder Squad," and now with his own TV show. On "The DNA of Murder," Holes gives true crime fans a behind-the-scenes look at how he approaches cases, aiding law enforcement agencies with unsolved crimes. On the series premiere, he'll look into a bludgeoning murder at an Iowa Holiday Inn from 1980.
THE COLLEGE ADMISSIONS SCANDAL 8 p.m. on Lifetime. This made-for-TV movie takes a dramatized look at the college admissions scandal that swept up famous actresses and business leaders earlier this year. It follows two wealthy mothers, played by Penelope Ann Miller and Mia Kirshner, willing to do whatever it takes to get their kids into prestigious universities, with a little help from a charismatic admissions consultant named Rick Singer (Michael Shanks).

Texto completo: Biopics about people known for their way with words have a leg up on the competition. So do biopics whose subjects spent a lot of time on camera; it's a bonus if that subject also brims with charisma.
So it's no surprise that Janice Engel's "Raise Hell: The Life and Times of Molly Ivins," is a captivating 90 minutes, because all those things are true of Molly Ivins in spades.
"Raise Hell" illuminates the arc of Ivins's life, from her childhood to her death in 2007, with plenty of commentary by friends, family, and colleagues. But the best moments are the ones where Ivins speaks for herself.
I didn't expect to laugh out loud at a biopic, but I did, multiple times, at her elaborately folksy political takedowns. I won't quote any of them here, because they lose something when not accompanied by her flawless deadpan.
Which isn't to say it's a nonstop party: the film addresses the flaws and sorrows that made Ivins who she was just as much as her journalistic skill, and her death at age 62 from breast cancer is a somber ending.
In the Trump years, it's become something of a cliché to say that we need the qualities of [insert recently deceased figure known for some combination of integrity, wit, and social consciousness] "now more than ever." But so much of what Ivins says in this movie, in clips from the '80s, '90s, and early '00s, rings devastatingly true to this political moment.
She speaks out clearly and forcefully about racism and economic inequality, the corporate takeover of politics, the horror and futility of endless war, and the moral hypocrisy of politicians.
We have commentators who speak out about these things now, of course, several of whom appear in the film. But there's no one quite like her: someone equally at home making off-the-cuff witticisms on camera and building her own unmistakable voice, funny and unpretentious but brimming with moral outrage, in writing read every week by people all over the country.
It's hard not to read "Raise Hell" as, at least in part, an elegy for a kind of journalist who simply doesn't exist anymore, though we need them more than ever.

Yovanovitch: Trump pressured State Department for her removal from Ukraine

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Former Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch testified to Congress Friday that a senior State Department official informed her that President Donald Trump advocated for her removal from office for months before her abrupt recall from the country last spring.
The decision to pull her from Ukraine was based “on false claims by people with clearly questionable motives,” Yovanovitch told the House Intelligence Committee in her opening statement, obtained by the New York Times.
In a further signal of the White House’s fight against impeachment, Yovanovitch was ordered by the State Department, at the direction of the White House, not to attend her highly anticipated deposition Friday, according to a statement by the Democratic chairman of three House committees leading the inquiry.
“In response, the House Intelligence Committee issued a subpoena to compel her testimony this morning,” the chairmen said Friday.
Yovanovitch, who was raised in Connecticut, was the second person named in the whistleblower complaint that sparked Democrats’ impeachment inquiry to testify before Congress.
U.S. Rep. Jim Himes, D-Greenwich, who sits on the committee, could not publicly discuss the substance of Yovanovitch’s testimony but said it bolstered the case for impeachment in his mind.
“I am more convinced than ever of two things: number one that Rudy Giuliani, the president’s personal attorney, was running the Ukraine file for the president,” Himes said Friday evening. “Some combination of Giuliani and his people — including the two who were indicted — had a lot to do with her dismissal.”
Giuliani, who is at the center of the Trump team’s efforts to get information from Ukraine, has been a vocal critic of Yovanovitch. Two Ukrainian businessmen who assisted Giuliani with this mission, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, were arrested on federal campaign finance charges Thursday. The duo was also subpoenaed by House Democrats.
“I do not know Mr. Giuliani’s motives for attacking me,” said Yovanovitch, who is still a State Department employee. “But individuals who have been named in the press as contacts of Mr. Giuliani may well have believed that their personal financial ambitions were stymied by our anti-corruption policy in Ukraine.”
House Democrats are investigating whether Trump, his administration and Giuliani pressured Ukraine to investigate one of Trump’s 2020 rivals, former Vice President Joe Biden, and his son, Hunter. Democrats want to know whether U.S. military aid was withheld from Ukraine in exchange for information on Biden and if the Trump administration tried to cover up these efforts.
Trump team alleges that Joe Biden thwarted Ukraine’s efforts to probe energy company Burisma, where Hunter Biden served on the board. A former Ukrainian top prosecutor alleged that Yovanovitch drew up a “do not prosecute list” for Ukraine. Yovanovitch said Friday that was untrue.
“I have never myself or through others, directly or indirectly, ever directed, suggested, or in any other way asked for any government or government official in Ukraine (or elsewhere) to refrain from investigating or prosecuting actual corruption,” she said.
Yovanovitch said she never met Hunter Biden, nor discussed him or Burisma with Joe Biden.
Yovanovitch served as ambassador to Ukraine from August 2016 to May 2019, when she was ordered to get on the next plane home.
Trump said Friday Yovanovitch was a nice woman, but the president of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskiy didn’t like her. Zelenskiy took office on the same day as Yovanovitch’s dismissal, casting doubt on the idea that the two would have had professional contact.
Yovanovitch discussed her removal from the country with Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan, she said.
“The president had lost confidence in me and no longer wished me to serve as his ambassador,” Yovanovitch testified. “(Sullivan) added that there had been a concerted campaign against me, and that the department had been under pressure from the president to remove me since the summer of 2018. He also said that I had done nothing wrong and that this was not like other situations where he had recalled ambassadors for cause.”
Yovanovitch worked for the State Department for more than 30 years prior to these recent controversies. She previously served as ambassador to Kyrgyzstan and Armenia.
“Today, we see the State Department attacked and hollowed out from within,” Yovanovitch testified. “State Department leadership, with Congress, needs to take action now to defend this great institution, and its thousands of loyal and effective employees. We need to rebuild diplomacy as the first resort to advance America’s interests and the front line of America’s defense.”
Earlier this week, the State Department blocked another official from testifying to the committee. But U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland bucked the department Friday, announcing he would appear before the House committee under subpoena next week. He is among numerous witnesses from whom the House is now seeking documents and testimony, including Giuliani.
Yovanovitch was born in Canada to Ukrainian parents and then moved to Connecticut at age 3. Her parents, Nadia and Michel, taught foreign languages at Kent School for roughly 30 years, until they retired in 1993. Marie, also known by the Russian nickname Masha, Yovanovitch, graduated from the private boarding school in 1976, Kent’s school magazine indicates.

Parnas gave to ND GOP

Texto completo: An associate of President Donald Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani who was arrested Wednesday on campaign finance violation charges has a history of donating to the state Republican parties of North Dakota and Minnesota.
Soviet-born U.S. citizen Lev Parnas donated about $660 to each of the state parties in October 2016, according to the Federal Election Commission website.
Federal authorities allege that Parnas and another associate, Igor Fruman, funneled foreign money to U.S. politicians and political organizations in an effort to influence U.S.-Ukraine relations, according to the federal indictment.
Global Energy Producers, a company created by Parnas and Fruman in 2018, also contributed $325,000 to pro-Trump super political action committee America First Action, according to the Washington Post. The PAC spent more than $565,000 on digital and print advertisements against 2018 North Dakota Senate candidate Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat, according to the FEC website. Heitkamp, the incumbent, was defeated by now-Sen. Kevin Cramer.
Cramer said a complaint alleging foreign contributions originating with Parnas, passed through a corporate contribution, was filed last year and, according to press reports, the contributions were set aside and therefore were not part of sums spent opposing Heitkamp and other candidates.
"This one, it seems they caught it before any money was spent," he said. "More importantly, they arrested these guys. That's all good. I'm grateful they caught them and prevented them from leaving the country."
North Dakota Republican Party Chairman Rick Berg said the party would look into Parnas' contribution and refund or donate the money received to charity if it finds Parnas has committed a campaign finance violation. Berg said it is unknown how Parnas' contribution was used but that the party would "track it down."
Minnesota GOP Chairwoman Jennifer Carnahan, hosting Trump on Thursday in Minneapolis, was not available for comment.
Parnas and Fruman, both based in south Florida, were arrested and were expected to appear in court in northern Virginia on Thursday, according to a spokesman in the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan, the New York Times reported.

Texto completo: A "Breaking Bad" movie hits Netflix. And Lupita Nyong'o eviscerates zombies on Hulu in "Little Monsters."
What's Streaming
EL CAMINO: A BREAKING BAD MOVIE (2019) Stream on Netflix. Over the course of its five seasons, "Breaking Bad" transformed the character Jesse Pinkman from a dewy-eyed, small-time drug dealer into a hardened (if also penitent) desperado. The series began with Jesse (played by Aaron Paul) joining forces with Walter White (Bryan Cranston), a New Mexico high school chemistry teacher who starts cooking and distributing crystal meth to pay for cancer treatment. The last time we saw Jesse -- after the drug empire the pair built together had collapsed -- he was a scarred man speeding into the night behind the wheel of a stolen Chevrolet El Camino. This sequel, an epilogue of sorts from the series's creator, Vince Gilligan, picks up the story from there. "It's a chapter of 'Breaking Bad' that I didn't realize that I wanted," Paul said in a recent interview with The New York Times. "And now that I have it, I'm so happy that it's there."
THE PARTS YOU LOSE (2019) Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. In a curious bit of timing, "El Camino" isn't the only movie out right now that casts Aaron Paul as a criminal. The actor also stars in this thriller, which was released in theaters last week and is available to rent digitally. Paul plays an injured fugitive who is taken in by a young boy on a snow packed North Dakota farm. The boy, Wesley (Danny Murphy), nurses him back to health as a way of escaping from his mean father (Scoot McNairy) and bullying that he faces because he is deaf.
LITTLE MONSTERS (2019) Stream on Hulu. A petting zoo becomes a playground for the undead in this zombie comedy. The story follows Dave (Alexander England), a wannabe rock guitar player who volunteers to chaperone his nephew's kindergarten field trip to up his proximity to Miss Caroline (Lupita Nyong'o), a dedicated teacher with a penchant for entertaining students with a ukulele. Unfortunately for the class but fortunately for anybody who enjoys the idea of watching Nyong'o terminate monsters in creative ways, the petting zoo is descended upon by zombies. Nyong'o is "easily the best part of this feeble Australian horror comedy," Elisabeth Vincentelli wrote in her review for The Times. "Miss Caroline never loses her cool and steadfastly dispatches the lurching attackers," Vincentelli added. "By the end, she looks like Mary Poppins after a post-apocalyptic Tough Mudder race -- and Nyong'o slays both registers."
What's on TV
TORN APART: SEPARATED AT THE BORDER 8 p.m. on HBO2. This 40-minute documentary follows two sets of mothers and children who were separated from each other last year after trying to cross into the United States at the southwestern border. Though the families (one comes from Honduras, the other Guatemala) manage to get back together, the film makes clear that the separation takes an emotional toll that continues affecting their lives even after they are reunited.

Texto completo: Victoria's Secret is laying off about 15 percent of the brand's employees at its Columbus, Ohio, headquarters as the beleaguered lingerie chain struggles to reshape its image and the chief executive of its parent company remains under scrutiny for his ties to Jeffrey Epstein.
The cuts, which took place on Wednesday and Thursday, involved about 50 people and range from senior leaders to junior staff, according to three people with knowledge of the situation who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.
The timing of the layoffs was unusual in the retail industry just before the key holiday season -- and followed an optimistic outlook delivered to investors by the chief of its parent company, Leslie H. Wexner, last month. L Brands, the parent company, also owns Bath & Body Works.
Language in the separation agreement given to at least some laid-off employees seemed to speak to the intense microscope the company finds itself under. The agreement document, which was reviewed by The New York Times, asked departing executives to agree that they would not make any statements to the media about the company, its employees or its operations, and that they would "direct all contacts from the media" regarding the company to Tammy Roberts Myers, an L Brands spokeswoman, or her successor. That language did not appear in a separation agreement from 2017.
Ms. Myers said in a statement on Thursday that the company "announced new leadership positions and organizational changes that help us simplify the business which allows us to be more agile."
"We're on the all-important journey to turn around the Victoria's Secret business," Ms. Myers said. "As we've said, everything is on the table, including having the right talent in the right places."
Victoria's Secret, once a powerhouse that shaped the notion of sexiness for many Americans, has found itself at odds with consumer tastes in the #MeToo era. The shares of L Brands have plummeted in recent years based on the brand's dismal performance, and it has discounted its products and ceded market share to nimble, more inclusive competitors.
The brand has also been dogged by Mr. Wexner's ties to Mr. Epstein, the financier who was arrested in July and charged with sex trafficking involving girls as young as 14. Mr. Wexner, 82, has sought to distance himself from the financier, whom he employed for more than a decade. He has also said Mr. Epstein "misappropriated vast sums of money" from him and his family, though no charges were ever filed.
Mr. Epstein died in August in prison in what the authorities said was an apparent suicide. L Brands said in July that it had hired lawyers at the direction of its board "to conduct a thorough review" into Mr. Wexner's relationship with Mr. Epstein. The investigation is still active, one person said, and the company has not provided an update on the query.
Separately, April Holt, Victoria's Secret's head of stores and store operations, said she was stepping down this week. The exit was not related to the layoffs, according to Ms. Myers.

After China Objects, Apple Removes App Hong Kong Protesters Use to Track Police

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO -- Apple removed an app late Wednesday that enabled protesters in Hong Kong to track the police, a day after facing intense criticism from Chinese state media for it, plunging the technology giant deeper into the complicated politics of a country that is fundamental to its business.
Apple said it was withdrawing the app, HKmap.live, from its App Store just days after approving it because the authorities in Hong Kong said protesters were using it to attack the police in the semiautonomous city.
A day earlier, People's Daily, the flagship newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, published an editorial accusing Apple of aiding "rioters" in Hong Kong. "Letting poisonous software have its way is a betrayal of the Chinese people's feelings," said the article, which was written under a pseudonym that translates into "Calming the Waves."
Timothy D. Cook, Apple's chief executive, said in an email to employees on Thursday that the company had removed the app after receiving "credible information" from the authorities and people in Hong Kong "that the app was being used maliciously to target individual officers for violence and to victimize individuals and property where no police are present." As a result, he said, the app violated Apple rules and local laws.
"National and international debates will outlive us all, and, while important, they do not govern the facts," he said in the letter, which was viewed by The New York Times. "In this case, we thoroughly reviewed them, and we believe this decision best protects our users."
With its reversal, Apple joined a growing list of corporations that are trying to navigate the fraught political situation between China and Hong Kong, where antigovernment protests have unfolded for months.
That minefield was evident this week when an executive of the N.B.A.'s Houston Rockets tweeted his support of the Hong Kong protests. The tweet prompted a backlash from the Chinese authorities, leading to apologies by the Rockets and ultimately the cancellation of broadcasts of N.B.A. exhibition games in China, one of the N.B.A.'s largest markets.
Companies ranging from Marriott to United Airlines to Versace have also backtracked on perceived slights to the Chinese government in the past, such as customer surveys that suggested Taiwan was an independent nation. All the firms are balancing the enormous economic opportunity in China, with its 1.4 billion consumers, with the negative public image of capitulating to an authoritarian government.
[Here's how Hong Kong's protests have evolved into a broader pushback against Beijing .]
No multinational company arguably has as much at stake in China as Apple, which assembles nearly all its products there and counts the country as its No. 3 market after the United States and Europe. It tallied nearly $ 44 billion in sales in the greater China region, which includes Taiwan and Hong Kong, in the year that ended June 30. Apple's stock price often rises or falls depending on how it is performing in China.
Mr. Cook has become a deft diplomat in China. He has traveled there frequently and attended numerous Chinese government events. In recent months, he has argued for moderation in the trade war between the United States and China. While Mr. Cook regularly speaks out on political issues in the United States like gun control and immigration, he has largely remained silent on Chinese politics, including the clashes in Hong Kong.
In late 2017, Mr. Cook said at a conference that while he disagreed with some Chinese policies, Apple must comply with local laws.
"Each country in the world decides their laws and their regulations, and so your choice is: Do you participate? Or do you stand on the sideline and yell at how things should be?" he said. "You get in the arena, because nothing ever changes from the sideline."
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Maya Wang, a senior China researcher at Human Rights Watch in Hong Kong, said Apple's decision to remove the Hong Kong app would embolden the Chinese Communist Party.
"I think the party concludes from this that intimidation, harassment and pressure work for most people, in most places," she said.
A Twitter account that claimed to be run by the developer of HKmap.live said in a message on Wednesday that Apple's reasoning for the app's removal -- that protesters were using it to attack the police -- was false.
"That is ridiculous," said the person running the account, who declined to provide a name. The person shared a message that Apple sent explaining the removal. In the notice, the company cited App Store policies that apps must comply with local laws and must not "solicit, promote or encourage criminal activity or clearly reckless behavior." The note was signed: "App Store Review."
Supporters of the app have argued that it helps Hong Kong residents avoid clashes between the police and protesters. The app "is used by passer-by, protesters, journalist, tourist and even pro-government supporters," the HKmap.live Twitter account later tweeted, calling the removal "clearly a political decision to suppress freedom and human right."
The Twitter account said Google had not removed the app from the marketplace for Android devices. The account said the iPhone app had been downloaded more than 100,000 times and the Android app more than 50,000 times.
The app shows a map of Hong Kong with updates from users on the location of the police, their water cannons and safe zones, among other things. Apple initially rejected the app for enabling people to evade the police, the app's Twitter account said last week. Several days later, the account tweeted that Apple had reversed course. It soon became the top free app in Hong Kong, according to the app-data firm Sensor Tower, and criticism from mainland China began.
After the People's Daily editorial, a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that "anyone with a conscience and a sense of justice" should boycott the app.
Charles Mok, a pro-democracy lawmaker in Hong Kong, said on Thursday that he had sent a letter to Mr. Cook saying HKmap.live helped people avoid the protests.
"We Hong Kongers will definitely look closely at whether Apple chooses to uphold its commitment to free expression and other basic human rights, or become an accomplice for Chinese censorship and oppression," he wrote.
In the United States, Senator Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, tweeted that Apple had told him that its initial rejection of the app was a mistake. "Looks like the Chinese censors have had a word with them since," he said. "Who is really running Apple? Tim Cook or Beijing?"
Apple has made other moves that appeared to appease the Chinese government. It recently removed the Taiwanese flag emoji from iPhone keyboards in certain areas, including Hong Kong.
On Sept. 30, Apple pulled the app of the news organization Quartz from the App Store in China, Quartz said. The news organization, which has covered the Hong Kong protests, said Apple had sent it a vague notice about removing its app "because it includes content that is illegal in China."
Zach Seward, Quartz's chief executive, said in a statement, "We abhor this kind of government censorship of the internet, and have great coverage of how to get around such bans around the world," and included a link to its articles about software designed to dodge censorship.
Apple declined to comment on the Quartz app on Wednesday and did not respond to a request regarding the Taiwanese flag emoji.
Apple has removed other apps in China that it allows elsewhere, including The New York Times app and some services that enabled Chinese users to circumvent the government's internet restrictions.
Apple has long prided itself on how every app in its App Store is approved by one of its employees, unlike Google's largely automated approach for Android apps. Apps that pose tricky policy questions are deliberated during weekly meetings of senior executives, led by Phil Schiller, an executive who heads the App Store. That group decided to remove the HKmap.live app, said a person familiar with the decision who declined to be named because the process was confidential.
Separately, Google this week removed a mobile game, The Revolution of Our Times I, which allowed users to play as Hong Kong protesters. Google said it had pulled the app from the Android app store worldwide because it violated its policy that bars "developers from capitalizing on sensitive events."
The developer, who declined to be named, said in an email that he or she donated 80 percent of the app's revenues to a group supporting the Hong Kong protests.
A Google spokesman said the company had decided to remove it during regular reviews of Android apps. He said Google hadn't heard from the Chinese government or the Hong Kong police about it.

Texto completo: A series of internal State Department emails reflect diplomats' frustration with the unexpected freeze on funding that Congress had already approved.
WASHINGTON -- American diplomats who had pushed for the Trump administration to restore security funding to Ukraine were advised by the White House to play down the release of the money when it was finally approved, documents show.
"Keep moving, people, nothing to see here ..." Brad Freden, the State Department's acting deputy assistant secretary overseeing issues in Europe and Eurasia, wrote in a Sept. 12 email obtained by The New York Times.
He said the National Security Council would not publicly announce that $ 141 million in State Department assistance was being restored after being held up in what the White House described as a normal review.
The money is now at the heart of an impeachment inquiry by House Democrats into whether President Trump withheld a total of $ 391 million in funding as he sought damaging information on his political opponents from Ukraine's newly elected leader.
A series of previously unreported internal State Department emails reflect diplomats' frustration with the unexpected freeze on funding that Congress had already approved.
"We realize the strain this puts on posts and your ability to conclude grants and carry out programs," Jim Kulikowski, the State Department's regional assistance coordinator, wrote in an Aug. 5 email.
"We currently await further guidance and will provide you with an update as soon as we know about next steps," Mr. Kulikowski wrote in the message, which was sent to dozens of State Department employees, including diplomats in Kiev and in countries across Eastern Europe.
The email did not explain why the assistance was being withheld.
Trump administration officials said the funding had been frozen weeks earlier, before a July 25 telephone call between Mr. Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. During that call, Mr. Zelensky said he was grateful for the security assistance that the United States had supplied to Ukraine, and made clear that he hoped to receive more.
A Ukrainian official has said Mr. Zelensky's government did not learn of the funding delay until about a month later. The White House has said the review merely sought to ensure the money was properly spent.
But the freeze irritated diplomats who questioned whether it was tied to Mr. Trump's demands for Ukraine to investigate two politically fraught allegations: a widely debunked conspiracy theory about election tampering in 2016 and corruption at an energy company that employed the younger son of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. There is no evidence that the Bidens were involved in wrongdoing.
Once the decision to freeze the aid became public in late August, a bipartisan group of lawmakers pressed the administration to reverse course, saying that holding up the money sent the wrong signal as a new Ukrainian government confronted a continuing military threat from Russia.
William B. Taylor Jr., the top American envoy in Kiev, wrote in a Sept. 9 text message that it was "crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign." In response, Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union, wrote that "the President has been crystal clear: no quid pro quo's of any kind."
Mr. Sondland then suggested that the conversation continue by telephone, rather than by text. On Tuesday, the Trump administration blocked Mr. Sondland from testifying to the House in the impeachment inquiry.
Officials were informed that the freeze had been reversed -- and the $ 141 million in foreign military financing would be released -- in a Sept. 12 email from the White House that was then sent around the State Department.
"Apparently, and I don't have full visibility, decision made last night," Mr. Kulikowski wrote.
Mr. Freden said the Ukrainian government had already been told that the funds were forthcoming. But he urged State Department employees not to announce the reversal.
"Ukrainians are aware, but N.S.C. said that in the spirit of the 'hold' being a normal review, there will be no public announcement that it has been lifted," he wrote, referring to the president's National Security Council.
Mr. Taylor said he planned to announce it in Ukraine.
"I will inform President Zelensky as soon as he is out of a meeting," Mr. Taylor wrote to Mr. Freden. "We then intend to make it public here."
Mr. Freden responded in minutes.
"In terms of public messaging, N.S.C. is deliberately treating both the hold and its lifting as administrative matters," he wrote. "My advice is to keep your public messaging low-key as well."
"Good advice -- thanks," Mr. Taylor emailed back.
In an email on Wednesday, Mr. Taylor declined to comment. The State Department did not respond on Wednesday to several requests for comment.
Some senior State Department officials readily volunteered information about the $ 141 million in aid as it was finally approved.
At a breakfast meeting with reporters on Sept. 12, R. Clarke Cooper, the assistant secretary of state for political military affairs, said that department officials were notifying lawmakers that morning that the State Department's portion of aid to Ukraine was moving forward.
He told reporters to anticipate other notifications to Congress -- specifically $ 250 million in military aid from the Pentagon, assistance the Defense Department announced later in the day would also move ahead. Lawmakers from both parties quickly announced the same day that the aid had been released.

COAL COMPANIES’ CLIMATE FIGHT COMPLICATES EPA’S POWER RULE DEFENSE: Coal mining companies and free market think tanks aren’t letting it go.
They want to pursue the legal fight over whether the Environmental Protection Agency can regulate power plants’ carbon emissions. And they’re holding on, even as many of their former utility and other industry allies have moved past it and the EPA doesn’t seem to want to engage, at least for now.
The EPA now, in the same lawsuit, has to defend its replacement to the Obama-era Clean Power Plan against environmental groups for being too weak — and against coal companies and free market groups for being too stringent.
The dual-track lawsuit is complicating what the EPA wants the court to think is a relatively simple legal decision, legal experts tell Abby.
The EPA wants the federal courts to rubber stamp its rule — and its interpretation of how much the Clean Air Act allows the agency to regulate power plants’ carbon — quickly.
In fact, the agency has asked the D.C. Circuit to hear oral arguments in the lawsuit in April, just nine months after the suit against the EPA’s Clean Power Plan replacement was filed. That means the EPA could have a decision from the court before the 2020 election.
It’s a schedule environmental attorneys tell Abby would be incredibly quick and unprecedented in the legal world, particularly for a case with so many parties and so many issues at stake.
And coal companies’ lingering fight makes a logistics headache, which could slow down the case: It’s putting environmental groups and Democratic-led states on both sides of the lawsuit.
Even as they’re challenging the EPA’s replacement rule for being too weak, states and environmental groups are intervening to support the agency’s authority to regulate power plants’ emissions at all.
Coal mining companies and free-market groups say the EPA can’t regulate power plants’ carbon emissions, because of statutory prohibitions and because it hasn’t proven those emissions are enough of a problem.
“EPA has never found domestic coal power plant greenhouse gas emissions cause or contribute significantly to air pollution that is reasonably anticipated to endanger public health or welfare,” coal mining giant Westmoreland wrote in a legal filing late Monday.
Environmental groups say they’re intervening because they don’t want to leave just the Trump EPA to defend the agency’s authority.
“When you have an agency that refuses to even say climate change in its rulemakings, you don’t want to assume they will give a full-throated defense of their authority under the Clean Air Act,” Jay Duffy, an attorney with the Clean Air Task Force, told Abby.
“We wouldn’t want to rest on our laurels and not make sure that a really vigorous defense of the mission of the Clean Air Act was put before the Court,” he added.
It’s telling that the EPA didn’t try to go after its authority: The EPA replacement rule is much narrower than the Obama administration’s, but the agency doesn’t give up its climate authority completely as some of Trump’s coal industry supporters would have liked.
And many in industry who’d challenged the EPA’s authority before have let that argument go in favor of a rule they see as more reasonable.
“EPA’s out to make law here,” Joseph Goffman, a former EPA air official during the Obama administration, told Abby. That law, he added, is to tie the hands of a future administration, not to do away with the agency’s authority completely.

PROTECTING CUSTOMERS FROM WILDFIRES BY CUTTING THEIR POWER: Pacific Gas & Electric is “proactively” shutting off power in portions of 34 counties in northern and central California starting today amid severe wind conditions. The blackouts could impact electric service for nearly 800,000 customers, the utility said Tuesday.
“We understand the effects this event will have on our customers and appreciate the public’s patience as we do what is necessary to keep our communities safe and reduce the risk of wildfire,” Michael Lewis, PG&Es senior vice president of electric operations, said in a statement.
PG&E’s power shutdown comes as the utility is grappling with its future amid what many have called the first “climate change bankruptcy.” The utility filed in January for bankruptcy protections as it faced billions in liability claims due to deadly wildfires in the state.
WARREN AND MARKEY INTRODUCE BILL TO HOBBLE LNG EXPORTS: Democrat Senators Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey released legislation Tuesday to ban infrastructure used to export liquified natural gas.
The legislation would bar the construction of natural gas compressor stations that facilitate gas exports.
Warren has been among the most aggressive presidential candidates in vowing to wean the U.S. off fossil fuels. She has pledged to end fracking for natural gas to have fossil-fuel-free electricity by 2035.
Markey has moved to show his climate bonafides as he faces a primary challenge from Joe Kennedy as he seeks re-election. He introduced the Green New Deal resolution in the Senate and has also authored legislation that would reimpose the crude oil export ban lifted by Congress in 2015.
WARREN UNVEILS ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE PLAN: Warren unveiled her latest in a series of plans to combat climate change Wednesday, this one focused on environmental justice.
“Industrial pollution has been concentrated in communities of color due to decades of discrimination and racism—and a system that puts corporate profits before people. We need big, structural change, focused on and led by members of those communities,” Warren said in a series of Twitter posts about her plan, which she posted on Medium.
She pledges to direct one-third of her climate investments into the most vulnerable communities on the “frontlines of climate change,” which she says would funnel at least $1 trillion into these areas over the next decade. She’d impose “steep fines” on corporate polluters, particularly in cases of environmental discrimination, which Warren would reinvest in areas that suffered damage.
Warren also wants to provide job training and guaranteed wage and benefit parity for fossil fuel workers transitioning into new industries.
COAL COMPANIES SPARED FOR NOW FROM OBAMA-ERA ROYALTIES RULE: A federal district court judge in Wyoming ruled late Tuesday coal companies temporarily won’t have to comply with the regulation — which alters how fees on coal, oil, and natural gas extracted on federal lands are calculated.
The 2016 royalties rule has been caught up in litigation for years. The Interior Department had formally repealed the rule in 2017, but a federal judge in 2019 sided with California, New Mexico, and several environmental groups to overturn the repeal.
The pause for coal companies now comes in large part because Wyoming Judge Scott Skavdahl wrote he shares industry’s concerns that Obama-era changes to the fees could be unlawful. The burden on coal companies for having to comply with the rule, particularly if it’s ultimately struck down, would be “immense,” Skavdahl wrote.
Oil and gas companies aren’t so lucky, though. Skavdahl wrote he didn’t share the same concerns for the oil and gas royalties, and those companies will still have to comply with the Obama rule as it makes its way through the courts.
EXPERT PANEL SPURNED BY EPA TO MEET ANYWAY: EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler disbanded the panel last year, despite objections from the EPA’s own science advisers that they wouldn’t have enough resources to complete a review of air pollutants’ health impacts on time.
That review will ultimately shape the EPA’s decision about whether to strengthen or alter federal air quality limits for fine particle pollution, which EPA and other scientists have linked to respiratory and heart problems.
The disbanded panel of scientists, however, has reconvened and will meet Thursday and Friday to examine the latest science and whether the current federal air quality standards are strong enough.
30 CITIES’ EMISSIONS REACH THEIR HIGHEST POINT: Analysis finds that 30 of the world’s largest cities — including major U.S. cities like New York, Los Angeles, Boston, Chicago, and Washington, D.C. — have seen a peak in their emissions, according to the climate group C40 Cities.
The analysis comes as mayors meet in Copenhagen for a climate summit hosted by C40. While there, a coalition of more than 90 mayors announced support for a “global Green New Deal” alongside other activists, including New York Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
However, the list of global cities peaking emissions centers on those in the Western world. Notably absent from the list so far are cities in developing nations like China and India where emissions are poised to continue to grow in the near-term.

A welcome, traditional production of Chekhov's classic 'Cherry Orchard' at CT Rep through Oct. 13 Review

Texto completo: It's nice to see a solid, straightforward production of "The Cherry Orchard" for a change. Connecticut Repertory Theatre's traditional approach proves that sometimes a play speaks so directly to our times that it needs no tweaking at all.
When Yale Repertory Theatre did the Chekhov classic in 2005, it shifted the second half from the 19th century to the 21st. A 1974 Hartford Stage production was criticized for its in-the-round staging. The New York Times declared that the Long Wharf's 1983 rendition had a "a senseless set" in the fourth act."
Those versions all had their merits. New perspectives and interpretations and attitudes are necessary.
But "The Cherry Orchard," with its themes of power lust, breakdowns in communications and a crumbling social structure, comes through loud and clear. It doesn't need reimagining or rethinking or underlining or rearranging.
Connecticut Rep uses a conventional ornate drawing room set design by Zach Broome and the same snappy Jean-Claude Van Itallie translation that the Long Wharf used 36 years ago.
One major directorial flourish is apparent. Chekhov famously called his play a comedy, though its story concerns unrequited love, loss of property, cruelty, neglect, disrespect, self-destructive impulses, reckless frivolity and class warfare. None of the characters get the things they most desire. Watching the train wrecks of lives can be a saddening experience.
Van Itallie's translation has a light touch, inserting words like "nincompoop," but director John Miller-Stephany guarantees the comedy label by adding pratfalls and mishaps and showing the characters to be impossibly full of themselves. Everyone talks fast, they don't shut up, and they willfully ignore each other. Funny.
Youthful actors drive this comical approach home. The cast is the accustomed CT Rep mix of student actors and a couple of older professionals who help steer the style.
In this case, the pros - accomplished New York and regional theater actors Caralyn Kozlowski and Mark Light-Orr - are playing Lubov Andreyevna Ranevskaya and Leonid Andreyevich Gayev. They are the play's old guard, the sister and brother who've let the family fortune slip through their fingers and are now losing their beloved home and the land around it. The estate includes a gorgeous cherry orchard (not seen but much talked about), a metaphor for useless beauty in the incipient Industrial Age.
The world-weary Kozlowski and thin, bearded Light-Orr set a high level of disillusionment and impatience that the other characters play off of. This includes wide-eyed children, young romantics, snarky servants, needy neighbors and others who hang around the house wondering how their lives turned out this way.
Stand-outs among the students in the cast are Sierra Kane as the governess Charlotta Ivanovna, who's wonderfully blasé and severe even when performing magic tricks, and Sebastian Nagpal, who brings humor and humanity to the ancient servant Firs.
One could make the usual quibbles about students having to act outside their age range. But most of the characters in "The Cherry Orchard," we realize, are not defined by their age. They're defined by their neuroses, their unreached potentials and the fact they've hung around this house for way too long. That goes for masters and servants alike. Class issues abound, but nobody is emotionally better off than anyone else.
The old-fashioned fashions and period furniture give heft to this "Cherry Orchard." They suggest that material objects are being taken for granted, then lost altogether. So are the people. So many things are lost in this stone cold classic: innocence, wealth, honor, security, romance.
"The Cherry Orchard" holds up a little too well.
THE CHERRY ORCHARDruns through Oct. 13 at the Harriet S. Jorgensen Theatre, 2132 Hillside Road on the University of Connecticut campus in Storrs. Performances are Wednesday and Thursday at 7:30 p.m.; Friday at 8 p.m.; Saturday at 2 and 8 p.m.; and Sunday at 2 p.m. now. Tickets are $10 to $33. 860-486-2113,crt.uconn.edu.

White House Blacklist Hits China for Surveillance

Texto completo: In blacklisting surveillance companies, the United States is the first major government to punish China for its crackdown on Muslims.
SHANGHAI -- The world has largely sat by for nearly two years as China detained more than one million people, mostly Muslims and members of minority ethnic groups, in internment camps to force them to embrace the Communist Party.
Now, the Trump administration is taking the first public steps by a major world government toward punishing Beijing. In doing so, it is opening up a new front in the already worsening relationship between Washington and Beijing: human rights and the dystopian world of digital surveillance.
Trump administration officials on Monday placed eight Chinese companies and a number of police departments on a blacklist that forbids them to buy American-made technology like microchips, software and other vital components. The companies are at the vanguard of China's surveillance and artificial intelligence ambitions, with many of them selling increasingly sophisticated systems used by governments to track people.
The White House cited their business in Xinjiang, a region of northwestern China that is home to a largely Muslim minority group known as the Uighurs. The United States government says more than one million ethnic Uighurs and other minorities have been locked in detention camps there.
On Tuesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced visa restrictions on Chinese officials believed to be involved in the detention or abuse of Muslim ethnic minorities.
The announcements suggest that the Trump administration is increasingly willing to listen to the advice of American officials focused on the strategic challenges posed by China and who are concerned about its human rights abuses, even if President Trump himself never seems to pay much attention to those.
The restrictions were announced just two days before American and Chinese officials were set to begin a 13th round of trade talks, most likely putting a chill over the negotiations.
More broadly, the White House, in its blacklist announcement, signaled a willingness to take aim at China's technological dreams. China has plowed billions of dollars into companies developing advanced hardware and software to catch up with the United States. Some of the companies added to the list on Monday are among the world's most valuable artificial intelligence start-ups.
Much of that technology -- including facial recognition and computer vision -- can be used to track people. That includes smartphone tracking, voice-pattern identification and systems that track individuals across cities through powerful cameras. Washington officials have grown increasingly worried about China's ambitions to export its systems elsewhere, including places known for human rights abuses.
"This is an important first step in making some of the companies that have benefited the most from the re-education system in Xinjiang feel the consequences of their actions," said Darren Byler, an anthropologist at the University of Washington who studies the plight of the Uighurs.
He said the move signaled that abuse of minority groups in Xinjiang "is real and justifies a political and economic response."
It is also a potentially groundbreaking use of a powerful tool that the American government typically uses against terrorists. The Chinese companies and police departments were placed on what is called an entity list, which forbids them to buy sensitive American exports unless Washington grants American companies specific permission to sell to them.
Use of the entity list over a human rights issue may be a first, said Julian Ku, a professor of constitutional and international law at Hofstra University.
"As far as I know, it was the first time Commerce explicitly cited human rights as a foreign policy interest of the U.S. for purposes of export controls," he said, referring to the Department of Commerce, which manages the entity lists. "This is not an implausible reading of the regulations, but it is new and has potentially very broad applicability."
Geng Shuang, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, said in a briefing on Tuesday that the White House was using human rights as an excuse to punish Chinese companies. Many of the companies offer a wide array of products outside of surveillance, including medical tools that diagnose tumors, automatic translation services and even social media filters that slim the waist.
"This goes against the basic principles of international relations, it interferes in China's internal affairs, and it goes against China's national security," he said. "There is no human rights issue in Xinjiang."
The Chinese Commerce Ministry urged the United States to take the 28 companies and organizations off the entity list as soon as possible.
The immediate effect on the Chinese companies is likely to be minimal, because many have stockpiled essential supplies, but they could feel increasing pain if they stay on the blacklist for months or years.
Perhaps more important, it can put a cloud over the companies' reputations, limiting their sales in the United States or elsewhere and keeping them from hiring the world's best technology talent.
"The U.S. move today puts up a big roadblock on the road to internationalization," said Matt Sheehan, a fellow at MacroPolo, the think tank of the Paulson Institute.
"Most global technology companies are setting up labs abroad, partnering with the best universities around the world and looking to recruit top talent from everywhere," he said. "That all just got a lot harder now that they're marked with the scarlet letter of the entity list."
The move followed more than a year of internal debate over how to punish China for its persecution of Muslims in Xinjiang.
Senior officials on the National Security Council and in the State Department have pushed for the use of the entity list to target Chinese companies supplying surveillance technology to the security forces in Xinjiang. They have also urged Mr. Trump to approve sanctions that would penalize Chinese officials and companies involved in the abuses.
But top American trade negotiators, including the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, have cautioned against policies that would upset trade talks. Mr. Trump has said he wants to reach a trade deal with China.
Until now, other top officials, most notably Mr. Pompeo and Vice President Mike Pence, have denounced China's policies in Xinjiang but not enacted punitive measures. This month, American customs officials blocked products from a Chinese garment maker in Xinjiang, but they had held off on stronger action.
The Chinese companies on the list include Hikvision, a major maker of surveillance cameras, and the well-funded artificial intelligence start-ups SenseTime and Megvii.
SenseTime said it set "high ethical standards for A.I. technologies," while Megvii said it required "clients not to weaponize our technology or solutions or use them for illegal purposes." It added that it had generated no revenue from within Xinjiang in the first half of 2019.
New York Times reporting showed that four of the companies on the list -- Yitu, Hikvision, Megvii and SenseTime -- helped build systems across China that sought to use facial recognition to automate the detection of Uighurs.
Government procurement documents, company marketing materials and official government releases tied all eight companies to various business operations and sales in Xinjiang. The many local Xinjiang police bureaus on the list buy commercial American technology like Intel microchips and Microsoft Windows software, according to procurement documents.
Mr. Trump's next step could be imposing sanctions on specific Chinese officials working in Xinjiang. Among the officials discussed is Chen Quanguo, a Politburo member who is the party chief in Xinjiang and an architect of the system of internment camps and surveillance.
The blacklist action is a sign that strategic China hawks have become even more influential in the administration in recent weeks.
Matthew Pottinger, the senior director for Asia and an architect of policies aimed at countering China, was promoted to deputy national security adviser last month. Earlier, Robert O'Brien, the administration's top hostage negotiator, replaced John R. Bolton as national security adviser. Mr. O'Brien has written that China poses an enormous challenge to the United States.
"This Xinjiang package has been in the works now for months," said Samm Sacks, a cybersecurity policy fellow at New America, a think tank. "So the fact that it comes out now just ahead of the next round of trade talks sends a signal from those in the administration who want no deal."
"So far, Beijing has been quite measured in its response to the U.S. government," she said. "That probably is over."

Texto completo: Last week, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said his chamber would have "no choice" but to hold a trial on whether to remove President Donald Trump from office if the House votes to impeach.
But in a new campaign ad on Facebook, the Kentucky Republican makes clear that any impeachment attempt will fail as long as he remains in charge of the Senate.
"Nancy Pelosi's in the clutches of a left-wing mob. They finally convinced her to impeach the president," McConnell says directly to the camera in a 17-second video.
"All of you know your Constitution. The way that impeachment stops is a Senate majority with me as majority leader.
"But I need your help," he adds, standing in front of a picture of an elephant. "Please contribute before the deadline."
The McConnell campaign, according to Facebook's "Ad Library," started running the digital ad Sept. 30, a few days after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced an impeachment inquiry over whether Trump improperly pressured Ukraine's president to investigate political rival and possible 2020 opponent Joe Biden.
The ad features the same video, but McConnell's team has paired the video with different captions that all are mostly focused on the topic of impeachment.
"Your conservative Senate Majority is the ONLY thing stopping Nancy Pelosi from impeaching President Trump. Donate & help us keep it!" one caption reads.
McConnell campaign manager Kevin Golden told The Courier Journal the impeachment inquiry is energizing the Senate leader's supporters.
"Few issues energize conservative voters like liberal overreach," Golden said in a statement.
"And the Democrats latest outrageous attempt to impeach President Trump has activated our base to new heights."
Another caption from Team Mitch goes after Pelosi's fellow California Democrat, Rep. Adam Schiff, who chairs the House Intelligence Committee.
"BREAKING: Adam Schiff LIED. His office secretly coordinated with the source of this laughable impeachment inquiry," the caption reads. "Help me stop it."
That caption appears to reference The New York Times' reporting that Schiff received an early account of the whistleblower's complaint regarding Trump's phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
The complaint from the anonymous whistleblower, reportedly a CIA officer, led to the White House releasing a summary of the July phone call between Trump and Zelensky.
According to the call's summary, Trump told Zelensky to reopen an investigation into a Ukrainian energy company connected to Biden's son, Hunter.
McConnell reportedly told the White House to release the transcript of the phone call, something that McConnell and his spokespeople have not commented on.
On Thursday, Trump added further fuel to the fire by telling reporters that China should also investigate the Bidens.
The president also claimed Thursday that McConnell put out a statement referring to the president's phone call with the president of Ukraine as "the most innocent phone call (transcript) that I've read."
McConnell's office has not responded to questions about Trump's assertion, though the Senate leader dismissed criticism of the call and said it is "laughable to think this is anywhere close to an impeachable offense."
On the Senate floor, McConnell has defended his record of standing up for Ukraine, especially against the Russian government.
Democrats and some Republican critics of Trump have said the president's requests to Ukraine and China are a blatant attempt to have a foreign power interfere with next year's election.
Trump has denied any wrongdoing.
It would take a simple majority of the House (218 votes) to submit articles of impeachment to the Senate.
A trial would then be held in the Senate, where it would take at least two-thirds (or 67 votes) of the chamber to convict Trump and remove him from office.
The chief justice of the Supreme Court presides over the trial. But as majority leader, McConnell would have some power in setting up ground rules for a trial, including timing.
"So I would have no choice but to take it up," McConnell told CNBC last week, referring to the impeachment trial. "How long you're on it is a whole different matter."
The new campaign ad from McConnell shows the Senate leader sees the impeachment matter as a chance to raise funds for his 2020 reelection campaign.
Amy McGrath, a former Marine Corps pilot and one of several Democrats in Kentucky vying to unseat McConnell in 2020, endorsed the impeachment inquiry last week.
McGrath has also urged McConnell to show "patriotic courage" and get to the truth of the allegations in the whistleblower complaint.

President Trump lacks both a legal and a moral compass

Texto completo: President Trump lacks both a legal and a moral compass
At a time of such division and conflict in our country, often sparked by President Donald Trump, I read a New York Times article by Michael D. Shear and Julie Hirschfeld Davis headlined “Shoot Migrants’ Legs, Build Alligator Moat: Behind Trump’s Ideas for Border.”
It crystallizes both my concern for our country and my anger at our president. Shear and Davis wrote: “After publicly suggesting that soldiers shoot migrants if they threw rocks, the president backed off when his staff told him that was illegal. But later in a meeting, aides recalled, he suggested that they shoot migrants in the legs to slow them down. That’s not allowed either, they told him.”
I wondered what sort of individual, indeed, what kind of president, would possibly suggest such gratuitous violence against desperate, poor human beings seeking a better life?
We do not yet know the consequences of the impeachment inquiry. But surely we know, at the very least, a person who would urge such actions along our borders should not occupy the office of the president.
We should not have to depend only upon the president’s aides for a legal and moral compass for our president.

Things change in 21 years
Twenty-one years ago, congressional representatives voted to impeach President Bill Clinton for lying about sex.
Now, Republicans argue that President Donald Trump’s offenses aren’t impeachable? Either that or they are silent.
Disgraceful.

Gary Busey Is Playing God. Seriously.

Texto completo: At 75, the actor is trying his hand at musical theater in an Off Broadway show called "Only Human." It kind of makes sense.
Describing an interview with Gary Busey is nearly impossible. On one hand, the experience is exactly what you might think: Frenetic. Unfocused. The works. His sentences are sprinkled with what he calls "Buseyisms": acronyms he's spelled out for decades that hint at his philosophy on life. B.I.B.L.E., for example, is "Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth," and partially the title of his memoir.
On the other hand, Mr. Busey, 75, still manages to surprise you. He came by The New York Times recently to discuss "Only Human," a new Off Broadway musical in which Mr. Busey plays the role of God. The show, which begins previews Tuesday and opens Oct. 21 at Theater at St. Clements in Manhattan, is a contemporary workplace comedy featuring a showdown between Jesus and Lucifer, who battle over their new creation: Earth.
While this may seem like an odd fit, Mr. Busey said he hasn't been as excited about a part since his Oscar-nominated title role in 1978's "The Buddy Holly Story." And why not? He has been a musician for decades, and counts several A-list musicians as friends, including Bonnie Raitt.
But Mr. Busey, who studied drama at Oklahoma State University, fell into acting and became a mainstay in television and film. Substance abuse and a serious motorcycle accident in 1988 derailed his life and career.
In the last 20 years, he's received more attention for eccentric appearances on reality television shows like "Celebrity Apprentice" and "Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew." In 2016, He did a two week stint in the Off Broadway murder mystery "Perfect Crime."
Mr. Busey discussed the new show and, really, whatever else he wanted, alongside his fiancé, Steffanie Sampson. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
You've played so many roles in film and television. Why does God in particular hold such meaning for you?
O. K. On December 4, 1988, I went off a Harley-Davidson without a helmet. Hit my skull on the curb, split my skull off the side, knocked a hole that big, and I passed away after brain surgery and went to the other side. The spiritual realm. The supernatural, and was surrounded by angels. Angels were big balls of light. Not quite as big as a volleyball. They're moving. They're breathing. They're shining. They're all different colors. They were all around my essence.
And three of the angels -- woop, woop, woop -- came up to me, and I felt love, protection and trust like I have never felt on Earth. One of them talked to me in an androgynous voice and said, "What you're doing is wonderful. You're going in a great direction. But because of your responsibility to mankind, you need to look for help in the spiritual realm. You may come with us now, or you may return to your body and continue to your destiny. It's your choice."
Do you feel that you were destined for this role?
Dustin Hoffman?
No, sorry. Destined.
I'm just kidding. I don't know, but yes. Yes! I do know. Yes. Of course, yes. What happened, Jesse Murphy, the producer, he saw my book cover, and he saw the halo over my head. He said, "Ah ha! I found God."
Is doing theater fun for you?
If you can't enjoy something, why do it? I enjoy everything in life. My motto is giving love with fun. And the word fun -- F.U.N. -- stands for Finally Understanding Nothing. And that's fine.
Give me a sense of how spiritual you are. Do you believe in God?
It's not believing. It's understanding the power that is here. The energy of the creator lives its essential point of existence. That's where all life begins. And all life begins before time began. It's a beautiful flow of loving energy that creates wonderful and beautiful things.
You live in Malibu. Do you like New York?
I love New York. Oh my gosh. I've been all around the world making movies and doing tours. This city is the city that never sleeps. When it does, it sleeps with its eyes open because you don't know it's asleep when it is.
What's the first thing you do when you wake up in the morning?
I have some vitamins. Then I stretch. I put on a hearing aid. Put on my watch. This morning, I did great. You'll be very happy to hear this. I took a shower. I got scrubbed down [points to Ms. Sampson]. Washed my own hair. All because I have a leader in my house that wears a dress and pants. Right there, Steffanie Sampson Busey.
What haven't you done yet that you'd like to try?
Music. Producing and write. Do music with my friends. Release it. And also direct a movie. Me in it. Jake in it. My 48-year-old son who is doing great. Has been since he's five. He played my son in "Straight Time" with Dustin Hoffman. No acting required.
Would you like to do more theater?
Oh yes. That's how I started. I was playing football in high school, starting center. I was also very funny. Football team got together and said, "Busey, go out for the play." I said, "What? I'm not doing that, man. I'd be a sissy." "No, you're funny. We dare you to go out for the play." So I went out for the play. It was "South Pacific." I got a part. People laughed at me. I loved it.
Are you nervous for previews?
The word nervous is not in my vocabulary.

Lightning Bolts Over Broadway

Texto completo: The creators of "The Lightning Thief" musical may have added songs to the Percy Jackson story, but they're not about to make the movie's mistakes.
One thing the team behind "The Lightning Thief: The Percy Jackson Musical" wants to make abundantly clear: "Maybe you've heard of a movie with a similar title," the show's Twitter account warns. "We're not that."
It is not "The Lightning Thief," the 2010 film that Rotten Tomatoes granted a mediocre 49 percent -- or the sequel that scored even lower. The film that The New York Times called "flat and mechanical" with a title character who was "blandly appealing." The film that plunged Rick Riordan into despair.
"If I were intentionally trying to sabotage this project," Mr. Riordan wrote, "I doubt I could have done a better job than this script." He would know. He wrote the best-selling Percy Jackson series on which the film was (loosely) based.
So when the musical -- now in previews for an Oct. 16 opening at the Longacre Theater -- started coming together several years later, the actors and creative team got the message. They read the books. They reread the books. When faced with a question of what would happen next, who would say what, how to make something happen onstage -- they went back to the books.
"It's been fun to see the transition from the early, 'Really? The movie didn't work and now they're making a musical?' to, 'Oh, this is made by people who love and understand what we love and understand about these stories,"' said Joe Tracz, who wrote the musical's script.
The film made the characters older and lost the story's adolescent spirit in the process. The musical returns to the eccentricity and silliness that got readers on board in the first place.
For newcomers, the opening number lays it out point blank: The Greek gods are real. They have kids. And being their kid -- chased by monsters, ignored by all-powerful parents running the universe, put into constant mortal peril -- tends to suck. (Angsty teens on Broadway -- sound familiar?)
Percy Jackson, a son of Poseidon, is one of those kids. Having a learning disability and getting kicked out of six schools, as it turns out, are side effects of his mind being hard-wired for battle and reading ancient Greek.
He winds up at Camp Half-Blood, a safe-haven-slash-summer-camp for children of absentee deities, and embarks on a cross-country quest with the tough, brainy Annabeth and his goat-legged satyr pal Grover to recover Zeus's stolen lightning bolt and save his mortal mom.
Social media-fueled teen musicals remain a gamble on the big stage of Broadway. "Be More Chill" -- also written by Mr. Tracz and directed by Stephen Brackett -- closed after several months, while "Dear Evan Hansen" has maintained its popularity for nearly three years.
"The Lightning Thief" played to just over half capacity last week, but the commitment to the original story seems to at least be paying off with fans. Wherever the show goes, a mini Comic Con of Percy Jackson fans follows, usually clad in the story's signature orange Camp Half-Blood T-shirts -- or, for at least one performance, furry homemade goat legs. (The show was featured at a session last Thursday at New York Comic Con itself, too.)
Mr. Riordan is known to avoid seeing adaptations of his work, and he isn't planning on visiting the Longacre during the musical's run, his publicist said. But his fans -- from middle schoolers picking up the books for the first time to millennials who still reread the young adult novels as not-so-young adults -- will find plenty that registers as familiar.
The first and last lines Percy has in the book are also the first and last lyrics he sings onstage, and our introduction to Annabeth -- "You drool when you sleep," she tells Percy -- remains the same. Destinations will be familiar, whether a Las Vegas hotel where time stands still or the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where Percy faces his first monster on a school field trip.
There are also smaller hints, Easter eggs hidden onstage for the eagle-eyed. Mr. D, for example -- the wine god Dionysus, whose punishment from Zeus in the novel includes an alcohol-free century -- takes enraged swigs of a Diet Coke, a small but notable nod to the source material.
Fidelity to the source has been a priority from the start, but it hasn't always been easy -- especially as Mr. Tracz and the composer, Rob Rokicki, first packed a 375-page novel into the initial one-hour production with TheaterWorksUSA in 2014.
The show was expanded to a full, two-act musical for a brief run Off Broadway in 2017; it then toured the country before returning, this time on Broadway, in September. (It is scheduled to play through Jan. 5, which includes the lucrative holiday season.)
Through the show's evolution, the minimalistic D.I.Y. aesthetic -- a necessity in the early stages, Mr. Brackett said -- has remained intact. In the book, Percy's sea-god parentage lets him unleash a stream of toilet water to wallop a rival. But onstage, pressurized waterworks aren't easy to come by -- so Percy pelts her with a speedily unraveling, leaf-blower-propelled roll of toilet paper instead.
"It's really capitalizing on having the audience use their imagination to fill in the blanks in the storytelling, which is one of the things that I thought was so beautiful about reading the novel," Mr. Brackett said.
For fans still feeling burned by the movie, that spirit is a reassurance -- a restoration of what the film lost. A 2014 New York Times review of the one-hour version said the show struck "a tone that's sassy though not snarky, and energetic without being hectic."
Chris McCarrell, who plays Percy, said the stage script refuses to let him or the other actors take themselves too seriously, which is appropriate.
"The magic of those books is the tone that does not waver the whole time," he said. "This is a mess of a 12-year-old trying to figure out what is happening, which I love. And I try to keep that alive in the musical, which is pretty easy to do."
The cardinal rule for the cast? "Don't show Stephen something if you don't want to put it in the show," said Kristin Stokes, who has played Annabeth since the show's inception.
"Trust me," said Jorrel Javier, who plays both Grover and Mr. D. "If the choice that you made just happened to coincide with his vision, then sometimes you end up having to kick your leg to your face eight times a week."

Texto completo: Tuesday’s forecast for Shanghai is not terribly different from Los Angeles weather: sunny, low-70s, little chance of rain.
But even as the Lakers boarded a flight Monday morning bound for China, they knew they were about to fly into a storm.
Sunday’s news cycle was bombarded by reaction to a Friday tweet from Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey: “Fight For Freedom. Stand With Hong Kong.” The NBA is generally a league that is permissive about expressing personal views on social issues; the estimated hundreds of millions of NBA fans in China are apparently not. Subsequent fallout included Chinese businesses vowing to cut ties with the Rockets, former Houston star Yao Ming saying the Chinese Basketball Association would no longer work with them, and awkwardly worded statements from Rockets ownership and the NBA at large.
In the middle of the madness, the Lakers are flying to Shanghai and Shenzhen, two of the largest cities in the world for a pair of exhibition games with the Brooklyn Nets and a host of league events. What was initially planned as an innocent bit of diplomacy for a league that is extremely popular overseas could now have significantly higher stakes for both the Lakers and the NBA.
Outside of North America, it’s reasonable to say that China is by far the most important market for the NBA. The country of 1.4 billion people is basketball-crazed. According to numbers shared by the league: The CBA estimates that 300 million people play basketball at some level in the country. The NBA has had a dedicated office in China since 2008. Tencent, the league’s top media partner in China, estimates that nearly half a billion people watched NBA programming on their platforms – a figure that has tripled from the viewership just five years ago. It’s common to see Chinese-language reporters roaming locker rooms before and after games, and ESPN has a partnership with Tencent to get one-on-one postgame interviews with players as they walk off the court.
Many players understand the power of the Chinese market, and it’s common for players to tour Chinese cities for their shoe companies. LeBron James, for example, goes abroad virtually every summer.
“I’ve been able to go over there and I’ve always been welcomed with open arms,” he said last week. “They love the game of basketball. It started with Yao and Yi (Jianlian) and those guys over there. We want to make the game as popular as we can and show our appreciation by going overseas in China like we’re doing next week.”
While Chinese fans have a raucous following for both superstars and a handful of major franchises – of which the Lakers are definitely one – they showcase love for players at all levels. Lance Stephenson, who played for the Lakers last year before deciding to play in China this season, recently shared a video on Instagram of the doorman at his hotel mimicking his famous “air guitar” gesture.
Joe Young, who spent Summer League playing for the Lakers, played for Nanjing’s CBA team last season. When he first flew in, he remembers being greeted by hundreds – perhaps even a thousand – fans all bearing roses for him, a foreign player who went on to average 36 points per game for a franchise that hung around the bottom of the league standings. Toward the end of the season, Young didn’t like leaving his apartment for fear that he would be accosted in public by adoring fans.
“It’s just another level over there,” he said. “Those fans are crazy.”
But in light of the Morey incident, it seems that devotion has an uglier side to it: a hair-trigger for rebuking political discourse that puts China in an unfavorable light.
Morey’s tweet touched on a nerve that has been sensitive for months. Hong Kong is in the midst of protests of mainland China’s attempts to assert more control over the island that was a longtime British territory. A bill that would have allowed for extradition to mainland China sparked more than a million people to take to the streets in June to show their displeasure. Since, protesters and the Chinese government have had countless skirmishes, in which the New York Times estimated that some 2,000 canisters of tear canisters had been fired. Complicating the issue, many mainlanders feel that the legacy of Hong Kong is irrevocably tied to the country’s adversarial history with colonialism – Brooklyn Nets owner Joe Tsai tried to relate the context in a Facebook post on Sunday night.
Morey’s tweet was deleted shortly after it was issued, but it was out in the open for the world to notice. Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta quickly noted that Morey’s tweet didn’t represent the Rockets, insisting that the team is an apolitical organization. Morey himself issued a statement saying he did not mean to offend Chinese fans. The NBA followed up with a statement that both related that the league supports individuals “educating themselves and sharing their views,” but also called the incident “regrettable.” James Harden, the Rockets’ franchise star, apologized and added “We love China.”
Outside of the league, the clamor was even louder as several political leaders criticized the NBA for kowtowing to Chinese interests – Republican Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri even wrote an open letter to the NBA asking them to cancel the Lakers’ exhibitions there.
On other hot-button issues, the NBA has stood unconditionally behind its players’ ability to express political views. On his own, James has spoken in support of the Black Lives Matter movement, for gun legislation and against NCAA amateurism. Other politically outspoken NBA figures include coaches Gregg Popovich and Steve Kerr, who have been particularly critical of the White House. Political expression has now entered the fabric of the NBA, so it’s all the more evident when the league tiptoes around a statement such as Morey’s that threatens its standing in a lucrative market.
The conflict of economic interests and political motivations is a needle the league has managed to thread for more than a decade of its increased investment in the Chinese market. This moment is arguably the first serious threat to the harmony that the NBA and China have managed to maintain. The Lakers, who sport two enormously popular stars in James and Anthony Davis, have a chance to heal some of the damage done.
Still, the larger question is likely to linger: Was it reasonable in the first place for the NBA to expect to have it both ways? That might not be so easily resolved.

Did Trump commit treason?

Texto completo: Let's say we had a president who did the following: Redistributed wealth by taxing the rich and giving to the poor. Boosted entitlements. Signed a law to strengthen workplace safety. Poured money into cleaning up the environment. Even helped finance National Public Radio. Liberals would be pleased, right?
We did have such a president. His name was Richard Nixon.
Of course, all this is largely forgotten today, overshadowed by Nixon's involvement in Watergate – the scandal that drove him from the Oval Office in 1974, as House impeachment and possibly even Senate conviction were nipping at his heels.
Because of this mixed legacy, Nixon ranks as the 28th best president (or the 16th worst, depending on how you look at it) in a 2017 C-SPAN survey of historians. In 10 categories, he scores near the middle for most, though 10th for "International Relations." But in terms of "Moral Authority" he's near the bottom, ranked 42nd. Lying to the American people and covering up a Constitution-shredding crime will do that to a guy.
President Donald Trump will be included in the next survey, which is taken every time we have a new president. Where do you think he'll rank? For starters, let's compare his actions with all the Nixon accomplishments mentioned above.
Trump is the anti-Nixon. After lying through his teeth in 2017 about how "the rich will not be gaining at all with this plan," he gave them (and himself) a huge tax break.
Entitlements? He has reportedly told Senate Republicans that cutting Social Security and Medicare could be a second-term project. We got a preview of his plans to do just that in his 2020 budget blueprint. Funny, Trump likes to run his mouth on Twitter and at his rallies, but this is something he hasn't blabbed to his wide-eyed, believe-whatever-he-says base.
Strengthen workplace safety? "We want to protect our workers," Trump said in 2017. But that was another lie. His administration has rolled back worker protections, making already dangerous jobs like coal mining, working on oil rigs and in meat processing plants even more so. Overall, "they've done more things to hurt workers than they have to help them," AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said last month on Fox News Sunday.
And cleaning up the environment? Nixon proposed a new Environmental Protection Agency in July 1970, and it began operations five months later.
Trump has gutted it, and when he brags about all the regulations he has cut – to the wild applause of his base – what he's not telling them is that he is endangering the air they breathe and the water they drink. They applaud and then go home, apparently oblivious to the 85 (and counting) rules he has rolled back. Air pollution, water pollution, toxic substances, on and on and on.
There's more, but you get the point: Trump is worse than Nixon. And I haven't even gotten to the scandals. What Trump has done is far more damaging to our country. To me, it can be summed up from just one event: his infamous meeting in the Oval Office in May 2017 with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.
It was bad enough that Trump revealed highly classified information that, according to two unnamed officials cited in The New York Times, exposed an intelligence source in the Middle East. But we've since learned – based on three sources obtained by The Washington Post – that Trump told his Kremlin guests he didn't care that the Russians had interfered in our 2016 election.
An enemy attacks us and our commander in chief doesn't care? If this is true then I will use, for the first time, a word that distresses me deeply: treason. This isn't just my view. Article 3, Section 3 of our beloved Constitution says: "Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying war against them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort."
The Russians attacked us. If the commander in chief who swore to defend us said it didn't bother him, this is "giving them aid and comfort." The Russians are surely gearing up for more mayhem in 2020, and what does Trump care? Treason.
Now we learn that Trump has leaned on foreign governments like Ukraine and Australia to dig up dirt that would help him politically. For all his dirty tricks, Richard Nixon never would have dreamed of doing that.
Trump is a man with no ethical compass or shred of decency. Worse than Nixon? Worse in every way. And worse than all the rest.

How the times have changed

Texto completo: You may, if you are old enough, recall a TV actor named Foster Brooks.
He was a guest star on such classics of boomer kitsch as "The Monkees," "The Munsters" and "The Mod Squad." But if you do remember him, it's likely for one thing only: his imitation of inebriation. Brooks made his slurring, stammering "funny drunk act" a TV staple, back when drunks were still considered, well ... funny.
To recall his career is to marvel at what a difference a generation or two makes.
That era produced another TV trope that, in hindsight, seems equally bizarre: the funny sexual harasser. A hundred times, you saw it: the lecherous boss chasing the nubile secretary around the desk. A hundred times, it didn't register as anything but a joke.
And again, the memory makes you marvel at how the times, they have changed.
In their new book, "She Said," Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, The New York Times reporters who broke the Harvey Weinstein sexual harassment story, remind us that early October contains three anniversaries, each a milestone of the progress we have -- and have not -- made in learning to take sexual assault seriously.
Oct. 7, 2016: The Washington Post releases the now-infamous "Access Hollywood" video where presidential candidate Donald Trump brags about sexually assaulting women. "And when you're a star, they let you do it," he says. "Grab them by the p---y. You can do anything."
Oct. 5, 2018: The Senate advances the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court despite a credible allegation that, as a drunken teenager, he attempted to rape a then-classmate, research psychologist Christine Blasey Ford.
Between those two dates -- Oct. 5, 2017 -- The Times published its report on the film producer Weinstein and his alleged assaults on women in his professional circle, including the actor Ashley Judd. Later, Gwyneth Paltrow and Annabella Sciorra would also number themselves among the accusers.
The story opened a floodgate. By the time the wave of accusations crested, it had splashed dozens of famous men: Matt Lauer, Charlie Rose, Mario Batali, Louis C.K., George H.W. Bush and Al Franken among them. Once-silent women found their voices under a hashtag -- #MeToo.
"She Said" recounts the journalistic detective work that led to the breakthrough. It's a compelling story that leaves one pleased to see the good guys -- the good "gals," really -- get a win. But let us be clear on the limitations of that win. Indeed, the convergence of those anniversaries speaks eloquently to America's ongoing irresolution on matters of sexual harassment and assault. Sure, Weinstein is facing charges, but Kavanaugh went to the Supreme Court, and Trump, to the White House.
Still, the story Twohey and Kantor broke changed gender politics. Predictably, there came a backlash, increasing numbers of male managers reportedly refusing to mentor female subordinates. That would seem to open them to civil sanctions. It will be fun to watch one of them try to defend his sexism in court, perhaps before a judge with lady parts.
Elsewhere, folks just want to know, where is the line? Is it allowed to tell a co-worker you find her attractive? Can you share -- or laugh at -- a bawdy joke? "So much was suddenly open to question," write Kantor and Twohey.
And it is. And that is surely frustrating and difficult.
On the other hand, some of us remember when the boss chased the secretary while the laugh track howled. We thought nothing of it. Now people are wondering what's acceptable?
Maybe that's not the worst thing in the world.

Smartphones are grenades in our kids' pockets Op-Ed

Texto completo: Fireworks exploded first thing Tuesday morning and it was amazing: Twitter was crackling with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg blasting Democratic presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren, and Warren doubled down on a pledge to break up the social media behemoth to protect us all from the monopolistic company's darker side.
The smackdown began with leaked audio of a Zuckerberg meeting with Facebook employees in which the CEO said it would "suck" if Warren were elected. Zuck vowed to aim the full force of his company against her as president: "If someone's going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight."
Warren slammed back: "What would really 'suck,'" she tweeted, "is if we don't fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights, and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy."
Meanwhile, all I could think about was the kids.
Our kids. Your kids. Everyone's kids. The high school kid who took his life last month in Tennessee due to cyberbullying.
Kids are walking around middle schools and high schools with smartphones and apps that have become a bully's best friend. Live grenades, you might even say. And all we parents are doing, it seems, is watching, helplessly, as Big Tech keeps getting bigger and bigger while our kids get sucked deeper and deeper into the diabolical depths of their profit-making devices and apps.
Sure, parents try to monitor their kids' social media use. But this can't be all we do. Not with kids like Channing Smith becoming casualties.
Just hours before Zuck vs. Warren, the story of the Tennessee high schooler's death was making the rounds nationally. He took his own life after being humiliated by cyberbullies, his family says. Channing was distraught after a screenshot of him kissing another boy was disseminated, unbeknownst to him.
The youngster's story was on my mind from the night before when, over a cup of morning coffee, the Twitter face-off unfolded between Zuckerberg and Warren. It felt timely.
Companies like Facebook, which also owns Instagram, control so much of our online lives, our privacy, our personal time, and with very little accountability or mechanisms to flag or halt increasingly toxic behavior. (Just how big is Facebook, you ask? Its shares are valued at $500 billion, with a 'b.')
From the way it handles user data to its effectively allowing its platform to be used for meddling in U.S. elections, there are many major concerns about this company. Just as there are concerns about Google and so many other digital companies that have poked into our lives in ways large and small.
But as a parent, one concern rises above all others: What is all of this doing to our kids? And when, if ever, do we say the harm is becoming too great to ignore, whether it's digital addiction or bullying or being victimized in some other way by the tech universe?
The digital world, in just a matter of a few years, has ballooned into a virtually lawless place. And our children are in the line of fire, whether through the exponential spread of child pornography, as a New York Times investigation recently documented, or through soul-crushing cyberbullying, which also appears to be on the rise.
Pew Research Center recently found that a majority of U.S. teens have experienced at least one of the following: "Online cyberbullying, including name-calling, being subject to false rumors, receiving explicit images they didn't ask for, having explicit images of themselves shared without their consent, physical threats, or being constantly asked about their location and activities in a stalker-ish fashion by someone who is not their parents."
Even local police can see the uptick.
"The technology today and what's out there with all the different apps and how they can hide their identity and spoof different numbers, it's crazy," said Deputy Chief Ted Caiola, whose Upper Gwynedd Township police department is one of several feeding the North Penn School District in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. We spoke Tuesday. He said kids come to realize, "'Hey, look, I can do this and not get caught.'"
In Tredyffrin Township, the veteran cop in charge of police in that Chester County community agreed that officers are summoned to many more bullying calls in today's digital age than they ever did before the advent of social media. Michael Beaty would know; he's been a suburban law enforcement officer for 32 years
"We've had to adapt with the growth of technology and find a way for us to continue doing our job," said Beaty, who became police superintendent in Tredyffrin two years ago.
As tech companies worry about their hegemony, parents should step up our own worrying game. Pew found that less bullying happens if kids spend less time online. That's a good start.

Whalen remembers feeling gutted in high school when a former friend would mock her postings, threaten to unfollow or unfriend her on social media and post inside jokes about her to others. The cyberbullying was so distressing that Whalen contemplated suicide.

Texto completo: Vast Turkish facility
uses technology to point
people in right direction
Earlier this year, thousands of flights began landing at Istanbul's new $11 billion airport, a sprawling behemoth that occupies an area larger than Manhattan and may eventually become the world's busiest air hub.
How do you help millions of harried passengers each year navigate an 818 million-square-foot facility with five concourses and 143 boarding gates?
One answer, according to airport officials, is a fleet of humanoid robots.
Specially designed for the facility, the wheeled robots are a first for Turkish airports, according to an airport-produced video introducing the machines to the public. About the size of a small child, the eggshell-blue machines have bright digital faces with cartoonish round eyes and an ever- present smile that appears designed to put people at ease.
When the robots speak, their mouths flash, their eyes wink and the machine's arms move up and down. A touch screen attached to the robot's chest allows people to interact with the machine.
"My capabilities include route showing, giving directions, inquiring about flight schedule and flight information status," the robot says between videos of the machine assisting customers and spinning in circles. "I am looking forward to meeting new passengers at Istanbul Airport every day."
The Istanbul Airport video doesn't reveal whether the machines have a name or how many will roam the facility, but Business Traveller reported that there are four robots on hand.
At a time when airports and the number of people passing through them continue to grow, the robots are an effort to make travel more manageable. When completed, Istanbul's airport - 20 miles outside the city on the Black Sea coast - will be able to handle as many as 200 million passengers a year. For perspective, Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport in Atlanta - now considered the world's busiest - processes about half that.
"We're starting to arrive at scales which were previously unimaginable for the size of these airport buildings," Andrew Thomas, a partner at the architectural firm Grimshaw, which designed the Istanbul airport, told the New York Times last year. "It almost doesn't matter what you put in it if the walks are so long that people are exhausted by the time they get to their gate."
Istanbul's airport robots may be innovative and on trend, but they're not groundbreaking.
Perhaps you've heard of Pepper, for example. In addition to being spotted eerily tapping a drum while performing Buddhist funeral rites in Japan, the doe-eyed humanoid robot has been interacting with British passengers at a railway station in central London (including posing for selfies). Pepper recently emerged at an airline in Taiwan, as well, its shiny crown strikingly bald yet cheerful.
At one of France's busiest airports, self-driving robotic valets called Stan have been parking travelers' vehicles for months, a process the company claims is far more efficient than human drivers.
Humanoid robots on wheels with digital expressions have popped up in other busy, high-stress locations such as hospitals.
When officials at Mongkutwattana General Hospital in Bangkok needed help moving paperwork earlier this year, they turned to a fleet of humanoid robots, which they outfitted in bright yellow dresses and shoulder-length brown wigs.
Adding an element of the supernatural, the unsmiling Chinese-made machines also have two blazing red eyes - each one massive and ghoulish - that glare from behind a darkened pane of transparent plastic like a demonic predator lurking in the dark.
Their names: Nan, Nee and Nim.

Texto completo: “You’re not entitled to benefit from your own murderous act.” – 1st Kings 21:19
Who in their right mind supports reparations for slavery? Who believes decisions made 400 years ago should require us to pay reparations? What kind of fuzzy-headed liberal thinks like that?
That would be God. Awkward, huh?
God said, “I have seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt, and have heard their cry because of their taskmasters; I know their sufferings … behold, the cry of the people of Israel has come to me, and I have seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them.”
God drafted Moses to go to Pharaoh and demand their freedom. Long story short, Pharaoh reluctantly agreed, but not before forcing God’s hand.
By ordering the deaths of the first-born children of Egypt, God knew the people would finally demand their leader free the slaves. That cataclysmic biblical event resonates with the American Civil War, which took the lives of so many of the first born (and second and third born) of both sides before the South let go of its grip on slaves.
After informing Moses of the God-awful plan, God says it will cause Pharaoh to “drive you out from here.” In the third chapter of Exodus, God told Moses the slaves would “not go away empty-handed.” God ordered the slaves to “ask” the Egyptian people for their “ornaments of silver and gold.” Thus, they stripped the Egyptians.
After 400 years of enslavement, these slaves were free. And as God decreed, they did not leave empty-handed. Where do you think they got the gold they used to craft the Golden Calf? The gold and silver weren’t gifts, but what Matthew Henry’s Biblical Commentary called “back wages.” Others call it plunder. In his book “God: A Biography,” Jack Miles writes, “The Israelites are not to be blamed for engaging in this plunder. It was God’s idea.”
It was reparations.
Reparations were God’s way of restoring justice. The first chapter of Exodus tells us of the injustices that demanded balancing. “The Egyptians put the Israelites to work at crushing labor, and they made their lives bitter with hard work with mortar and bricks and every work in the field, all their crushing work that they performed. Egyptians were ruthless in all the tasks that they imposed on them.”
God not only heard the cries from the slaves, he also witnessed how the Egyptian people, their country and their economy benefited from the suffering they visited on the slaves. A nation can afford to build magnificent cities when it doesn’t have to pay wages to the builders. The Hebrew Bible says that is exactly what the slaves did for the Egyptians.
Slaves did the same for the United States. One historian described the economic benefits. “Slavery was so profitable, it sprouted more millionaires per capita in the Mississippi River valley than anywhere in the nation. With cash crops of tobacco, cotton and sugar cane, America’s southern states became the economic engine of the burgeoning nation.
“If the Confederacy had been a separate nation, it would have ranked as the fourth richest in the world at the start of the Civil War.” (https://www.history.com/news/slavery-profitable-southern-economy)
The “must-read” New York Times study “The 1619 Project” documents “the vast material wealth” created by slaves, which “helped turn a poor, fledgling nation into a financial colossus.”
Add the land stolen from native peoples. “Stolen bodies working stolen land” is Colson Whitehead’s description in “The Underground Railroad.” America was built on slave labor, stolen land, and the destruction of African and Native cultures. We took their past, present and future, using them to create the wealth that continues to benefit all of us more than 150 years after slavery ended.
How do we atone? God’s plan for Egypt’s atonement for enslaving the Hebrews? Plunder Egypt. Today’s debate over reparations doesn’t ask as much. It asks only for an honest inquiry into what justice would look like if white Americans paid their fair debt.

Texto completo: I've been a runner in more than 60 countries, including seven marathons on all seven continents. From casual runs in the streets of Sydney to half marathons in Anchorage, Alaska, to a mountain trail marathon in northern Mongolia, running has become a part of my every journey.
I'm not alone.
Next month New York City will welcome these running travelers, as the more than 50,000 entrants for the New York City Marathon come from all over the world.
Andro Besic, a 60-something New Zealander I met at the Antarctica Marathon, competes in only the most exotic races - from the Polar Circle in Greenland to the Tenzing Hillary Everest Marathon in Nepal, a run down from the Everest base camp.
"These races show what you are made of and what you want from yourself," he said.
I've created my own group of running friends who have traveled to Toronto; Buenos Aires, Argentina; and the Gold Coast of Australia to run, oftentimes leading to some unexpected revelations.
For my sister, Peg Pardini, and me, deciding to run a marathon in Ireland, the birthplace of our paternal grandparents, allowed us to explore our heritage. Before the race, we set out to find our grandfather's family in County Monaghan. We discovered there the richness of our family history, dating to the early 1800s.
Running a marathon abroad is a built-in way to experience a place with a group of like-minded people. On a running trip to Mongolia, Peg and I slept in yurts for a week, acclimatizing for a mountain run. With no Wi-Fi or contact with the outside world, the 65 runners bonded with conversations, card games and group dinners.
If you are a single traveler, it's easy to plug into any of the race activities, before and after the main event, to meet people from all over the world.
Keith LaScalea, 46, has traveled to more than 20 marathons on his own. "It allows me to experience the full spirit of the race and meet other runners, some who have become friends," he said.
Global marathoning has become such a phenomenon that some travel companies are now devoted to it.
Marathon Tours, a 40-year-old company based in Boston, offers trips to more than 40 running events around the world, including those in Bhutan and Myanmar. They guarantee a race entry (there may be waiting lists for popular runs), help with hotel accommodations and organize pre- and post-race celebrations.
"Travel has became an integral part of the runner's lifestyle that allows them to break through the touristic veneer," said Thom Gilligan, the company's founder.

Arias cure the blues in 'Farinelli and the King'

Texto completo: There is an adage among directors of Shakespeare: You don't just do "Hamlet," you first must have a Hamlet.

In other words, before you launch into staging an intricately layered piece of dramatic writing, be sure you start with a concrete foundation.

At the always-ambitious Station Theatre in Urbana, director Tania Arazi Coambs has assembled many of parts necessary for Claire van Kampen's "Farinelli and the King," even if the structure had not cured by Thursday's opening night. In James Hevel, Coambs has cast an accomplished young singer as Farinelli, the famed 18th century castrato who had extraordinary vocal range and power.

Those who saw the play in London or New York (or have read it) may be surprised to find that a key element of Kampen's dramaturgy has been altered. A program note from the playwright explains to Station audiences that "previous productions" of the play had two Farinellis, which emphasized the dual nature of the character. In those earlier productions, one actor performed the operatic singing role and another acted the playwright's words.

Although the author does not address the issue in her note, it may be that the duality of Farinelli's character requires two actors to strike the complex emotional chords inherent in it. Hevel best manages to convey Farinelli's inner state when singing the affecting arias of Nicola Porpora and G.F. Handel that are scattered throughout the performance. Chia-ying Chan performs the musical accompaniment with unassuming energy.

What of the titular king, then?

In the decision to have one performer portray Farinelli, the parallels between the singer and the depressed, occasionally catatonic King Philip V of Spain (rendered here as "Philippe") become muddled. Kampen's play paints the two men as trapped in their lives by nature and circumstance, but with their eyes on the stars and their ears tuned to "the music of the spheres."

The psychic distress of Philippe (Aaron Miller) is healed by the piercing, ethereal voice of Farinelli. For his part, the singer feels renewed, truly heard and seen by the king. The two men become soul mates, but not in a romantic sense. Miller's wild-eyed monarch is a sometimes-vexing counterpoint to Farinelli, though his pastoral second-act monologue shows a subtlety to be encouraged.

The dramatic tension, when it arises, comes from the court intrigues of the king's wife, Isabella (Cara Maurizi), who tries to protect her husband from the machinations of his chief councilor, Don Sebastian (Rodney Woodworth). The play is nominally about the singer and the king, but it is Isabella who brings the two men together in her search for something to soothe the king's spirit. Along the way, Isabella and Farinelli begin to have feelings for one another, leading to unhappy ruptures among the trio.

It is always impressive to see how the Station Theater finds ways to present complicated works in its tiny space. In "Farinelli," the intricacies very nearly bring the production to a halt several times as scene shifts drag and acting cues lag. A superfluous opening scene, which is nowhere in the published text, could be cut and save several minutes. As it stands now, the entire performance is easily 10 minutes too long.

Brian Hagy richly lights the sumptuous costumes by Brianna Malotke and well-crafted scenic details of Yvonne Tessman. In a space the size of the Station, less can often be more.

In that spirit, give us more, please.

Marc Thiessen: Durham investigation has Democrats up in arms

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — President Trump’s critics are now complaining that he asked the Australian prime minister to cooperate with the Justice Department’s investigation into the origins of the Mueller probe and that Attorney General William Barr has traveled overseas to ask foreign intelligence officials to cooperate with that investigation. The New York Times called it another example of “the president using high-level diplomacy to advance his personal political interests.”
<img class="size-medium wp-image-2657222" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/Marc-Thiessen-color-2018-300x235.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="235" />
No, it’s not. The president’s critics are conflating two different things: the investigation by Trump’s private lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani, into Hunter Biden’s business dealings, and the official inquiry by U.S. Attorney John Durham into the counterintelligence investigation directed at the Trump campaign during the 2016 election. The former is opposition research activity; the latter is a criminal justice matter.
There is absolutely nothing wrong with asking foreign heads of state or intelligence officials to cooperate with an official Justice Department investigation. As George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley explains, “It is not uncommon for an attorney general, or even a president, to ask foreign leaders to assist with ongoing investigations. Such calls can shortcut bureaucratic red tape, particularly if the evidence is held, as in this case, by national security or justice officials.”
Americans support the Durham probe. For two years, they were told by Trump’s opponents that the president was “working on behalf of the Russians” and had committed “treasonous” acts that were of “a size and scope probably beyond Watergate.” Those were serious accusations, and Americans took them seriously. They waited for special counsel Robert Mueller to tell them whether the president had indeed betrayed the country.
Then Mueller issued his report, and they found out that none of it was true. They understandably wanted answers. How did it come to pass that our government was paralyzed for two years and spent tens of millions of their tax dollars, chasing a Trump-Russia collusion conspiracy theory? A Harvard CAPS-Harris Poll following the Mueller report’s public release found that 53% of Americans said that “bias against President Trump in the FBI played a role in launching investigations against him,” and 62% supported appointing a special counsel to investigate the investigation of Trump.
Instead of a special counsel, Barr appointed Durham, a career prosecutor, to lead the investigation that Americans demanded. Durham is a man of unimpeachable character who was appointed by Obama administration Attorney General Eric Holder to investigate the CIA’s terrorist interrogation program. At the conclusion of that probe, which ended without any criminal charges, Holder praised Durham for working “tirelessly to conduct an extraordinarily thorough and complete” investigation.
Now Barr has asked Durham to bring the same tireless professionalism to his investigation into the origins of the Mueller probe. But suddenly, all those who were so eager to find out what happened in 2016 when they thought Mueller would reveal that Trump conspired with the Russians have lost interest. The same people who were outraged at Trump’s efforts to discredit the Mueller probe are now doing the exact same thing to the Durham probe. Back then, Democrats insisted Trump stop criticizing the investigation and “let Mueller follow the facts wherever they lead.” Now they need to heed their own advice: Stop criticizing the investigation. Let Durham follow the facts wherever they lead. If there was no wrongdoing, then there is nothing to worry about.
To be sure, Trump bears some responsibility for helping Democrats lump together Durham’s official investigation with Giuliani’s partisan activities by mentioning them both on the call with Ukraine’s president. There should be a firewall between the two inquiries. Instead, Trump and Giuliani have blurred those lines.
But keep in mind, it was the Democrats who told us there is nothing wrong or illegal with a presidential candidate hiring a private lawyer to conduct opposition research in a foreign country on their political opponents. After it emerged that the Clinton campaign and the DNC had paid Christopher Steele to dig up dirt in Russia on Trump, the Democrats’ defense was: That’s just opposition research. Everyone does it. The biggest problem with the Steele dossier was not that Democrats paid for opposition research, but that the FBI might have used it as the basis for spying on the Trump campaign — which is part of what Durham is investigating.
Durham is no partisan actor. Despite political pressure, he cleared the CIA of wrongdoing during the Obama administration. Like Mueller, he will follow the facts wherever they lead. Maybe that is why so many Democrats are up in arms.

Texto completo: Un agente de la Patrulla Fronteriza (CBP) fue arrestado en Tucson, Arizona, por atacar sexualmente a una de sus compañeras de trabajo.
De acuerdo con el New York Times, Gus Zamora, de 51 años y asignado al sector de Yuma, fue arrestado y acusado en junio pasado. El hombre está casado con Gloria Chávez, otra agente de la CBP que es vista como un modelo a seguir para las mujeres que trabajan o quieren trabajar en la institución.
A Zamora se le permitió retirarse de la CBP después que se conoció el arrestó, algo que ha sido criticado por activistas y litigantes.
Según la información, Zamora invitó a la colega, identificada en documentos de corte como R.W., a cenar en mayo pasado. La mujer dijo que el hombre empezó con coqueteos desde antes de la cena al enviar un mensaje de texto que decía “te arreglaste para mí “.
Los agentes estuvieron acompañados por un rato de Roy Villareal, otro miembro de la CBP , amigo de Zamora y supervisor de la denunciante. La mujer dice que el agente, a quien ella veía como un mentor, comenzó a pedir licor al punto que ella se emborrachó y perdió la consciencia. Una mesera dijo que el hombre insistía bastante para que la mujer bebiera.
La denuncia dice que Zamora llevó a la colega a su habitación en un hotel en Tucson, a donde había ido desde El Centro, California, y allí la habría abusado. El agente dijo a los investigadores que había ofrecido llevar a la mujer a su casa, pero que ella le dijo que no quería esta sola y le pidió que la llevara al hotel .
La mujer dijo que recuerda despertar en la habitación varias veces, pero que nunca tuvo conciencia para dar consentimiento a relaciones sexuales.

El agente se ha excusado en su avanzado estado de embriaguez desde que empezó la investigación .
“Tampoco estaba en un estado para dar consentimiento”, dijo Zamora a un detective.

Correcting a media error: Biden's Ukraine showdown was in December 2015

Texto completo: "One of his most memorable performances came on a trip to Kiev in March 2016, when he threatened to withhold $1 billion in United States loan guarantees if Ukraine's leaders did not dismiss the country's top prosecutor, who had been accused of turning a blind eye to corruption in his own office and among the political elite."
- New York Times, May 1
"In March 2016, Biden made one of his many trips to Ukraine and told the country's leaders that they had to get rid of the prosecutor if they wanted $1 billion in U.S. aid."
- NPR, Sept. 24
"In March 2016, Biden was in Kiev, where he was scheduled to announce a $1 billion American loan to the Ukrainian government."
- Atlantic, Sept. 25

This is just a sampling of the many news organizations - starting with the New York Times in the first paragraph of a front-page article - that reported that Joe Biden threatened on a trip to Kiev in March 2016 to withhold $1 billion in aid unless a top prosecutor was fired.
But here's the rub: Biden never traveled to Ukraine that month. The Ukrainian president at the time, Petro Poroshenko, traveled to Washington in March - but only after the prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin, had already been dismissed by the Ukrainian parliament.
Why the confusion? Because Biden managed to squeeze months of diplomacy into a few hours when he recounted the story years later at the Council on Foreign Relations. Biden's tale, ironically, has become Exhibit 1 in President Trump's false narrative that Biden ousted the prosecutor because he was investigating a company associated with his son Hunter Biden. As we have reported, the drive to push out Shokin was an international effort widely celebrated at the time.
We don't normally do media criticism, but it's important to correct the timeline.
The Facts Here's what Biden said during a 2018 appearance before the Council on Foreign Relations:
"I was supposed to announce that there was another billion-dollar loan guarantee. And I had gotten a commitment from Poroshenko and from [then-Prime Minister Arseniy] Yatsenyuk that they would take action against the state prosecutor [Shokin]. And they didn't. . . . They were walking out to a press conference. I said, 'Nah, . . . We're not going to give you the billion dollars.' They said, 'You have no authority. You're not the president.' . . . I said, 'Call him.' I said, 'I'm telling you, you're not getting the billion dollars.' . . . I looked at them and said, 'I'm leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you're not getting the money.' Well, son of a b----. He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time."
From Biden's story, it sounds like things had happened very fast, in the space of six hours. But it was really a diplomatic slog that extended from September through May. (In August 2016, in fact, Biden gave a somewhat less dramatic version of the story to the Atlantic magazine.)
Biden was carrying out a policy developed at the State Department and coordinated with the European Union and the International Monetary Fund. The $1 billion in loan guarantees was essential leverage because the Ukrainian government needed the credit line to underwrite its budget. At stake was not just Shokin, but a broad package of reforms, including a shake-up of the cabinet, sought by Western powers.
The U.S. ambassador at the time, Geoffrey Pyatt, along with then-Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs Victoria Nuland, were key champions of the policy at the day-to-day level. Shokin was considered a close associate of Poroshenko, so his removal required a lot of work. "He's was completely Poroshenko's creature," recalled one former U.S. official involved in Ukraine policy.
Pyatt kicked off the effort with a speech on Sept. 24, 2015, in which he blasted Shokin for "openly and aggressively undermining reform" and having "undermined prosecutors working on legitimate corruption cases." In testimony to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Oct. 8, Nuland declared: "The Prosecutor General's Office has to be reinvented as an institution that serves the citizens of Ukraine, rather than ripping them off."
Biden followed up with a visit to Kiev in December. On Dec. 7, he held a news conference with Poroshenko and announced $190 million to "fight corruption in law enforcement and reform the justice sector." He made no public mention of the loan guarantee, but behind the scenes he had explicitly linked the $1 billion loan guarantee to reform efforts, including removing Shokin, according to Colin Kahl, Biden's national security adviser at the time.
A day after the news conference, he addressed the Ukrainian parliament and decried the "cancer of corruption" in the country. "The Office of the General Prosecutor desperately needs reform," he noted.
Kahl said Biden had a version of the parliament speech in which he would have announced the loan guarantee if Poroshenko immediately had taken the actions demanded by the United States and its international partners. But since the Ukrainian leader did not remove Shokin during that trip, Biden instead emphasized the country's corruption in his speech.
"It was a very politically challenging thing for Poroshenko," Kahl said. "You could see he was not happy" about not getting the loan guarantee.
Biden next met on Jan. 20 with Poroshenko on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, when he also pressed "the need to continue to move forward on Ukraine's anti-corruption agenda," according to a White House statement. Kahl said Biden at that meeting reinforced the linkage between the loan guarantee and the necessary reforms.
Then a series of calls followed.
Feb. 12: Biden spoke to Poroshenko by phone. "The two leaders agreed on the importance of unity among Ukrainian political forces to quickly pass reforms in line with the commitments in its IMF program, including measures focused on rooting out corruption," the White House said.
Feb. 16: Poroshenko announced he had asked Shokin to resign. "This morning I have met and had a serious conversation with the prosecutor general. I have suggested Viktor Mykolayovych [Shokin] should write a letter of resignation," the president said in a statement. Shokin agreed to do so.
Feb. 18: Another call took place between Biden and Poroshenko. "The Vice President also commended President Poroshenko's decision to replace Prosecutor General Shokin, which paves the way for needed reform of the prosecutorial service," the White House said in a statement. "The Vice President urged President Poroshenko to continue on this positive trajectory, to include successful implementation of the new legislation and continued visible progress on anti-corruption reforms, noting this will require unity and stability."
Feb. 19: Poroshenko announced he received Shokin's resignation letter. It still required parliamentary approval, and Shokin did not go away quietly.
That same day, Biden spoke separately to Poroshenko and Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk. "He urged Ukraine's leadership to unite and rebuild popular trust around a strong governing coalition and reform program, and to accelerate Ukraine's efforts to fight corruption, strengthen justice and the rule of law, and fulfill its IMF requirements," the White House said.
March 16: Reports emerged that Shokin was back at work after having been on vacation. He later fired a reformist deputy who had called for his removal from office.
March 22: Biden and Poroshenko spoke again by phone, mainly about Russia's conviction and sentencing of Ukrainian pilot and member of parliament Nadiya Savchenko, who had been captured by Russian forces in eastern Ukraine.
March 29: The Ukrainian parliament, in a 289-to-6 vote, approved Shokin's dismissal.
On March 31, Poroshenko met with Biden during a trip to Washington, and Biden emphasized that the loan guarantee was contingent on further reform progress beyond Shokin's removal. "The Vice President welcomed the efforts of President Poroshenko to form a stable, reform-oriented government, and stressed that this step, as well as the enactment of needed reforms, are critical to unlocking international economic assistance, including the third $1 billion U.S. loan guarantee," the White House said.
President Barack Obama originally was not expected to meet with Poroshenko, but a meeting was arranged on April 1. "President Obama confirmed willingness to provide the third tranche of loan guarantees in the amount of $1 billion upon completion of the formation of a new government in Ukraine," the Ukrainian press service reported.
On April 14, Biden and Poroshenko had another call. Biden congratulated the president on his new cabinet and "stressed the urgency of putting in place a new Prosecutor General who would bolster the agency's anti-corruption efforts and strongly support the work of its reformers," a White House statement said. The Ukrainian press service reported "the parties agreed that an agreement on the issue of the third tranche of credit guarantees in the amount of $1 billion will soon be signed."
May 12: Poroshenko nominated Yuriy Lutsenko as the new prosecutor general.
On May 13, in a phone call, Biden told Poroshenko he welcomed Lutsenko's appointment and creation of an inspector general in the prosecutor's office. "The Vice President informed President Poroshenko that the United States was prepared to move forward with the signing of the third $1 billion loan guarantee agreement, which will support continued progress on Ukrainian reforms," a White House statement said.
The loan guarantee was finally signed June 3, with Pyatt representing the United States.
The Bottom Line As we demonstrated, Biden was never in Kiev in March 2016, as many news organizations have reported. The tying of $1 billion in loan guarantees to needed reforms, including the ouster of Shokin, was a policy pursued over many months, but Biden's explicit linkage was made during his trip to Kiev in December - three months earlier.
Biden's overly dramatic foreshortening of events has confused many reporters, including here at The Fact Checker (in an online article published in May). We've corrected our mistake, and we urge other news organizations to do so as well.

Texto completo: The state of California is home to some of the most infamous serial killers in U.S. history — from the Manson Family, to the Freeway Killers, all the way to the Grim Sleeper.
Well, another accused killer is now awaiting trial in California. This time it’s prolific Democratic donor and West Hollywood resident Ed Buck.
Buck was finally arrested by Los Angeles County Sheriff’s deputies and charged with operating a drug house, as well as providing methamphetamine to a 37 year-old man who suffered an overdose at Buck’s apartment.
This incident was the third known time a man suffered a meth overdose at Buck’s home. The previous two alleged victims, Gemmel Moore and Timothy Dean, did not survive.
Days later, the feds announced that they too would be prosecuting Buck — this time on one count of distribution of methamphetamine resulting in death.
At a press conference, U.S. Attorney Nick Hanna said investigators found 10 more victims, nine of whom said Buck, “administered drugs to them or strongly encouraged them to ingest narcotics as part of agreements to be compensated for sexual services.”
The case is now generating national and international headlines; and I’m noticing that three false storylines seem to be emerging, and they need to be corrected.
First, The New York Times tried to minimize Buck’s power and influence by referring to him as “a small-time Democratic donor and political activist.”
That’s like calling Harvey Weinstein a “love-sick teenager.”
According to federal records, Buck has contributed more than $500,000 to Democratic candidates and groups, and was classified by the California Secretary of State’s office as being a “major donor.”
Before he was nicknamed ‘Dr. Kevorkian’ by his West Hollywood neighbors, Buck could have easily gone by Ed ‘Big Bucks’ with all of the campaign cash he was throwing around.
Second, it has been reported in multiple publications that the politicians and political action committees who took contributions from Buck acted quickly to distance themselves from him.
Some politicians, including former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former President Obama, still won’t say what they’re doing with Buck’s donations, even after his arrest.
In her defense, Hillary may not even know that Buck has been arrested. If she did, she might have fainted again.
Other candidates, including Congressman Adam Schiff, D-Burbank, and Ted Lieu, D-Torrance, agreed to give their Buck contributions of $2,700 and $19,400 respectively, to charity, only after the second man, Timothy Dean, died in Buck’s apartment in January.
The families of the victims, asked for the contributions to help pay for funeral expenses, but both congressmen declined.
What profiles in courage.
To date, only two elected officials donated the money they received from Buck to the victims’ families. Congresswoman Karen Bass, D-Los Angeles, sent the entire $250 she received from Buck to help pay for Gemmel Moore’s funeral expenses, and West Hollywood Councilman John D’Amico made a $25 contribution toward the funeral.
Finally, Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey claimed that her office worked diligently and carefully to find and speak with witnesses over the course of the last two years so they could build a case against Ed Buck.
But the Moore family attorneys say the opposite is true. Nana Gyamfi and Hussain Turk wrote in a statement that, “Our team of activists had to personally escort witnesses to the LASD’s office and pressure them into recording our witnesses’ statements. We later discovered, in May of 2019, that Lacey was not even aware that these reports existed.”
Maybe prosecutors were too busy busting people for possession of plastic drinking straws to go after Ed Buck.
The reality is that Ed Buck abused vulnerable gay black men because powerful people looked the other way and enabled him.
Now that he’s finally been arrested, we shouldn’t try to minimize his power and influence, or rewrite history to make law enforcement and politicians seem as if they cared about the suffering of Ed Buck’s victims more than they actually did.
John Phillips can be heard weekdays from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. on “The Morning Drive with John Phillips and Jillian Barberie” on KABC/AM 790.

Texto completo: Un segundo oficial de inteligencia está considerando presentar una queja y testificar ante el Congreso sobre sus preocupaciones sobre los tratos del presidente Trump con Ucrania, informó el New York Times el viernes, citando a dos personas informadas sobre el asunto.
The Times informó que el oficial tiene más información directa sobre la situación que involucra a Trump que el primer denunciante, cuya queja presentada en agosto ayudó a provocar la investigación de juicio político contra Trump que la Cámara demócrata lanzó la semana pasada, reporta The Hill.
Según los informes, el Inspector General de la Comunidad de Inteligencia Michael Atkinson entrevistó a la persona para corroborar las afirmaciones originales del denunciante.
Trump ha criticado repetidamente al primer denunciante no identificado, cuestionando sus motivos y acusando que son “partidistas”.
Mientras tanto, el Director interino de Inteligencia Nacional, Joseph Maguire, dijo al Congreso a fines de septiembre que creía que el denunciante hizo lo “correcto” al presentar su queja.
El denunciante presentó su queja por preocupaciones sobre la llamada telefónica de Trump al presidente de Ucrania a fines de julio en la que Trump presionó al líder extranjero para que iniciara una investigación sobre el exvicepresidente Joe Biden , un destacado candidato presidencial demócrata.
Una transcripción aproximada de la llamada emitida por la Casa Blanca dada a conocer la semana pasada, corroboró varios puntos clave en la queja del denunciante relacionada con la conversación de Trump con el líder ucraniano.
El denunciante original no tenía conocimiento directo de la conversación, pero escribió que obtuvo información de “múltiples funcionarios de la Casa Blanca con conocimiento directo”.
El presidente Trump y otros republicanos han atacado la credibilidad de la persona.
Mientras tanto, los demócratas dijeron que el testimonio de Atkinson el viernes ante la Cámara confirmó detalles importantes del llamado de Trump con el presidente ucraniano Volodymyr Zelensky .
“Exploramos con el Inspector General (IG) a través de documentos y testimonios las razones por las cuales encontró que la denuncia de denunciantes era urgente y creíble”, dijo el presidente del Comité de Inteligencia, Adam Schiff en un comunicado. “Ahora que todos hemos visto el registro de llamadas, podemos ver que la determinación del IG fue correcta en ambos aspectos “.
El Times informó el viernes que no estaba claro si Atkinson informó a los legisladores que el segundo funcionario estaba pensando en presentar una queja.
The Hill se comunicó con la oficina del inspector general de la comunidad de inteligencia para obtener comentarios y aún no ha recibido respuesta.

Texto completo: 1/15/1952 - 9/9/2019
Long term resident of Silver Spring and later of Annapolis, Maryland, Roy Karten died of complications of Parkinson's disease in Annapolis. He is predeceased by his his father, David Karten, a long serving Pentagon veteran and his mother, Inge Karten. In the course of a distinguished career as a photographer, Roy served for a time as photo editor for U.S. News and World Report; his images, particularly portraits of prominent figures, in politics, business and the arts, from presidents to popstars, were regular features in many publications. His photo credits include Newsweek, The New York Times and Washingtonian. Sharp and quick to laugh, with an easy conversant style, Roy could talk to anyone about anything, establishing quick rapport with his subjects and leading to surprising invitations. He shared stories of days escorting the likes of Audrey Hepburn and Lauren Bacall around the Washington he knew so well.
Privately, he turned his viewfinder to friends, events and nature with a celebratory eye, asking, "Who decides what is beautiful?" and answering, generously, hundreds of times over.
He is survived by his four cousins: Stuart Karten, Susan Karten, Leslie Karten and Arthur Karten. Roy will be remembered and celebrated by family and friends at a private memorial.

Texto completo: Does life imitate art, or does art imitate life? That is very much an open question.
Is the story of Don Quixote a description of life or a prescription for life? Truth is to be found on both sides of the issue. Cervantes’ novel is a telling commentary on human nature. How much of our lives do we spend cultivating delusions? Who has never tilted at a windmill?
Don Quixote and Donald Trump share much in common. Both have raised narcissism, paranoia and delusion to a fine art. Quixote and Trump have created their own private universes from which they peek out at the world. Fact and truth have been surrendered to fantasy.
Quixote viewed windmills as giants to be slain. Trump’s giants are Clinton, Comey, Mueller, the House of Representatives and The New York Times.
Don Quixote had his personal sidekick, Sancho Panza. Donald Trump has his trusted attorney, Rudy Giuliani. Both Quixote and Trump share in a romantic dream. Quixote dreamed of being a knight on a quest to revive chivalry. Trump’s dream centers on a desire to imitate his hero, Vladimir Putin.
No matter how beautiful our delusions, sooner or later they come crashing down. Don Quixote’s moment of truth comes when he realizes he is not really a knight errant. Trump’s awakening is unfolding around his extortion of the president of Ukraine to find “dirt” on the Bidens.
Don Quixote had his epiphany. Trump’s will come in the form of his impeachment.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – On May 23, Kurt Volker, the U. S. special envoy for Ukraine, met with President Donald Trump to deliver what he thought was great news: the new Ukrainian government was serious about fighting corruption and deserved robust U. S. support.
He urged Trump to invite Ukraine's new president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to the White House as a demonstration of America's backing for the fledgling democracy as it battled Russian aggression.
"The president was very skeptical," Volker told lawmakers and congressional staff on Thursday in a statement delivered behind closed doors as part of the House Democrats' impeachment inquiry.
"He said that Ukraine was a corrupt country, full of 'terrible people,'" Volker recalled. "He said they 'tried to take me down'. ”
The opening statement – first published by Buzzfeed News and confirmed by Volker to USA TODAY – offers a remarkable account of the tightrope that Volker walked as he tried to navigate demands from Trump and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, while ensuring Ukrainian officials did not become ensnared in America's messy domestic politics.
He was also, of course, trying to protect his own reputation, as well as U. S. -Ukraine relations. Volker's testimony came as House Democrats probe allegations that Trump used the power of his office to solicit foreign interference in the 2020 election.
Here are three takeaways from Volker's opening remarks to the trio of House committees leading the impeachment inquiry:
Biden's name never came up?
Volker told lawmakers that he had no idea Trump or Giuliani were specifically seeking an investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden and Biden's son Hunter. He said the president never mentioned Biden's name in their conversations, nor did Giuliani specifically talk about the former vice president.
"As you will see from the extensive text messages I am providing, which convey a sense of real-time dialogue with several different actors, Vice President Biden was never a topic of discussion," Volker told the lawmakers.
That may be true, but Giuliani had made it clear to Volker that he wanted the new Ukrainian government to state publicly that it would investigate Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company that had ties to Hunter Biden. And Volker acknowledged he was aware of "public accusations" against the vice president.
That's because Giuliani had spoken publicly about his campaign to get the Ukrainian government to provide damaging information on the Bidens as early as May 9, when the New York Times published a story detailing the former New York mayor's efforts.
Biden a 'man of integrity'
Volker flatly contradicted Trump and Giuliani's assertions that Joe Biden engaged in unethical or illegal activity.
Trump and Giuliani have repeatedly argued that Biden strong-armed the Ukrainian government to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, in order to thwart an investigation into Burisma, the Ukrainian company linked to his son Hunter Biden.
Giuliani has said Shokin's ouster benefited Hunter Biden, who served on Burisma's board of directors – a post for which he was paid $50,000 a month.
Volker told lawmakers that Giuliani appeared to be getting information from unreliable sources about Shokin, Biden and Burisma, and Volker never believed there was any wrongdoing.
"I have known former Vice President Biden for 24 years, and the suggestion that he would be influenced in his duties as vice president by money for his son simply has no credibility to me," he said. "I know him as a man of integrity and dedication to our country. "
Volker's choice: 'do nothing, and allow this situation to fester; or try to fix it'
Volker said he realized that U. S. -Ukraine relations were in jeopardy because of Trump's negative perception of the country, which he believed Giuliani was fueling. Trump was refusing to schedule a meeting with Zelensky, and he'd ordered a freeze on U. S. aid to Ukraine.
"It was clear to me that we had a growing problem in the negative narrative about Ukraine . . . that was impeding the development of our bilateral relationship," he told the impeachment investigators on Thursday. "I therefore faced a choice: do nothing, and allow this situation to fester; or try to fix it. I tried to fix it. "
That meant connecting Giuliani with Ukrainian officials. Volker said he introduced them only after a top adviser to President Zelensky, Andrey Yermak, asked him to do so.
He said he "made clear to the Ukrainians, on a number of occasions, that Mayor Giuliani is a private citizen and the president’s personal lawyer, and that he does not represent the United States government. "
But that initial connection grew into a broader effort by Volker and other diplomats to get the Ukrainians to make a public statement about Zelensky's willingness to probe Burisma and the 2016 presidential election. Text messages that Volker shared with the House committees show State Department officials believed Trump would only agree to a meeting with Zelensky if he made those commitments publicly.
Yermak, Zelensky's aide, eventually told Volker that demand was untenable.
"I agreed – and further said that I believe it is essential that Ukraine do nothing that could be seen as interfering in 2020 elections," Volker said. "It is bad enough that accusations have been made about 2016 – it is essential that Ukraine not be involved in anything relating to 2020. "
The plans for a Zelensky statement were shelved. And Volker's efforts to repair U. S. -Ukraine relations did not work out as he'd hoped.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Long Island Democratic Rep. Kathleen Rice wants to know if the NRA tried to bribe President Trump, and she's asking the FBI to investigate.
Trump met with the gun advocate group's chief executive, Wayne LaPierre, at the White House on Sept. 27. According to a New York Times story about the sit-down, the two "discussed prospective gun legislation and whether the NRA could provide support for the president" in 2020 and against impeachment.
Trump has softened statements about gun control in the past after meeting with the NRA, but the suggestion in the report is that there was something of value in it for him.
Rice, and fellow former prosecutor Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) asked FBI Director Christopher Wray in a letter sent Thursday to see if LaPierre broke the law.
"We respectfully request you investigate whether Mr. LaPierre attempted to bribe the president," they wrote.
The two quote language that asserts LaPierre offered the help Trump wanted if he would "stop the games" with tightening gun laws. Trump has twice declared after mass shootings that the background-check system needed to be strengthened, only to ease away from his pronouncements.
He did so most recently after the mass murders in Dayton, Ohio, and El Paso, Texas, over the summer. Yet prospects for advancing any new rules or laws to curb gun violence have dimmed considerably since the initial furor after the shootings.
The NRA did not immediately answer a request for comment, but has denied anything inappropriate happened in the meeting. In a statement released at the time, the group denied "any discussion occurred about special arrangements pertaining to the NRA's support of the president and vice versa."
Rice and Lieu are not satisfied.
"As former prosecutors, we are deeply troubled that Mr. LaPierre discussed with the president these two subjects in the same conversation," they wrote too Wray.
"It would either be massively inappropriate or an attempt at bribery, which is prohibited under [law]," they wrote.

Texto completo: It was the story that ignited the #MeToo movement two years ago: “Harvey Weinstein Paid Off Sexual Harassment Accusers for Decades."
Now The New York Times reporters who broke the story, Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, have written a book called “She Said" that details how they were able to coax victims to finally speak on the record. For writers, the book serves as a master class in investigative journalism. For everyone else, it's a reminder that meticulous reporting is at the heart of real news.
Kantor and Twohey will be at First Parish Church in Cambridge on Monday with actress Ashley Judd, who is at the Harvard Kennedy School this academic year, focusing on gender issues. Judd was one of the first actresses to go on the record and accuse the Hollywood mogul of sexual misconduct.
The conversation with Judd, Kantor said, will be a “rare chance for us to really talk about what happened behind the scenes and also to talk about the journalist-source relationship and how that evolved."
Here is an edited transcript of my conversation with Kantor and Twohey:
Q. What's the freshest revelation in your book that deepens the Weinstein story?
Twohey: We were able to pull the curtain back more on the machinery that was in place to silence women and help Weinstein evade scrutiny. There were individuals in the institutions that got glimpses of Weinstein's alleged predatory behavior over the years, and in some cases tried to stop it or looked the other way. We were able to illuminate the role of the Weinstein Co., including Harvey Weinstein's brother Bob, who had been one of the most perplexing figures to us coming out of the initial story. This was Weinstein's sibling and longtime business partner.
For the first time, in this book, Bob opens up and acknowledges he was aware of allegations of sexual misconduct against his brother, going back decades. He provided money that helped silence two of the women who came forward, but like so many people in Weinstein's orbit Bob believed his brother when he claimed that those were shakedowns and extramarital affairs and nothing more.
Q. Other journalists over the years tried to break the Weinstein sexual-misconduct story but failed. What was the turning point for you?
Kantor: One of the reasons we wanted to write this book was to show how surprising it was — who helped and who hindered, both in terms of the overall Weinstein story and our investigation. It turns out that we had a “deep throat" figure who emerged in our investigation named Irwin Reiter, a company accountant for 30 years. He had tried starting in 2014 to confront the problem internally and had been unsuccessful. He gave us critical information, documents, and the knowledge of more recent incidents that had unfolded inside the company.
Q. Megan, before the Weinstein story, you in 2016 covered the alleged sexual misconduct of Donald Trump. Why do sexual-misconduct allegations dethrone some men, and others get to keep their jobs or even get promoted?
Twohey: Jodi and I have spent a lot of time talking about that, and it's worth noting that, yes, our book starts in 2016, with the reporting that I did on women who came forward with allegations of sexual misconduct against Trump, moves onto the Weinstein investigation, and then pushes through into the year that followed and up through Christine Blasey Ford coming forward with her allegation against [now Supreme Court Justice] Brett Kavanaugh.
What we have seen time and time again is that when women make allegations in the political realm against political figures or within a political context of any kind, that it quickly descends into holy war, with both sides taking up arms against each other. Oftentimes the women are almost being forgotten.
Q. Why did your story, in particular, break the dam on sexual harassment?
Kantor: So many contributing factors have been building up for years and years, from Anita Hill's testimony to Tarana Burke's founding of the Me Too movement to the Bill Cosby story. The Bill O'Reilly story became our in-house tutorial on how to trace a legal and financial trail to help document these kinds of allegations.
As one of our editors, Matt Purdy, has pointed out, the Weinstein story was one of the first times when the accusers had more credibility and prestige than the accused. Famous actresses had so much credibility and respect in society that learning that this could happen to even them was really potent. But the Weinstein story is not just about one alleged predator — it's an X-ray of how power works. That's why this story is just forcing us even two years later to still reckon with all these moral questions.
Q. A recent study found women felt even more hostility in the workplacethan two years ago. Is that concerning to you?
Twohey: It's clear that in two years both the accusers and the accused feel like there has not been adequate reforms to ensure that complaints of sexual harassment are addressed. There are three outstanding questions that we try to highlight in this book. One: There has not been agreement over what behaviors should merit scrutiny. Are we only talking about really serious rape and sexual harassment, or are we talking also about bad dates? [Two:] What is the fair process by which complaints can be vetted? And, thirdly, what does accountability look like and how is it doled out?

Q. In your book and on The New York Times podcast, The Daily, you delved into the role of feminist lawyer Lisa Bloom. Why did Bloom help Weinstein?
Twohey: She spent her career fashioning herself as one of the most prominent victims' rights advocates, and in 2016 she crossed to the other side to help Weinstein. She did that because she thought he had only engaged in inappropriate comments toward women and that she just wanted to help him apologize. We obtained these confidential records which show that she had much deeper knowledge of the serious allegations against him.
She has refused to have an in-depth conversation about that. It is worth noting that she had a business — before she went to work for him as a lawyer — and had done a deal in which the Weinstein Co. was going to make a book that she had written about Trayvon Martin into a movie.
This was also the case with David Boies, perhaps one of the most famous litigators in the country, who was helping Weinstein spin and conceal allegations of sexual misconduct for 15 years. He also was somebody who wanted to have his toe in the film industry.
Bloom has framed her work for Weinstein as a mistake. Boies, who actually granted extensive interviews for this book, has said he has no regrets about his handling of Weinstein and says that there was nothing unusual or wrong about the fact that they were intertwined on the film industry side of things. That's one of the things that we want readers to walk away pondering: How it is that people can end up doing this type of work for an alleged predator like Weinstein.
Q. Will there be a movie version of “She Said"?
Kantor: There are plans for a film adaptation; they're in the hands of Plan B, which is a company that has made a lot of films based on nonfiction material, like “Selma" and “Moonlight." What we're actually doing is continuing to report and investigate every day. The Weinstein trial is coming up in January, so we will be right here in the office of The New York Times, trying to unearth more information.

Texto completo: In the midst of the Ukraine-Trump-whistleblower-impeachment scandal, former Ambassador Joseph C. Wilson IV, a central figure in an earlier such disputation, died last week in New Mexico. He was 69.
Wilson was a career foreign service officer whose personal flamboyance and healthy ego helped and hindered his diplomacy. In the words of the New York Times, he was a "big personality whom some found prickly and difficult," but this worked to his advantage at times. In 1990, as deputy chief of mission in Baghdad during the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, he was the last American official to speak face-to-face with Saddam Hussein, telling him in plain language to withdraw his troops. When Hussein threatened diplomats with death if they harbored foreign nationals in their embassies, Wilson defied him and sheltered and evacuated hundreds of Americans, and others, stranded in Baghdad.

To President George H.W. Bush, this made Wilson a "true American hero," and, in 1992, Bush appointed him ambassador to Gabon and São Tomé and Principe. Wilson went on to serve as Bill Clinton's senior Africa adviser on the National Security Council before retiring in 1998. That same year, he married his third wife, an undercover CIA officer named Valerie Plame.

Wilson founded and ran an international business and development company specializing in Africa and might well have spent the balance of his working life in the nation's capital as a consultant. But after 9/11, the chance confluence of his wife Plame and his old adversary Hussein altered Wilson's trajectory, transforming him overnight from an indistinguishable ex-diplomat-turned-consultant into a political celebrity.

In the immediate aftermath of the October 2001 American invasion of Afghanistan and the dawn of its concomitant war on terror, the administration of President George W. Bush turned its attention to Hussein's support for regional terrorism and, in particular, credible allegations of Iraq's replenished stockpile of "weapons of mass destruction." The fact that Hussein was resistant to international inspection only deepened suspicion that the weapons existed, and "regime change" was imperative.

In February 2002, the CIA dispatched Wilson to the West African republic of Niger to investigate claims that Hussein had purchased enriched uranium. Wilson concluded that no such transaction had taken place. Yet in his 2003 State of the Union address, Bush asserted that "the British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa." After the successful invasion of Iraq, and Hussein's overthrow, Wilson published an op-ed in the New York Times in which he claimed that "if [my] information was ignored because it did not fit certain preconceptions about Iraq, then a legitimate argument can be made that we went to war under false pretenses."

This is not the place to recount the extended dispute between the Bush White House and its critics, in Congress and in the press, about whether the administration's rationale for the Iraq invasion consisted of "false pretenses." But in the aftermath of solving one puzzle arising from Wilson's op-ed — why was he, of all people, dispatched by the CIA to Niger? — Plame's identity as an undercover officer was revealed by columnist Robert Novak. This, in turn, led to broader accusations of unlawful White House vengeance against the Wilsons and charges of myriad crimes, including but not limited to treason, and the inevitable appointment of a special prosecutor and congressional demands for impeachment.

In the end, sad to say, few reputations emerged unscathed. The particulars of Wilson's Times piece were largely discredited; the special prosecutor knew who had unmasked Plame but tried and convicted an innocent bystander. The press quickly chose sides and stuck to its stories despite the evidence. For their part, Plame and Wilson were the subjects of a glamorous photo shoot in Vanity Fair and a friendly 2010 movie where Wilson was played by Sean Penn. His 2004 bestseller was entitled The Politics of Truth: Inside the Lies that Led to War and Betrayed My Wife's CIA Identity: A Diplomat's Memoir.

Twins need Polanco at his best in ALDS

Texto completo: The Twins will open the American League Divisional Series on Friday night when they travel to New York to face the Yankees.
One of the biggest keys to the Twins success in this series will be the play of shortstop Jorge Polanco, who has done a little bit of everything for the club this season.
Only six players in the American League scored 100 runs, hit 20 home runs and 40 doubles in 2019 -- Xander Bogaerts, Rafael Devers and Mookie Betts of the Red Sox, Marcus Semien of the A's, Francisco Lindor of the Indians and Polanco.
It was a breakout campaign for Polanco, especially after last season when he was suspended 81 games for using a performance-enhancing drug.
He said that this year has been about rebuilding with the support of his teammates and coaches.
"From last year to this year, personally, you learn from mistakes and you move on and you keep working hard," he said through a translator.
When asked if there was a big reason why this year's Twins team had so much success, he pointed to the locker room.
"I think the biggest difference between this year and last year is that this year's team is together, playing together, supporting each other," he said.
Coming into this season, Polanco had hit .272 with 23 homers, 64 doubles and 125 runs scored in 288 career games. Still it was considered a gamble when the Twins signed him to a five-year, $25.75 million contract in the offseason.
Family, coaches help
Polanco said support from his family and coaches helped get him where he is this season.
"I believe my family has helped me to grow and mature, and also my coaches here in the big leagues," he said. "They give you their best and teach me to help me grow in the game and outside the game, too."
Polanco finished the year sixth in the American League in hits, fifth in doubles and triples, 10th in runs scored and eighth in wins above replacement for position players, according to Baseball Reference.
He said that as his game got better, pitchers came at him differently.
"They pitch to me one way today, a different way tomorrow," he said. "The same way they're making adjustments, I'm making adjustments, as well."
Does he feel any added pressure to perform?
"No, no, I don't feel any pressure," he said. "I just want to help the team win and go out there every day and do my job."
One area, he said, that has helped is his work with James Rowson, the Twins hitting coach.
"He helps you prepare for every single day for the mental aspect of the game," Polanco said. "If things are mentally right, you're going to go out there and execute your job."
For the Twins to find a way to top the Yankees, they'll need Polanco to be at his very best.
High scoring series
The two teams played an incredible series at Target Field in July -- with the Yankees winning two of three games and outscoring the Twins 30-27.
That series featured one of the best games of the year, a 14-12 win by the Yankees on a game-saving catch by former Twins center fielder Aaron Hicks in the 10th inning.
Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman told the New York Times, "We got out of Minnesota by the hair on our chinny-chin-chin."
Manager Aaron Boone said, "They're a beast."
Both clubs are waiting to finalize their 25-man playoff roster. According to the Times, the Yankees still are waiting to make a decision on slugger Edwin Encarnacion. And the Twins are waiting to see how infielder Luis Arraez recovers from his ankle injury.
Yankees players such as Gary Sanchez, Giancarlo Stanton and Luis Severino are recently back from injuries and the Twins have Marwin Gonzalez and Max Kepler looking like they'll be ready to play.
This should be a big offensive series.
Denver bested Vikings
If you thought the Vikings' 16-6 loss to the Bears on Sunday was disappointing, you will not be happy if you compare that game with the Bears' Week 2 win over the Broncos, who are 0-4.
In that game, the Bears needed a last-second field goal to escape with a 16-14 win in Denver.
Denver ran the ball 24 times for 90 yards -- with Royce Freeman going for 54 yards on 11 carries and Phillip Lindsay going for 36 yards on 13 carries. Compare that to the Vikings running backs, who came into Sunday leading the NFC in rushing, and finished with just 40 yards on 16 carries.
And quarterback Joe Flacco was able to throw for 292 yards against the Bears, completing 35 of 50 throws for 292 yards with a touchdown and an interception while being sacked just twice.
Meanwhile Kirk Cousins got sacked six times and completed 27 of 36 passes for 233 yards. But those stats don't really show how lopsided the game was -- in the first half Cousins was just 7-for-10 for 49 yards.
What's even more confusing is how the Bears were able to dominate the Vikings while missing defensive linemen Akiem Hicks and Bilal Nichols and linebacker Roquan Smith.
Looking back two weeks, the Broncos were able to actually control the clock against the Bears, winning the time of possession battle 32 minutes, 59 seconds to 27:01. On Sunday the Vikings had the ball for just 24:33 while the Bears had it for 35:27.
Offense has switched
When the Vikings announced their intentions to run the ball a lot more this season, there's no doubt that people thought they would still keep their passing game involved with wide receivers Adam Thielen and Stefon Diggs.
But the fact is that through four weeks, their offensive identity has completely flipped.
Last season at this time the Vikings ranked 12th in the league in total offense with 1,561 yards. This season they rank 23rd with 1,297 yards.
But here's the big difference -- this year the Vikings rank 31st in passing yards through four weeks with 676 yards compared to last year when they ranked fifth in passing yards with 1,309. But this season they rank second in the NFL with 621 rushing yards compared to last year when they were dead last through four weeks with 252.
There's no doubt that the Vikings wanted to change the identity of their offense, but they need to find more balance if they're going to be successful.

The Ascent Of Sara Moonves

Texto completo: "It's literally the most insane fashion week ever," said Sara Moonves, standing outside her Chinatown apartment one evening during New York Fashion Week waiting for an Uber.
Complaints about shuttling from shows in abandoned subway stations on the Lower East Side and former weapons facilities on Park Avenue is basically a prerequisite for working in fashion (particularly when having a town car driver is no longer standard operating procedure). But in Ms. Moonves's case, there was justification.
On June 25, Condé Nast sold W magazine to Future Media Group, the publisher of Surface, an independent fashion magazine, for less than $ 10 million. Stefano Tonchi, the editor of W for the last 9 years, was fired, and Ms. Moonves, its style director since 2017, ascended to the top role.
It so happens that Ms. Moonves didn't sound whiny talking about the insanity presently surrounding her. It was more gee golly wow. She was closing her first issue, wooing advertisers, flying to Los Angeles for a cover shoot, and then heading straight to London, Milan and Paris for three more weeks of fashion shows.
Although she is the daughter of Les Moonves -- the former head of CBS who was forced out after allegations of sexual harassment, about whom she has nothing to say besides "I love my dad" -- a woman who spent her childhood surrounded by celebrities, there is nothing jaded about her.
The shoots Ms. Moonves does with photographers like Tim Walker have an Alice in Wonderland-without-the-hangover quality. "Epic" and "amazing" are her two favorite adjectives.
Ms. Moonves, 34, also has a pack of best friends second only to Derek Blasberg, along with a can-do attitude that helps explain how she managed to become the youngest editor in chief of a major American fashion magazine by about a decade.
Still, this might not have happened but for the fact that things went terribly wrong between Marc Lotenberg, who bought the magazine, and its former editor, Mr. Tonchi.
The story, according to two sources briefed on the sale process, is that in the fall of 2018, when Condé Nast decided to sell the magazine, Mr. Tonchi was given a role in helping to find a buyer, for which he was paid a fee on top of his salary. This was an unusual arrangement. (Among those who were interested in acquiring the title was Mr. Moonves, according to an article in WWD, though a spokesman for Mr. Moonves told WWD that he "did not at any time make an offer to buy or invest in W.")
As the deal with Mr. Lotenberg began to close, disagreements arose over the size of what amounted to a signing bonus that Mr. Tonchi asked for, a sizable severance agreement, were he to be fired, and a noncompete clause that the buyer was asking for.
During the second week of June, Mr. Lotenberg met individually with senior staffers, one of whom was Ms. Moonves. Talks progressed from "what do you like and what do you want to change about the magazine?" to "what would you do as editor in chief?"
On Friday, June 21, as a lawyer worked on Ms. Moonves's deal, she flew to London for a scheduled cover shoot the following Monday with the singer Frank Ocean.
Then came a wrench. Frank Ocean behaved like Frank Ocean and ran several hours late for the shoot.
Ms. Moonves was torn. If she stayed on set, she would miss her flight back and the Tuesday announcement of her promotion. She wanted the chance to talk to staff members whom she valued and wanted to retain. If she told people at the magazine that she couldn't stay in London, they would be suspicious.
Returning to New York seemed like the better option.
The same day, Mr. Tonchi received a phone call from Condé Nast, asking him to come to a meeting at its World Trade Center headquarters. He realized he was going to be fired.
At 8 a.m. on Tuesday, June 25, he sat in an office with Anna Wintour, the company's artistic director, and a member of the human resources department, who proceeded to do just that.
On Wednesday, June 26, he sued Advance, the parent company of Condé Nast, for breach of contract, and people at W went back to work.
On Thursday, Advance countersued him.
"IT HAPPENED VERY QUICKLY," was all Ms. Moonves cared to say about her hiring as she stepped into a black Escalade bound for a Chelsea gallery, site of the spring Proenza Schouler show. She had on black pants from the Row, which is designed by two of her best friends, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen. On top she wore a leopardy, zebra-ish coat designed by Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez of Proenza Schouler, who are also two of her "best friends."
"Proenza for the Proenza show," Ms. Moonves said.
When the car arrived at the gallery, Ms. Moonves walked into the fashion equivalent of a college reunion, chatting with the model Karen Elson, the British Vogue editor Edward Enninful and the photographer Theo Wenner (all of whom she has worked with).
Ms. Moonves was seated in the front row next to W's editor at large, Lynn Hirschberg, who books the magazine's covers and is something of a legend in the business. Ms. Hirschberg started at Rolling Stone, after which she did long stints at Vanity Fair and The New York Times Magazine, where she wrote big stories about the business of Hollywood and wrangled celebrities for T: The New York Times Style Magazine. (Mr. Tonchi was the editor of T from 2004 to 2010.)
She left The Times in 2010 to go to W with Mr. Tonchi, but she grew increasingly exasperated with his behavior during the sale. So when Mr. Tonchi walked into the Proenza show and took his seat across the room, Ms. Hirschberg floated the idea of going over to let him have it.
"Not worth it," Ms. Moonves said. (Mr. Tonchi declined to comment for this article.)
The lights dimmed, house music blared, and models marched around the room in clothes that looked sort of Thierry Mugler as reimagined by Martin Margiela. It was a good collection, and Ms. Moonves headed backstage afterward for a quick kiss and hug with her boys. Rihanna's show was next, but a number of her staffers were going home.
Not Ms. Moonves. This was partly because she and RiRi share a publicist, Amanda Silverman. Ms. Moonves also has a fear of missing out that has been with her ever since she was a student at Harvard-Westlake school in Los Angeles, talking about Nicolas Ghesquière as if he were a god.
This was sometimes puzzling to Jonah Hill, the actor, who grew up with her. "The only things I knew about were skateboarding and hip-hop," he said. (He also called Ms. Moonves his "best friend.")
But she knew where she was headed.
In college, at New York University Gallatin School of Individualized Study, where she majored in journalism and photography, she interned at Vogue with Sally Singer, the magazine's features czar. After college, she went to Vogue as the assistant to Phyllis Posnick (who styled Irving Penn shoots).
When Ms. Singer left the magazine in 2010 to become the editor of T, Ms. Moonves went with her and began styling her own shoots. In 2013, when Ms. Singer returned to Vogue, Ms. Moonves followed and became a contributing fashion editor, working with photographers like Annie Leibovitz, Anton Corbijn and Inez van Lamsweerde.
Like many people with famous parents, the attendant connections accelerated her ascent. She also would not have gotten where she did had she not been able to do the job, particularly at Vogue. When she complained to her father about her editor's exacting standards, he said, "Well, they did make a movie about this."
Anyway, Ms. Moonves mostly loved Vogue, and Vogue mostly loved her back. "They're like my family," she said.
In 2017, Mr. Enninful, the fashion director of W, was hired by British Vogue, and Ms. Moonves became W's style director. One of the photographers she worked with most frequently was Tim Walker, who brings a quirky, Wes Anderson-like sensibility to fashion photography.
In an interview, he said that Ms. Moonves's skills as a stylist include personableness and an understanding that fashion exists in a larger cultural context.
"She doesn't have a pretentious bone in her body," he said. "She's very easy with people who are extraordinarily famous, but she's the same with my photo assistant as she is with Margot Robbie, although she did have a crush on Timothée Chalamet."
Ms. Moonves even helps call in clothes for civilians who need something great to wear on a big night. "My mom!" Mr. Hill said. "I was taking her to the Oscars. Sara didn't even tell me."
Don't bother asking him what the dress was. "I don't know," he said.
THE DAY AFTER New York Fashion Week ended, Ms. Moonves stood in a conference room on the 38th floor of Condé Nast's 1 World Trade Center headquarters. (The magazine will remain in the building until at least June 2020.)
The walls were papered with pages from the October issue, Ms. Moonves's first as the editor in chief. The theme was "the new originals," which Ms. Moonves -- she had on Loewe sneakers and a chunky black sweater and skirt, both from the Row -- thought was fitting, signaling a "new chapter" in the magazine's history.
The issue didn't look like a wholesale reinvention of Mr. Tonchi's magazine, but it was earthier and more playful. There are two covers. One has the Spanish singer Rosalía; the other has Mr. Ocean, who was photographed by Mr. Walker and has no styling credit.
"Frank styled himself," Ms. Moonves said.
In between were pictures of the fashion photographer, video director and illustrator Jean-Paul Goude; the West Coast style maven Lisa Eisner; the country singer Kacey Musgraves; and the artist Alex Katz, whose photograph was by taken by Ms. Moonves's boyfriend, Jeff Henrikson. ("I know," she said of their relationship. "A photographer and a stylist. What a cliché.")
In one nod to the magazine's past, Ms. Moonves removed the Tonchi-era W logo and replaced it with what she called a "new version of the old W," the one run until 2010 by Patrick McCarthy and Dennis Freedman.
Their W, she said "was epic."
Of course, Mr. McCarthy and Mr. Freedman's magazine benefited greatly from Condé Nast's lucrative arrangements with top photographers who could shoot their more commercial work for Vogue, Vanity Fair and Glamour while using W for provocative fashion spreads (Think: Brad Pitt facedown on the floor, butt exposed, and Tom Ford playing with sex toys.)
Ms. Moonves isn't sure whether she will retain access to all of them, but she professed not to be worried about how the magazine will fare under a new owner whose main experience in publishing is an independent magazine with shoestring budgets and a faulty credit history.
A group of editors walked in to go over final proofs of the issue and a reporter raised an eyebrow about the likelihood that the meeting had been staged for a newspaper article. "This is very much a real meeting!" Ms. Moonves said. "Really not fake!"
But it didn't last long. She was "literally" about to jump into a car and head to the airport.
While she was away, I called Ms. Hirschberg, who told a story about how she had trailed Mr. Moonves to the network upfronts in 1995 for a New York Magazine article she wrote about him. Backstage, she spotted a 10-year-old girl running around talking to everyone.
"'That's Sara,"' Ms. Hirschberg recalled Mr. Moonves saying. "'One day, we'll all be working for her."'

Texto completo: A museum exhibition offers an empathetic look at the intimate lives of sex workers in the L.G.B.T. community.
A pair of tartan-patterned pole dance pumps, a tiny pleated schoolgirl skirt and a leather merry widow -- they emerged one by one from a nondescript cardboard carton, the raffish trappings of the sex trade.
"I wonder what kind of mark this would leave?" Nelson Santos, the acting director of curatorial programs at the Leslie-Lohman Museum in SoHo, joked offhandedly as he sorted those items, flicking at a riding crop with a pussycat's head at its tip. Some of them are woven into an installation that opens on Sept. 28, a highlight of an exhibition titled "On Our Backs: The Revolutionary Art of Queer Sex Work."
The show was conceived, said Gonzalo Casals, the museum director, as an intimate platform for artwork that holds up a mirror to the lives of sex workers in the L.G.B.T.Q. community, some pieces by artists who themselves worked as prostitutes. Made up of installations, photographs and vignettes -- a street scene, a boudoir, a peep-show booth -- it aims to offer a finely grained, overtly empathetic portrait of a marginalized society.
What it offers as vividly is a glimpse of the brash theatricality that underpins the world's most ancient profession. Sex work is performance, after all, the show's producers argue.
"Whether a stripper or hustler is stepping out from behind a curtain or the bathroom door, that person is stepping onto a stage, creating a persona through costumes and props," said Alexis Heller, the curator of the show.
Onstage or off duty, sex workers' accouterments form the subversive foundation of role play. Leather corsets, harnesses, fishnets and thigh-high boots, each part of a sex worker's arsenal, may seem familiar, even trite, to anyone who has watched a strip show or, for that matter, viewed similar items parading along a fashion runway, where they have asserted their status as part of a kinky perma-trend.
For some sex workers, though, such objects remain close to sacrosanct, acquiring, over years of service, a talismanic glow.
"There are people who will wear the same color lipstick for every performance," Ms. Heller said. "Many of them are unwilling to part with the props that have long been essential to their practice."
That point is underscored in an installation by Midori, a sex educator and performer. A web curtain woven from Japanese rope ties, it is embedded with bustiers, powder compacts and other miscellany of the trade. "That curtain," Ms. Heller said, "is meant to give the sex worker a chance to let those props go."
Far from a portrait of victimhood and degradation, the installation, like the show itself, confers on its subjects an air of self-possession. There is an un-self-conscious dignity in the portraits of Leon Mostovoy, a transgender photographer who worked in San Francisco during the 1990s. His "Market Street Cinema" series offers shadowy glimpses of lingerie-clad strippers primping or striking louche poses backstage.
Ben Cuevas transposes images of hustlers from the '70s and '80s into contemporary settings that, in another era, were home to gritty sex emporiums like Show World in Times Square (once known as the McDonald's of sex), their garb all but indistinguishable from the wardrobes of many a contemporary suburban mom.
"Fashion has been enormously influenced by sex work, and vice versa," Mr. Santos said. "Today that influence is much more a part of the conversation than it was in the past." Public outrage has subsided for sure since the '70s, when Yves Saint Laurent scandalized spectators with a collection of fur chubbies and abbreviated skirts inspired by the wartime prostitutes of the rue Saint-Denis.
These days, designers making reference to hustlers and showgirls tend to equate the totems of the trade as expressions of self-assurance -- a kinky variation on power dressing. It's a notion not lost on the creators of "Hustlers." The tight jeans, spandex leggings and clingy bodysuits worn by Jennifer Lopez and her stripper companions in that film serve as a virtual armor intended, consciously or otherwise, to signal cool invulnerability.
True, such portrayals tend to be rife with clichés, the trappings of sex work having long been absorbed into fashion's mainstream. They are so deeply embedded in the popular culture that most have lost their darker associations.
Fashion and film don't produce a vast range of ideas about what sexuality, and in particular female sexuality, looks like, as Annie Sprinkle, the writer, sex educator and former prostitute, told The New York Times in 2017.
"Still, there are a lot of political implications, a lot of activism to these clothes," said Ms. Sprinkle, whose work is represented in the exhibition. "In the right context, a garter belt can pack a wallop."
The exhibition aims to provide such a context, its debut an openhearted response to a sociopolitical climate of censoriousness and repression. "In some ways," as Mr. Santos glumly observed, "we seem to be going backward instead of forward."
The show is not so much a call to action as a bid for the acceptance of a maligned community. "Sex workers are still being criminalized," Mr. Casals said. "Our goal is to change hearts and minds. And our work is far from done."

REY'S A FLEA-MARKET FIND LED BY A VETERAN CHEF

Texto completo: Rey's Island Grille sits tucked between the booths of gadgets and tropical tchotchkes at Flamingo Island Flea Market in Bonita Springs, but it's no ordinary flea market snack shack.
At Rey's you won't find corn dogs or frozen french fries. No, Rey's serves up a combination of Caribbean island cuisine and top-notch lunch and breakfast specials, most made from scratch by a longtime chef.
"When people see the flea market, they think we're just a regular, run-of-the mill flea market restaurant," chef-owner Rey Rangel said.
"I've been a chef for 20 years, and I've cooked for a lot of famous people. I've been doing this for a long time, and when customers come in they have a trained chef cooking for them."
On his menu Rangel pulls from his Caribbean heritage — he's originally from Trinidad and Tobago — for daily specials such as braised oxtails, curry chicken, jerk chicken, plantains, beans and rice, plus coleslaw with a tropical twist and a spicy, peppery kick.
But his food isn't only island-specific. Rangel serves up flatbreads and pizzas, plus burgers made from fresh-ground prime rib. One of the most popular versions comes topped with avocado, applewood smoked bacon and a fried egg.
"It's not just your normal burger," Rangel said.
On his breakfast menu, Rangel offers classic hot breakfast favorites like French toast with scrambled eggs and bacon, plus specials such as the chorizo, egg and cheese wrap, and the "Green Monster," which features scrambled eggs with spinach, feta and tomatoes with a side of avocado toast.
The restaurant serves breakfast all day and also has baked goods, including cupcakes and cinnamon rolls Rangel bakes himself.
Before opening at Flamingo Island, Rangel owned the Hot Caboose Island Grill in Bonita Springs. The Hot Caboose was located inside the historic Dixie Moon Cafe building on Old 41. The building was relocated last year in order to preserve it from destruction. Before moving to Florida, Rangel owned three restaurants in the New York and New Jersey area. One, a French restaurant, pulled on his classical training. The others, both Caribbean-influenced, drew inspiration from his family and upbringing.
Hidden like it is inside the flea market, Rey's Island Grille is the kind of spot that draws in-the-know foodies. Rangel has people drive from as far away as Fort Lauderdale to dig into platefuls of his daily specials, and Rangel said there's an American Airlines pilot who makes sure to swing by every time he flies into town.
"The business has grown a lot over the past year," Rangel said. "I get a lot of repeat customers. It's really been great."
For those planning to stop in, take note: the restaurant is only open when the flea market is open — Friday, Saturday and Sunday from 8 a.m.-4 p.m. That way, you can pick up some island trinkets on the way to chef-cooked Caribbean flavors.

Texto completo: Los agentes de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas ( ICE ) tienen diversas estrategias para vigilar física y virtualmente a los inmigrantes que buscan detener y deportar y, constantemente, modifica sus estrategias para mejorar.
Así lo reporta The New York Times, que señala que el “negocio de la deportación… ha sido transformado por el poder del big data” , lo que ha obligado a los agentes migratorios a modificar sus estrategias, sobre todo considerando que el Pew Research Center reporta que hay 10.5 millones de indocumentados en el país contra 6,100 oficiales de ‘La Migra’. Entonces, necesita hacer más con menos.
“Hay una escasez continua de personal en la agencia, donde la satisfacción laboral, aunque en aumento con (Donald) Trump , sigue siendo notablemente baja”, indica el reporte. “Existe una presión incesante de la Casa Blanca para deportar a las personas. Por lo tanto, ICE intenta encontrar eficiencias donde pueda, y utiliza tecnología, alguna de ésta diseñada para los consumidores, otras para espías o la policía, para hacer más con menos” .
La agencia no quiso compartir sobre sus técnicas de investigación, pero el Times revisó registros públicos que los oficiales de ICE revisan “terabytes de información de cientos de sistemas informáticos”.
Esos datos sobre inmigrantes provienen de gobiernos estatales y locales, de corredores de datos privados y de redes sociales.
Oficiales actuales y retirados indican que el perfil de capturas de indocumentados ha cambiado, ahora no solamente se captura a criminales, sino aquellos que hayan violado la ley migratoria, incluso los agentes completaban los procedimientos cuidadosamente antes de realizar un arresto.
“Antes de intentar un arresto, completaron un formulario, la ‘hoja de trabajo de operaciones de campo’, y lo aprobaron dos niveles de supervisores. Cuando se les da la opción, siempre perseguirían a alguien con antecedentes penales graves en lugar de a alguien sin él”, indica el Times, aunque ahora eso ha cambiado. “Las decisiones de segmentación también dependen de quién se puede encontrar. Y hoy, a quién pueden encontrar depende de quién ha dejado un rastro para que los oficiales lo sigan: personas con licencias de conducir , personas con seguro de automóvil , personas con facturas de servicios públicos , personas que pagan impuestos estadounidenses , personas con cuentas de redes sociales , personas con hogares estables , personas con niños nacidos en Estados Unidos… personas que alguna vez pensaron, aunque solo fuera por un momento, que no estaban en la lista”.
La agencia se basa en software y acuerdos de intercambio originalmente destinados a investigadores criminales y antiterroristas, “fusionando pequeños trozos de información perdida” en reportes.
“El trabajo está regulado solo por un conjunto de leyes de privacidad obsoletas y los límites de la tecnología” , alerta el Times que indica que los agentes revisan llamadas de voz y video de los detenidos en las instalaciones de ICE, así como las bases de datos de DMV sobre licencias y otros sistemas de información como CLEAR, de Thomson Reuters, dirigidos a inmigrantes.
La agencia revisa prácticamente todo en tiempo real, incluso a estadounidenses.
“Hay monitoreo mundial de los residentes estadounidenses. Todavía es una vista parcial. Pero es suficiente para mostrar la escala de la máquina”, indica.

5 things to know about potential return for Schiano

Texto completo: Rutgers University athletics director Pat Hobbs says for the next two months he'll oversee the search for a replacement for fired football head coach Chris Ash. Nunzio Campanile is the interim head coach for now.
Speculation is rampant that former Rutgers coach Greg Schiano will be a frontrunner. Schiano went 68-67 in his 12 seasons here (before the school joined the Big Ten), including a stretch from 2005-11 where the Scarlet Knights were 56-33 with six bowl appearances.
In 2006, Rutgers was 11-2 with a win over No. 3 Louisville, a week spent inside the AP Top 10, and a school-record No. 12 finish in the AP poll.
So will Schiano return? Here's what you need to know:
Schiano is not a frontrunner... yet
When asked on Monday, Hobbs did not directly reference Schiano but also did not rule out the possibility that the former coach is in the mix.
"Anybody who can help Rutgers football be competitive and win conference championships is a candidate for this position," Hobbs said.
Despite speculation that Schiano could be a favorite for the job, Hobbs said he has not spoken to or met with any potential candidates yet.
"No, and I'll repeat that because I know there's been reports out there of agreements and other things," Hobbs said. "I have had no conversations with anyone about the permanent position of being the head football coach at Rutgers University."
The Tennessee controversy
The University of Tennessee planned to hire Schiano as its new head coach in 2017, but school officials changed their minds after many Vols' fans, donors and politicians balked at the hire. Their complaints stemmed from Schiano's background as an assistant at Penn State during Jerry Sandusky's tenure as the Nittany Lions' defensive coordinator. Sandusky is serving 30 to 60 years in prison for his conviction on 45 counts of sexual abuse. Schiano has said he had no knowledge of Sandusky's crimes. Tennessee school officials said they fully vetted Schiano, including examining his time at Penn State.
The Schiano file
Schiano left Rutgers for a job with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2012 for his first-ever head coaching job at the professional level. He compiled a 11-21 record in two seasons before being fired in 2013.
He then coached two years at Berkeley Prep in Tampa before Urban Meyer hired him to be Ohio State's defensive coordinator and associate head coach in 2016.
Right now, he's not coaching
After three years with the Buckeyes, it was announced in early 2019 that Schiano would not be returning to the team. Reports suggested that the New England Patriots were hiring Schiano to be defensive coordinator, but he suddenly resigned due to his wishes to spend more time with his "faith and family."
Would a Schiano return mean The Chop is coming back?
The Rutgers football team's rallying cry was "Keep Chopping" during the Schiano tenure (Ash did away with the mantra. replacing it with "The Hunt"). Schiano started the craze after the 2005 opening game, when Rutgers blew a 20-point lead at Illinois and he had no idea what to say, according to the New York Times. Schiano gathered his players in a meeting room and recalled the words of a sports psychologist he once met at the University of Miami who told the team that playing football was like chopping wood. It caught on: It was not uncommon for a player to refer to a game as a "60-minute chop" and explain a big hit by saying, "I got my chop on."
Greg Schiano went 68-67 in his 12 seasons at Rutgers, before the school joined the Big Ten. Schiano left Rutgers in 2012 to be a head coach of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

Texto completo: A new autopsy suggests a hotel handyman who died during a fight with a tourist from Connecticut had taken a lethal amount of cocaine.
A banker from Connecticut visiting the Caribbean island of Anguilla with his family in April answered a knock at the door of his resort suite and found an employee who said he had come to fix a sink.
The two men began fighting almost immediately. The tourist, a former football player named Gavin Scott Hapgood, overpowered the smaller employee, Kenny Mitchel, and pinned him until the police arrived. Mr. Mitchel, 27, died soon after, and when a coroner ruled he had been asphyxiated during the struggle, Mr. Hapgood, 44, was charged with manslaughter.
Now that same coroner's revised autopsy report based on recently released toxicology tests has upended the narrative of what happened at the Malliouhana resort that day, finding that Mr. Mitchel died not from injuries related to the fight, but from a lethal dose of cocaine.
The new report suggests he had so much cocaine in his bloodstream that he was essentially a dying man when he entered Mr. Hapgood's suite that day.
"Acute cocaine toxicity could have been a potentially independent cause of death in the known circumstances," reads the report by Dr. Stephen King, who oversaw the autopsy. The revised report, dated Sept. 3, was obtained by The New York Times.
A separate analysis of the new autopsy, conducted at the request of Mr. Hapgood's lawyers by the Chief Medical Examiner for the state of Maryland, Dr. David R. Fowler, led to a similar finding. Also obtained by The Times, the report described cocaine levels in Mr. Mitchel's bloodstream "twice that commonly accepted to have a fatal outcome," causing his lungs to fill with blood and suffocating him.
The revised report also seems to bolster the defense claim that Mr. Mitchel was behaving erratically and aggressively, common side effects for that level of drug use. Mr. Hapgood has said Mr. Mitchel threatened him with a knife and demanded money. Mr. Mitchel's blood also had alcohol levels at twice the legal limit.
It remains unclear how the new toxicology findings will affect the prosecution. The attorney general in Anguilla, Dwight Horsford, has declined to discuss the case, which has moved slowly since Mr. Hapgood's arrest following the fight on April 13. The defendant was allowed to post a bond of $ 74,000 and return to his home in Darien, Conn., sparking an outcry on the island that a tourist was receiving preferential treatment.
Mr. Hapgood returned to Anguilla several times last month for preliminary hearings in court that were closed to the public. Those hearings have been adjourned until Nov. 11. Mr. Hapgood, who was traveling with his wife and three children, has been placed on leave by his employer, UBS Investment Bank, pending the outcome of the case.
A GoFundMe page seeking donations to the family raised more than $ 250,000 before the site pulled it down last week, the Darien Times reported. It is against the site's policy to allow raising money for a defendant accused of a violent crime.
After months of silence, Mr. Hapgood recently spoke out about the case, repeating his claim of self-defense both outside the Anguilla courthouse and at a news conference in Manhattan.
"We're hanging on by a thread, to be honest with you," he told reporters. "It was a terrifying incident."
The revised autopsy suggests that Mr. Mitchel may likely have died regardless of where he was that afternoon.
Different people react to cocaine differently depending on a variety of factors. But it is a widely accepted finding that 900 nanograms of cocaine per milliliter in the bloodstream is potentially lethal.
Mr. Mitchel's level was more than twice that amount -- 1,900 nanograms per milliliter, according to toxicology reports released in September. Another substance, benzoylecgonine, which is produced when cocaine is broken down, was found in high quantities, -- 1,700 nanograms per milliliter -- suggesting he had repeatedly used cocaine in the days before his death.
The Chief Medical Examiner in New York City, Dr. Barbara Sampson, cautioned in an interview on Tuesday that there were no absolute rules in cases involving cocaine.
"There is no 'safe level' of cocaine, and there is no uniformly lethal number, either," she said. "The interpretation of cocaine levels is very difficult. It has to be analyzed in context with the whole case."
She said the widely used textbook in this area, "Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemical in Man," offered a range of 900 to 2,100 nanograms of cocaine as potentially lethal.
Dr. Fowler found in his analysis that the cocaine likely caused the asphyxiation that contributed to Mr. Mitchel's death. In similar cases involving cocaine, the walls of the lung's air sacs break down and fill with blood, "preventing air exchange," Dr. Fowler wrote.
A person experiencing this degree of shortness of breath would survive only if treated immediately with a ventilator in a hospital's intensive-care unit, Dr. Fowler wrote.
Mr. Mitchel's blood-alcohol level was 0.18, according to the report.
In the days and weeks after his death, Mr. Mitchel's family and supporters spoke out in his support, describing him as a hard worker and happy father.
Yet, that profile was complicated by an arrest a few weeks before his death, when Mr. Mitchel was charged with rape. The woman who made the complaint in that case was his former girlfriend, Emily Garlick, with whom he shared a young daughter.
She later pulled back the accusation in an interview, saying the incident was an argument and no crime took place. On Tuesday, she continued to defend Mr. Mitchel, saying she did not know him to use cocaine.
"He hid that from me if he did," Ms. Garlick said on Tuesday. "He went out with his friends the night before. They said he was fine, he was good."
She said she doubted the new autopsy findings. "How can they just change it like that?" she said.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — President Trump recently asked the Australian prime minister and other foreign leaders to help Attorney General William Barr with an investigation into the origins of the Russia probe that shadowed his administration for more than two years, the Justice Department said Monday.
The White House curbed access to a transcript of the call with Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia — which the president made at Barr's request — to a small group of aides, a US official said. The restriction was unusual and similar to the handling of a July call with the Ukrainian president at the heart of House Democrats' impeachment inquiry.
Like that call, Trump's recent discussion with Morrison shows the president using high-level diplomacy to advance his personal political interests — in this case, a Justice Department inquiry that Trump hopes will discredit the investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.
The Justice Department inquiry and a parallel but unconnected effort by the president's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani represent a kind of two-front war. Trump has said that Barr can help him validate his 2016 electoral victory and seems eager for Giuliani to help him in 2020 by trying to unearth damaging information about former vice president Joe Biden.
Barr in recent months has asked the president to facilitate communications with foreign officials and has made at least one trip to Italy to secure cooperation for the Justice Department review, according to a department official. The review is examining US intelligence and law enforcement activity around the Trump campaign and whether it was lawfully predicated.
Trump initiated the discussion in recent weeks with Morrison explicitly for the purpose of requesting Australia's help in the Justice Department review of the Russia investigation, according to two people with knowledge of the discussion. Barr requested that Trump speak to Morrison, one of the people said. It came only weeks after Trump seemed to make military aid to Ukraine contingent on Zelensky doing him the “favor" of helping Barr.
The Washington Post on Monday reported a similar set of overtures by Barr to seek help from foreign intelligence officials on the Justice Department inquiry.
The direct involvement of the nation's top law enforcement official shows the priority Barr places on the investigation being conducted by John Durham, the US attorney in Connecticut, who has been assigned the sensitive task of reviewing US intelligence work surrounding the 2016 election and its aftermath.
Monday night, Justice spokeswoman Kerri Kupec confirmed the Trump call to Morrison and other foreign leaders.
"At Attorney General Barr's request, the president has contacted other countries to ask them to introduce the attorney general and Mr. Durham to appropriate officials," Kupec said.
Current and former intelligence and law enforcement officials expressed frustration and alarm Monday that the head of the Justice Department was taking such a direct role in re-examining what they view as conspiracy theories and baseless allegations of misconduct.
Justice Department officials have said that it would be neither illegal nor untoward for Trump to ask world leaders to cooperate with Barr. And it is within Barr's powers to speak with foreign law enforcement officials about what his prosecutor needs from them.
In the request to Australia, Trump was in effect asking the Australian government to investigate itself. The FBI's counterintelligence investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election began after Australian officials told the bureau that the Russian government had made overtures to the Trump campaign about releasing political damaging information about Hillary Clinton.
Australian officials shared that information after its top official in Britain met in London in May 2016 with George Papadopoulos, a Trump campaign foreign policy adviser who told the Australians about the Russian dirt on Clinton.
Papadopoulos also said that he had heard that the Russians had “thousands" of Clinton's e-mails from Joseph Mifsud, an academic. Mifsud, who was last seen working as a visiting professor in Rome, has disappeared. Trump allies, like the president's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, have put forth an unsubstantiated claim that Western intelligence agencies planted Mifsud to trap Papadopoulos.
Barr began a review of the Russia investigation this year with the stated goal of determining whether law enforcement or intelligence officials acted inappropriately in their decision during the height of the 2016 presidential campaign to begin investigating whether the Trump campaign was conspiring with Russia's election interference. But the president has made no secret he sees a larger purpose: to validate his victory and to settle scores with his perceived “deep state" enemies.
The investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election outraged Trump, who cast it as a politically motivated "witch hunt."
The Justice Department said last week that it is exploring the extent to which other countries, including Ukraine, “played a role in the counterintelligence investigation directed at the Trump campaign." At the very least, Barr has made it clear that he sees his work treading into sensitive territory: how the law enforcement and intelligence agencies of the United States' closest allies share information with US officials.
Mueller's investigation confirmed that Australia played a central role in the origins of the original FBI investigation, even if his final report does not mention the country by name. It said that information from a “foreign government" prompted the FBI to “open an investigation into whether individuals associated with the Trump campaign were coordinating with the Russian government in its interference activities."
Morrison, the Australian prime minister, met Trump in Washington this month for official meetings and a state dinner at the White House. Barr attended the dinner.
On Monday evening, a spokesman for Morrison said that “the Australian government has always been ready to assist and cooperate with efforts that help shed further light on the matters under investigation."
“The PM confirmed this readiness once again in conversation with the president," he added.
Barr has taken an active role in overseeing Durham's work, American officials said, and is pushing his team to work as quickly as possible, according to other people familiar with the investigation. Durham needs to identify key witnesses and go through the time-consuming process of procuring documents or other material from foreign governments, a lawyer briefed on the case said.
The attorney general sparked a controversy in April when he said during congressional testimony that “spying" on the Trump campaign had taken place as part of the Russia investigation and that there was a “failure among a group of leaders at the upper echelons" of the intelligence community. He later announced that he was reviewing the origins of the Russia investigation.

Trump is right to want the whistleblower's identity, and he should get it

Texto completo: The national media have decided that it’s inappropriate for President Trump to inquire about the identity of a whistleblower who is accusing him of abusing power. But Trump has every reason to want to know.
Oh, and as it turns out, the first people to find out about the whistleblower’s identity, and share details about him with the world, were none other than four journalists at the New York Times.
When Trump was asked by a reporter Monday at the White House whether he knew the identity of the whistleblower, the president said he was “trying to find out.” Of course he is. Who isn’t interested in learning more about the intelligence official who just kicked off an impeachment inquiry against a sitting president? Who isn’t curious about that person’s motives?
Trump is always expected to sit with his hands tied behind his back and a blindfold over his eyes whenever he’s under siege. And so liberals immediately attacked him for suggesting that he might want to know who it was that just accused him of misconduct.
“The whistleblower’s identity is protected by law,” tweeted Renato Mariotti, a legal analyst for CNN. “Trump is trying to retaliate against a witness in plain sight.”
Mariotti might look up the word “retaliate,” because at least as of Tuesday, it did not mean “learning more about the person who just accused a sitting president of abusing his office.”
Regardless of whether there are laws that allow a government whistleblower to make allegations of wrongdoing from anonymity, that doesn’t mean people aren’t free to find out who it is on their own.
The New York Times already knows who it is, not because the whistleblower came to the paper’s reporters ready to reveal himself but because the Times, like everyone else, wanted to know.
The Times last week reported the name of the whistleblower’s lawyer, that the whistleblower is a CIA officer, and that he had worked for some time in the White House. If the most important national paper in the country gets to know who it is and share information about him, why shouldn’t anyone else be allowed to know, especially the person who’s being accused of wrongdoing?
Reasons liberals have for wanting to keep the whistleblower anonymous are clear. It’s asymmetrical warfare. The less Trump knows about where the allegations are coming from, the weaker his position in defending himself.
Trump is allowed to want to know who’s making these claims against him, and he would be right to find out.

Texto completo: President Trump discussed filling a border trench with alligators or snakes during private border security discussions.
During the height of border tensions within the White House in March, Trump privately floated a number of extreme ideas to defend against migrants. Those ideas included a water-filled trench stocked with either alligators or snakes and an electric wall with the ability to pierce human flesh, according the New York Times.
After the president suggested shooting migrants who threw rocks, staff informed him that it was illegal, and he backed off of the idea before wondering in a later meeting about shooting migrants in the legs to slow them down, which staff informed him was also illegal.
When Trump floated the ideas in March came at a time in which Trump also ordered advisers to shut down the whole 2,000 mile border by noon on the day following the meeting. Staff feared that doing so would strand tourists in Mexico and would lead to an economic meltdown. Trump backed off the idea after a week of meetings but began firing aides that had gone against him.
“The president was frustrated and I think he took that moment to hit the reset button,” said Thomas Homan, Trump’s former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. “The president wanted it to be fixed quickly.”
One meeting that was supposed to be 30 minutes ended two hours later with staff attempting to appease him.
“You are making me look like an idiot!” Trump shouted to those in the room. “I ran on this. It’s my issue.”
In the following weeks, there was a shakeup within the Department of Homeland Security that included the departure of Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.
The Washington Examiner has reached out to the White House for comment on the report.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Attorney General William Barr has held private meetings overseas with foreign intelligence officials seeking their help in a Justice Department inquiry that President Donald Trump hopes will discredit U.S. intelligence agencies’ examination of possible connections between Russia and members of the Trump campaign during the 2016 election.
And Trump has assisted with Barr’s efforts by calling other countries’ leaders, including the Australian prime minister in a recent phone call.
Justice Department and White House spokesmen, as well as an Australian government spokesman, confirmed and defended the efforts after The Washington Post and The New York Times reported them, citing people familiar with the matter.
Barr’s personal involvement is likely to stoke further criticism from Democrats pursuing impeachment that he is helping the Trump administration use executive branch powers to augment investigations aimed primarily at the president’s adversaries.
But the high-level Justice Department focus on intelligence operatives’ conduct matches Trump’s and conservatives’ "investigate the investigators" rallying cry. Barr has voiced his own concerns, telling lawmakers in April that he believed "spying did occur" when it came to the U.S. investigation of the Trump campaign.
The direct involvement of the nation’s top law enforcement official shows the priority Barr places on the investigation being conducted by John Durham, the U.S. attorney in Connecticut, who has been assigned the sensitive task of reviewing U.S. intelligence work surrounding the 2016 election and its aftermath.
Current and former intelligence and law enforcement officials expressed frustration and alarm Monday that the head of the Justice Department was taking such a direct role in re-examining what they view as conspiracy theories and baseless allegations of misconduct in the three-year-old election.
Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec did not name the countries in her statement. But Barr has already made overtures to British intelligence officials, and last week the attorney general traveled to Italy, where he and Durham met senior Italian government officials and Barr asked the Italians to assist Durham, according to one person familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive issue.
It was not Barr’s first trip to Italy to meet intelligence officials, the person said. The Trump administration has made similar requests of Australia, said people who discussed the interactions on the condition of anonymity.
In a recent phone call, Trump urged Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison to provide assistance to the ongoing Justice Department inquiry, the people said. Trump made the request at Barr’s urging, they said. The Trump phone call was first reported by The New York Times and later confirmed by an Australian government spokesman who said his government was ready to "help shed further light on the matters under investigation," Bloomberg reported.
Trump administration officials defended the moves as above board.
"I’m old enough to remember when Democrats actually wanted to find out what happened in the 2016 election," White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said. "The Democrats clearly don’t want the truth to come out anymore as it might hurt them politically, but this call relates to a DOJ inquiry publicly announced months ago to uncover exactly what happened. The DOJ simply requested the President provide introductions to facilitate that ongoing inquiry, and he did so, that’s all."
Kupec said, "Mr. Durham is gathering information from numerous sources, including a number of foreign countries. At Attorney General Barr’s request, the President has contacted other countries to ask them to introduce the Attorney General and Mr. Durham to appropriate officials."
In a statement, a spokesperson for the Australian government said it has "always been ready to assist and cooperate with efforts that help shed further light on the matters under investigation. The [prime minister] confirmed this readiness once again in a conversation with the President."
Trump still complains frequently that those involved in the investigation of his campaign should be charged with crimes, asserting the FBI search for possible election season collusion between Russia and Trump campaign officials was a witch hunt spurred by agents and bureaucrats opposed to Trump becoming president. That investigation ended earlier this year when special counsel Robert Mueller determined there was insufficient evidence to charge any Americans with conspiring with Russia and declined to reach a decision about whether the president had sought to obstruct justice.
David Laufman, a former Justice Department official who was involved in the early stages of the Russia probe, said it was "fairly unorthodox for the attorney general personally to be flying around the world as a point person to further evidence-gathering for a specific Justice Department investigation," and especially so in Barr’s case.
Barr’s direct involvement in the effort also helps explain part of the controversial July phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. A rough transcript of that call shows Trump said he wanted Ukrainian assistance to help find out "what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine," and possible involvement with the Democratic National Committee computer system that U.S. agencies have determined was hacked by Russian intelligence ahead of the 2016 election.
Some of the president’s supporters have suggested Ukraine had a more direct role in the 2016 investigation than currently known, an assertion denied by current and former officials who were involved in the original probe.
A spokesperson for the CIA declined to comment, citing the ongoing review.
A former senior U.S. intelligence official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the ongoing investigation denied that the CIA was involved in monitoring any members of the Trump campaign. Any such operations were conducted by the FBI and were lawful, the former official said, emphasizing that the CIA focused on Russia’s interference in the election, and the role that Russian officials and intelligence agencies played.

Texto completo: Over the past week, the president has accused Democratic lawmakers of lying and hypocrisy on dealings with Ukraine. Here are the facts behind his claims.
This is exaggerated.
President Trump was referring to statements made by Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California, during a congressional hearing last week about the July 25 phone call between Mr. Trump and the president of Ukraine. That call is part of a whistle-blower complaint that led Democrats to begin an impeachment hearing.
Mr. Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, did not claim to be reciting from the reconstructed transcript of the call and said he was conferring "the essence" of the conversation, "shorn of its rambling character and in not so many words." But he did speak in first person, leaving an impression that he was quoting Mr. Trump.
Later in the hearing, Mr. Schiff said that his "summary of the president's call was meant to be at least part in parody." Mr. Schiff described Mr. Trump's side of the call as a "classic organized crime shakedown." His account veered from the transcript in chronology and details at points, and seemed intended to put additional attention on the implication that Mr. Trump was demanding something from Ukraine in return for the assistance the United States had provided the country, but it generally tracked with the transcript's version of what Mr. Trump said on the call.
First, Mr. Schiff said President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine expressed "his interest in meeting with the president and says his country wants to acquire more weapons from us to defend itself."
The transcript, which was not verbatim and contained several ellipses, does show Mr. Zelensky saying Ukraine is "almost ready to buy more Javelins from the United States for defense purposes." Later in the call -- not before Mr. Trump spoke, as Mr. Schiff suggested -- Mr. Zelensky thanked Mr. Trump for his invitation to visit Washington and said he was hopeful for a future meeting.
Then, according to Mr. Schiff, Mr. Trump essentially responded, "We've been very good to your country, very good. No other country has done as much as we have, but you know what, I don't see much reciprocity here. I hear what you want. I have a favor I want from you, though."
This is supported by the transcript in which Mr. Trump is quoted as saying the United States does "much more than the European countries are doing."
"And it got almost no attention, but in May, CNN reported that Senators Robert Menendez, Richard Durbin and Patrick Leahy wrote a letter to Ukraine's prosecutor general expressing concern at the closing of four investigations they said were 'critical.' In the letter, they implied that their support for U.S. assistance to Ukraine was at stake and that if they didn't do the right thing, they wouldn't get any assistance. Gee, doesn't that sound familiar? Doesn't that sound familiar?"
-- at a news conference on Sept. 25
This is exaggerated.
The three Democratic senators did write a letter to Yuriy Lutsenko, then Ukraine's prosecutor general, in May 2018. Mr. Trump's claim of an implied ultimatum is a matter of interpretation, but the letter does not include an overt threat of withholding foreign aid if Ukrainian officials "didn't do the right thing."
In the letter, the senators expressed concerns over a New York Times report that Mr. Lutsenko's office had frozen investigations related to the special counsel investigation led by Robert S. Mueller III because officials were wary of offending Mr. Trump. They also asked Mr. Lutsenko three questions about Ukraine's cooperation with Mr. Mueller and whether Mr. Trump or his aides had tried to impede any cooperation.
"As strong advocates for a robust and close relationship with Ukraine, we believe that our cooperation should extend to such legal matters, regardless of politics," they wrote, adding, "If these reports are true, we strongly encourage you to reverse course."
The only direct mention of foreign aid was in relation to The Times' reporting about the limited cooperation with Mr. Mueller's investigation: "The article notes that your office considered these cases as too politically sensitive and potentially jeopardizing U.S. financial and military aid to Ukraine."
"Chris Murphy literally threatened the President of Ukraine that, if he doesn't do things right, they won't have Democrat support in Congress. So you're going to look all of this up."
-- at a news conference on Sept. 25
Mostly true.
Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democratic of Connecticut, met with Mr. Zelensky in Ukraine this month as part of a bipartisan congressional delegation.
In interviews this month, Mr. Murphy has said he advised Mr. Zelensky against investigating former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. based on political pressure from Mr. Trump's aides and allies. He also noted that Mr. Zelensky was worried about the suspension of foreign aid.
The Times reported on Sept. 9 that Mr. Murphy "said he urged Mr. Zelensky not to heed the requests from Mr. Giuliani, warning that to do so could threaten bipartisan support for Ukraine in Washington."
"So I went there to make it clear to him that the worst thing that he could do for the U.S.-Ukraine relationship was to get involved in an election here in the United States," Mr. Murphy said in a Sept. 22 appearance on NBC's "Meet the Press."
In a statement responding to Mr. Trump's claim, Mr. Murphy said his position was unchanged: "In the meeting Republican Senator Ron Johnson and I had with President Zelensky three weeks ago, I made it clear to him that Ukraine should not become involved in the 2020 election and that his government should communicate with the State Department, not the president's campaign. I still believe this to be true."
"I gave you anti-tank busters that -- frankly, President Obama was sending you pillows and sheets. And I gave you anti-tank busters."
-- in a news conference on Sept. 25
This is exaggerated.
The Trump administration in 2018 approved the sale of anti-tank missiles and launch units to Ukraine in 2018.
While President Barack Obama declined to supply Ukraine with lethal weapons, his administration did approve of other forms of military aid, which Mr. Trump dismissed as "pillows and sheets."
Between the 2014 and 2016 fiscal years, the United States committed more than $ 600 million in security assistance to Ukraine, according to the Congressional Research Service. That included "counterartillery and countermortar radars, secure communications, training aids, logistics infrastructure and I.T. systems, tactical U.A.V.s and medical equipment."

In Kashmir, Anger and Fear Amid Chaos

Texto completo: For nearly two months, the flash-point region of Kashmir has been locked down. The Indian government has flooded it with troops. The internet has been cut off. Mobile phones don't work.

Soldiers have ordered people to stay inside their homes or they will be shot. Anti-government militants have killed and threatened civilians as well. People can't get to the hospital, they can't communicate with loved ones, they can't go to school or work. Everyday life has been paralyzed.

This all began Aug. 5 when India announced stunning news: It was stripping Jammu and Kashmir state, India's only Muslim-majority state, of the autonomy it had held since the 1940s. The territory will soon be cut in half and each piece will become a federal enclave.

The Indian government, which is controlled by a popular Hindu nationalist political party, says these moves are necessary to bring peace to Kashmir. For decades, the region has been racked by unrest, rebellion, warfare and bloodshed. Pakistan, India's rival, also claims parts of Kashmir and is accused of stirring up an anti-India insurgency.

Indian officials knew that stripping Kashmir's statehood would be deeply unpopular. And the Kashmir Valley, the most restive part of the state and home to as many as 8 million people, remains under a punishing blockade.
The photographer Atul Loke spent four weeks in Kashmir over two trips in August and September for The New York Times. Here is what he saw.
Sporadic protests keep breaking out. Security officers blast shotguns and tear gas into crowds. Dozens of demonstrators have been seriously wounded. Many are scared to go to the hospital, fearing they will be arrested. Instead, they stumble into nearby mosques, their faces bloody, their bodies shaking, to be wiped down and bandaged by sympathetic volunteers.
The Indian security forces have arrested thousands of people. Most are being held without charges under what is called preventive detention. Almost Kashmir's entire leadership class -- democratically elected representatives, teachers, students, intellectuals, and prominent merchants -- is now behind bars.


The arrests and the blockade have left Kashmiris feeling unsettled, demoralized and furious. Zahida Jan, a high school student, collapsed in grief just talking about her older brother, Fayaz Ahmed Mir, who was arrested in front of her in early August. The family says he is innocent. His job was driving a tractor in apple orchards. They say the reason authorities arrested him was that he had joined a protest nine years ago. They have no idea where he is.
Children as young as 8 have poured into the streets. With schools closed, they have little to do. Many hang around the mosques. Among the slogans they bark out is: "There is only one solution. Gun solution! Gun solution!" Several young men have claimed that they were tortured by security forces. The Indian government has denied it. The young men, who were arrested on suspicion of aiding the militants, said government soldiers hung them upside down, hit them with bamboo sticks, applied electric shocks and forced them to drink large amounts of a noxious liquid. A month after he said he was tortured, Abid Khan, a shopkeeper, showed deep black lines on his buttocks. He said four soldiers stripped him naked, pinned him down and beat him again and again with wooden poles. But the tensions are no longer as simple as protesters versus security officers. Kashmiri separatists are conducting their own clampdown, threatening or even attacking civilians in a campaign to destroy any semblance of normality that may be trying to creep back.
Anti-government militants recently shot the family members of a wealthy apple trader. The militants are trying to stop the apple business, a lifeline for many Kashmiris, as a form of protest against the Indian government. The militants even shot a 5-year-old girl, officials said.
Indian officials have not indicated when they will lift the security restrictions or release people who have been jailed.


Indian officials have not indicated when they will lift the security restrictions or release people who have been jailed.
Ajit Doval, India's national security chief, blames Pakistan for Kashmir's problems. If the internet were restored in Kashmir, he says, Pakistan would flood it with misleading information and stir up hatred. If the Indian soldiers relax, Pakistan would exploit the situation and send in more militants. He said lifting the restrictions would depend on "how Pakistan behaves."
Pakistan has denied those accusations. And its prime minister, Imran Khan, just spoke before the United Nations to accuse India of atrocities in Kashmir. He has asked for international intervention to help the crisis from escalating into war between India and Pakistan, both nuclear-armed.
