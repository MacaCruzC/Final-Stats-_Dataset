Texto completo: Edmund Morris, who died last week at 78, has the peculiar distinction of having written one of the best biographies of any American president, his three-volume life of Theodore Roosevelt published between 1979 and 2010, and one of the worst, his “official” life of the 40th president, Dutch: A Memoir of Ronald Reagan published in 1999. Let this be a lesson to biographers and presidents alike.
Morris was a graceful and perceptive writer. His life of Roosevelt, especially the first volume, The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt, which won the Pulitzer Prize in 1980, was not only a penetrating character study but did much to revive TR’s historic reputation, long overshadowed by his distant cousin Franklin. That, along with Morris’s conservative temperament and friendly feelings toward Reagan, seems to have persuaded such White House lieutenants as Michael Deaver, in the mid-1980s, to recruit Morris as Reagan’s authorized biographer. It was a gamble that didn’t pay off.
To begin with, strictly speaking, Morris was not an academic historian but a onetime advertising copywriter, raised in Kenya and South Africa, with an interest not in politics or history or, especially, ideology but in the psychological lives of his varied subjects. When it was announced in 1985 that Reagan’s official biographer would be granted unprecedented access to the president, putting Morris at his elbow at meetings and global summits and interviewing Reagan privately at least once a month, Newsweek observed that “the White House can expect a work as much about the person as his presidency. His greatest challenge, Morris predicts, ‘will be to define … this mysterious power that [Reagan’s] personality has upon the American people.”
A dozen years later, in effect, he conceded defeat. Morris could not diagnose that mysterious power. “He was truly one of the strangest men who’s ever lived,” Morris wrote of the Gipper. In desperation, Morris resorted to the unconventional device of inserting himself into Reagan’s personal history as friend and fictional character, showing up at opportune moments in Reagan’s long life. The upshot was a predictable mixture of interesting insights and surreal vignettes. Most of all, however, Dutch was a missed opportunity for chronicling a deeply consequential presidency and setting the tone for future Reagan scholarship.
To this day, while there are admirable accounts of Reagan’s considerable influence on his time, such as Steven F. Hayward’s notable two-volume Age of Reagan, there remains no truly satisfactory biography.
Part of the problem, of course, is that “official biographies” are largely intended as authorized versions of political events, with eyes fixed firmly on the judgment of posterity. Yet this was never really Morris’ intent. Fascinated by Reagan’s mysterious power, as well as the poignant details of his life, Morris was largely uninterested in the ideas and policies that, especially in contrast to the temper of his time, make Reagan such an important president.

The other problem, too, is that most successful American presidents have been enigmatic, self-contained, opaque characters — “His ambition was a little engine that knew no rest,” as Abraham Lincoln’s law partner recalled — who, like Reagan, are benevolent strangers to family and friends. Ironically, this explains Morris’ success as well as his failure. The conventional wisdom on the subject was nicely captured last week by his New York Times obituary: While Morris “wrote an acclaimed biography of Theodore Roosevelt,” it explained, “[he is] best known for his life of Ronald Reagan.”
The truth, however, is likely to be the opposite. Whatever emerges in the annals of Reagan scholarship, Dutch is unlikely to hold center stage; the same can hardly be said of Morris’ Theodore Roosevelt.
The great virtue of its three eloquent volumes, thankfully completed after Morris’ Reagan interlude, is its insightful thesis: TR was not simply a force of nature in national life but the center of a sweeping circle of acquaintances who shaped and defined modern America. Roosevelt, too, possessed “mysterious power,” which Morris was content to describe with thoughtful sympathy. If only he had taken the same approach with Reagan.

Texto completo: Oh yeah, the Finals.
The NBA season is supposed to lead dramatically to this point but was widely believed to be over before it started with the Warriors coming off three titles in four seasons … having lost the one in 2016 after leading the Cavaliers 3-1… with no LeBron James-led contender arising in the East to worry about.
Instead, it’s the Toronto Raptors with their star/upcoming free agent, Kawhi Leonard, and trash-talking rapper/co-owner, Drake, representing the East and, in an upset, taking a 1-0 lead.
Unfortunately, Leonard played hurt last series as his uncle/adviser, Dennis Robertson, told Yahoo’s Chris Haynes (“You could clearly see he was in pain.”)
Nor did Kawhi look too bouncy in Game 1, scoring 23 points and shooting 5 for 14 from the field.
So, lead or no lead, good luck, Raptors!
The matchup looked so one-sided, Warriors players were being asked before it started if Steph Curry would finally be the Finals MVP … based, of course, on the assumption that injured Kevin Durant won’t be a major factor and that wouldn’t matter to the team.
Meanwhile, the New York Times’ Marc Stein introduced his plan for the anticipated walkover: multiple postseason tournaments like European soccer teams.
Compounding the absurdity, Commissioner Adam Silver told Stein that a second “cup” was “in the conceptual phase.”
As if the league needs a new attraction with a boffo comedy going as Magic Johnson continued to bash the Lakers while pledging undying love to them?
It was another crazy week with ESPN.com’s Baxter Holmes producing a 6,500-word opus on Johnson’s misbegotten era … while ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith melted down on the air, decrying his own company’s story.
Smith is Magic’s guy at The Wide World of Sports. As Stephen A. actually noted, he was embarrassed to have Johnson coming in the same day Holmes’ piece ran, in which Magic was alleged to be an abusive boss who had several Lakers staffers resigning and/or taking anti-anxiety medication.
Ranted Stephen A. in Johnson’s defense:
“Oh my god! Let’s get the ax! Let’s take Magic Johnson to the guillotine!”
Of course, with Johnson determined to keep going on the air to defend himself, these coincidences in timing are becoming common … like the week before when Magic went on to call GM Rob Pelinka a back-stabber, the same day the Lakers introduced Coach Frank Vogel in their first press conference since Johnson’s resignation 41 days before.
In the part we didn’t know before, Holmes reported James’ agent, Rich Paul, waged a season-long campaign against Coach Luke Walton.
This was confirmed by Silver, himself. In an early-season chance meeting, the commissioner said Paul told him something to the effect of, “Luke Walton is not the right guy to coach LeBron.”
Assuming that Paul’s opinions followed James’, and Johnson’s followed LeBron’s, this explains why Magic went off on Walton at the seven-game mark, turning Luke into a lame duck.
LeBron knows he’s held to the highest standards and has done this before, trying and failing to get Erik Spoelstra fired in Miami, succeeding in getting David Blatt fired in Cleveland.
In this, James was joined by Johnson, feeling exposed after his controversial decisions to forego shooters and sign eccentrics such as JaVale McGee, Lance Stephenson and Michael Beasley.
Not that Magic was supposed to take orders from James. With LeBron locked up for three seasons, it was the other way around.
It was Johnson’s job to make James understand they might have to sacrifice this season to finish rebuilding after saving a maximum salary slot and bringing in so many veterans on one-year deals.
What Magic wasn’t supposed to do was go off on Walton before Thanksgiving on LeBron’s behalf, undercutting what little stability they had.
Of course, conveying that message meant realizing it, himself. By all accounts, Magic didn’t, talking of building for the future while challenging Golden State at the same time.
A Lakers staffer told Holmes he didn’t know if Johnson had a plan. Actually, Magic did … or LeBron did … and it was a dilly: Trade for Anthony Davis, off-loading enough salary to save their max slot for another star free agent to put alongside James.
Unfortunately for Magic, it proved impossible with New Orleans blaming the Lakers for their heavy-handed, obviously LeBron-driven, wooing of A.D.
Worst of all for Johnson, he wasn’t working at the Lakers job full-time and couldn’t live it down when it got into the press.
“And last but not least, lazy?” Magic told Stephen A. last week, re-framing the charge into one he could lampoon.
“I have built a $600 million business. You can not be lazy going from basketball and winning five championships. … I wasn’t lazy as a player and I’m not lazy as a CEO and a business owner. That’s never going to happen.”
Of course, no one said he was lazy. The charge was that he wasn’t often in the Lakers’ office, which he hasn’t addressed.
Holmes, noting Johnson’s many business interests, suggests he was in their office “once a week or every two weeks.”
Infrequent as that was, it could have been OK if Johnson had a smooth working relationship with an experienced No. 2 man who assigned all the detail work.
Imagine if Jeanie Buss had kept GM Mitch Kupchak, who had all the qualifications, instead of lumping Mitch in with her brother, Jim, when she fired him.
The No. 2 man became Pelinka, an agent, hired at the suggestion of his client, Kobe Bryant, neither of whom had front office experience.
As for Johnson’s inconceivable charge of being stabbed in the back … still unspecified aside from citing “little things that bothered me” … he had more than two seasons with Pelinka. If loyalty was an issue, Magic should have been able to tell long before.
Unfortunately for the Lakers and Jeanie, who kept Pelinka, Rob is now lumped in with Johnson in the press, as if he was Magic’s partner in crime … setting up Pelinka as the scapegoat for the next thing that goes wrong.
Actually, Pelinka looks more like another of the staffers Magic ran roughshod over.
Pelinka, reported Holmes, survived with the avid support of Jeanie’s best friend and new Lakers power player, Linda Rambis.
Now to see how long any of them, Rob and/or Linda, last.
If there’s a silver lining for Lakers fans, it’s that the heat in the press is exposing an organization run on nepotism and cronyism, which Jeanie might finally be obliged to recognize and professionalize.
Of course, that suggests more misadventures await in the meantime so buckle up.

On the Border, With New Gadgets and Old Tools

Texto completo: How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Miriam Jordan, a national immigration correspondent based in Los Angeles, discussed the tech she's using.
What tech tools do you use most on the job?
My Lenovo laptop, printer and iPhone are the main tools of my trade. And I use the Voice Memos app exclusively to record news conferences.
But let me step back. While technology is great, there's no substitute for building a rapport with someone, especially as an immigration reporter. I prefer face-to-face conversations, whenever possible.
Because I am frequently in the field talking to Spanish speakers in sometimes precarious situations, I find that just jotting down what people say in a notebook is more discreet than using the Notes app or recording a conversation. There is a formality inherent in recording that I feel inhibits folks from speaking freely, and many of the people I interview are undocumented. Keeping a record of what they tell me in a device makes them worry about being exposed to immigration authorities, especially in the current political climate.
You travel a lot for work then. What gadgets help with that?
I always carry an extra battery pack for my mobile phone. Especially if I am in a remote location, I want to know that I can reach the photographer with whom I am traveling (sometimes we end up separated), as well as my editor and family.
When I am driving just about anywhere that is new, I rely on the Waze app to guide me. I wonder how I would manage without it! If I am somewhere without a car, then a ride-sharing app like Uber or Lyft does the trick.
How about social media?
Twitter enables me to stay abreast of the conversation surrounding my immigration beat, as well as to be a part of it, if I desire. I have also been contacted by readers on Twitter with tips -- or complaints. Twitter is also indispensable to promote my pieces and to amplify them, if I write threads that include aspects that didn't make it into the story.
Facebook Groups can be treasure troves of information about what activists are doing, and they help me find ideas as well as sources for stories. For example, after a judge ordered the government last year to reunite families who had been separated at the border, volunteer groups helping parents and children converged on Facebook to discuss their observations.
I also often use WhatsApp to talk with sources on sensitive topics, because all communication is encrypted.
What technology do migrants use?
Like most families from the Spanish-speaking Caribbean and Latin America, as well as other parts of the developing world, migrants crossing the border use WhatsApp to communicate with their loved ones back home and among their family in the United States.
WhatsApp can be used to transmit photos of police reports, birth certificates and other documents that migrants may need their relatives to send them after they have arrived in the United States to help build their asylum case. Once upon a time, people in far-flung areas would have to find an internet cafe to email material from their home country to the United States. WhatsApp is also invaluable because you can send voice memos to people who are illiterate.
Some migrants arrive at the border with smartphones, but not all of them. The greater the distance they have traveled, the more likely they are to carry one. Brazilians, Indians and Africans tend to have smartphones more than Central Americans do. Once they are settled and working in the United States, they often use their smartphones to send money to their family back home.
And migrant children are as addicted to video games and entertainment on cellphones as other kids.
How is technology used by Americans communicating with migrants?
I was recently at a respite center in Tucson, which on some nights sleeps more than 300 Central American migrants who have just been released by the Border Patrol. It is staffed by an army of well-intentioned volunteers, who provide food, clothing and medical care to the migrant families.
But often they don't speak Spanish, and rely on Google Translate. The funny way that things get so literally translated often breaks the ice between migrants and their helpers as they erupt in laughter.
Outside of work, what tech do you love to use or to avoid?
I use my iPhone to listen to music when I run and when I walk the dog. I also use it to tune in to the Times podcast "The Daily" as well as other podcasts. I have an internet-connected exercise bike.
How do your kids help you with digital tools and the internet?
My 22-year-old twins, Maya and Danny, are definitely my tech-support team when they are around.
Danny helps me with basic functions on Microsoft Word, Outlook and Facebook. I have a knack for accidentally deleting sections or material in my files, which he helps me restore (Alt Z?). My computer also seems to freeze not infrequently, and he comes to the rescue.
Maya helps me buy music on iTunes and download music onto my phone. She helped me to discover new text actions, such as "laughing" or "loving." She has helped me post certain things to Facebook and keep my profile picture more or less current.
Neither seems interested in pricey wearable tech, like smart watches. Thankfully!
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Trump won't put Tubman on $20 bill, so protesters are doing the job

Texto completo: In her gossipy tell-all, "Unhinged," former White House adviser Omarosa Manigault Newman described making a personal appeal to President Donald Trump to move forward with stalled plans to put African American abolitionist hero Harriet Tubman on U.S. currency.
"You want me to put that face on the $20 bill?" an incredulous Trump reportedly replied.
I'll answer that question!
Yes. Yes, I do.
Setting aside gender or race, Tubman is one of the greatest figures in our history. She was born into slavery in Maryland in the 1820s, escaped in 1849 and returned at great peril more than a dozen times to lead an estimated 300 slaves to freedom via the Underground Railroad.
"So much of what we believe has changed for better for this country is reflected in what she struggled for," said then-U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew in April 2016 when he announced plans to put Tubman on the front of the $20 bill as early as 2020 to mark the centennial of women's suffrage.
Hers is "a legacy of what an individual can do in a democracy," Lew said.
President Andrew Jackson, one of the most problematic figures in our history, would move from the front of the bill to the back.
The following day, Trump, then a candidate for president, ripped the initiative as "pure political correctness" and suggested that Tubman belonged instead on the little-used $2 bill.
After Trump was elected, Steven Mnuchin, his treasury secretary, wouldn't commit to advancing the change, telling a TV interviewer that he had "a lot more important issues to focus on" than faces on money.
Trump officials have said that Newman, who is African American and left the White House under a cloud in late 2017, is a disgruntled former employee whose book is "riddled with lies and false accusations."
But "You want me to put that face on the $20 bill?" aligns with his earlier criticism, echoes his sexist slam at 2016 GOP presidential rival Carly Fiorina -- "Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?" -- and is consistent with the latest news developments.
Mnuchin told members of the House Financial Services Committee on May 22 that concern over "counterfeiting issues" would delay any redesign of the $20 bill until 2028. The New York Times later reported that unnamed senior Treasury Department officials said Mnuchin was concerned that Trump "might create an uproar" and cancel the redesign altogether.
Trump is very fond of Jackson, the former president and general who kept slaves instead of freeing them and who ardently supported the institution of slavery rather than advocating to end it.
Jackson also signed the Indian Removal Act of 1830, which resulted in the brutal and deadly eviction of tens of thousands of indigenous people from ancestral homes east of the Mississippi River to land west of the Mississippi along what became known as the "Trail of Tears."
Yes, many famous people of the past fail to live up to contemporary values, and it's unfair and unproductive to consign to history's trash heap all those who weren't enlightened by 21st century standards. But Jackson, whose populism inspires Trump's affection, was a particularly racist and autocratic president, and simply demoting him to the back of the twenty in favor of Tubman isn't exactly erasing his memory.
By defending Jackson's legacy against the Obama-era initiative to honor Tubman, Trump is appealing directly to those who are aggrieved and threatened by all sorts of liberal second-guessing of America's past -- those who'd like to see monuments to the Confederacy toppled or consigned to private property, for instance.
But it's not "political correctness" that demands the United States share the honor of appearing on our most frequently used paper currency with those others than white men, it's historical correctness. It's common sense.
Do you, too, want to put that face on a $20 bill?
Some protesters are now using an ink stamp to superimpose Tubman's portrait over Jackson's on the bill, an act that does not change the status of the bill as legal tender.
Promotional materials at TubmanStamp.com link to a U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing posting explaining that the law makes defacing currency illegal only if it's intended for commercial or fraudulent purposes, or if it's intended to make the bill "unfit to be reissued."
The stamps are currently sold out, but the manufacturer has posted 3D printing instructions for the DIY crowd along with a note that he's trying to catch up on heavy demand.
Evidently there's no shortage of citizens willing to say yes to the face and do the job Trump refuses to do.

Texto completo: A strong wind fills the sails of a potential Fiat Chrysler-Renault merger, but rocky shoals lie ahead.
The lure of massive savings — FCA estimated $5.6 billion annually — is one key reason many experts say the idea has merit.
Those savings will be needed as the automakers navigate a future that demands more expensive technology. Savings would come, FCA said, from common vehicle platforms, powertrains and technologies.
"I think it's a good deal for both of them. The auto industry is going through such an incredibly stressful period," said Maryann Keller, of the New York-area consulting firm Maryann Keller & Associates. "I don't think it's a heavy lift. I think both parties want it and both parties need it."
The biggest challenge to securing approval for the 50-50 merger proposal FCA announced Monday will be concerns about job losses in Europe, several experts said. Those concerns would remain despite FCA's assurance that no plants would be closed as a result of the deal.
"Workers at both companies belong to strong, combative unions that will kill a deal that doesn't guarantee jobs," said Erik Gordon, a law professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business. "The French and Italian governments also will insist on job guarantees. If either country suffers job losses, the government will be run out of power."
Union officials in France have already weighed in and they are not pleased, according to the New York Times.
"Nothing would prevent the Italian shareholder from favoring its national base. The C.G.T. considers that there is nothing good to expect from a Renault-F.C.A. merger," according to the Times, quoting a statement from France's C.G.T. labor union.
'Every single job' In Italy, Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini struck a positive tone about the proposal during a press conference, but he also emphasized jobs, according to Reuters.
"Fiat Chrysler expanding is good news for Italy ... I count on it being a brilliant operation that preserves every single job while creating a European car industry giant," Salvini said, according to the news service.
So job protections are key, but the way to achieve real economies of scale is to streamline, which is certain to affect someone, according to David Kudla. CEO and chief investment strategist for Mainstay Capital Management.
"That cost saving has to come from somewhere. That's less plant equipment and manpower," he said. "What workers, what unions, what plants, what countries does that affect?"
Kudla noted that if an automaker begins sharing, say, powertrains, then that would affect a plant that produces the powertrains that are no longer needed.
"The positive thing is there's real efficiency in that," Kudla said.
Bloated hippopotamus Gordon, the U-M professor, noted what would appear to be a clear dilemma.
"The problem is that a merger makes little sense without job cuts. Without cuts, the resulting company would be an inefficient, bloated hippopotamus of a company," Gordon said.
These issues could scuttle a deal, according to Keller.
"There are powerful unions throughout Europe, especially in France and Italy, and both of them are going to want assurances that this merger is not going to impact them," Keller said.
The French government, which owns 15% of Renault, will also want some say in the jobs issue, Keller said.
Worries about job security for FCA's U.S. workforce do not appear to be a huge issue, according to the experts. FCA is planning a multibillion-dollar expansion on Detroit's east side to retool Jefferson North Assembly and turn the idled Mack Engine complex into an assembly plant.
Noting the profitability of FCA's North American operations, particularly with its Jeep and Ram brands, Keller said she sees no reason why the new entity would shift jobs out of the United States.
"They're going to depend on this money machine," Keller said.
Kristin Dzizcek, vice president of the Industry, Labor & Economics Group at the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, said the UAW will monitor the process, as a union representative indicated to the Free Press Monday, but pushback from the UAW might not be an issue.
"The UAW will probably be happy to see the commitment that they're not going to close plants," Dzizcek said.
Nissan-UAW bad blood One of the concerns the UAW might have is how tightly the proposal ties it to Nissan, which is in an alliance with Renault, It would have a seat on the board and would then have a role overseeing UAW-represented plants. The UAW has battled against Nissan, such as at the automaker's plant in Canton, Mississippi.
"It would be an unusual situation," Dzizcek said.
For Michelle Krebs, executive analyst with Cox Automotive's Autotrader, the prospect of Nissan in the fold would add significant complications. However, Renault's alliance with Nissan and Mitsubishi has been under strain because of the drama involving Carlos Ghosn, the former head of the companies now facing criminal charges, and tension for Nissan over how much it contributes toward the value of the alliance.
"The first question that has to be answered (is) are Nissan and Mitsubishi in or out, because that changes the complexion of the situation," Krebs said. "If it's just Renault and FCA, North America doesn't change much, but bringing Nissan in, that changes things."
Krebs said FCA and Nissan compete here. If they eventually become part of the same group, that competition would be self-defeating. FCA's merger proposal was limited to Renault, whose board is studying it, but as noted before, FCA highlighted the "synergies" possible in the broader alliance.
Krebs also raised doubts about the savings that FCA says would arise from a merger.
"I'm always skeptical of those savings because they typically don't materialize," Krebs said.
Ultimately, there are many details to work out, she said.
"What we saw was a six-page document," Krebs said, referencing the news release announcing that FCA had proposed the merger.
Kudla, of Mainstay Capital Management, said he does not believe the issues, whatever they are, are insurmountable.
"I think it can happen. I don't think we know enough yet about what the hurdles might be. We know there are people who want to see it happen," Kudla said.

Your jealousy of Hope Hicks is showing, and it's not a good look

Texto completo: Hope Hicks is very pretty. So pretty, in fact, that as a 17 year-old model, she graced the cover of a Gossip Girl spinoff novel, providing the public further evidence that not only is she very pretty, but unless she got plastic surgery done as a very young teenager, she is very pretty naturally. That she has neither lip fillers nor a nose job would put her in just 1% of all of Hollywood.
So of course, people are very jealous of her. This weekend it showed.
Maggie Haberman at the New York Times wrote a piece last week about Hicks' compliance (or lack thereof) with a congressional subpoena. The tweet sharing the article perhaps unwisely framed this as an "existential dilemma" rather than one about complying with the law. But that's not what had everyone's panties in a knot.
TweetTweetTweetTweetTweet
And my personal favorite, "Glam Shots for One, Not for the Other: Different Media Standard for Hope Hicks and Chelsea Manning Draws Backlash":
TweetTweet
There's just one problem. (Well, aside from the seething jealousy from women I'm guessing would consider themselves feminists.) This isn't a "glam" shot. It wasn't even posed. It was one of the last images shot by the New York Times before Hicks officially resigned, and a candid one during a meeting at that. Don't take my word for it — just listen to the photographer who shot the picture.
Tweet
I hate to break it to you, but Hope Hicks was just a rare bird in the swamp who was both naturally beautiful and styled herself well. You too can balayage your hair, contour your face, and wear this season's Stuart Weitzman Highland boots. Don't get jealous! Just hit the gym, the salon, and maybe Bendel's. Nothing is stopping you, except your jealousy.

Warren poised to break out, AOC endorsement could derail Sanders

Texto completo: Democrat Elizabeth Warren’s once floundering 2020 presidential campaign has been declared back by the media and her bid to win the endorsement of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez appears on track and threatening the No. 2 position of Sen. Bernie Sanders.
Several media outlets have reported that the Massachusetts senator is breaking away from the middle and bottom of the 2020 pack and she is winning more support from liberals and progressives than Sanders.
And she has in the past month won several unofficial endorsements from Ocasio-Cortez, and the two even cut a “Game of Thrones” video posted on Twitter. The media-savvy New York lawmaker has also defended Warren over high legal fees she charged and backed a high tech breakup plan pushed by Warren.
Tweet
One long-time Warren watcher said that it appears the senator’s campaign to win the official endorsement from the darling of progressives is on track.
“The AOC endorsement could be the coup d’état for the heart and soul of the restless left wing base Warren is courting,” said the Warren watcher.
It would likely undermine the campaign of Sanders, who has long considered himself the leader of progressives and liberals, said another analyst.
Tweet
The recent rise of Warren, detailed in new media reports, is coming at the expense of Sanders, who is No. 2 behind former Vice President Joe Biden.
The New York Times today noted her rise and cited a Quinnipiac University survey in which she was the top candidate among “very liberal” voters by 8 points over Sanders.
And the Hill declared her the No. 3 Democrat in the primary race, and rising. The paper said that she has momentum. “Warren is snapping at Sanders’s heels. If she were to supplant him as the leading progressive candidate, the landscape of the race would shift,” said the Hill.

More transparency about UFOs is a good thing

Texto completo: We seem to be entering an era of increased transparency from the U.S. government concerning UFO sightings, and that is a positive development.
Over the weekend, the New York Times caused a stir by quoting Navy pilots describing their sightings of flying objects, supported by video and other evidence, that behaved inexplicably. The objects were able to hover for hours in the air, move up and down, spin like a top, and travel at hypersonic speeds before stopping and changing direction on a dime. There's no reason to believe that they are alien (and one scientist quoted suggests other possibilities).
My colleague Tom Rogan, our resident UFO expert, has written a bit more background on the recent history of actual sightings of UFOs and their potential implications. International politics professor Daniel Drezner observes at the Washington Post that the Navy has been formalizing the process for reporting encounters with UFOs, which has marked an overall shift in transparency about the topic and in the media treatment of it. Even if the government doesn't formally use the name UFO, military officials have been coming public with reports of what are by definition flying objects that we haven't been able to identify.
To me, the increased transparency surrounding UFO sightings is a good thing for two main reasons.
One is that the more the government reveals, the less room there is for wild conspiracy theories to fester. Sure, there will always be conspiracy theorists, but when the government refuses to acknowledge observable phenomena, it only feeds into the idea of a massive cover-up. As long as the government isn't revealing any secretive research, there is no downside to simply reporting some of what has been observed and stating that there is currently no explanation.
The second reason for added transparency is the crowdsourcing effect. Given that the government currently has no explanation to what has been observed, by releasing the information that exists, they can enable researchers and scientists to study the possible explanations.
More information increases the chances of an intelligent and productive discussion of these strange occurrences, rather than confining such conversations to supermarket tabloids.

German Official Advises Jews Against Wearing Skullcaps

Texto completo: BERLIN -- Germany's top official responsible for efforts against anti-Semitism suggested this weekend that Jews should not wear their skullcaps everywhere in public, setting off a debate about balancing personal safety and the right to religious freedom in the country.
The recommendation by Felix Klein, a federal official, came amid growing evidence that, three-quarters of a century after the Holocaust, anti-Semitism is on the rise.
In the interview published by the newspaper Die Welt and other outlets on Saturday, Mr. Klein said his thinking on the issue had changed. "I can't tell Jews to wear the kippa everywhere in Germany," he said, referring to the traditional skullcap.
The remark suggested a sobering state of affairs in Germany, analysts said.
"When a representative of the federal government officially tells the Jewish community that 'you are not safe against anti-Jewish hate everywhere in Germany,' then that is a pathetic display for the rule of law and political reality," said Michel Friedman, a journalist and politician who has served as president of the European Jewish Congress.
Some rejected Mr. Klein's comments, with Interior Minister Horst Seehofer saying, "It would not be acceptable if Jews had to hide their faith in Germany."
He added, though, "Given the growth of anti-Semitic criminal offenses, we must be worried and vigilant."
Mr. Klein said Sunday in a telephone interview with The New York Times, "I wanted to shake up the debate and am happy that it caused such ripples."
And to those who may hear surrender to anti-Semitism in his remarks, he added, "I don't see it as resignation, but the exact opposite."
About 200,000 Jews live in Germany, where many have returned from Eastern Europe and Russia since the fall of Communism.
A government report released two weeks ago showed that while politically motivated crimes were down generally in Germany, anti-Semitic crimes were up by 20 percent.
Nearly 90 percent of the episodes -- which include internet posts and physical attacks -- were linked to the country's far-right groups, which appear to be growing more radical while not increasing in number.
Last year, a Syrian teenager attacked a man wearing a skullcap in the Prenzlauer Berg district of Berlin. The victim, an Arab-Israeli man who had worn the skullcap to show what Jews face, had filmed the attack, and his video was quickly picked up by the news media.
Soon afterward, activists organized a "Berlin Wears Kippa" campaign, in which the city's mayor, Michael Müller, compared the skullcap to a symbol of tolerance.
"Today, the kippa is a symbol of the Berlin that we would like to have," Mr. Müller said then during a rally.
But some Jewish residents, even in cities like Berlin, have been hiding their skullcaps under baseball caps for years.
"Generally, I don't tend to dramatize, but the situation has really gotten worse," Josef Schuster, the head of Germany's Central Council of Jews, said in an interview with the Sunday version of the daily newspaper Welt.
Mr. Klein's office was created just last year, and in his brief tenure, he has been part of creating a federal system of offices to allow people to report anti-Semitic crimes.
In the interview, Mr. Klein also recommended that the police, along with judges and teachers, receive special training to deal with rising anti-Semitism.
In another interview, with the German-Jewish weekly newspaper Jüdische Allgemeine, Mr. Klein lamented that anti-Semitic comments were becoming more common in some German circles.
In the second half of the 20th century, he said, "there was anti-Semitism also; that is sadly correct, but it was more frowned upon to make anti-Semitic comments."
While the Bavarian state interior minister, Joachim Herrmann, seemed to agree that there was a problem, he did not agree on the remedy. "I think the statements are wrong," Mr. Herrmann told the Bayrischer Rundfunk, the state broadcaster. "Everyone can and should wear his kippa where and when he wants."
His sentiment was echoed by the American ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell, who said on Twitter: "The opposite is true. Wear your kippa. Wear your friend's kippa. Borrow a kippa and wear it for our Jewish neighbors. Educate people that we are a diverse society."

Representative Will Hurd of Texas said that by sharing the video, Trump has escalated the debate over disinformation, which is "something that gets at the heart of our democracy."
"You shouldn't disseminate information that you know is ultimately doctored," Hurd said when asked about the video during an interview on CBS's "Face the Nation."
Trump shared the video Thursday night on Twitter, ratcheting up tensions in his spat with Pelosi amid accusations from Democrats that the White House is stonewalling congressional investigations into the president's personal finances, businesses, and other matters.
"PELOSI STAMMERS THROUGH NEWS CONFERENCE," Trump wrote in his tweet, quoting the chyron from Fox Business Network, which aired the video Thursday night on "Lou Dobbs Tonight."
In a response on Twitter on Thursday night, Pelosi said Trump was "distracting from House Democrats' great accomplishments #ForThePeople, from his cover-ups, and unpopularity."
Trump's tweet came on the same day that The Washington Post reported on the rapid spread of other distorted videos of Pelosi that have been altered to make her sound as if she is drunkenly slurring her words.

Both parties criticize Trump on 'confidence' in Kim
Members of both parties criticized President Trump's handling of North Korea on Sunday after the president tweeted that he has "confidence" in Kim Jong Un and quoted North Korean state-run media's assessment that former vice president Joe Biden is a "low IQ individual."
Representative Adam Kinzinger, Republican of Illinois, a military veteran who sits on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, cited the Memorial Day holiday in taking issue with Trump's message.
"It's Memorial Day Weekend and you're taking a shot at Biden while praising a dictator," Kinzinger tweeted. "This is just plain wrong."
Another Republican, Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa, said she "certainly wouldn't trust" Kim. Ernst, who is also a veteran and serves on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said she was disturbed by North Korea's recent missile test and by Trump's reaction.
"I think Japan does have reason to be concerned, and I am concerned as well," she said on CNN's "State of the Union."
The issue arose after Trump, who is on a state visit to Japan, tweeted that North Korea's recent missile tests were not of concern, contradicting a recent statement by national security adviser John Bolton.
White House press secretary Sarah Sanders defended the president's comments. In an appearance on NBC's "Meet the Press," Sanders was asked by Chuck Todd whether Americans should "be concerned that the president of United States is essentially siding with a murderous, authoritarian dictator over a former vice president in the United States."
Sanders disputed that characterization. "Chuck, the president's not siding with that," she said. "But I think they agree in their assessment of former vice president Joe Biden."
Biden is leading early polls for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.

Texto completo: Free speech concerns cited over decision to bring Espionage Act case
Two prosecutors involved in the case against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange argued against the Justice Department's decision to accuse him of violating the Espionage Act because of fear that such charges posed serious risks for First Amendment protections and other concerns, according to people familiar with the matter.
The previously undisclosed disagreement inside the Justice Department underscores the fraught, high-stakes nature of the government's years-long effort to counter Assange, an Internet-age publisher who has repeatedly declared his hostility to U.S. foreign policy and military operations. The Assange case also illustrates how the Trump administration is willing to go further than its predecessors in pursuit of leakers - and those who publish official secrets.
The internal Justice Department debate over how, or whether, to prosecute Assange stretched back to the Obama administration, which ultimately decided that such charges were a bad idea but did not formally close the case.
The case was dormant when the Trump administration began, but in 2017, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, eager to demonstrate his zeal for pursuing anti-leak investigations, urged the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia to take a second look at prosecuting Assange.
In a sign of how seriously they took their task, one of the assistant U.S. attorneys asked to evaluate the case was James Trump, an aggressive veteran prosecutor with experience in intelligence leak matters.
James Trump was part of the team that won criminal convictions in 2015 against former CIA officer Jeffrey Sterling, who was charged with leaking classified information to journalist James Risen. Prosecutors in that case had taken the dramatic step of seeking to compel Risen to reveal his source in court. The prosecution team in that case wanted to jail Risen until he cooperated with investigators, but that plan was scuttled by then-Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., according to people familiar with the matter who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.
When it came to Assange, James Trump was concerned about pursuing a prosecution that was so susceptible to First Amendment and other complicated legal and factual challenges, the people familiar with the matter said.
Another prosecutor, Daniel Grooms, also disagreed with charging Assange, according to the people familiar with the matter. At the time, Grooms served as criminal chief in the U.S. Attorney's office that was handling the case.
Prosecutors debated the case internally for months, with James Trump and Grooms advocating against Espionage Act charges, the people said. By the time prosecutors actually charged Assange, James Trump had offered his opinion and was no longer part of the discussions, and Grooms left the Justice Department last month for unrelated reasons, these people said.
A Justice Department official said James Trump, who was not part of the original investigative team, offered to remain on board in whatever capacity his supervisors wanted after delivering his opinion. It was determined he had significant other case work and the team could proceed without his assistance, the official said.
It is not uncommon for prosecutors to internally debate or disagree about whether a particular case merits criminal charges; in the Assange case, however, the disagreement involved major questions about constitutional rights.
Grooms declined to comment; James Trump referred a reporter to Joshua Stueve, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Alexandria, Va., who said in a statement, "We do not respond to anonymously sourced statements. Department of Justice policy prohibits the unauthorized disclosure of non-public, sensitive information."
Part of the concern among Justice Department veterans was that prosecutors had looked at the same evidence for years during the Obama administration and determined such charges were a bad idea, in large part because Assange's conduct was too similar to that of reporters at established news organizations.
People familiar with the Assange case said that the Justice Department did not have significant evidence or facts beyond what the Obama-era officials had when they reviewed the case.
On Thursday, senior Justice Department officials announced an 18-count indictment against Assange, accusing him of conspiring with former Army Pfc. Chelsea Manning in 2010 to obtain and disseminate secret government documents. The charges alarmed First Amendment experts, who called them a threat to press freedoms.
Assange, 47, has spent years in the Ecuadoran Embassy in London, but after his asylum was revoked, British police arrested him last month and U.S. prosecutors unsealed a one-count indictment charging he conspired with Manning to try to hack a government computer password.
Law enforcement officials described that initial, single charge as a placeholder, and said officials had planned for months to charge Assange with Espionage Act violations, each one of which carries a potential 10-year prison sentence.
The new indictment accuses Assange of providing direction to Manning, the former Army intelligence analyst who shared hundreds of thousands of classified war logs and diplomatic papers with WikiLeaks. Manning is in jail for refusing to testify before a grand jury investigating Assange.
Assange is fighting extradition in the British courts, a process that could take years.
Jacques Semmelman, a New York lawyer who specializes in extradition cases, said the U.K. government is likely to reject the Espionage Act charges against Assange, due to an exemption in the extradition treaty for political offenses.
"It is a classic political offense. I have a difficult time seeing a British court departing so significantly from legal tradition and saying in this case they will make an exception," said Semmelman. "The political offense exception as it has existed for probably 150 years has consistently maintained that for espionage charges, they are not extraditable. That's just a classic principle of international extradition law."
Semmelman said U.S. prosecutors have a better chance of getting Assange extradited on the single hacking conspiracy charge, but added that the lengthy Espionage Act indictment makes even that task more difficult.
In announcing the indictment, U.S. Attorney G. Zachary Terwilliger said Assange was "not charged simply because he is a publisher" but rather for "publishing a narrow set of classified documents in which Assange also allegedly published the unredacted names of innocent people who risked their safety and freedom to provide information to the United States and its allies."
Assange's lawyer, Barry Pollack, countered Thursday that the charges reveal "the gravity of the threat the criminal prosecution of Julian Assange poses to all journalists in their endeavor to inform the public about actions that have been taken by the U.S. government."
Legal experts said the Assange charges suggest the Trump administration is trying to rewrite the legal balance between government secrecy and press freedom struck by the Supreme Court in the landmark 1971 case known as the Pentagon Papers.
"What the Pentagon Papers established is that the press is to be protected, and the government has generally followed that," said Genevieve Lakier, a First Amendment expert at the University of Chicago.
The Assange indictment is "blurring the line between a member of the press and a leaker," she said, by stretching the definition of complicity. "That could be really, really bad for the press, particularly in a period where there's much more hostility towards the press."
Because this kind of prosecution has never been attempted before, she said, "We just don't have a lot of very clear case law on how far reporters can go to protect their sources. It's a very thin line; when you're working with someone, you're often enabling them, helping them, protecting them, and if there's any collaboration, now you're in a conspiracy."
She also noted that the prosecution might have been made possible in part because Assange himself challenged those lines.
James Goodale, who was general counsel for the New York Times during the Pentagon Papers case, called the Assange indictment "highly outrageous."
Goodale said he feared the government was trying to interpret the Espionage Act so broadly to cover any kind of communication, in order to expand the reach of government secrecy rules.
"It's the same stupid statute, trying to be applied in a different and a really more heinous way," he said.

Texto completo: The real reasons so many hate Trump
In response to a recent letter to the editor, “Why the establishment hates Trump,” there is not a huge coordinated effort to change what Trump loyalists impressions are about Donald Trump.
The Trump loyalist is locked into worshiping him no matter what. As Trump said during the campaign, if he were to “shoot somebody on 5th Avenue" he wouldn’t lose a vote. Some evangelicals even claim that he was sent by God to save us. Trump is a reality TV personality. He's not a great businessman or a negotiator. He is a liar and a cheater. He cheats at golf, he cheats on his taxes and he cheats on his wives.
A former Bush official (Larry Lindsey) puts Trump on the couch. He had two psychologists evaluate the president from afar. The professionals found that he is a diagnosed narcissist. Having Trump on the TV every day is like having a contagious disease. Trump's shtick is that white people are under attack and we need to build walls because immigrants and minorities are taking our jobs and freeloading off the government.
Trump claims that the tariffs he’s imposed on China are being paid for by China that is totally wrong, the American consumer is paying. Farmers are being hammered and now need a subsidy because now China won’t buy their crops. This amounts to a tax on Americans, not the Chinese. Trump on foreign policy is one of sucking up to dictators and stiffing our allies.

Group trying to bring Union Bridge together
On behalf of “Dream Big Union Bridge” I would like to thank the Carroll County Times for the featured article on our recent “Rubber Duck Derby,” it was a great article and we truly appreciate the exposure.
As co-founder of "Dream Big Union Bridge" one of my goals is to bring the citizens together. Get to know your neighbor, you don't have to love them … but if we all pull together and show that we have each other's back and are looking out for each other. We can form a bond and grow together. We have a unique town in Union Bridge and we want to bring it back to life!
Anyone and everyone is welcome to attend our functions and meetings. We meet the first Monday of every month at St. James Lutheran Church in Union Bridge. You are not required to attend meetings of events, you can help behind the scenes. Everyone has something to bring, therefore all are welcome. Check us out on Facebook.

Union Bridge
Count your blessings, at any age
When you're a retiree and are feeling a growing list of aches and pains and have gone through major illnesses not only in your own body but also in your family and friend's bodies and deaths, you may want to do what I did recently when I awakened pain-free and the sun shined upon my 76-year-old body and I was inadvertently detoured and found myself driving through the parking lot at my doctor's office. I stopped for a moment, breathed in the fresh spring air and called out, "YES!"
I plan to dwell on that memory because it reminds me how many blessings I have no matter how many pains I will have in the future and even though Baugher's Restaurant still does not offer orange marmalade for my toasted English muffin.

Union Bridge
Don’t forget Democrats in criticism
Mitch Edelman’s column on immigration (April 23) chastised America for its failure to grant asylum to German Jewish refugees in 1939 who were aboard the MS St. Louis. He “forgot” to mention who was in charge at that time … Democrats!
A closer look reveals that FDR was president while both the House and Senate were controlled by Democrats. The New York Times was also complicit as it remained silent on the plight of European Jews throughout the Holocaust. More recently, anti-Semitism found a home within the Obama administration and among newly elected House members of the Democrat Party.

Texto completo: En el Subway de Nueva York se ven cantantes, bailarines, músicos, artistas plásticos y hasta esculturas…
Esta semana, usuarios de uno de los vagones del tren 4 de la línea roja viajaron acompañados de una escultura viviente que a su vez cargaba una columna que parecía ser de cemento en una carrucha.
El artista callejero que llevaba su cuerpo pintado de blanco al igual que la pieza que sostenía actúa como si fuera directo a su espacio y estuviera listo para su interpretación.
El personaje en el Subway que se asemejaba a una escultura de la Antigua Grecia, intentaba acomodarse sin molestar al resto hasta llegar a su parada.
Su presencia llamó la atención de otros pasajeros, algunos de los que aprovecharon para grabar la escena.
Y “como el mundo es pequeño”, y a Nueva York también le aplica el refrán, un cibernauta que comentó uno de los videos en Facebook dijo que el artista era su vecino.
“El vive en la puerta al lado de mi casa. Es un buen chico. También, créalo o no, hace buen dinero con eso”, expresó el usuario.
Un reporte del diario puertorriqueño Primera Hora del 2017 explica que el artista, identificado como Johan Figueroa González, es natural de la isla.
Sus interpretaciones trascendieron a los medios en PR cuando fue arrestado en enero de ese año por la Policía mientras realizaba su acto artístico en la Plaza de Armas del Viejo San Juan.
Después de esa experiencia, el artista decidió probar suerte en Nueva York. Espacios como el Washington Square Park en Manhattan le brindan la oportunidad de mostrar su talento sin intervenciones.
Tal ha sido su desarrollo que medios como The New York Times y de otros países han destacado su labor artística.
Las interpretaciones de Figueroa González destacan, principalmente, por la capacidad de camuflarse con la arquitectura.

Texto completo: Un video que la fiscalía en Nueva York aún no presenta como parte de la evidencia en el juicio contra Keith Raniere muestra el martirio al que fueron sometidas mujeres convertidas en esclavas sexuales a través de la secta NXIVM en Albany.
En la grabación se aprecia el rito de iniciación mediante el cual “tatuaban” a las mujeres con las iniciales del líder de la secta.
En el clip, presentado en exclusiva en el noticiero de Loret de Mola de Televisa , se ve a un grupo de cuatro féminas desnudas en una de estas ceremonias.
Una de ellas está acostada mientras la tatúan; se trata de Sarah Edmondson , quien denunció en 2017 las prácticas de la secta a The New York Times.
A Raniere, que camuflaba los abusos como cursos de “autoayuda” bajo “Programas de Éxito Ejecutivo”, se le ve en el video pronunciando una especie de juramento que las mujeres a su vez deben repetir.
“Por favor márcame, sería un honor que quiero portar por el resto de mi vida”, se escucha en la ceremonia.
A pesar del dolor que se refleja en la cara de Edmondson al ser marcada a fuego vivo con un cauterizador, ésta intenta disimularlo y ríe junto a las otras chicas.

Bajo el sistema piramidal creado por Raniere en 2015, el grupo se conformó solo por mujeres. El acusado ocupaba la punta de la pirámide.
El alcance de este caso y el programa ESP (Executive, Success, Program), llegó a México con los nombres de Alejandro Bentancourt y Emiliano Salinas, hijo del expresidente Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
Otra mexicana mencionada como cercana de Raniere es Rosa Laura Junco , hija del presidente de Grupo Reforma.

Texto completo: Our guide to film series and special screenings happening this weekend and in the week ahead. All our movie reviews are at nytimes.com/reviews/movies.
'DREAM OF A CITY' AND MANFRED KIRCHHEIMER'S NEW YORK at Maysles Cinema (May 24-30). Kirchheimer, an experimental documentarian and a city symphonist of New York, is perhaps best known for 1981's "Stations of the Elevated," which finds rhythm and poetry in graffiti-covered subway cars. This retrospective is organized around a run for his newly completed "Dream of a City," which was shot six decades ago -- from 1958 to 1960 -- and uses the construction of one high-rise as a starting point to celebrate life throughout New York at the time. Kirchheimer will appear at screenings this weekend, and all showtimes pair the 39-minute "Dream of a City" with another similar-length film.

FILMAFRICA at BAM Rose Cinemas (through May 27). This annual series at BAM starts the New York African Film Festival, which takes place around the city. Because this year is the 25th anniversary of the Rwandan genocide, the BAM lineup zeros in on Rwanda, with movies about the genocide (the HBO film "Sometimes in April," directed by Raoul Peck of "I Am Not Your Negro") as well as more recent Rwandan films like "Finding Hillywood" (on Friday and Saturday), which explores the country's developing film industry.

THE HOUR OF LIBERATION: DECOLONIZING CINEMA, 1966-81 at Film Forum (May 24-June 13). The anticolonial movements of the 1960s were both expressed and documented in cinema. Film Forum captures the spirit of those times in this series, which opens with classics like "The Battle of Algiers" (on Friday and Saturday and in June) and Ousmane Sembène's "Black Girl" (showing throughout the coming week and in June) and expands to all corners of the globe. The freewheeling Brazilian feature "Macunaíma" (on Tuesday and Wednesday and in June) infuses its 1928 source material with the concerns and rebellious mood percolating during Brazil's military dictatorship, while Med Hondo's "Soleil O" (on Thursday, May 31 and June 1), about a Mauritanian accountant in Paris, has been newly restored as part of an initiative to preserve historically significant African films.

ESTER KRUMBACHOVA: UNKNOWN MASTER OF THE CZECHOSLOVAK NEW WAVE at Film at Lincoln Center (May 24-29). In its first retrospective since its name change in April, Film at Lincoln Center highlights a secret weapon of 1960s and '70s Czechoslovak cinema: Krumbachova was a costume designer on Jan Nemec's World War II film "Diamonds of the Night" (on Saturday and Tuesday); a screenwriter, cast member and costume designer on Vera Chytilova's "Daisies" (on Friday and Monday); a screenwriter and production designer on the fairy-tale fantasia "Valerie and Her Week of Wonders" (on Saturday and Monday); and, once, a feature director in her own right ("The Murder of Mr. Devil," on Friday and Monday).

'LIANNA' at the Quad Cinema (May 28, 7 p.m.). John Sayles and the actress-producer Maggie Renzi will appear in person at this screening of Sayles's 1983 feature, about a faculty wife at a New Jersey university (Linda Griffiths) who falls in love with a psychology professor (Jane Hallaren). At the time, the film was received as trailblazing for its depiction of lesbian love. "Though 'Lianna' is about a subject that only yesterday was called explosive, and that even now is not all that commonplace, the film Mr. Sayles has made about Lianna's rude awakening -- to herself and the world -- mostly avoids melodramatics," Vincent Canby wrote in his review for The New York Times.

Texto completo: House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., said Democrats should keep plugging along conducting oversight on President Trump and hold off on opening an impeachment inquiry.
“The vast majority would, in fact, support impeachment, just not now,” Clyburn said during an interview with CNN’s John Berman Wednesday morning. “The issue now is whether or not that is something that should be done today or tomorrow, or whether or not we go through a process by which we build a foundation upon which to successfully impeach the president.”
“So that's where we are. We are all looking forward to the day when that might be ripened,” Clyburn said. “We have not gotten there yet. That is the difference between the majority of the caucus right now and the very strong minority who would like to see us move forward with impeachment right away.”
iFrame Object
Clyburn said Democrats have had multiple successes in recent days, citing “victories” including Michigan Republican Rep. Justin Amash’s comments arguing that Trump committed impeachable offenses during special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation. Clyburn said these successes were the result of multiple committees conducting oversight on the president’s actions and dealings.
“We got there by steady, focused movement in the direction of getting at the facts as to whether or not this president did, in fact, break the law. So why don't we keep doing it?” Clyburn said.
Although Clyburn said he was more interested in launching an impeachment inquiry than he was several weeks ago, he said he doesn’t believe “we ought to pull the trigger on that.”
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has rejected attempts from her party to move forward with an impeachment inquiry.
The New York Times reports she is holding a meeting with lawmakers Wednesday morning to discuss status and strategy of House investigations, and that she is receptive to using legislation to push Trump to cooperate with Congress’ oversight.

Texas, don't even think about importing California's rail disaster

Texto completo: Last week, the Trump administration fulfilled yet another promise when it canceled nearly $1 billion in taxpayer funding for California’s high-speed rail project between Los Angeles and San Francisco. In the midst of yet another infamous Infrastructure Week, this announcement was an important development in the effort to ensure that when it comes to the allocation of public resources, taxpayers aren’t on the hook for unrealistic boondoggles that both violate private property rights and provide a nonexistent return on investment.
The use of public resources in public rail projects is not inherently inappropriate. These investments, however, must be subject to serious scrutiny given the amount of money that backers seek for direct subsidies, loan guarantees, and ongoing financial support from taxpayers. At the end of its life this year, the California rail effort was projected to cost nearly $100 billion by the time it was completed in 2033, three times the original projections.
As the New York Times explained, “The cost was originally supposed to be split among the state, the federal government, and private businesses.” In July 2018, before the project was abandoned, a University of California, Berkeley professor and member of the committee appointed by the legislature to review the project explained, “At the moment, 100% of the cost is going to be absorbed by the taxpayers.”
From cost overruns to exaggerated ridership projections and eminent domain complications, the California train to nowhere provides an unfortunate case study in the evolution of high-speed rail projects in the United States.
That’s why the effort underway in Texas to build a high-speed rail project that connects Dallas and Houston should not be fast-tracked anytime soon.
On an estimated project cost of $15-18 billion, it’s worth noting that the Texas rail project has received less than $400 million dollars in loans from a bank and investment corporation backed by the Japanese government. This figure includes an additional bridge loan provided by an investor to service the accumulating foreign debt. Assuming this project is only as costly as projections suggest and is built within the time frame outlined by backers, that leaves more than $14 billion in project costs that have yet to be raised or financed. So, where might that come from?
A competing French technology company has explained, “it’s not going to happen on private financing” and provided important global context for the pipe dream of fully financing the project with private capital in stating: “Nowhere in the world have high-speed rail projects become reality without government participation.”
The Texas Central website even acknowledges, “the project will explore all forms of capital available to private companies to finance debt for the project including federal loan programs like RRIF and TIFIA.” The Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing program can be used to “fund up to 100% of a railroad project” for direct loans and loan guarantees of up to $35 billion. A Reason Foundation study of Texas Central in 2017 found that these loans “lack stringent taxpayer protections,” concluding that “the project will inevitably have to be bailed out by the taxpayers of Texas.”
It’s questionable as to whether Texas Central even qualifies for these loans. Under the definition and requirements of RRIF loans, it may not actually legally operate a railroad, a view that has been upheld in a Leon County, Texas, court. The decision may have ramifications beyond rail proponents’ ability to secure federal loans because legally operating as a railroad is also required for eminent domain purposes.
In an April 11 letter to the chairman of the U.S. Surface Transportation Board, Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, rightly urged the board to reject Texas Central’s petition to exercise federal eminent domain powers in order to take private land between Dallas and Houston for the train’s tracks. He explained that because the project does not connect to any existing federal or interstate railways, it does not qualify for the use of federal eminent domain authority.
Proponents of the Texas Central Rail project should start being a little more honest about the project. This isn’t a utopian free-market solution to infrastructure, and for the most part it won’t be a privately financed enterprise. Without the coercive use of eminent domain and billions of dollars in risky taxpayer-backed loans, this train might never leave the station.
If the abysmal failure of the California experience taught us anything, it’s that an early death of this project might be best for everyone.

IRS memo contradicts Mnuchin, says agency must comply with subpoena for Trump's tax returns

Texto completo: A draft memo written by an IRS lawyer says the agency must comply with congressional committee requests for President Donald Trump's tax returns unless he claims executive privilege, according to reports from The New York Times and The Washington Post.
The memo, first obtained by the Post, appears to contradict the administration's legal argument that Congress must have a "legitimate legislative purpose" for requesting the returns.
Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin has thus far refused to honor a subpoena from the House Ways and Means Committee for six years of the president's federal tax filings. But the memo says compliance "is mandatory, requiring the Secretary to disclose returns, and return information, requested by the tax-writing Chairs," according to the Post.
Mnuchin said Wednesday during a House Financial Services Committee hearing that he first learned of the memo from the Post and only glanced at it on his way to the hearing.
He disputed the assertion that the memo contradicted his conclusions, telling Rep. Jennifer Wexton, D-Va. , "that memo I understand is addressing a different issue, and is not addressing the issue that we and the Department of Justice looked at. "
"When it comes to constitutional issues there could be different interpretations and that's why there's a third branch of government," Mnuchin said, signaling his belief that the courts would have to resolve the dispute.
Mnuchin told Wexton he did not know why the memo had only now come to his attention.
"We're trying to find out who wrote the memo, where it came from, when it was and why it wasn't distributed," he said.
The IRS confirmed the authenticity of the memo, and spokesman Bruce Friedland told the Times it was written last fall. He said IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig and the agency's top lawyer, Michael Desmond, did not know about the memo until this week and that it was never sent to the Treasury Department.
Friedland told the Times the memo "is a draft background paper that was never finalized" and that it "is not the official position of the IRS. "
According to the Post, the memo says the law "does not allow the Secretary to exercise discretion in disclosing the information provided the statutory conditions are met" and that "the Secretary’s obligation to disclose return and return information" does not require the committee "to state a reason for the request. "
It says the "only basis" for the IRS to refuse to comply with the subpoena is "the invocation of the doctrine of executive privilege. "
The Post said the memo was written by a lawyer with the agency's Office of Chief Counsel, but the paper could not determine the identity of the lawyer.
Trump tax returns: Treasury Department refuses to comply with subpoena for Trump's tax returns
'You're ordering me to stay': Mnuchin threatens to not return before Congress after grilling on Trump's tax returns
Trump has refused to share his tax returns since the 2016 presidential campaign on the grounds that he has been under audit. But he has not provided evidence of such an audit and the IRS has no rule prohibiting an individual from sharing tax returns that are under audit.
Mnuchin said Wednesday that the people do not have a right to see the president's tax returns and "the American public knew that he didn't release them before they voted for him. " Trump has made similar arguments, saying in a tweet earlier this month that the "voters didn't care" that he didn't disclose his tax filings.
On Friday, Mnuchin told House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, D-Mass. , in a letter that he consulted with counsel for the Justice Department and "we have determined that the Committee's request lacks a legitimate legislative purpose. "
"The Department is therefore not authorized to disclose the requested returns and return information," Mnuchin said.
In response to "the Treasury Secretary’s failure to comply" Neal said in a statement that he was "consulting with counsel on how best to enforce the subpoenas moving forward. "
On Wednesday, Rep. Alma Adams, D-N. C. , asked Mnuchin, "Are you aware then that by denying this that you are in direct violation of the law?"
"No, absolutely not. I have been advised I am not violating the law. I never would have done anything that violated the law, and quite the contrary I've been advised that had I turned them over, I would be violating the law," he responded.
Neal had already made two requests to Rettig for the returns before issuing the subpoena to Mnuchin. He asked for the tax filings under a 1924 law stating that the IRS "shall furnish" any individual's tax returns if they are requested by the chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, the Senate Finance Committee or the Joint Committee on Taxation. The only limitation on that power explicitly expressed in the law is that the returns must be viewed in "closed session. "
In his statement on Friday, Neal said the law "does not allow for discretion as to whether to comply" with the request. But he did outline a legislative purpose in his request, saying the returns were necessary for a review of the process for auditing presidential tax returns. Mnuchin has argued Trump's returns aren't necessary for such a review.
But, as the contradictions between the IRS memo and the administration's official position indicate, there is some debate on the question of whether the committees must have a "legislative purpose" to request the documents, and – if it is necessary –whether Neal's request demonstrates such a purpose.

"The memo writer’s interpretation is that the IRS has no wiggle room on this," University of Chicago Law School professor Daniel Hemel told the Post. "Mnuchin is saying the House Ways and Means Committee has not asserted a legitimate legislative purpose. The memo says they don’t have to assert a legitimate legislative purpose – or any purpose at all. "
"The House Ways and Means Committee’s request to obtain the president’s tax returns falls squarely within its oversight and legislative authority, and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin has no basis to refuse the request," Fordham University law professor Rebecca Kysar told Vox.
But other experts have cited the potential for abuse if Congress is given the power to request individuals' tax returns without limitation.
An April 2019 Congressional Research Service analysis compiled by legislative attorneys said that the law would likely be "subject to the same legal limitations that generally attach to Congress’ use of other compulsory investigative tools. Notably, the inquiry must further a 'legislative purpose' and not otherwise breach relevant constitutional rights or privileges. "
But that report notes that the Supreme Court's interpretation of a legislative purpose is "relatively generous" and "authorizes inquiry into any topic upon which legislation could be had. " It said the Supreme Court has also found Congress' "power of inquiry" to conduct oversight to be "penetrating and far reaching" but that it must not be used to "expose for the sake of exposure" and used against an individual when the inquiry could "result in no valid legislation.

Texto completo: Yellow cabbies should be exempted from congestion pricing tolls coming to Manhattan as well as a surcharge that is already in place, according to two City Council members.
Councilmen Ydanis Rodriguez and Fernando Cabrera on Tuesday called on Gov. Andrew Cuomo and the MTA to establish the carveout before the new tolls take effect, which is expected in 2021. Their request came in response to an extensive investigation from The New York Times detailing how thousands of immigrant workers fell victim to predatory loans that saddled them with crippling debt, as lenders fattened their pockets and the government ignored warning signs. 
"Our taxi drivers are currently facing a financial epidemic unlike we've ever seen. This crisis ... did not happen overnight," said Rodriguez, the chair of the Transportation Committee. "This is the result of an accumulation of lack of leadership and bad decisions for many decades."
Yellow taxis and other for-hire vehicles are already subjected to a congestion pricing surcharge, which took effect in February. Yellow cabs operating in Manhattan below 96th Street saw an added $2.50 fee on top of the $5.50 base fare just to get in the vehicle. Ubers, Lyfts and other car services driving in the area are hit with a $2.75 surcharge. 
The surcharge has angered the professional driving industry and arrived amid a series of driver suicides, which advocates have blamed on economic hardships plaguing the industry.
But the request to be exempt from the surcharge and a future toll flies in the face of transportation experts and environmental advocates who have argued exceptions would lessen the impact of the policy - both from the standpoint of traffic reduction and transit funding.
Rodriguez and Cabrera, the later of whom opposes congestion pricing outright, are the latest politicians to speak out following the Times' investigation, though the issues had been reported before and overlooked by city, state and federal elected officials. New York Attorney General Letitia James announced an investigation into lending practices around taxi medallions and Mayor Bill de Blasio followed with a separate investigation into the brokers involved in arranging the loans.
"The review will set down strict new rules that prevent broker practices that hurt drivers," de Blasio said in a statement. "It's unacceptable to prey on hardworking New Yorkers trying to support their families and we'll do all that we can to put an end to it."
It's not clear yet what impact the congestion surcharges will have on the yellow cab industry, though the former commissioner of the city's Taxi & Limousine Commission predicted they would be "devastating." Yellow taxi trips have actually increased slightly as the new fees took effect, from 247,315 average daily trips in January of this year to 252,634 in March. But monthly averages tend to have sizable fluctuations and trips are still down when you compare that three-month span to the same point last year - part of a long downward slide in trips that came as e-hails like Uber and Lyft flooded the city with cars. 
The MTA and the governor's office did not respond to requests for comment. 
"Without an exemption from the congestion surcharge, taxi drivers - whether they are lease-drivers or owner-drivers - simply won't earn enough to survive, even if their expenses go down," said Bhairavi Desai, the executive director of the New York

Texto completo: In the years since World War II broke out in Europe and President Franklin Roosevelt foreshadowed support for France and England in a radio fireside chat, presidents have spoken to the American people at length about conflicts threatening to involve the nation.
As tensions rise precipitously between the United States and Iran — with bombers set on hair trigger alert and naval battle groups on the move — that's not what we're getting from President Donald Trump. Standing in the front door of the White House last week he blurted out, "I hope not," to a reporter's shouted question about the prospect of war with Iran.
Then on Sunday, he seemed to contradict that sentiment in a tweet, "If Iran wants to fight, that will be the official end of Iran. Never threaten the United States again!"
As tightening sanctions cripple the Persian Gulf nation, an American carrier group is rushed to the region and nonemergency personnel are evacuated from the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad and the U.S. Consulate in Erbil — a step not taken even when Islamic State terrorists were rampaging across Iraq in 2014 — Trump needs to explain what he is trying to achieve.
The commander in chief is preparing the military for the outbreak of violence, but he's not fulfilling his role in preparing the public. On Tuesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Joseph Dunford will brief the House of Representatives in a secure auditorium. The New York Times reports that military officials expect Middle East commanders to ask for a fresh wave of American forces to deter Iran.
The White House and the Pentagon say the moves are a response to intelligence that Iran is planning attacks on U.S. troops in the region. But this conflicts with threat assessments by allies.
Beyond this immediate urgency, confusion persists about the broader endgame behind the Trump administration's "maximum pressure" campaign of sanctions, levied against Iran ever since Washington last year withdrew from a 2015 agreement that was successfully containing Tehran's nuclear program.
Now Iran threatens to resume stockpiling enriched uranium that could be the precursor to a nuclear warhead.
There's no question Iran is a bad actor in the Middle East, growing its ballistic missile program and using proxy forces in Lebanon, Syria and Yemen to provoke violence and instability. But how Trump intends to change this is not at all clear.
The sanctions are aimed at making Iran "conform to the normal things that normal nations do," Pompeo said this month. But he clearly doesn't believe this himself. "I just don't see it," the secretary of State said earlier about Iran moderating its behavior.
And Trump's other leading foreign policy consultant, national security adviser John Bolton, has made a career out of advocating force against Iran.
Is regime change the goal? This hasn't worked in Venezuela, where a weaker dictator with a devastated economy still resists U.S.-led efforts to install a new government. And Iran has resisted U.S. efforts to moderate its behavior for 40 years.
Trump, who relishes summitry, has repeatedly offered to meet with Iranian leaders and cut a "deal" to curb their behavior and accept tougher nuclear restrictions. Tehran has thus far shown zero interest.
Trump has long promised to avoid foreign entanglements and has told the Pentagon that his wish is no war with Iran. Then why did he hire Bolton?
And what is the plan? Soundbites shouted at reporters and belligerent tweets can't convey to Americans the risks Iran poses and what the United States is compelled to do about it.
If there is to be a face-off that includes the prospect of a wider conflict, President Trump owes it to the American people to speak before the saber rattling becomes a sobering reality.

Dishonesty on both sides of abortion

Texto completo: In the past five months, various states have passed both the most permissive and the most restrictive abortion laws seen since the Supreme Court ruled in 1973 that the right to an abortion is constitutionally protected. The combination of those laws and the reactions to them have given the debate a heightened passion. Abortion is on the lips and minds and social-media feeds of many Americans. But in observing the debate, you'd think the two sides were talking about two different procedures that affect two separate populations, yet share a name.
To listen to the most passionate supporters of legal abortion and the New York law guaranteeing access to the procedure up to the time of birth when the health of the mother is at risk, you would think that the mother is the only living being affected. It is only "her body," only "her choice" and the only impacts are on her.
In an article posted Tuesday on the website Prevention, Dr. Jen Gunter, an OB/GYN and columnist for The New York Times who supports unrestricted abortions at any time in a pregnancy (and makes a very compelling case for it), wrote, "We must hold the line at the truth that all abortions are valid. The headlines should not be about restrictions; they should inform that abortion is a medical procedure. That's all an abortion is - a medical procedure. There shouldn't be abortion laws that ban it, just like there aren't appendectomy laws for appendicitis."
But comparing killing a viable fetus late in a pregnancy with removing a diseased appendix is not honest or productive.
To listen to the supporters of laws passed recently that ban abortion almost entirely (Alabama) or cut it off at six weeks (Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, Ohio), you would think the fetus is the only being affected by the procedure. Of the bill he signed in March, Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant tweeted, "We will all answer to the good Lord one day. I will say in this instance, 'I fought for the lives of innocent babies, even under the threat of legal action.' "
It's as if to Bryant, the women carrying these babies, including those who were raped, were victims of incest or did not know they were pregnant six weeks in, do not exist except as baby containers.
Both of these stances are lies of omission. Two beings are deeply affected by every abortion performed, and any abortion prevented. In discussing the legality of abortions, the interests of two beings are at stake, and must be balanced.
Other lies have become staples of this debate, too. The slur that anti-abortion activists only care about children until they are born is disproved by the churches that work to feed and clothe and shelter poor children even as they fight abortion. The idea that anything more than a microscopic fraction of expectant mothers and doctors would abort viable fetuses late in pregnancy without a hugely compelling medical reason is farcical.
I support legal abortions. I also support a fight against unplanned pregnancy that includes free long-term contraception for all women and the development and distribution of free long-term contraception for all men. The key to cutting abortions is limiting pregnancy to those who want babies.
But I know there are well-intentioned, loving people on both sides of this argument. I know every abortion affects two beings. And I know that the rhetoric coming from both extremes in this fight doesn't capture the feelings of the huge group caught in the middle.

Colombia's Army Ordered Up 'Double' Killings, Then Backpedaled

Texto completo: Colombia's army walked back on Tuesday part of a contentious policy to step up attacks in the country, saying it would change its pledge forms in which officers are required to list the number of criminals and militants they plan to kill, capture or force to surrender in battle.
The change came only days after The New York Times revealed the army's new orders instructing top commanders to "double the results" of their combat operations against guerrilla, paramilitary and criminal organizations in Colombia.
The orders had unnerved some senior army officers, who said the intense pressure to carry out attacks was heightening the risk of civilian casualties and had already led to suspicious deaths by overzealous soldiers.
Colombia endured as many as 5,000 illegal killings in the mid-2000s after soldiers were pressured by their superiors to increase attacks on guerrilla fighters during the country's civil war.
Many soldiers killed innocent peasants during that era to lift their combat numbers, sometimes even dressing up civilian victims in rebel fatigues and planting weapons near their bodies to make them look like enemy fighters.
Two years ago, the Colombian government reached a peace deal with the country's largest rebel group -- the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC -- in an effort to end decades of conflict.
But peace has been elusive. Many Colombians opposed the peace deal, saying it was too soft on the rebels. Some armed groups never agreed to the deal, while many former guerrillas have returned to fighting.
[Read about how Colombia's peace deal with the country's largest rebel group is beginning to fray.]
A new government has taken over since the deal was struck, and at the start of this year, Colombian generals and colonels were gathered together and told to sign the written pledge to step up attacks again.
After the Times investigation, Maj. Gen. Nicacio Martínez Espinel, the top commander of the army, told the Colombian newspaper El Tiempo that he would withdraw the pledge required of officers.
Then on Tuesday, an army spokeswoman said the pledge would be "subject to some modifications" because of "a possible wrong interpretation" by those outside the military. She did not specify what the changes were.
In an interview with The Times last week, General Martínez acknowledged that he had issued the orders to officers to "double the results" of their operations, citing what he called a growing threat of the country's paramilitary and guerrilla groups.
But he disputed how officers interviewed by The Times had interpreted his instructions on the pledge form, saying commanders only needed to vow to be "operationally effective."
On Monday, Colombia's defense minister, Guillermo Botero, released results from recent operations that indicated there had been a 33 percent surge in overall operations since mid-December, including a 124 percent increase in combat operations.
Between Dec. 11 and May 18, there were 67 deaths, up 6 percent from the same period last year; the number of those arrested increased 132 percent, to 1,713 arrests this year.
While the pledge to increase captures, kills and surrenders would be changed, the Defense Ministry indicated no change in other orders that had also worried officers.
One order apparently still in place instructs officers not to "demand perfection" in carrying out attacks, even if significant questions remain about the targets they are striking.
"You must launch operations with 60 to 70 percent credibility or exactitude," the order says.
The orders, which all appeared this year, have already led to suspicious killings and cover-ups, according to officers interviewed by The Times.
Colombia's military remains under investigation by prosecutors in Colombia for the series of illegal killings in the mid-2000s, known as "false positives."
At least 1,176 members of the security forces have been convicted of crimes related to the illegal deaths, according to the government.
In an interview published Monday in El Tiempo, President Iván Duque said he did not know about the pledge form but that he had a "zero tolerance guideline for the armed forces."
Mr. Duque said he stood by General Martínez, whom he described as having a good record.
He added, "I don't tolerate nor will I tolerate any violation of the Constitution or the law by any member of the armed forces."

Texto completo: From the start, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi has resisted calls to impeach President Donald Trump.
She’s called the move divisive. She refused to budge even as rumblings grew among House Democrats that special counsel Robert Mueller’s report had enough to start impeachment proceedings against Mr. Trump on obstruction of justice grounds. On Monday night, Ms. Pelosi told Democratic leaders that impeachment would take away from the party’s legislative agenda and undercut ongoing investigations into the president by other congressional committees.
But the pressure is mounting, as the Trump administration continues blocking Democrats’ every effort at investigation. It’s unclear how long can Ms. Pelosi can hold the line.
“The more they stonewall, the more powerless people feel, and the more they want to take this immediate action,” says Krystal Ball, a political commentator and host on The Hill’s digital news channel. “The pressure comes from that sense of powerlessness and disgust.”
An April CNN poll found that 69% of Democratic voters want Congress to move forward with impeachment. Billionaire Tom Steyer this month launched a $1 million ad campaign accusing Democrats of doing nothing while the president got away with obstruction and corruption. Even Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan, a Republican and member of the conservative Freedom Caucus, said over the weekend that the president should be impeached for obstruction of justice.
All the while, Mr. Trump has stayed on war footing with congressional Democrats, almost daring them to go ahead. “If it’s an impeachment proceeding, then somebody should call it that,” Rudy Giuliani, one of the president’s personal lawyers, told The New York Times this month. “If you don’t call their bluff now, they’ll just keep slithering around for four, five, six months.”
At the Monday meetings, some Democratic leaders pressed Ms. Pelosi on the issue, arguing that impeachment proceedings would give them access to the documents that the administration has refused to provide. The situation intensified Tuesday after former White House counsel Don McGahn failed to obey a Judiciary Committee summons. Even members less explicitly in favor of taking that step say the White House is pushing them toward doing so.
“The initial aim was to investigate and then see what we have. The problem is we can’t get any information,” Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, chair of the House Oversight Committee, tells reporters. “The caucus is slowly moving toward saying, ‘Well, what do we do?’ Because he’s not leaving us with any choices.”
This group of lawmakers – reluctant to move toward impeachment but also increasingly willing to take that step – could be the tipping point for Ms. Pelosi, says Kris Miller, who teaches American government and legislative politics at the University of Maryland, College Park. Before this week, the loudest calls for impeaching the president had come mostly from progressive members in solidly blue districts, she says. Now, some combination of institutional duty and being boxed in by the administration’s stonewalling has caused a rise in this third camp.
“Their numbers are not huge, but they’re growing quickly,” Professor Miller says. “I think that changes a lot for the caucus overall.”
Still, Ms. Pelosi isn’t entirely out of options – yet. Democrats have managed to put the Trump administration on the defensive in one court case: On Monday, a federal district court judge ruled that the president’s accounting firm must turn over his financial records to the House Oversight Committee. Judge Amit Mehta rejected the Trump legal team’s argument that the committee had no authority to investigate the president.
There’s also a view that if Ms. Pelosi could hold her caucus together until a little closer to the 2020 primaries – if the burst of voices calling for impeachment dies down in the next day or two – she might be able to more successfully make the case that the best way to defeat Mr. Trump is through the ballot box.
And while some Democratic presidential candidates have voiced support for impeachment, “It’s not absolutely in their interest to have all this going on while they’re trying to introduce themselves to the public,” says John Fortier, of the Bipartisan Policy Center. “The argument that impeachment may not be good for [the Democratic Party] politically is a strong one.”
One big wild card could be the special counsel’s testimony, if it takes place. A public hearing relatively soon might be enough to defuse the pressure on Democrats to take drastic action, Professor Miller says.
For now, every option seems to be on the table. “Everybody in the Democratic caucus – including Pelosi – wants to hold the administration to account,” Washington Rep. Pramila Jayapal told a group of reporters Tuesday.
“The question is … how do we best do that?” says Representative Jayapal, who co-chairs the Progressive Caucus and called for impeachment over the weekend. “And that is an ongoing discussion.”

Texto completo: Crece la presión para que la legislatura de Nueva York avance el programa que entregaría licencias de conducción a indocumentados en todo el estado.
Una coalición de inmigrantes y activistas se manifestó este martes en Albany, sede del Gobierno del estado de Nueva York, para pedir que se apruebe este vital proyecto de ley.
La propuesta de ley, presentada por el asambleísta Marcos Crespo y el senador Luis Sepúlveda, está a la espera de recibir el respaldo de las dos cámaras legislativas, cuya sesión finaliza a mediados de junio, lo que preocupa a los inmigrantes que dependen de un coche para trabajar o desplazarse.
“Las licencias de conducir son necesarias para familias como la mía. En Long Island y a través del estado hay áreas donde conducir se convierte en la única opción porque no podemos confiar en el sistema público de transporte para ir al trabajo o llevar a nuestros niños a sus citas médicas”, aseguró Silvia García, residente de Long Island y miembro de la organización proinmigrante Se Hace Camino Nueva York.
“Los inmigrantes de Nueva York han esperado por mucho tiempo, necesitamos que la legislatura del estado tome acción ahora”, afirmó García en un comunicado de la “Coalición Luz Verde” que convocó la protesta de hoy.
Doce estados, Puerto Rico y el distrito de Columbia ya han otorgado licencias de conducir a indocumentados.
Para el asambleísta Crespo, el tiempo para restaurar el privilegio de conducir a los residentes que no son ciudadanos “es ahora”, dijo Crespo en referencia a que los indocumentados podían conducir en este estado.
Pero, en el 2002, un año después de los atentados terroristas del 11S, el gobernador George Pataki impuso el requisito de presentar el documento del seguro social para sacar o mantener la licencia de conducir, lo que llevó a que miles perdieran el permiso.
“Esta legislación hará las carreteras más seguras para todos los neoyorquinos. Además aumentará significativamente los ingresos para nuestro estado y reducirá el coste del seguro (de los coches) para todos los conductores” , afirmó.
Aunque resta poco tiempo para que concluya la sesión legislativa, antes de que comience el periodo de vacaciones, aún no hay fecha para votar el proyecto ni el gobernador Andrew Cuomo ha pedido a los legisladores que lo incluyan en la agenda.
Por su parte, el senador Sepúlveda aseguró que el proyecto de ley es “sin lugar a dudas una de las cosas correctas que hay que hacer para Nueva York, con carreteras más seguras, comunidades más fuertes y más unidas y un auge económico”.
Destacó que los inmigrantes indocumentados aportan más de mil millones de dólares al año a la economía del estado y que de aprobarse el proyecto, esa cantidad aumentará con la creación de más empleos, mejores salarios y millones de dólares en ingresos locales y estatales.
En un editorial el pasado abril, el periódico New York Times apoyó la legislación y destacó que se calcula que en Nueva York viven 750,000 indocumentados, lo que suponía más del 5 % de la fuerza trabajadora del estado en 201 6, de acuerdo con el Pew Research Center.

Texto completo: Bobby Hall, the rapper known as Logic, already went to No. 1 once this year, with his debut novel, "Supermarket," topping The New York Times's paperback trade fiction list. Now he has a chart-topping album as well, as "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind" becomes Logic's third No. 1 at Billboard.
Featuring guest spots by Eminem, Will Smith and Gucci Mane, "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind" (Visionary/Def Jam) was credited with a total of 80,000 sales in the United States in its opening week, which includes 74 million streams and 24,000 copies sold as a full album, according to Nielsen.
On the singles chart, Lil Nas X's "Old Town Road" holds at No. 1 for a seventh week. Two weeks ago, the country-meets-rap phenomenon (or is that rap-meets-country?) blocked a new Taylor Swift single from the top spot, and now it holds off a superstar collaboration -- Ed Sheeran and Justin Bieber's "I Don't Care" -- which lands at No. 2. (Taylor Swift's song, "Me!," falls to No. 8.)
So far "Old Town Road" is showing no signs of slowing down. Its winningly campy music video was released last Friday and has already racked up 39 million views on YouTube, which should help the song's chances on next week's chart.
Back on the album chart, Billie Eilish's "When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?" holds at No. 2, Khalid's "Free Spirit" is No. 3, and Ariana Grande's "Thank U, Next" is No. 5.
In fourth place is "Space Between," the new album by Sammy Hagar and his band the Circle -- which includes Michael Anthony, like Hagar a Van Halen exile. It had just 263,000 streams but, thanks in part to a ticketing bundle, sold 40,000 copies as a full album, more than any other title this week.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Whatever he's hiding, it's troubling

Texto completo: When you look at the short span of President Trump's political career, one question jumps out: How much of his craziest, most paranoid and norm- violating behavior is motivated by a desire to keep his financial arrangements secret?
It began with Trump's bizarre refusal to release his tax returns, in defiance of both a nearly half-century practice and Trump's own promise that he'd do so.
Then there was his refusal to divest from his sprawling multinational empire, or even put it into a blind trust - either of which would have forced at least some information disclosure to a third party.
There were also the interviews and tweetstorms calling journalists who report on his finances "enemies of the people," and suggestions that federal officials who audit him are anti- Christian.
As well as his implicit threat in 2017 that he would fire special counsel Robert S. Mueller III if he crossed a "red line" by examining Trump's personal financial dealings.
Also, his curious personnel priorities. Once it became clear that House Democrats would exercise their explicit statutory authority to get Trump's tax returns from the Internal Revenue Service, Trump asked Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to prioritize confirmation of Trump's IRS general counsel nominee ahead of confirmation of a new attorney general. This IRS general counsel pick, mind you, also happened to have previously advised the Trump Organization on tax issues.
Trump's treasury secretary has also been spending so much time safeguarding Trump's tax returns, in violation of that explicit statute, that the activity is reportedly crowding out his day job.
All of which raises the question: Why exactly is Trump (and the rest of his administration) expending so much energy and political capital to keep these documents hidden? What could possibly be so disturbing or incriminating to justify such an effort?
One theory is that, maybe, if Trump's tax returns or other financial records become public, his supporters would learn that he's not nearly as rich as he says. Another is that his finances are not exactly on the up and up.
Of course, both explanations could be true.
Thanks to dogged reporting from the New York Times, we know that Trump lost more than $1 billion over a decade beginning in 1985, more than nearly any other taxpayer in the country. We know that he inherited a fortune from his father - including through legally questionable tax dodges - but frittered much of that fortune away.
We also know, thanks to other matters of public record - including testimony from the president's own former attorney, as well as a sworn deposition from Trump himself - that Trump has inflated his net worth when it suited him.
So yes, whatever information Trump's financial documents reveal about his actual net worth could potentially undermine the core tenet of his sales pitch to his voters.
But what he might be a wee bit more worried about relates to the other red flags raised over the years.
Issues such as: Why international transactions involving multiple Deutsche Bank accounts controlled by Trump set off alerts in a computer system designed to detect money laundering and other financial crimes, as the Times reported Sunday.
Or why Trump purchased a house for $40 million and flipped it for more than twice that amount in a sale to a Russian oligarch, another transaction that might raise suspicions of money laundering.
Or why, about a decade ago, the self-proclaimed "King of Debt" suddenly began making huge, all-cash real estate purchases, including of money-losing golf courses. Debt is highly tax- advantaged in real estate finance. The fact that Trump went on a cash spending spree while interest rates were near zero is fishy at best. Not least because a golf reporter said Trump's son Eric told him that the organization wasn't borrowing from banks because it had "all the funding we need out of Russia." (Eric Trump later denied making the statement.)
We don't know what Trump is working so hard to hide, but we have a lot of hints. They're all troubling. Which is precisely why it's so important that Congress - as part of its constitutionally mandated oversight duties - conduct a forensic audit of Trump's worldwide financial dealings. That means learning whom he's been getting money from, whom he owes money to, and what individuals or entities could be using financial influence to exert pressure over policy.
Almost as troubling as whatever it is Trump is trying to hide: Why do all those supposed national security hawks in Trump's party exhibit so little curiosity about the answers?

PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES WEIGH IN ON ABORTION IN WAKE OF BANS: The number of states moving ahead with tougher abortion laws is bringing the issue to the forefront of the 2020 presidential election.
Alabama enacted the nation’s strictest abortion ban last week, following four other states that passed laws banning abortion after six weeks into a pregnancy, before many women know they’re pregnant. While such laws have been blocked by judges everywhere they have been challenged, they are aimed at having the Supreme Court revisit Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that legalized abortion up to roughly 24 weeks into a pregnancy.
President Trump spoke out on the issue this weekend, suggesting he believed that the Alabama law — which allows exemptions only in cases in which the woman’s health is in danger — went too far. Trump said he supports exemptions for women who are victims of rape or incest and allowing abortions if a woman’s pregnancy threatens her life. He encouraged other Republicans to unite behind that message.
“If we are foolish and do not stay UNITED as one, all of our hard fought gains for Life can, and will, rapidly disappear!” he tweeted.
Democratic presidential candidates in interviews throughout the weekend said they supported abortion rights. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said he doesn’t think there should be restrictions on abortion, and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg said on Fox News that he supported allowing abortions in the third trimester, describing circumstances in which wanted pregnancies turn out not to be viable.
Other candidates spoke out not only about their support for abortion but also how they would work to further abortion access should the Supreme Court try to chip away at Roe.
New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker last week told Buzzfeed News that if he becomes president he would sign a bill that would make abortion legal nationwide, superceding whatever the Supreme Court decides. New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee both made similar promises while Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren released several proposals not just to have Congress pass a law codifying the rules in Roe but to block state restrictions on the procedure.

VIRGINIA ABORTION RESTRICTIONS FACE TWO-WEEK TRIAL: The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia will hear challenges to four of Virginia’s anti-abortion laws over the next two weeks. The laws have been on the books for more than 40 years, and the challenge against them was brought on behalf of abortion providers in the commonwealth by the Center for Reproductive Rights, Planned Parenthood, O’Melveny and Myers, and the ACLU of Virginia.
The groups want the court to strike down a law that only lets doctors provide abortions, a law requiring second-trimester abortions be performed at a hospital, a 24-hour waiting period, and licensing requirements for clinics. The case, Falls Church Healthcare Center v. Normal Oliver, will run through May 31.
COLORADO MOVES TOWARD PUBLIC OPTION: Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, signed into law Friday a bill that directs state agencies to come up with a public option proposal by Nov. 15. After agencies file the plan to the legislature, the state will apply for any necessary waivers with the Department of Health and Human Services to implement it.
PROTECT OUR CARE HITS GOP LAWMAKERS WITH 7-FIGURE AD BUY: Protect Our Care, an advocacy group aiming to preserve the Affordable Care Act, launched a seven-figure ad campaign Monday to applaud House Democrats in 20 congressional districts for passing the recent bill that would lower drug prices and bolster the Affordable Care Act. The ads will include the name of each congressmember, saying they “stood up to the big drug companies and made it harder for them to rig the system just so they can rake in bigger profits by charging you more.”
AMY KLOBUCHAR GETS PERSONAL ON ALZHEIMER’S: MY DAD’S IN MEMORY CARE: Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., described how Alzheimer's is affecting her father, a longtime Minneapolis newspaper columnist who has publicly battled alcoholism. “People don't really realize it just adds so much cost to our healthcare because they get other illnesses, and they fall, and things go wrong because of their problem with Alzheimer's," Klobuchar, a presidential candidate, said at a New Hampshire campaign stop Sunday.
MISSOURI MOVES A STEP CLOSER TO EIGHT-WEEK ABORTION RESTRICTION: A Missouri proposal to ban abortions after eight weeks passed the state House Friday 110-44 and contains no exceptions for rape or incest. The bill now goes to Republican Gov. Mike Parson, who has said he will sign it.
LOUISIANA’S DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR ‘INCLINED’ TO SIGN TOUGHER ANTI-ABORTION BILL: Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, signaled he’d support a bill that would ban abortion as soon as a fetal heartbeat is detected. "Certainly he wants to see the final bill first. This is very much in line with his previous pro-life votes and actions,” Christina Stephens, a deputy chief of staff, told CNN.
MEASLES CASES REACH A NEW HIGH: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Monday that the number of measles cases has increased to 880, 41 more than last week. This is the highest number since the 1994 outbreak.
CORY BOOKER WRITES OPEN LETTER TO MEN ADDRESSING ABORTION: Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker published a letter in GQ telling men to stand up against recent abortion restrictions and legislation limiting women’s access to healthcare. The New Jersey senator said part of the effort to protect reproductive rights is on men, “Not because women are our mothers, sisters, wives or friends — but because women are people. And all people deserve to control their own bodies.”
FDA ISSUES WARNING ABOUT UNAPPROVED DIABETES MANAGEMENT DEVICES: The Food and Drug Administration warned Friday of unauthorized or unapproved devices used to manage diabetes, including some insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitoring systems, which could provide inaccurate blood glucose measurements or unsafe insulin dosing. “By using products that have not been reviewed by the agency for safety and effectiveness, patients with diabetes may be putting themselves at risk for serious injury or even death,” said Dr. Jeff Shuren, director of the Center for Devices and Radiological Health.
DNA TESTS REVEAL 30% OF SUSPECTED FRAUDULENT MIGRANT FAMILIES WERE UNRELATED: In a pilot program, approximately 30% of rapid DNA tests of immigrant adults who were suspected of arriving at the southern border with children who weren't theirs revealed the adults were not related to the children, an official involved in the system's temporary rollout told the Washington Examiner Friday. "There’s been some concern about, 'Are they stepfathers or adopted fathers?'" the official said. "Those were not the case. In these cases, they are misrepresented as family members."

Texto completo: Two Naperville natives recently took a dive into the "Shark Tank" and came out with a big bite.
Brothers Anthony and Nick Pucci took their product, Cubicall, to the popular ABC-TV program, where budding entrepreneurs pitch their business to a panel of celebrity executives, with the hope of getting one of the panel members to invest in their business.
Cubicall is a custom phone booth that the brothers created out of necessity a couple of years ago, Anthony Pucci said in a news release. The booth has a simple and efficient design that fits into an office space, providing a quiet, private space for workers to make calls or hold private conversations.
"We started this company when we created our own solution to the problems we experienced when working in an open office," said Nick Pucci. "After selling two phone booths the very first weekend we put our phone booths online, we knew we weren’t alone with our frustrations."
The Puccis sought a $350,000 investment for a 10% stake in the company.
While they were initially met with skepticism from the panel, they got offers from panelists Kevin O’Leary and Barbara Corcoran. Both offered $350,000 for a 25% stake in the company, but O’Leary also sought a $100 royalty for each product sold to a certain point, then a $50 per item royalty afterward.
The duo chose to accept Corcoran’s offer.
"We knew going into this that Barbara Corcoran was the best Shark for Cubicall," Anthony said. "Her expertise and experience in commercial real estate and contract furniture dealers makes her the perfect partner for Cubicall. We couldn’t be more thrilled with the outcome."
Nick said appearing on the show was a great experience.
"Going on Shark Tank was surreal. We’ve been watching the show since the first season," he said. "We thought we had a pretty good chance at striking a deal.
"We were thrilled to get two offers," he added. "While Mr. Wonderful’s (O’Leary) may have been tempting, we knew Barbara was the perfect partner for Cubicall."
The brothers, who now live in Los Angeles, launched Cubicall in 2017. They realized their potential when they began selling the booths to companies like IBM, SAP, Lyft and Cisco and educational institutions like the University of Wisconsin Madison.
The phone booths have been featured on Fox Business Channel, The New York Times, Interior Design, Fast Company Inc. and was called "an efficient privacy solution to open-plan distractions" by Forbes, according to the Puccis.
While the brothers’ business is fairly new, entrepreneurship runs in the family.
Their great grandfather opened Cicero Macaroni, a pasta factory in Cicero, in 1922. Their grandfather eventually sold the business to Riviana Foods Inc., the maker of No Yolks and Wacky Mac noodles.
Good fellow Congratulations to Cozen O’Connor attorney Danielle Harris for being selected as a fellow to the 2019 National Employment Law Council Academy.
An associate in the firm’s Labor and Employment practice in Chicago, Harris is one of 31 fellows chosen nationwide to participate in this year’s NELC Academy. It is the second consecutive year she has been selected for the academy.
Harris’ practice primarily consists of litigating single plaintiff employment cases and counseling clients with non-litigation employment matters.
The Gurnee native graduated magna cum laude with her undergraduate degree from Northern Illinois University and received her law degree from Chicago-Kent College of Law.
Tapping a new role Kudos also go out to Baxter & Woodman’s Carolyn Grieves, who was recently elected chair of the board of directors for the Illinois Section of the American Water Works Association.
ISAWWA provides resources for the management and advocacy of safe and sustainable water. Grieves will represent the section at national events and board meetings, provide input to the executive director and appoint committee chairs.
She’s been an active member of ISAWWA since 1994, serving on the Safety and Emergency Management, Water Efficiency, and Water for People committees.
She was named as the organization’s Water Professional of the Year in 2017.
Staying satisfied Rosemont-based Wintrust Financial Corp. received top rankings in the J.D. Power 2019 U.S. Retail Banking Satisfaction Study for the Midwest region.
Wintrust Community Banks had a top score of "among the best" in five of the six factors in the Powers study, including overall satisfaction, account opening, communication and advice, convenience, products and fees, and channel activities, which measures customer experience with transaction channels like in-person, websites and mobile.
The company received "better than most" in the sixth category, problem resolution. On the study’s 1,000-point scale, Wintrust scored 845.
Wintrust has received recognition from J.D. Powers in two out of the last three years.
The J.D. Power Award comes on the heels of other recognitions, including the Chicago Tribune Top Workplaces Award, three Greenwich Excellence Awards from Greenwich Associates in the Middle Market Banking in the Midwest category; and the 2019 Forbes Best Banks in America list.

Texto completo: Yet, again, we hear the plaintive wail of those who want to eliminate the electoral college and elect a president by popular vote.
Many of the people who espouse that view have little or no knowledge of the history of the subject or the intent of the founding fathers when they crafted Article II, Section 1 of the U.S. Constitution. Unfortunately, the study of the Constitution in schools and universities has not been a priority.
Every citizen should be educated in Constitutional basics. A citizenry deprived of a basic understanding of the Constitution and its history is far too vulnerable to tyranny disguised as “fairness” and “compassion.”
To that end, let’s return to 1787 when the Philadelphia Constitutional Convention met from May 25 through Sept. 17 for the purpose of drafting the US Constitution.
James Madison was extremely concerned that certain groups or cliques within the country could coalesce with some proposal that would violate the rights of individual citizens or bring harm to the whole nation. Alexis de Tocqueville would later refer to Madison’s concerns as “the tyranny of the majority.”
One should understand and appreciate the genius of the founding fathers in that they elected not to set up a pure democracy but instead opted to form a hybrid, a democratic republic wherein the citizenry elects representatives, and those representatives (the US Congress), together with the president, are responsible for the day-to-day operations of the country.
Before the First US Congress met and declared the newly-formed Constitution in effect on March 4, 1789, the founders clearly had much “discussion” concerning not only the new country’s formation, but also, the most reliable way to protect it from sinking into the kind of various oppressive governments they had witnessed. They finally settled on the system we have in place today: each state elects two representatives who will form the US Senate; the number of representatives in the House is determined by that state’s population (as fixed by the US census taken every ten years) and adjusted as the state’s population increases or decreases.
Following that same “representative” pattern, individual states are then allocated a number of electors who form the electoral college, the total of which is based on the number of the state’s US senators plus the number of that state’s US representatives. It is the Electoral College, not the popular vote, that determines who will be president.
Following every election, the critics come out with declarations that the electoral college is flawed and should be abolished; popular vote should elect the president. But the founding fathers had the sagacity to understand the fundamental nature of humans, and more specifically, the fundamental nature of power-hungry politicians.
If there is a problem with the electoral college, the problem is not with federal mandate; the problem can be traced directly to the states themselves and their “winner-take-all” allocation of electors. For example, in California in the 2016 election, Clinton won 61.5% of the vote, according to The New York Times. Under California’s laws, Clinton was entitled to all 55 electoral votes; under a proportionate share system, she would have been entitled to only 34 electoral votes (61.5% of 55).
The arrogance of those who imagine their intellect exceeds that of those men in 1787 and pontificate on the “anti-democratic electoral eollege” is stunning. Winning the electoral college requires winning the popular vote in a substantial number of states. As noted by Bradley Smith on Dec. 19, 2016 in the Washington Examiner, “The Electoral College does not assure that the president will have received the most popular votes, but it does assure that the president will have won with substantial popular support, and that his support will not be restricted to one region of the country or to a handful of coastal metropolises.” That diversity seems to be precisely what the founders had in mind, a representative democracy.
It’s time to stop bemoaning an election that took place over two years ago and thank God every day for the wisdom and courage of those founding fathers who stood firm in setting up a government that is today the envy of the world.

Are you an individualist or a collectivist?

Texto completo: An individualist is a person who favors freedom of action for single human beings as distinct from a group and its control. A collectivist is an adherent to the principle of giving the interests of a group priority over the individual.
Individualists believe they have self-directed liberties and freedoms of choice in pursuing their own interests and preferences, so long as physical harm is not done to others, some of which liberties and freedoms are guaranteed by society itself, such as in the United States Constitution. In that document, citizens are assured of the "free exercise of "religion, "of speech [and] the press, and "the right ... to peaceably ... assemble.
Also guaranteed is "the right ... to keep and bear arms and entitlement to own private property, which cannot be "taken for public use, without just compensation.
The state of West Virginia, as one illustration, cites in its state constitution that individuals have certain "rights, namely, that they are deemed "by nature, equally free and independent, and have certain inherent rights, of which, when they enter into a state of society, they cannot, by any compact, deprive their posterity, namely: the enjoyment of life and liberty, with the means of acquiring and possessing property, and of pursuing and obtaining and possessing property, and of pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety.
The state constitution also allows that residents have "rights ... to be secure in their homes, persons, papers and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures ... They are also are guaranteed that their "property shall not be taken or damaged for public use, without just compensation ...
We are also assured due process, are protected from requirements of "religious or political tests and guaranteed "religious freedom.
We are assured of the the right to assemble peaceably, to consult for the common good, and "the right to keep and bear arms for the defense of self, family, home and state, and for lawful hunting and recreational use.
And, of course, we are assured by the state's motto that Mountaineers are always free: "Montani Semper Liberi.
Collectivism, in contrast to individualism, may cause the self-directed liberties and freedoms of choice of individuals to pursue their own interests to be subordinated or sacrificed to what the advocates of collectivism deem the greater importance or merit of a group or society.
Socialism is a species of collectivism. Its advocates portray socialism's ideals or ultimate aims in emotionally appealing enticements: the achieving of social justice, greater equality and economic freedom from want.
Socialism also means particular essential methods whereby its supporters hope to attain these seductive ends, by the abolition of personal economic pursuits and of private ownership of the means of production in favor of an economy owned and controlled by government and planned and operated by whomever therein has the influence (power) to become the planners and operators.
There lies the rub: Planners run amok, behaving uncontrollably in directing the affairs of entire populations through absolutist power, such as is being witnessed in Venezuela.
Authored by Corey Robin, a professor of political science at Brooklyn College and the City University of New York Graduate Center, "The New Socialists, is an opinion piece that appeared in The New York Times Sunday Review on August 26, 2018.
The author describes today's socialists as focusing more on the "language ... of power than "of poverty.
Robin describes socialists as "hav[ing] always understood: Mass action - sometimes illegal, always confrontational - will determine socialism's final form.
And there you have it stated: the objective of modern-day socialists is to seek power, rather than the achieving of social justice, greater equality, and economic freedom from want, those being deceptive come-ons to launch "The Road To Serfdom, the title of a famous book by Friedrich Hayek, an economist and philosopher best known for his defense of classical liberalism as opposed to social liberalism.
Classical liberals consider that human rights originate from our humanity and thus are inalienable and predate the institution of the state, whereas, social liberals consider that all rights are granted by the state and believe that such rights can be altered to pursue the "common good.
The contrast in beliefs of origins of rights of humans, whether intrinsic from birth or bestowed by the state, has significant consequences in their elaboration.
The rights of humans as perceived by liberals in the classical sense are often described as "negative rights, such as the right to not have violence initiated against you, the right to not have your opinion censored by the state, the right not to have your property taken from you and those rights delineated above in the discussion of individualism. Therefore, to a classical liberal, the only legitimate role for the state is to protect those rights and not infringe upon them.
It is apparent from the foregoing recitation of human rights protected by the constitutions of the United States, and by way of illustration, of West Virginia, that they were written and now maintained consistent with classical liberalism and individualism.
Jules Morad, a classical liberal author, asserts that social liberals make two erroneous assumptions in their claims that the rights of humans are derived from the state: (1) that the "common good can be defined objectively; and (2) that the State has the foresight and efficiency to increase the common good without experiencing unintended consequences.
Too often, according to Morad, the "common good is simply the subjective interest of some interest group, such as, in my view, the leftists in the national Democratic Party who are seeking to swell the ranks of the party by bestowing upon potential or existing voters an open-door policy for immigrants, taxpayer-provided benefits to illegal immigrants, the cancellation of student debt and extending voting rights to jailed felons. Their motivation is one of greed: to advance their political ambitions, in contrast to what they would have the public believe; that their motivation is altruistic, a selfless concern for the well-being of others.

Texto completo: No End to the Abuse of Evelyn Nesbit
The magazine Gear Patrol responded to Ginia Bellafante's column last Sunday about the use of a 100-foot mural of an early 20th century pinup girl who had been sexually abused. Comments have been edited for length and clarity. We are writing to clarify the column covering the new mural on 236 Fifth Avenue. On May 10, along with the rest of The New York Times's readership, we at Gear Patrol learned about the circumstances surrounding the history of the artwork's primary subject. This came just days after learning that this mural was in the process of going up on the side of the building in which we lease office space.
Within the article, Gear Patrol was singled out as a tenant without context or opportunity to comment, leaving readers to infer that we were linked to or involved with the project. We would like to set the record straight. Though a current tenant of 236 Fifth Avenue, we had no knowledge of or involvement at all in the planning or creation of this artwork. Gear Patrol was a tenant nearly a year before the mural was painted. We in no way, shape or form condone exploitation or sexism of any kind. Such attitudes are deeply counter to our company's core values.

The Unlikely Revival of a '60s Radical
Readers sent in letters and responded at nytimes.com to Alex Traub's article on Frances Fox Piven, who has become the intellectual guru of activist progressives: Hewing to the ideological thrust of the American left, Piven's focus was exceptionally narrow when it came to issues to support. Where was she during the AIDS crisis in the 1980s and early 1990s?
Despite the fact that Act Up and the AIDS movement disrupted business as usual in many aspects of our lives, the left was nowhere to be seen. Many on the left called it a "single issue" movement as an excuse for their absence. Yet, the AIDS movement dealt with issues affecting the entire spectrum of those affected, including fighting to change the Centers for Disease Control definition of AIDS which excluded women and poor people from an AIDS diagnosis and therefore not allowing them to get disability or have research done about their illness. We fought the price of drugs, the absence of supportive housing, the exclusion of women and people of color from clinical research, etc. Where were Piven and her comrades on the left? Her politics of disruption seems to have missed a movement that everyone else saw. One can only wonder why.

The conversation has so tilted to the right that even after the H.R.C. debacle of 2016, people will still vote for corporate shill, Joe, this time. "Our last best hope." (Laugh machine erupts.) Trump is the last gasp of a dying culture. This is who we are. I stopped feeling sorry for the racist, bigoted, overfed "working class" long ago. This group wants low taxes so that when they pick the right lottery numbers, their wealth will be left undisturbed. Pathetic.

Things aren't going too well for the "common man" in today's American capitalist society, but they are going better than they did for the 30 million people who died in Mao's "Great Leap Forward."
Michael Yokell, Boulder, Colo.
Americans tend to think that capitalism works because in this country we do not suffer the atrocious effects of it. Our "happy" life under capitalism is at the expense of the rest of the world. Our happiness comes as the result of the misery billions have to endure around the world.
Pablo Cuevas, Brooklyn
This woman yells about elitism while she insulates herself within a university a long way from the streets where those she supposedly speaks for live. She should look at how the Lenin and Guevara revolutions turned out. Russia and many countries below our southern border are not bastions of paradise. All have fences to keep people in, not out. I am not a Trump fan or supporter of most of our politicos either. But this woman speaks of people and governing philosophies that have long been pushed to the garbage heap of history.

Texto completo: BALTIMORE -- The deep breaths came fast and furious in the opening moments of the 144th running of the Preakness Stakes, and for good reason: John Velazquez, a Hall of Fame jockey, was airborne one moment and in the dirt the next after his colt, Bodexpress, broke out of the starting gate like a rodeo horse rather than a thoroughbred.
This old, tradition-steeped American sport could not withstand another catastrophe or controversy. Dead horses, too many of them, have drawn a bull's-eye around its existence. A multimillion-dollar disqualification in the Kentucky Derby had first confused and then angered casual sports fans who tune in to horse racing for the five weeks in the spring that the Triple Crown commands their attention.
Horse racing is on the ropes. Big time.
When Velazquez rolled and then popped to his feet, thoroughbred lovers were given permission, for at least the next 1 minute 54.34 seconds, if not exactly to enjoy a horse race then at least to wish the horses a safe journey around Pimlico, a historic -- read: dilapidated and old -- racetrack.
They did, and the middle jewel of the Triple Crown managed to deliver a satisfying, even redemptive story. The winner, War of Will, hugged the rail for most of the mile-and-three-sixteenths distance, just as he did in the Kentucky Derby, before scooting to the middle of the track and holding off the challenge of a long shot named Everfast. War of Will's jockey, Tyler Gaffalione, rubbed his colt's neck and trained his eyes between the horse's ears.
"I was just hoping we'd hold on," he said. "I didn't want to look back."
It's easy to see why.
Two weeks ago, beneath the twin spires of Churchill Downs, War of Will lost a chance at victory after tangling with Maximum Security as Gaffalione and his colt turned for home in the 145th running of the Derby, America's most famous horse race.
Maximum Security crossed the finish line first and appeared to be the emphatic winner until three Kentucky stewards, horse racing's version of referees, ruled that the colt had jumped a puddle and impeded the progress of War of Will and two other horses.
Maximum Security was disqualified, and his jockey, Luis Saez, was suspended for 15 days. In the days since, the owners of Maximum Security, Gary and Mary West, have filed a lawsuit in federal court asking that the disqualification be reversed.
Mark Casse, the trainer of War of Will, took the Derby brouhaha in stride until the Wests and some of the betting public started pointing the fingers at Gaffalione and his colt. It did not sit well with Casse.
"I felt joy and relief that we didn't have the most disastrous incident in American horse racing history," he said.
Casse was right to be defiant.
He thinks War of Will might have won the Derby. "If it wasn't for the incident," he said, "it would have been a great race down the lane."
He did not care if this year's Preakness was a low-wattage affair. He didn't care that Maximum Security was not here and that neither was Country House, the runner-up in the Derby that was declared the official winner.
He was not going to apologize, either, that for the first time since 1951, the second leg of the Triple Crown did not include any of the first four horses that crossed the finish line in the Derby.
"We just won the Preakness," he said. "I really don't care who was in it."
If Casse and Gaffalione felt as if they helped avert disaster in Kentucky and deserved some accolades at Pimlico, no one could blame them.
Of late, any news about horse racing has been bad news.
On Friday, a 3-year-old filly named Congrats Gal died soon after pulling up and finishing last in the Miss Preakness Stakes.
Earlier that day at Santa Anita Park in Southern California, a 3-year-old gelding named Commander Coil became the 24th fatality at the racetrack since Dec. 26, a series of events that has twice led to the suspension of racing at the legendary track and threatened to close down the sport in the state forever.
The fatality was the first since March 31 at Santa Anita, which announced a ban on the use of medication and whips on racing days after the 22nd death.
"We're looking at ourselves all the time of what we can do to improve, what the sport can do to improve," said Tim Ritvo, chief operating officer of the Stronach Group, which owns Pimlico and Santa Anita.
Ritvo knows the stakes are high, especially in California, where it takes just 600,000 signatures in a state of more than 39 million to get a ballot initiative before voters to decide if the sport should be banned.
"We were really devastated and close to seeing racing go away," he said.
The record will show that War of Will earned a $ 990,000 first-place check for his owner, Gary Barber. He also rewarded his backers with $ 14.20 for a $ 2 bet.
Someone asked Casse how much weirder this Triple Crown season can get. Doesn't he just want to take his horse, and his victory, and go home?
No, he said.
"I think we've covered bizarre already, so no, I'm not worried," Casse said, adding that if War of Will is healthy, he is on to the Belmont Stakes in three weeks. "This is the life we live each and every day."

Soucheray: St. Paul worst city? No black socks? A fellow can only take so much

Texto completo: It was dispiriting enough to read that something called 24/7 Wall St., an online financial news company, decided that St. Paul is the “worst city in Minnesota.’’ USA Today picked up the story and I suppose we were duty-bound to feature this egg on our face in the Pioneer Press.
Crime was most significantly cited for ranking us with the likes of Beloit, Wis.; Keokuk, Iowa; Grand Forks, N.D.; and Box Elder, S.D. I don’t know why those cities were named worst in their states. Box Elder is in Pennington County, with a population of 7,800 people, according to the 2010 census. It has no claim to fame other than being nine minutes from Ellsworth Air Force Base.
What the hell, I might as well point out, in the event the revisionists ever get around to it, that the original Lakota name for Box Elder was Chansuska.
Another bon mot has been making the rounds after our mayor got terribly excited to name Mogadishu, Somalia, as St. Paul’s newest sister city. It goes something like: “Mogadishu? We have absolutely nothing in common with a city that has bombed-out streets, armed gangs, a fledgling socialist economy and well … nevermind.’’
But then I read the Enemy Paper on the same day we learned of our fate by an outfit nobody ever heard of. Linda Idziorek of Minneapolis wrote a terse letter to the editor of the Enemy Paper saying, “Please, Minnesotans, as the weather warms — no black socks for men in shorts. Yuck!’’
A fellow can only take so much. I can live with being ranked alongside Keokuk and Box Elder, but I take great umbrage at being ridiculed for wearing black socks with shorts.
Perhaps Ms. Idziorek is unaware that wearing black socks with shorts received the presumptuous approval of the New York Times as recently as two years ago when they decided that wearing black socks with shorts was a new fashion trend. They quoted Garret Munce, a fashion editor at GQ, who said, “Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Everywhere I go I would see teenagers and young cool-looking guys doing it. It’s something new. It’s a little bit normcore. It’s a little bit skater.’’
“Normcore” and “skater” must be fashion terms that those of us confined to the misery of being in the worst city in Minnesota could not possibly be expected to understand.
New? Many of us have been wearing black socks with shorts since the beginning of time; we just didn’t have the approval of the Times. In the same Times piece, they called people who wear black socks with shorts “practitioners,’’ which makes it sound like we are practicing something, maybe witchcraft or sorcery.
The Times not only deemed the look to be new, which it is not, but they also offered instructions for just that right look of rebellious undertone. We are supposed to wear thick dark socks with shorts, as opposed to the more shear socks one might wear with a suit. Well, we already knew that, too. But to show you how out of touch these isolated people are, they believe that the socks should be pulled up as high as they go. No, that would be overkill and makes the Times sound backwater and wholly out of touch.
The black socks should be worn a little scrunched down, thus exposing our long wintered pale legs to as much sunlight as possible. Pulling them all the way up suggests that you are on your way to play right field for the church softball team.
I can take the bone-headed rankings of 24/7 Wall St., Ms. Idziorek, but I cannot take your foul admonition of “yuck!’’ That might seem to encourage the practitioner to give our fashion statement a second thought.
I, for one, shall not.

'Do over' proms pursue perpetual adolescence

Texto completo: Prom season is upon us. We all know what that means: More American adults are doing their proms all over again.
A New York Times headline about a growing number of adults says they are taking "A Second Shot to Have the Best Night of their Lives."
And carry on like retrograde adolescents.
The modern prom, reports Slate, "may be traced to the Ivy League and the annual tradition of a 'presentation week,' during which formal dress and dancing accompanied a promenade concert."
Not content with only the well-to-do experiencing the awkwardness and misery of the prom, high schools across America embraced it, particularly after World War II. Now the prom is a rite of passage for American teens everywhere, with many blowing thousands of dollars on their big nights.
But I certainly wouldn't want to do my prom over.
I didn't know my date very well. She was in my photography class, very pretty and still available.
When she agreed to go with me, she greatly disrupted the Bethel Park High School prom-date pecking order. Whereas my date greatly raised my social status — even my friends and family were shocked she'd go with me — I lowered hers.
She was awfully sore about it.
"I heard about you," she told me at our pre-prom date. "A regular class clown! You better not show up in a limo, wear a top hat or cane or do anything else to embarrass me!"
That set the tone for an unpleasant weekend.
We got lost on the way to the prom, lost on the way to my friend Cook's cabin in Ohio and lost on the way home. My first foray into the adult world was rough, to be sure — a precursor, regrettably, of many more unpleasant adult experiences to come.
Similarly awkward prom experiences may motivate the growing number of adults trying to "get it right" during a second round.
But there are no "do overs" in life. Didn't novelist Thomas Wolfe make it clear we "can't go home again"?
Prom is supposed to be a teen's first foray into the adult world, not an adult's return to adolescence.
That's not stopping ever more "adults" from trying. Too many are not just doing their proms over, they're doing summer camps over, too — another hot trend.
To be sure, a growing desire for perpetual adolescence among today's "adults" is revealing itself all over the place — from delaying moving out of their parents' homes to delaying marriage and parenthood. That same desire leads Hollywood to keep recycling favorite movies and TV shows from their adolescence.
Look, if you had an unpleasant prom experience when you were 18, as I did, those are the breaks.
I wrote an earlier, light-heartedcolumn about my experience. It was published all over the country.
After that piece ran, I bumped into my old prom date at the grocery store. She still looked great, but, boy, she was really sore now.
It turns out her husband was so delighted by her rare rude behavior, he carries the column around in his wallet, showing it to total strangers.
The joy I get from that story almost makes my lousy prom experience worthwhile — but certainly not enough to make me want to do the prom all over again.

Texto completo: Grumpy Cat, the feline that became an internet celebrity for her permanent scowl, died Tuesday. She was 7.
Her family announced the sad news on Twitter.
"Besides being our baby and a cherished member of the family," the family wrote, "Grumpy Cat has helped millions of people smile all around the world -- even when times were tough."
Tweet
Grumpy Cat, whose real name was Tardar Sauce, died of complications from a urinary tract infection, the family said. She died "in the arms of her mommy, Tabatha."
She was born April 4, 2012, in Morristown, Ariz. Her owner, Tabitha Bundesen, told The New York Times her facial expression was the result of feline dwarfism and an underbite.
Her fame originated as a Reddit post, titled "Meet grumpy cat." The image took Meme of the Year honors at the 2013 Webby Awards.
From there, hundreds of memes were created with sarcastic comments posted over her grumpy face.
memes
The cat traveled the world making appearances, and even starred in her own Christmas movie in 2014. The San Francisco Madame Tussauds debuted a wax likeness of Grumpy Cat in 2015. She was also a best-selling author.
While her face showed distain, her personality was much more playful and loving, Bundesen told Mental Floss.
"She's super frisky, especially between 3 and 6 a.m.--when you're trying to get your deepest sleep, she's wanting to play," Bundesen said. "(Her brother) Pokey actually has more of a grumpy personality."

Texto completo: Anjelica Huston isn't apologizing after making pointed comments about her acting contemporaries and past relationships during a press tour for "John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum."
Huston has a key role in the Keanu Reeves action movie, which premiered in Hollywood on Wednesday. She's been talking about her past while promoting the movie, making pointed jabs about Robert De Niro's acting choices and a new Diane Keaton movie in the process.
"You know we all live life, and at a certain point you have to claim your life. You know, I could apologize for a lot of things. But you know, all in all I've tried not to hurt people. Once in a while, I think maybe I'm a little politically incorrect - but that's part of who I am," Huston said.
The 67-year-old actress also commented on the
size of her ex Jack Nicholson's genitalia during an interview earlier in the week. She says she's happy to keep speaking her mind - but doesn't want to be seen as a role model for younger actresses.
"Oh God, no. I don't want to be an example to
anyone who, you know, who doesn't know their own mind yet," she said. "I've always known what I liked and what I didn't like and where I wanted to be. And so far, that served me pretty well."

Big-bucks bunny: A stainless steel sculpture of a rabbit by Jeff Koons has set an auction record in New York, fetching over $91 million. The sale of Koons' 1986 "Rabbit" at Christie's was the most expensive work by a living artist ever sold at auction. The previous record was set by British artist David Hockney. His 1972 "Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures)" brought in $90.3 million at Christie's last year. The New York Times says Robert E. Mnuchin, an art dealer and the father of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, was the winning bidder for "Rabbit."
Shakira cleared: A Spanish court has cleared Colombian singers Shakira and Carlos Vives of a plagiarism claim after rejecting a lawsuit brought against them by a Cuban-born singer and producer. Livan Rafael Castellanos had accused Shakira and Vives of plagiarizing his 1997 song "Yo te quiero tanto" in their award-winning hit "La Bicicleta."

La Administración de la Seguridad Social ha enviado “cartas sin correspondencia” a más de 570,000 empleadores desde marzo de este año , reportó el diario neoyorquino.
Estas cartas notifican a los empleadores que presentaron formularios de impuestos W-2, que contienen nombres de empleados y números de Seguro Social que no coinciden.
Las razones de estas discrepancias pueden ser inofensivas, como los cambios en los nombres conyugales y los errores tipográficos en los formularios, pero también pueden indicar el uso fraudulento de documentos por parte de los inmigrantes.
De acuerdo con la Ley las cartas de no coincidencia no requieren que los empleadores tomen medidas contra un empleado, sino que les piden que corrijan el desajuste en un plazo de 60 días .
El gobierno comenzó a enviar este tipo de cartas en 1993 y dejó de hacerlo en 2012. Este marzo bajo nuevos lineamientos del gobierno Trump se reactivó la práctica.
Aunque las cartas de “no coincidencia “no amenazan con una acción legal, los empleadores se quedan en el limbo, ya que tienen que sopesar la pérdida de trabajadores con las posibilidades de ser castigados por las autoridades federales de inmigración en el futuro.
No está claro si la SSA planea compartir los desajustes de las bases de datos de ICE y USCIS para emprender la búsqueda de inmigrantes que esten trabajando sin tener el permiso laboral expedido por el gobierno.
Según una investigación de, Pew Research publicada el mes pasado en EEUU habría aproximadamente 7.8 millones de trabajadores no autorizados en la fuerza laboral de los EEUU .
Por su parte cuarenta y seis legisladores demócratas escribieron una carta a la Administración del Seguro Social a principios de este mes pidiéndole que dejara de escribir las cartas ya que según ellos solo crea miedo entre los empleadores y los empleados inmigrantes.

Texto completo: "Carmine Street Guitars," a documentary by filmmaker Ron Mann ("Comic Book Confidential"), covers one week in the life of a Greenwich Village institution: the shop of guitar-maker Rick Kelly, who carves instruments from planks of reclaimed wood from old New York buildings. Although this "warm and affectionate" ode to Kelly's craft is "sometimes a little stilted," according to the New York Times, the movie is "mostly as sweet as it is informative." Unrated. At Landmark's West End Cinema. 80 minutes.

Part spy thriller, part underdog sports documentary, "The Russian Five" will find its greatest appeal with fans of Detroit's hockey team, the Red Wings, according to the Hollywood Reporter. The resurrection of that slumping franchise in the 1990s - thanks to the team's recruitment of five talented Russian players (Sergei Fedorov, Vladimir Konstantinov, Viacheslav Fetisov, Vyacheslav Kozlov and Igor Larionov) - is the subject of Joshua Riehl's film, which lays out a story that fans may already know well, but in a fashion that the Detroit News calls "compelling" and "easily digestible." Unrated. At Regal's Majestic Stadium 20. 102 minutes.

The lies behind the defense of abortion

Texto completo: As Alabama and Georgia passed laws restricting or nearly banning abortion, the attacks poured in from every angle. As varied as these attacks were, there was a common theme: dishonesty and falsehood.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, for instance, wrote on Twitter, “Alabama lawmakers are making all abortions a felony punishable w jailtime,incl women victimized by rape+incest.”
Whether intentionally or not, this viral tweet (retweeted 16,000 times) clearly implies that the bill would punish mothers who get abortion. That’s false, and it's a fairly standard lie of abortion defenders.
Some of the attacks are newer. One increasingly popular attack is that abortion opponents are uninterested in saving lives but are merely trying to harm women and control their lives.
“The movement is anti-woman,” liberal-legal-scholar-turned-resistance-tweeter Laurence Tribe wrote about pro-lifers. Liberal New York Times columnist Jamelle Bouie wrote of pro-lifers in Alabama and Georgia that their “goal, ultimately, is the restoration of an imagined past and reestablishment of rigid hierarchies of gender and race.”
Liberal commentator David Klion told pro-lifer David French that French supports the law “because you hate women and want more of them to die.”
This is all based on the lie that only men are interested in restricting abortion.
Alabamans believe by a 58% to 37% margin that abortion should be illegal in most or all cases, according to a 2014 Pew poll. That obviously isn’t just men. The most recent nationwide poll found majority support among both men and women for bills barring abortion after the baby’s heartbeat is detectable, with no statistically significant difference between the sexes’ views.
The bill was drafted and introduced by Rep. Terri Collins, a female lawmaker. It was signed into law by Gov. Kay Ivey, a woman. It mirrors the policy preferences of most Alabama women.
In this light, consider the arguments from men like Tribe, Bouie, Klion, and dozens of others. Either they are lying by pretending all women support legalized abortion, or they are explaining to most women in Alabama: Oh dear, you merely think you care for the life of the unborn, but really, you want the state to control women’s lives and bodies.
Many of the lies in defense of abortion are decades old.
Abortion advocates have long claimed that it is needed in order to curb overpopulation. That myth has been punctured, as births have been dropping in the U.S. even as abortion has declined over the past decade.
The only reason abortion bans had to be passed this month in Alabama and Georgia was the lies that are Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey. These shoddy decisions were based on fictional rights invented through the discredited idea of substantive due process. The legal and constitutional reasoning behind them was nonexistent, even pro-choice legal scholars have admitted.
So why do abortion’s defenders base their arguments so much on lies? In part, it’s because they can get away with it. The abortion lobby has perhaps the most sophisticated public relations machine in America, and reporters take their talking points as gospel.
But there’s another possible explanation. Maybe abortion defenders base their argument on so many lies because they have to. Because a big lie is the foundation of their view.
One telling objection to the Georgia heartbeat bill was the absurd claim that the beating heart of a baby in utero is not a heartbeat. It’s merely “fetal pole activity,” progressive celebrity Alyssa Milano argued.
The lie goes deeper, though, and usually has to go unspoken. But sometimes they say it out loud.
“When a woman is pregnant,” Democrat Christine Quinn said recently, “that is not a human being inside of her.”
And there we have it.

Texto completo: FORT KENT, Maine -- The University of Maine at Fort Kent will host Paul Doiron, author of the famous "Mike Bowditch" mystery series, at 7 p.m. on Wednesday, June 5.
Doiron, a New York Times bestselling author, will be a guest of the Acadian Archives acadiennes, where he will meet fans and read from his latest book "Almost Midnight."
Since "The Poacher's Son" was published in 2010, Doiron has added nine more adventures in the series. He remarked on the evolution of the books and its protagonist: "In the first book, Mike Bowditch is such a mess -- emotionally damaged, self-sabotaging -- but over the course of the subsequent novels, he takes steps to become a better man. It's a heroic journey."
Doiron has written 10 novels starring Bowditch, a Maine game warden, as his central character. "The Poacher's Son," first in the series, garnered rave reviews from newspapers and authors alike.
Doiron is the editor-in-chief of Down East: The Magazine of Maine. A native of Maine, he attended Yale University, where he graduated with a degree in English, and holds an MFA in creative writing from Emerson College.
He is a registered Maine guide and lives on trout stream in coastal Maine with his wife, Kristen Lindquist.

Texto completo: LONDON – The United States is playing a "very dangerous game" as it attempts to "drag Iran into an unnecessary war," a senior Iranian official said Tuesday.
Hamid Baeidinejad, Iran’s ambassador to the United Kingdom, said the Trump administration made a "serious miscalculation" in deploying an aircraft carrier strike group, B-52 bombers and other military personnel and equipment to the Persian Gulf to counter alleged, unspecified Iranian threats.
Baeidinejad denied that Iran or its "proxies" were behind what Washington described as the "sabotage" of oil tankers in the Gulf belonging to Saudi Arabia, Norway and the United Arab Emirates. Tuesday, Saudi Arabia said drones attacked one of its oil pipelines and other energy infrastructure, an incident that caused global oil price benchmarks to jump.
"We are prepared for any eventuality, this I can tell you," Baeidinejad said. The United States and Iran have no formal diplomatic channel of communication.
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader, said neither country wants a war.

"This is not a military confrontation because no war is to happen," he said, according to Iran's state television and a government Twitter account. "We don’t seek a war nor do they. They know a war wouldn’t be beneficial for them. "
Baeidinejad said that from the Iranian perspective, it appears that some of President Donald Trump's closest advisers, such as national security adviser John Bolton, are "trying to convince" Trump to start a military confrontation that neither country wants and would be "devastating" for Iran, the United States and the region.
'They're not going to be happy': Trump threatens Iran over reports of 'sabotage'
Acting U. S. Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan presented a military plan at a meeting of top national security officials that would send as many as 120,000 U. S. troops to the Middle East in the event Iran strikes U. S. forces in the region or speeds up its development of nuclear weapons, according to a report published in The New York Times on Monday. The plan was partly ordered by Bolton, the report said. It does not call for a land invasion of Iran.
Trump dismissed the report but said he would send U. S. troops if needed.
Since last week, the Trump administration has insisted it has "specific and credible" intelligence indicating Iran or its regional supporters may be preparing attacks against American forces or targets in the region. "It's going to be a bad problem for Iran if something happens," Trump said Monday outside the White House.
The details of that intelligence remain murky; some seasoned Iran experts fear the Trump administration's focus on possible threats from Iran are being driven by hawks looking for a pretext for military conflict.
"We should remind ourselves that this is a TOTALLY UNNECESSARY CRISIS!" Trita Parsi, a professor at Georgetown University and an Iran specialist, wrote on Twitter.
Last year, Trump withdrew from a landmark deal reached between Iran and world powers in 2015 under which Iran promised to curtail its nuclear program in return for relief from crippling sanctions. President Barack Obama viewed the accord as one his signature foreign policy accomplishments. Trump campaigned on abolishing it.
"We're only here cuz Trump quit the deal and put Bolton in charge of Iran policy," Parsi tweeted.
On Wednesday, the U. S. put its military on high alert in neighboring Iraq amid what it said were "imminent threats to US. forces" in the nation. Iran aids a number of Shia militant groups in Iraq, in Lebanon, Houthi rebels in Yemen – who are at war with close U. S. ally Saudi Arabia – and elsewhere across the Middle East region.
The U. S. Embassy in Iraq ordered all non-essential, non-emergency government staff to leave the country right away amid escalating tensions with Iran.
But the threats have drawn skepticism from U. S. allies.
British Army Maj. Gen. Christopher Ghika, a deputy commander with the Operation Inherent Resolve coalition, said Tuesday during a video briefing from Iraq that "there’s been no increased threat from Iranian-backed forces in Iraq and Syria," a statement that was subsequently disputed by the Pentagon.
Federica Mogherini, the European Union’s foreign affairs chief, called Monday for "maximum restraint" from the U. S. after meeting with U. S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Brussels on Monday.
"This is politics, and this is about Bolton and others who have had a bee in their bonnet about Iran for as long as they have been in politics," said Robert Muggah, a specialist in international security and co-founder of the SecDev Group, an Ottawa, Canada-headquartered consultancy that analyzes open source intelligence.
Trump has pursued a policy of "maximum pressure" on Iran, slapping the Middle Eastern country with a series of increasingly onerous sanctions that crippled its economy, led to runaway inflation and caused food and medicine shortages. Last week, Tehran announced that it was abandoning two of its obligations under the nuclear deal: exporting excess uranium and "heavy water" used in nuclear reactors. The Trump administration characterized the move as an attempt by Iran to hold the United States "hostage" through "nuclear blackmail. "
But Iran's partial breach of the accord was a direct response to the United States ending exemptions from nations that purchase these stockpiles. In other words: Iran took that step to comply with U. S. sanctions.
"The (nuclear deal) is becoming meaningless because of the U. S. ," Baeidinejad said, noting that Iran gave the three Western European signatories to the deal – the United Kingdom, Germany and France – 60 days to "salvage" it.
Otherwise, he said, "there will be consequences from our side" that could include suspending modernization of Iran's Arak nuclear facility. Modernization of the "heavy water" plant ensures it will produce less plutonium, which is needed for a nuclear bomb. The United Nations' nuclear watchdog verified 14 times that Iran was complying with the terms of the agreement – even after the United States withdrew last May.
Baeidinejad wouldn't say whether Iran would consider Trump's possible offer to hold talks with Tehran. "I'd like to see them call me," Trump said last week.
Tuesday, Pompeo, who was in Moscow where he met with his Russian counterpart, reiterated that the United States doesn't seek a war with Iran.
That's not how the U. S. military moves looked to some in Iran.
"You wanted a better deal with Iran. Looks like you are going to get a war instead," Hesameddin Ashena, an adviser to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, wrote on Twitter.
Ashena also found room for a moment of levity on the social media platform.
"That’s what happens when you listen to the mustache," he added in the tweet, referring to Bolton, who has bushy white whiskers.

Texto completo: Within the span of just a few years, Glasgow native Gary John Bishop went from being an unpublished author to selling a million books. It wasn't by giving up on his dream that Bishop became a success, but through following the same personal philosophy he now shares with the world through his books.
Bishop's latest title and second book, "Stop Doing That Sh*t," will be the focal point of a Sun Sentinel Unscripted event at Mizner Park Cultural Center in Boca Raton on Friday, May 17.
During the event, Bishop will speak about his personal journey as an author, talk about some of his life philosophy and speak to the ideas presented in his latest book.
He said that oftentimes, people work in opposition to what they know are their best interests.
"I went on this mission of really putting together the logic of why a human being would know that there's something they should do and yet they don't," Bishop, who has lived in Central Florida for 25 years, said. "I really feel as if, in this book, I've put together something that will help people have many 'aha' moments in terms of being able to put the pieces together for themselves."
Bishop thinks of the book not as an easy three-step process but as a toolkit that everyday readers can take and use in their own lives. He's read a lot of the Stoic philosophers and more modern existentialists, but said all of the knowledge doesn't add up to much if it doesn't make sense to the average person.
"My problem with philosophy is that it's a little too interested in itself rather than its usefulness," Bishop said. "I'm more interested in where you're struggling in life. Let me show you the way that this might apply to you in such a way that it'll shift your perspective or open up a pathway to new action for you."
With his Scottish roots, Bishop finds that he's sometimes more blunt than readers are willing to stomach and often uses curse words. He said that promoting his first book, "Unfu*k Yourself: Get Out of Your Head and Into Your Life," proved to be tricky. As a self-published author, it was challenging for Bishop to first get his book out in the public sphere with a curse word in the title.
"Shakespeare loved to curse. Not that I'm comparing myself to Shakespeare, but I think there's a lot of poo pooing of cursing that is a little unnecessary," Bishop said. "I think curse words are like the hot sauce of language. When used in the right way, they certainly bring life to an otherwise unappetizing meal."
After the initial challenges in getting his work out there, Bishop became a New York Times bestseller with "Unfu*k Yourself" and has taken pride in making a difference in people's lives, especially while touring to promote his new book.
"I don't like making money. Money's awesome," Bishop said. "But I'm really about supporting and helping people. This is about using our lives for a purpose that's greater than ourselves. This is about people."

What's next for Philly's 76ers?

Texto completo: TORONTO — The Process is dead. Long live the process.
Asked where The Process is at this stage of his career, Philadelphia 76ers All-Star center Joel Embiid — dejected from losing to Toronto, 92-90 in Game 7 on Sunday — said, "I don't give a damn about The Process."
Quite the admission from Embiid, who came to embody the Sixers' divisive rebuild set forth by former general manager Sam Hinkie. Regardless of whether Embiid uttered his comment in the disappointment of defeat or if that's how he really feels, the Sixers have reached a critical moment in this era.
Where do they go from here? Who is the coach and who is on the team at the start of the 2019-20 season?
General manager Elton Brand has proven himself in his first season in the job following the Bryan Colangelo Twitter disgrace that resulted in Colangelo losing his job. Brand acquired Jimmy Butler and Tobias Harris in trades during the season, but the work gets more difficult, starting with what happens to Coach Brett Brown.
The New York Times reported that it will be difficult for Brown to save his job if the Sixers didn't advance to the conference finals. Brand told reporters in April the goal was to get deeper in the playoffs than last season, which was a second-round exit, the same as this season.
Does Brown take the fall for that? Basing his future on an incredible buzzer-beater by Kawhi Leonard in a Game 7 seems short-sighted. If the Sixers don't think he is the coach to get them to the next level, that's their prerogative. But it shouldn't be based on the outcome of a single Game 7 result on the road.
If Philadelphia makes a coaching change, Brand better have his replacement ready to go — like Toronto president Masai Ujiri replaced Dwane Casey with Nick Nurse following last season's playoff exit. If not, this has the potential to backfire.
The Sixers need to resolve that, then focus on their roster. Jimmy Butler likely will become a free agent and Tobias Harris will be a free agent. Do those two want to come back, and at what price and length of contract? Giving up what they did in trades to get those two indicates they are willing spend to keep both. A third starter, J.J. Redick, is also a free agent along with Mike Scott, Amir Johnson, Greg Monroe and Boban Marjanovic. Because Philadelphia has several young players on team friendly contracts, the Sixers have money to spend in free agency.
In the draft, the Sixers have one first-round pick and three second-round picks. While the draft is important, it's far less so compared to the coaching situation and free agency.
Joel Embiid, right, and the Philadelphia 76ers face a critical offseason after getting knocked out of the NBA Playoffs.

Giuliani calls Comey a 'jackass' for his handling of unverified Steele dossier

Texto completo: Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani slammed former FBI Director James Comey over his handling of the unverified dossier, which was used in FISA applications targeting former Trump campaign associate Carter Page, compiled by British ex-spy Christopher Steele.
“How come it was unverified for five months when he was FBI director? Hey jackass, you had five months," Giuliani said in a lengthy radio interview with Howie Carr on Tuesday.
The dossier was used in Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act filings beginning in October 2016 through June 2017, and Comey signed off on three of the four submissions to the Foreign Surveillance Court before he was fired in May 2017. Comey personally briefed Trump on some of the most salacious allegations in January 2017.
“I would love to cross-examine him,” Giuliani said of Comey.

Giuliani pointed to newly released notes from an Oct. 11, 2016, meeting between Steele and former Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kathleen Kavalec, which he said cast doubt on the reliability of Steele’s dossier and called into question the information provided to the court in the FISA application that was submitted later that month. The notes, which Kavalec is believed to have emailed to the FBI in mid-October, indicate that Steele knew he had been hired by the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee and had been told they wanted his findings made public prior to the 2016 election.

The notes also show that Kavalec believed at least some of Steele’s allegations to be false. She said Steele alleged that, as part of Russia’s 2016 election interference efforts, there was a “significant Russian network in the U.S. run by the Russian Embassy that draws on emigres to do hacking and recruiting” and “payments to those recruited are made out of the Russian Consulate in Miami.” But, as Kavalec pointed out, “it is important to note that there is no Russian Consulate in Miami.”
“I guarantee you one of those memos [from Kavalec] went to Jim Comey. The FBI was notified — she would not have notified the FBI that she found the Steele affidavit to be exceedingly questionable,” Giuliani said.
Giuliani said Kavalec’s notes were damning and Comey and the FBI had not done their due diligence in verifying the dossier’s allegations before using it. “I mean, an Assistant Secretary of State, who is not a law enforcement professional, read the Steele affidavit at the same time as the director of our FBI. And she came to the conclusion that it was an unverified piece of junk and put out a memo to that effect," he said.
Giuliani said the dossier was “written like it’s a National Enquirer story” and claimed that anyone who saw it should have immediately been skeptical. He pointed to his past experiences as an investigator and prosecutor, saying that “when I got something questionable like that, you verify what you can verify.”
Giuliani said that figuring out whether the Russians were making payments out of a Miami consulate would have been easy to do. “You call up the State Department and they tell you we don’t have a Russian consulate in Miami," he said. Giuliani also said that the FBI could have verified whether or not former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen had actually gone to Prague, noting that if they had simply “called the passport office” then “you would find out he didn’t and that he’s never been to Prague.”
Allegations in the Steele dossier included that Cohen traveled to Prague to meet with Kremlin-connected figures and foreign hackers, but special counsel Robert Mueller’s report concluded that Cohen had not been to Prague.
At a CNN town hall last Thursday, Comey defended the way that he and the FBI had handled Steele’s information. He asserted “the most important part” of the dossier was related to “Russians coming for the American election,” which he asserted was “consistent with our other intelligence” and “true.”
And during an event at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C., on Friday, former FBI General Counsel James Baker also defended the FBI’s use of the Steele dossier. He said the FBI was careful in the way it used Steele’s reporting. “We have an obligation to take that information seriously and to be highly skeptical … You go to work … You try to validate it … We don’t just swallow it hook, line, and sinker ... We spent a lot of time trying to vet that information line by line," Baker said.
Steele has come under increased scrutiny in recent weeks. According to a New York Times report in April, the FBI reached out to some of Steele’s foreign sources in an attempt to determine their credibility, and as early as January 2017 agents had concluded that some of the dossier’s contents may have been based on “rumors and hearsay” which were “passed from source to source.” The agents also believed some of Steele’s information may have been based on “Russian disinformation.” The Wall Street Journal reported that DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz “is homing in on” and “has been asking witnesses about” the FBI’s “treatment of information” provided by Steele.
There are at least three federal investigations into alleged FISA abuse and other matters related to the way that the FBI and DOJ handled the Trump-Russia investigation. Horowitz is expected to finish his investigation in either May or June, U.S. Attorney John Huber was tasked with this responsibility by then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions back in 2018, and U.S. Attorney John Durham has reportedly been selected by Attorney General William Barr to look into the origins of the Russia inquiry.

Biden agrees with woman who says Trump is 'an illegitimate president'

Texto completo: Former Vice President Joe Biden quipped that a woman who claimed she had a “very severe case of what's called Trump Derangement Syndrome” should become his running mate.
The exchange occurred at a campaign event in Nashua, N.H., Tuesday after the woman told Biden that Trump is an “illegitimate president” because he won the 2016 election by nearly 80,000 votes in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan and argued he was aided by the Kremlin.
“He’s an illegitimate president in my mind,” she said. “That’s it. I think all the talk about impeachment and what the Democrats should do, that’s fine, it’s theoretical at this point. Let them investigate, let them subpoena, let them go to the Supreme Court, he’s illegitimate.”
The woman said that she was worried that Russian President Vladimir Putin would attempt to meddle in the 2020 election, resulting in another term with Trump in the White House. She characterized such a prospect as “terrifying.”
“Would you be my vice presidential candidate?” Biden joked before saying, “Folks, look, I absolutely agree.”

Biden vowed to not trash other Democratic candidates, saying that regardless of what candidate secures the Democratic nomination, he or she must be able to defeat Trump. He then took a swipe at Attorney General William Barr’s decision to have a federal prosecutor investigate the origins of the Russia investigation.
“You’re absolutely right, and now that they have an investigation of the investigators who are investigating whether or not Vladimir Putin and the Russians engaged in trying to affect our elections, give me a break. Gosh almighty," he said.
Special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation determined that no Americans illegally colluded with the Kremlin during the 2016 election. However, Mueller’s report did not make a determination on whether Trump obstructed justice. Barr has since said there’s insufficient evidence of an obstruction crime, but Democrats in Congress want to investigate further.
Meanwhile, the New York Times reported Monday that Barr instructed a federal prosecutor to investigate the origins of the Trump-Russia probe amid concerns from Republicans that the FBI inappropriately conducted surveillance on members of the Trump campaign.

Texto completo: El Senado de Alabama aprobó el martes una medida que prohibiría casi todos los abortos en el estado, estableciendo un desafío directo a Roe v. Wade, el caso que reconoció el derecho constitucional de una mujer de interrumpir un embarazo, reporta The New York Times.
La legislación prohíbe los abortos en todas las etapas del embarazo y criminaliza el procedimiento para los médicos , que podrían ser acusados de delitos graves y enfrentar hasta 99 años de prisión. Incluye una excepción para los casos en que la vida de la madre corre un grave riesgo , pero no para los casos de violación o incesto, un tema de feroz debate entre los legisladores en los últimos días
Ahora se traslada al escritorio del gobernador Kay Ivey , un republicano. Aunque el gobernador no se ha comprometido públicamente a firmar la legislación, muchos legisladores republicanos esperan su apoyo.
Hasta ahora, no había posibilidad de revertir a Roe “, dijo a NYT Eric Johnston , quien fundó la Coalición Pro-Vida de Alabama y se desempeña como su presidente, y ha pasado más de 30 años tratando de prohibir el aborto.
Johnston, quien redactó el proyecto de ley de Alabama y se considera un purista en el tema del aborto, dijo que no apoyaba la serie de leyes restrictivas que otros estados han promulgado en los últimos meses, incluidas las llamadas cuentas de latidos fetales. Estos proyectos de ley esencialmente prohíben los abortos a partir de las seis semanas posteriores a la concepción, un momento en el que muchas mujeres aún no saben que están embarazadas.
Los demócratas y los defensores de los derechos de aborto dicen que la medida de Alabama conduciría el procedimiento a la clandestinidad, poniendo en peligro las vidas de mujeres y niñas y afectando de manera desproporcionada a los residentes pobres y de minorías de Alabama.

Texto completo: STEVENS POINT – What does it take to print a best-selling book on a tight deadline?
If you ask employees of Worzalla Publishing Co. in Stevens Point, they can tell you — 1,934,100 pounds of paper; 456,314 pounds of ink; and 7,166 employee hours. The result: author Jeff Kinney's latest book, "Diary of an Awesome Friendly Kid: Rowley Jefferson's Journal," which was released April 9.
Kinney is best known for his "Diary of a Wimpy Kid" series, which follows main character Greg Heffley on his adventures as a middle-schooler. The new series focuses on Greg's best friend, Rowley Jefferson.
It has spent four weeks on the New York Times bestseller list for Children's Middle Grade Hardcover books and is currently at No. 1.
Worzalla is very familiar with Kinney and his books. The company has published every domestic copy of the "Diary of a Wimpy Kid" series since the first batch of 25,000 copies in 2007. Last year, Kinney made a special stop at the Stevens Point plant to celebrate the 200 millionth copy of the "Diary of a Wimpy Kid" series.
So, when Kinney branched out to launch his new series, his production team turned to Worzalla.
The task was a daunting one, employees said. They print large orders all the time, but they only had four weeks to finish a project that normally would take six weeks.
So, just how big was the order?
If you laid out all of the books' 41,654,551 pages end to end, you would cover the distance from Stevens Point all the way to Manila, Philippines.
Kathy Ladwig and April Kemnitz were part of the customer service team that led the project at Worzalla. Last October, Amulet Books — part of ABRAMS, the series' publishing company — reached out to Worzalla, exploring the idea of working together on the new series, Ladwig said. The Worzalla team was given a fake project name, too, as details including the title were still top secret.
By January, the team learned the order would be twice as big as originally planned. In February, they learned they would print fewer paperback copies and more hardcover books. The publishing company even pushed back installation of new equipment, so they could focus on the Kinney project.
While the size of the project was not unusual, the quick turnaround time was, said Richard Letchinger, Worzalla's vice president of sales and marketing.
Worzalla printed almost constantly for a solid four weeks, met their goal, and even finished two days before their final deadline, Kemnitz said. And then they celebrated.
"Every time we're done with a Wimpy Kid job, we have a big pizza party for the whole plant," Kemnitz said.
This was Worzalla's fastest turnaround time for such a large volume with critical deadlines, said Jim Fetherson, Worzalla's president and CEO.
"Worzalla is so proud of all the men and women who worked long hours and gave up their weekends to finish this huge project," Fetherson said. "We are thrilled that our team exceeded expectations."

Rosenstein faults Comey, defends Mueller probe

Texto completo: Former No. 2 official
at Justice says he stood for what was right
Former deputy attorney general Rod J. Rosenstein on Monday defended his role in the firing of James B. Comey from the FBI and criticized the bureau's former director as a "partisan pundit" - offering one of his most detailed public accounts of the hectic events that led to the appointment of Robert S. Mueller III as special counsel.
Speaking to the Greater Baltimore Committee just days after stepping down as the Justice Department's No. 2 official, Rosenstein fired back at criticism that he acted inappropriately for President Trump and sought to present his legacy as one of an official who was thrust into a political maelstrom and did what he thought was right.
At Trump's request, Rosenstein wrote a memo supporting Comey's dismissal in May 2017 and came under intense public criticism for doing so. Critics viewed the move as a way of obstructing the inquiry into Trump's campaign.
In prepared remarks, Rosenstein seemed to minimize the effect Comey's firing could have had on the inquiry.
"I would never have allowed anyone to interfere with the investigation," he asserted, though he conceded later that he "recognized that the unusual circumstances of the firing and the ensuing developments would give reasonable people cause to speculate about the credibility of the investigation."
After Comey's firing, the FBI began investigating whether Trump had sought to obstruct justice, and Rosenstein ultimately appointed Mueller to oversee that. Mueller asserted in his final report that Trump told Rosenstein to mention in his memo that Comey had told the president three times he was not personally under investigation in the Russia case. Rosenstein did not do so.
In his prepared remarks, Rosenstein said that Trump "did not tell me what reasons to put in my memo," but noted what the special counsel report had said. He said he did not include what Trump wanted because it was not relevant, and he did not have personal knowledge of what Comey had told Trump.
Rosenstein said he "did not dislike" Comey but that Comey took steps that were "not within the range of reasonable decisions" during the investigation of Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server. Rosenstein suggested that if he - rather than Trump - had been in charge, "the removal would have been handled very differently, with far more respect and far less drama."
"If I had been asked to make a recommendation before the removal decision was made, I would have included a more balanced analysis of the pros and cons," he said. "But my brief memo to the attorney general is correct, and it was reasonable under the circumstances."
Rosenstein made clear, too, that he has been distressed by Comey's recent commentary about him. He referred to a New York Times op-ed in which Comey suggested that Rosenstein and Attorney General William P. Barr had allowed their souls to be consumed by Trump.
"But now the former director is a partisan pundit, selling books and earning speaking fees while speculating about the strength of my character and the fate of my immortal soul," Rosenstein said. "That is disappointing. Speculating about souls is not a job for police and prosecutors."
Rosenstein, who said he generally disfavors special counsels, also defended his appointment of Mueller. He said there was "overwhelming evidence" of Russian hacking and efforts on social media to influence the 2016 presidential election, and that the investigation was "justified."
"I determined that I needed a special counsel to help resolve the election interference investigation in a way that would best protect America from foreign adversaries and preserve public confidence in the long run," he said. "I knew that some people would not be happy about it."
Rosenstein said he felt he had "made the right decision."
"My soul and character are pretty much the same today as they were two years ago," he said. "I took a few hits and made some enemies during my time in the arena, but I held my ground and made a lot of friends."

Texto completo: Discovery buys Golf Digest and strengthens PGA Tour deal
FARMINGDALE, N.Y. -- Discovery Inc. purchased Golf Digest on Monday in a deal that will provide exclusive content from Tiger Woods and strengthen its relationship with the PGA Tour as it sets out to build golf's largest digital network.
Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
The announcement comes nearly one year after Discovery signed a $2 billion deal with the PGA Tour to deliver golf content directly to 220 markets outside the United States over the next 12 years. It then signed Woods to a partnership and formed GolfTV, for which Woods provides content not found anywhere else.
Woods made his only public comments since his winner's news conference at the Masters in an interview with GolfTV. While the content is distributed to overseas markets, Discovery has been liberal in sharing portions of that interview and other content from golf's biggest star on social media.
GolfTV recently signed British Open champion Francesco Molinari of Italy to a similar deal.
The purchase from CondeNast, which bought Golf Digest from The New York Times Co. in 2001, allows Discovery to reach golf fans with everything from instructional videos to equipment profiles, golf course rankings and travel destinations.Chiefs backup quarterback EJ Manuel retires from NFL
KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Chiefs quarterback EJ Manuel, who was signed this offseason to compete for a backup job, has decided to retire after four seasons with Buffalo and one season with Oakland.
Manuel was the 16th overall pick of the Bills in the 2013 draft, going 6-11 while struggling to live up to expectations. He'd been Derek Carr's backup the past two seasons with the Raiders.
His retirement was part of a series of roster moves the Chiefs made Monday.
The Chiefs signed wide receiver Rashard Davis, running back Marcus Marshall, tight end Jody Fortson and defensive backs Herb Miller and Andrew Soroh. They also claimed offensive tackle Zach Golditch off waivers from Arizona while waiving wide receivers Andre Lindsey and Sammie Coates, defensive backs Leon McQuay and Dakari Moore and fullback JD Moore.
Tight end Tim Ward was placed on the non-football injury list while wide receiver Jamire Jordan, an undrafted free agent from Fresno State, was placed on injured reserve.Hicks back, but Yankees put Andujar and Loaisiga on IL
NEW YORK -- No sooner do the injury-ravaged Yankees finally get a player back than two more go down.
On the same day New York activated center fielder Aaron Hicks for the first time this season, third baseman Miguel Andujar and right-hander Jonathan Loaisiga were placed on the 10-day injured list.
The moves Monday left the Yankees with 13 players on the injured list. They've put 17 on the IL for 18 stints this year -- Andujar now twice because of a small labrum tear in his right shoulder.
Runner-up for 2018 AL Rookie of the Year, Andujar was initially sidelined from April 1 to May 3. He is 3 for 34 since returning and is batting .128 overall (6 for 47) without an extra-base hit.
Loaisiga went on the IL, retroactive to Friday, with a strained pitching shoulder. Luis Cessa was tabbed to start in his place, weather permitting, on Monday night against Baltimore.White Sox say Rodon, Jones out for season
CHICAGO -- Carlos Rodon and Nate Jones will miss the rest of the season with arm injuries, leaving the rebuilding Chicago White Sox without two key pitchers.
Rodon is scheduled for elbow-ligament replacement surgery Wednesday in Los Angeles. The left-hander was selected by Chicago with the No. 3 pick in the 2014 amateur draft, but his career has been hampered by injuries.
Jones had surgery Monday to repair a flexor mass tear in his right forearm. The 33-year-old has struggled with injuries since he had a 2.29 ERA in 71 appearances in 2016.
While Rodon and Jones have been ruled out for the year, top prospect Eloy Jimenez could return to the White Sox before they go out on a seven-game trip next week. General manager Rick Hahn says Jimenez will begin a rehab assignment with Triple-A Charlotte on Tuesday.
The 22-year-old Jimenez sprained his right ankle when he crashed into the wall in left trying to make a play during a 12-11 victory over Detroit on April 26.

South African women defend animals against poachers

Texto completo: This year marks the sixth anniversary of the Black Mamba Anti-Poaching Unit, South Africa's predominantly female team of anti-poachers. Established in 2013, the 36 women patrol the Balule Nature Reserve, a 100,000-acre private wildlife reserve in northern South Africa, on the western boundary of Kruger National Park.
The women, some as young as 18, are there to protect the country's lions, pangolin, elephants and rhinos, whose horns are thought to have medicinal properties and can garner hundreds of thousands of dollars on the black market.
The Mambas track about 78 miles of the park's border for eight hours a day, looking for snares or traps, inspecting the border fence and searching cars for weapons or contraband. But while they may look like soldiers in their camouflage uniforms, the Mambas are unarmed.
In addition to the pride of working in a traditionally male environment, being a Mamba gives the women the opportunity to show their children - especially their female children - that women can hold meaningful work outside of the home. Their beginning salary is about 3,500 South African rand, or about $224 dollars, monthly, with the chance to earn more the higher they go.
Pandoro Safari Game Lodge and Roar Africa both offer tours to visit with the Mambas.
"These women are part of the changing face of the male-dominated safari industry, and without them, our wild spaces and wildlife would perish," said Deborah Calmeyer, Roar Africa's founder and chief executive.
Collet Ngobeni has been a Black Mamba since 2013. Now 34, Ngobeni lives in Bushbuckridge, a small community nearly two hours away from the reserve, with her husband and two young children.
This interview was edited and condensed for clarity.
Q: As a young girl, did you ever imagine you would one day be patrolling a park, saving animals from poachers?
A: When I grew up, I only knew that wild animals are for white people! They didn't belong to Black people. But that's not true. Wild animals belong to all of us because it's nature.
Q: What kind of work did you think you'd be doing?
A: I only knew that if you go to university, you need to be a teacher or doctor. We changed that mindset. They can be a photographer. They can be anything that they like as long as they love it.
We go to the school here, called Bush Babies, to educate these kids on nature. When they see us in schools, because of our uniforms, they call us soldiers and they get excited to see us. They pay attention to us. We tell them that they must tell their parents that it's not good to kill wild animals. We have people who have a lot of money - they check for the boys that are poor, then recruit them to be poachers.
Q: What did you do before becoming a Mamba?
A: I was at home. I was not working. Now and then I heard news on the radio speaking about poachers and rhinos. I was not aware of anti-poaching; I wanted to be a guide or a tracker. So when I heard they want women to do the anti-poaching, I was very happy to be the one who applied. I wanted to give a change to my community.
Q: How did your family react to the news that you would be out in the bush without any weapons?
A: My husband was very positive about this. He said, "You are going to make a change in our communities and in our kids and in our future generations."
My mother was scared. She said, "These people are going to kill you!" I explained that it's not only for me but for future generations. They need to see wildlife in real life, not in postcards.
She is not scared anymore because she realized how great a job we are doing. My life is not in danger. These poachers are not in the reserve for the human beings, they are there for the animals. If they see us, they don't come after us. They just run away.
I know how to interact in the bush. So, I don't feel in danger when I'm in the bush. I don't go alone. We work in a group.
Q: What was your scariest moment?
A: In 2014, I was with two of my colleagues patrolling the fence. There was a car parked next to the fence. They were outside the reserve and we were inside. If we see cars, we greet them with smiles, but these people did not want to speak to us. They were poachers. I was scared. But we were not going to leave them there. We needed to show them that we are here with pride and we know what we are doing. They saw us try to take their number plate. We managed to scare them. They drove away.
Q: But that raises a good question. How do you stay safe?
A: We have smartphones with an app that let's everyone know where we are. When we go out to patrol, we tell the others where we're going. If we see rhinos, we take pictures and send to the office so they know where to send people to patrol at night.
Q: What was your training like?
A: The first one was very hard: They were training us how to survive in the bush without bathing - for seven weeks! That was very hard because we would wake up early in the morning, and run or walk along the fences. We made our houses with branches. They showed us how to interact when we see the Big Five (elephant, lion, leopard, rhinoceros and Cape buffalo). The second training was two weeks.
I stay in the reserve now for 21 days and go home for 10 days. People donated houses to us in the bush. We call them compounds. We share with two or three people.
Q: What do people say when they run into a group of women patrolling the park?
A: At first they thought it was a man's job what we are doing. They were not giving us the respect they were supposed to give us. Now they see that this woman can do the job they are doing.
When they see us, they love us! Especially when we are at the gate doing road checks. Because in their lodges they tell them what we do in the reserve. We go there to educate those people that they don't have to poach animals or take firewood with them because it's illegal.

Texto completo: Good books spring from provocative questions, such as those posed by El Cerrito-based writer James Vlahos in his intriguing new book, "Talk to Me" (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, $28, 336 pages).
In "Talk," Vlahos, a regular contributor to the New York Times and Wired, addresses the economic, cultural and psychological impact of voice-driven artificial intelligence or conversational AI. Think of Siri, Alexa and talking appliances, and Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon.
As we interact with technology less by touch and more by talk, how will issues of privacy be determined? Who stands to profit the most? Can machine learning systems that enable computers to amass and utilize enormous amounts of data also teach compassion? Or will interactions with voice computing devices be more like a series of bad dates that ultimately end with breakups? If conversational AI achieves the level of interaction we enjoy in real life with actual people, will it increase our addiction to all things digital?
As fascinating as these queries are, the origin of "Talk" was a far simpler question. When his father was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer in 2016, Vlahos wondered what would it be like to continue to converse with him after he died. With only basic programming know-how, but a longtime interest in video games and technology, Vlahos developed a chatbot. He recorded his father speaking 91,970 words on topics including family history, jokes and his fanatical devotion to Gilbert and Sullivan. With approval from his mother and brother, he created Dadbot, an all-text chatbot with which he can converse forever with his father. He writes in the book, "If even a hint of digital afterlife is possible, then the person I want to make immortal is my father."
A 2017 cover story Vlahos wrote for Wired about his experience is the bedrock of the book, but root connections date back to childhood.
"I was born and raised in Kensington and majored in journalism at the University of Oregon," he said. "I wouldn't call ours an intellectual household, but it was literate. There were books all around; I remember we'd fight over who got which sections of the Sunday paper."
A college course on "Information Gathering" required selecting a topic and preparing an extensive, annotated bibliography.
"I picked the commercialization of children's television," he said. "It was about ads embedded in programs, like GI Joe in a cartoon to sell products to kids. I read hundreds of journals and books. For each source, you had to write a one-and-a-half page bibliography."
Deep research became Vlahos' top writing habit.
The interaction between people and electronics continues to leave him fascinated and wary.
"Computers, internet, phones; we keep getting new things foisted upon us. I'm not a technology scold, but I do wonder, what are the perils? One of the first things was for me to stop seeing voice-activated AI as magic, as automated computers doing amazing things," he said. "Particularly with dialogue systems, there's a human element as well. There are persona designers for Siri and Alexa. There are people with liberal arts degrees working on these things."
Learning about tech companies' approach to complex issues involving speech recognition, hearing, phonemes, conversational variability and societal "pain points" that smartphone virtual assistants were designed to improve was "an enormous pain in the (rear)," Vlahos said.
He began sleuthing at conferences, where scientists and other experts loved to talk. After he was effectively embedded covering Alexa for Wired, Amazon became his best source for state-of-the-art information.
Vlahos suggests the ghosts remaining in AI are human elements that embody everything machines do not offer naturally: warmth, charm, humor.
"It's much easier to teach a computer to solve a problem efficiently than to teach it where or when to say something emotionally appropriate," he said.
But users' desire to untether from a keyboard or handheld device drives the charge for voice AI to improve, especially in areas of language variability and conversational intimacy. He predicts conversational AI will eventually become virtually essential with users, and the company with the largest and earliest "land grab" will profit significantly.
In the meantime, three years working to produce "Talk to Me" won't alter his general approach to language and writing. But it has opened his eyes to new venues such as voice apps he might "play around in." Vlahos is working on his mother's oral history using Alexa, as well as developing a true-crime podcast and pondering his next book.

Texto completo: CORRECTION PUBLISHED 5/19/2019: This book review misspelled the last name of Frederick Law Olmsted. Special to the Star Tribune
These days the name Frederick Law Olmstead means Central Park in Manhattan, the U.S. Capitol grounds or the Biltmore estate in Asheville, N.C. Olmstead was the country's major designer of public spaces in the 19th century, a career he stumbled on after hunting his life's purpose from sailor to artisanal farmer to journalist.
He made some progress as a writer for the fledgling New York Times in 1853-54, sending back dispatches from the South as a witness to the slave culture on the eve of the Civil War. Olmstead collected his newspaper articles into four books that found few readers, sending him in search of another career.
Olmstead's articles and books, unnoticed for years, have inspired another traveling reporter to cover the same ground more than 160 years later. Veteran reporter Tony Horwitz, 60, follows his successful formula in his ninth book, hitting the road in Olmstead's tracks to experience the same territory.
In "Spying on the South," he wanders by coal barge, luxury Mississippi steamboat and rental car from West Virginia to the Deep South, winding up on the Texas-Mexico border. Like Olmstead, he finds unhappiness, anger, bad food, complacency and dissolution (see the chapter on "Mudfest") below the Mason-Dixon Line.
His predecessor grappled with a greater issue -- slavery. Olmstead's dispatches describe the violence and blindness of the Southern aristocracy about its "peculiar institution" as it condemned the "coarseness" of the Northern states.
Horwitz is an engaging writer and apparently an engaging guy as he banters and quizzes a range of people from the smugly secure to the desperately homeless. Few turn him away, and most are eager to ramble on about their lives and, of course politics.
Since the election of President Donald Trump, writers have fanned out across the hinterlands in search of the causes behind his election, so Horwitz adds little to the attitudes of the Red States. He does find enlightening material along the Mexican border, where people of both countries mix freely. The author describes a miserable picture of ruined lives in Mexican towns caused by the drug wars, a stark contrast to conditions in Texas.
Trump's 2016 victory was "a political jolt unlike any in the forty years since I'd cast my first vote," he admits. Hours of interviews and days spent in the South left him (and many others) unprepared for result.
"Spying on the South" was written before a change in the political weather last year, so it seems outdated. Yet, Horwitz accomplished his goal of demonstrating how effectively Olmstead captured the South before the cataclysm.
Olmstead could see it coming. Horwitz did not anticipate the shake-up of Trump's election. Quoting Lincoln, the author "listened in vain for a swelling 'chorus of the Union' touched by the 'better angels of our nature.' "
His blend of Olmstead's 1854 views and his modern experiences produce a readable travelogue without a strong political bent.

Texto completo: The scandal of the rich and famous cheating their children’s way into college caused a far greater stir than was justified by the number of people involved. Why?
Maybe because the story is a vivid example of the widening gap between “elites” and the rest of us. Or perhaps the scandal resonates because our culture evermore stresses college. And as college looms larger and larger in the lives of young folks, the rising cost of college puts a degree farther and farther from more and more families.
The Countryman
Add a couple of other factors. We are increasingly divided geographically. A great many elites call themselves “bi-coastal.” They live on the right coast (Atlantic) or left coast (Pacific) and when they travel from one to the other, they don’t drive. They say anywhere that isn’t an hour’s drive from an ocean is “flyover country.”
Turn on the TV, especially after the 11 o’clock news, and see talk-show hosts in New York or Los Angeles get great guffaws by mocking people above whom they often fly. I first noticed this attitude with David Letterman, who hosted The Late Show on CBS for 22 years. Letterman grew up in Indianapolis but he picked up bi-coastal ways easily.
We may sometimes confuse two types of “elite.” The first is people born to wealth and status. Bushes, Rockefellers, Carnegies. The second is people who made a bundle and want to buy status. Perot, Bezos, Zuckerberg.
The college-admission scandal led to 50 arrests — more may be coming — of people such as actors Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin and William Rick Singer, the scam’s mastermind. He presented some kids of the rich and famous as athletes in minor sports, for others he arranged for a “body double” with a brain to take entrance exams for them.
Parents buying their kids’ way into college seem to be among the new rich who made a bundle and want to buy social status. Huffman, a banker’s daughter, has made a killing as an actor. She and other elites paid Singer to get their kids into elite schools such as Yale, Stanford, UCLA, Wake Forest, Georgetown, the University of Texas and USC.
When I was coming up, many folks lived a middle-class life or moved into the middle class without college. No one needed a degree to own a grocery or work in a bank. My brother-in-law, a successful banker in Oklahoma, has no degree. His college was six years in the Air Force.
The culture’s attitude toward college is changing. You don’t have to read many stories about education or listen to many radio stories about education to learn that all Americans are expected to continue school after high school. With elite college costs topping $70,000 per year, that sounds scary. A working stiff in Indiana whose daughter shows academic promise might look at that and say, “Sheesh. Not gonna happen.”
Many elite schools, including Bates, Bowdoin and Colby, work hard to draw students of various racial, regional and economic backgrounds. Bowdoin and Colby promise that their students can graduate without loan debt. Still, their student bodies remain heavily elite. An aside, when my fiancee and I ate in the Bates dining hall last winter, we sat at a table with three female students. We knew nothing of their backgrounds, but they didn’t look like they came from Scarsdale. And, man, were they smart. Great conversation.
So when we hear again and again that college holds the key — I emphasize “the” — to success, anyone whose pedigree hasn’t been stamped by dear old alma mater might come to resent those with stamped pedigrees. If the only road to middle class life is college and you didn’t graduate college, wouldn’t you feel a bit left out?
Disrespected?
Even so, not everyone feels a tug of ivy. I remember reading in the paper a quote from Mexico (the one in Oxford County) at graduation time. The choices, a grad said, were “the mill or move.” You went to work across the river at the paper mill or you left town.
The college scandal may be just magnifying the elites’ historic ability to get their kids into choice schools. The Atlantic wrote in March that at Harvard’s first commencement, nearly 400 years ago, the nine young men received their degrees “not according to age or scholarship” . . . “but according to the rank their families held in society.”
Maybe starting with the sons of those nine, the “legacy” student arrived. If Daddy went to Harvard, l’il Johnny is a “legacy.” The Atlantic reported that legacy applicants, mostly white and wealthy, are admitted to Harvard at five times the rate of non-legacies.
Several candidates for president have put forth plans to pay for ever larger shares of college costs. Some even say college should be free at all state universities. The plans sound terrific. But an analysis by David Leonhardt in The New York Times found that the tuition-paying plans would mostly help families that can afford much or all of their college costs. Assistance for college should be directed at kids in community colleges, he concluded. So, let’s not use tax money to help the elites. Again.
The elites will always be with us. And F. Scott Fitzgerald pretty well nailed it when he wrote, “Let me tell you about the very rich. They are different from you and me. They possess and enjoy early, and it does something to them, makes them soft where we are hard. . . They think, deep in their hearts, that they are better than we are because we had to discover the compensations and refuges of life for ourselves. . . They are different. ”
With the signs of these differences evermore obvious, no wonder so many people resent the elites. Often to the point of anger.
Bluto Blutarsky told his frat mates at Animal House that his college time was “seven years down the drain.” Bob Neal did him one better, taking 10 years to graduate.

West Coast holds tight amid barrage

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES - A big crowd showed up for the festive unveiling of President Barack Obama Boulevard here last weekend, at the intersection of "hope and resistance," as one news outlet put it. Sure, it's just a 3½-mile stretch of road, a living ex-president's name added to streets honoring Jefferson and Washington.
But the ceremony also marked the latest, and one of the most joyous, of the not-so-subtle ways in which the West Coast continues to live free and prosper under a president doing everything he can to hurt the 51 million Americans in the three lower-48 states that hug the Pacific shore.
President Donald Trump hates the West Coast. He has called California "out of control" and boasted about "my sick idea" to dump migrants into the progressive cities in this time zone. Worst of all, his administration is actively working to take away health care from more than 5 million people in California alone.
His energy and environmental policies would hasten the collapse of some of nature's finest handiwork, from a pristine coastline that he tried to open to oil drilling, to forests that will soon be aflame again because the president will not do anything to stall climate change.
His trade war is a bullet that could wound the nation's most trade-dependent state, Washington, which produces apples and wine and software and coffee and jetliners and trucks and global health care for the world.
To Trump, everything "Out West" is like occupied territory. Almost daily, he issues legal missives and executive orders intended in some way to make life worse on the West Coast.
But here's the good news for E Pluribus Unum: He's losing. Badly. The West Coast is crushing it against Trump. Using the law to fight a bully, the Constitution to challenge an authoritarian, and facts against Fox News-driven fantasy, California, Oregon and Washington have stalled some of the most despicable of Trump's retrograde policies.
After the wipeout in last year's congressional elections, only a mere 38-mile strip of the Pacific shore in the Lower 48 states, in Washington, remains in Republican hands.
In California and Washington, the ranks of the uninsured have fallen to record lows because of Obamacare. Would any other sitting president go out of his way to reverse that lifesaving progress? 
If the law stands, and the 133 million Americans with pre-existing conditions keep their legal protections, you can thank California's attorney general, Xavier Becerra, for leading an aggressive coalition to defend Obama's greatest legacy.
Federal judges have repeatedly sided with California against Trump on air pollution, toxic pesticides and oil drilling. In April, the Interior Department was forced to suspend a plan to drill off the Pacific shore. And a federal judge in Oregon has so far backed a far-reaching attempt to hold Trump's government responsible for averting climate change.
West Coast governors have defied Trump's ban on transgender Americans serving in the military; they've opened their National Guard ranks to the people Trump is trying to shun from service.
Washington's attorney general, Bob Ferguson, has filed 36 lawsuits against the Trump administration and has not lost a case. His first takedown of the tyrant halted, nationwide, the initial Muslim ban.
Talent and capital can go anywhere. It's drawn to the West Coast, because creativity doesn't grow well in nurseries of fear and tired thinking. Washington was named the best state for business in 2017, and the best place for workers in 2018.
We'll soon look west for a replacement for Trump. By moving their presidential primaries up to March, California and Washington have assured that the one-in-seven Americans who live in those two states will have an early say. It's only fitting, given how much they've contributed to the fight against the Trump blight on the Republic.

Texto completo: NEW YORK - It wasn't the most reviled deal the Mets ever made - sending Tom Seaver to the Reds tops that list - but history showed that dealing Nolan Ryan to the Angels for Jim Fregosi couldn't have turned out worse for the New York team.
As Ryan, 72, prepares to return to Flushing for a reunion of the 1969 world champions the weekend of June 28, Major League Baseball's all-time strikeouts leader and Hall of Famer still wonders what might have been had he remained with the Mets.
"I would have liked to have had the opportunity to pitch an extended period of time with Tom," Ryan said in April from his home in Round Rock, Texas.
Ryan said it was Seaver's leadership that helped set him on the course to 324 wins, seven no-hitters and 5,714 strikeouts over 27 seasons. The two right-handed legends totaled 635 major league victories.
"I give Tom a lot of credit for having an impact on my career," Ryan said. "He was the first guy that I was around who was truly focused on his career and had goals and set out to achieve those goals. His work ethic and just being around and observing him had a very positive influence on me."
Unfortunately for the Mets, they did not reap the benefits.
The 22-year-old Ryan went 6-3 with 92 strikeouts in 89 1/3 innings during the 1969 season in which the Mets had a miraculous world championship run. Though he allowed only 53 walks, he often found himself working out of unfavorable counts.
He was, to say the least, a project for manager Gil Hodges.
"Nolan always had great stuff and when he was on was unbelievable," recalled teammate Jim McAndrew, 75. "When he had trouble finding the strike zone, it drove Gil crazy. Nolan made him an old man early."
Ryan spent two more seasons on the Mets' staff, finishing his tenure with a 29-38 record, a 3.58 earned- run average, 493 strikeouts and 344 walks in 510 innings.
In 1971, he struck out 137 but walked 116 in 152 innings, a 1.18 strikeouts-to-walks ratio. Ryan blamed his erratic control on missing time because of a military obligation.
"I was in a top-priority reserve unit, so I was going back to Houston every other weekend," he said. "Because of that, it didn't allow me to stay in the rotation, and because of that, also I think the inconsistency of my schedule contributed to my control problems."
In 1971, at 24, Ryan was sent to the Angels for Fregosi, a respected third baseman.
"We've had him three full years and although he's a hell of a prospect, he hasn't done it for us," Mets general manager Bob Scheffing told the New York Times after the deal. "How long can you wait? I don't rate him in the same category with Tom Seaver, Jerry Koosman or Gary Gentry." Scheffing died in 1985.
Hodges, who died before the 1972 season, reportedly agreed with the trade. "He hadn't done it for us and the Angels wanted him," he told the Times in 1971. "I would not hesitate making a trade for somebody who might help us right now, and Fregosi is such a guy."
Fregosi hit .233 in 1972 and part of 1973 before being traded to the Rangers. Fregosi, who later became Ryan's manager in Anaheim, died in 2014. Ryan blossomed almost immediately after the trade, becoming a 19-game winner with 329 strikeouts and a remarkable 2.28 ERA in 1972.
"I said he'd become a superstar," former Mets catcher Jerry Grote, 72, said from Belton, Texas. "One reason: The strike zone. He pitches upstairs. They won't give him that strike here. In the American League, he'll get it, guys will be chasing balls over their head."
In all, Ryan led his league in strikeouts 11 times, his best being 383 in 1973, when he was 21-16 with a 2.87 ERA and finished second to Baltimore's Jim Palmer in the American League Cy Young Award voting. It was the closest he ever came to winning the coveted award.
That same year, Seaver Won the National League Cy Young with a 19-10 record, 2.08 ERA and 251 strikeouts for Mets, who reached the World Series but fell in seven games to the Oakland A's.
Imagine if the Mets had had both that season - or any season during both of their primes.
"That would have been a pretty strong 1-2 combination," Ryan said.
Consider this: In 1970, Ryan tied a Mets record by striking out 15 against the Phillies, only to have Seaver surpass it four days later when he set a record with 19 against the Padres.
Ryan was a big factor in the 1969 National League Championship Series, throwing seven innings of relief in Game 3 against the Braves for his first playoff victory. He also saved Game 3 of the World Series, his only appearance in the Fall Classic.
The fact that Ryan won his only World Series ring with the Mets is something he never forgets.
"That very much means a lot to me," he said. "Anytime you win with an organization and a group of guys, that always has a special place in your heart."

Instagram tries to define teen bullying, with difficulty

Texto completo: IF YOU WERE to rank all the ways humans can inflict harm on one another, ranked by severity, it might be a few pages before you got to “intentional inducement of FOMO."
Purposefully giving someone else FOMO — fear of missing out — is not a crime, or even a misdemeanor. But it is a big problem on Instagram, where millions of teenagers go every day to check on their peers. And it is one of the subtle slights that Instagram is focused on classifying as part of its new anti-bullying initiative, which will use a combination of AI and human reviewers to try to protect its youngest users from harassment and pain.
The anti-bullying effort is part of a larger attempt by Instagram and its parent company, Facebook, to clean themselves up. Instagram is particularly vulnerable because of its young user base. About 70 percent of American teens use the service, according to the Pew Research Center. And 42 percent of cyberbullying victims ages 12 to 20 reported being bullied on Instagram, according to a 2017 survey by British anti-bullying organization Ditch the Label.
Recently, I went to Instagram's New York office with several other reporters to hear its executives describe how they're trying to fight bullying. Last year, Instagram announced an effort to use AI to label instances of bullying within photos. This year, it said it would begin testing new features aimed at improving teenagers' mental health, including the ability to hide “like" counts on posts. “There are a lot of teens using Instagram, so we actually see new behaviors and words all the time, and we need to work quickly to understand if these new trends are harmful," said Bettina Fairman, Instagram's director of community operations.
If you want to stamp out bullying, you first have to know what forms it takes. So late last year, Instagram began assembling focus groups of teens and parents and gathering feedback on the unwanted behavior they encountered on the platform.
Some were the predictable types of threats and insults — like rating users' attractiveness on a 1-to-10 scale, a practice that Instagram already prohibits — while others were more unexpected. Some teenagers reported feeling bullied when their exes showed off new boyfriends or girlfriends in a menacing way — for example, by tagging the jilted ex in the photo to trigger a notification and rub in the fact that they had moved on to someone new.
“One of the things we learned early on is that how we were defining bullying in our Community Guidelines doesn't necessarily capture all the ways people feel like they're being bullied," said Karina Newton, Instagram's global head of public policy.
Not all of these behaviors necessarily violate Instagram's rules. The company has not yet decided where to draw every line; for now, it is just trying to understand bullying's many flavors and teach machines to flag them for human reviewers, who then decide whether or not they violate the platform's rules. Facebook and Instagram already use AI to detect various types of off-limits content, but classifying bullying is a bigger challenge, because doing so often depends on the context of a social interaction.
Take one of the example: a photo of two teenage girls that was posted to Instagram with the caption “love you hoe." Normally, Instagram's systems would pick up on the derogatory word “hoe" and flag the post to a human reviewer. But in context, it's clear that the user meant it as a term of endearment, so the correct action would be to leave the post up.
Or consider a hypothetical photo of a teenage couple at the beach, posted to Instagram with the caption “Wish you were here, Amanda!" Normally, that post would be bland and inoffensive. But you can imagine contexts in which it would constitute bullying: Are the people in the photo mocking Amanda for being the only senior not invited to Beach Week? If so, it could constitute “intentional inducement of FOMO." Is Amanda the ex-girlfriend of the boy in the photo, being taunted by the new girlfriend? If so, it could be classified as a form of betrayal. Is a whale in the background tagged as Amanda as a cruel joke about her weight? If so, it could be classified as an insult.
It's odd to realize that what Instagram is describing — a planetary-scale AI surveillance system for detecting and classifying various forms of teenage drama — is both technically possible and, sadly, maybe necessary. It should make us all question whether a single company should have so much power over our social relationships, or whether any platform of Instagram's size can be effectively governed at all.
Eventually, the company hopes its AI will be good enough to identify and remove all types of bullying on its own, without the need for human review. But, executives cautioned, that day may be distant, especially outside the English-speaking world, where it has fewer moderators and less local-language data available to train algorithms.
Instagram's critics probably won't be satisfied that, after making billions of dollars in profits and contributing to what researchers say is an epidemic of teenage depression and anxiety, the company is now trying to dismantle the culture of social media bullying it helped to create. It's also true that Instagram has a multitude of serious problems on its hands — including anti-vaccine misinformation and rampant hate speech and extremism — and that building AI to detect bullying is probably a more convenient challenge than rethinking the ad-driven business model and platform design issues that encourage anti-social behavior in the first place.
But better too little, too late than nothing, ever. Instagram's bully-detecting AI is a good idea, and a step toward giving young people an easier time navigating the vicissitudes of 21st-century adolescence. For their sake, let's hope it works.

Texto completo: BOSTON — Harvard University has barred prominent former professor Jorge Dominguez from its campus and stripped him of his emeritus status after an investigation found repeated "unwelcome sexual conduct" targeting multiple students and faculty over four decades.
The school Thursday announced the completion of a yearlong Title IX investigation into Dominguez, a government professor who was accused last year amid the #MeToo movement of a pattern of groping and other sexual harassment by at least 18 students and junior faculty members.
Harvard also said it now plans to conduct an external review of the school's response to the complaints against Dominguez, a onetime vice provost. Many on the Ivy League campus have criticized how he was retained and even promoted at Harvard despite repeated complaints over the years.
Dominguez, an expert in Latin American studies and Cuba in particular, resigned last year after the new allegations, ending a run at Harvard that began in 1972. He had been disciplined by Harvard in 1983 for alleged sexual harassment but was allowed to continue teaching at the university anyway.
#METOO: Professors face their own reckoning
Claudine Gay, Harvard's dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, in an email to the community Thursday said the investigation, conducted internally by the school, found "a longstanding pattern of behavior that, at several points, violated policies designed to ensure a safe and non-discriminatory educational and work environment. "
"I am appalled by the report’s findings and heartbroken for those who had to endure the behaviors described," Gay said. "Subjecting anyone in our community to unwanted conduct of a sexual nature is unacceptable. "
She said sanctions include revoking Dominguez's emeritus status, typically reserved for retired faculty, which comes with several privileges including the ability to teach courses on campus.
Dominguez has also been disinvited to all Faculty of Arts and Sciences campus and each of its activities held off campus, Gay said, and at her request, Harvard has disinvited him from Harvard’s campus and from off-campus Harvard-sponsored events.
Harvard did not make the specifics of the report available, including the conduct of Dominguez or the possible failure of Harvard staff to follow up on allegations.
Gay cited "tension" in all Title IX cases between the privacy of parties and the broader needs of the community, but said she decided to share the findings and sanctions of this investigation after deciding it is "vital for the safety" of the Harvard community.
"Following our policies and procedures has resulted in a set of sanctions that, in effect, removes Jorge Dominguez from our community," Gay said. "This has, in turn, created an obligation for our community to be informed of the removal. "
Dominguez could not be reached for comment.
Harvard's commitment to conduct an external review follows the release of a 52-page report last week from a committee of students that, according to the New York Times, called for the outside investigation and other changes such as the hiring of more female professors and creating an anonymous reporting system for harassment.
The Boston Globe reported that the committee's report, which looked at the government department where Dominguez worked, called Dominguez's continued employment a “deplorable situation” and a “prolonged institutional failure. ”
Government students warned other students to avoid late-afternoon meetings with Dominguez and to wear baggy clothing, the study found, according to the Globe, and that his behavior was "an open secret. "
Many of the women shared their stories with the Chronicle of Higher Education last year – how he would try to kiss them, touched the inside of their thigh, pressed his crotch into them during hugs and slid his hand down their back to touch their behinds.
Harvard President Lawrence Bacow, in an email Thursday addressed to the committee, agreed to bringing in outside experts for the external review to look at whether the school's "procedures, practices, and norms" have hurt its ability to ensure a safe work environment for all.
Bacow pointed to three areas of focus with the Dominguez situation as a guide: What characteristics of Harvard or its culture "might have inhibited" those who have experienced misconduct from reporting it? Are there "impediments to an effective response" when misconduct is reported? How can Harvard ensure promotional decisions are made with a proper understanding of reports or allegations of misconduct?
He said he will share further updates on the external review, including who will lead the effort, in the coming weeks.
But some at Harvard want more action from the school. The Harvard graduate students union has been pushing for a "third-party, neutral grievance process" for the reporting of sexual harassment in the future.
"Harvard failed to manage this growing crisis on its campus for 42 years," Rachel Sandalow-Ash, a second-year student at Harvard Law School, research assistant and union member said in a statement Thursday. "The system is broken.
"After countless cases of harassment and zero solutions, it’s time for Harvard to face facts: the University has failed survivors, and is incapable of fixing this problem internally. Harvard can't be allowed to police itself. We need strong protections against discrimination and harassment in our union contract, including a neutral third-party grievance procedure. "

Trump asked Don McGahn to deny obstruction after Mueller report release

Texto completo: Soon after the Justice Department released special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation report, President Trump asked former White House counsel Don McGahn to publicly state that he did not view an order to dismiss Mueller as obstruction of justice.
Sources told the Wall Street Journal that McGahn declined the request delivered by current White House special counsel Emmet Flood.
“We did not perceive it as any kind of threat or something sinister. It was a request, professionally and cordially made," McGahn's lawyer, William Burck, said in a statement.
In a follow-up, the New York Times reported McGahn also declined a request to publicly say he believed there was no obstruction before the Mueller report was released. The Times reported that Trump's lawyers saw that Mueller's report left out that McGahn told investigators that he did not believe obstruction of justice had taken place as Burck had told them months earlier.
The White House has yet to react to the news reports.
In the 448-page report, released last month with redactions, Mueller details 10 instances in which Trump might have obstructed justice, including ordering McGahn to fire Mueller. The report said McGahn resisted and went so far as to pack up his belongings at the White House and inform his chief of staff, Annie Donaldson, to tell her of the decision. Former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon and chief of staff Reince Priebus, however, pushed him not to quit, and McGahn did not leave his post at the White House until late 2018.
Another instance of possible obstruction examined said that following media reports in January 2018 — which the president said were “fake news” — that said Trump directed McGahn to have Mueller fired, the president attempted on multiple occasions to have McGahn deny he was told to do so. The report said McGahn shrugged off a request from the president to write a letter disputing he was ordered by Trump to fire the special counsel and told the president during an Oval Office meeting that press accounts were accurate.
Mueller declined to say either way whether Trump committed a crime, citing a Justice Department guideline that sitting presidents cannot be indicted. Democrats argue that Mueller's report leaves the obstruction question up to Congress to investigate and decide.
Trump tweeted last month that he never told McGahn to "fire" Mueller and that if he wanted, he "could have done it" himself.
McGahn cooperated with the special counsel’s team, sitting down for several interviews over 30 hours.
The House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed McGahn last month, seeking his testimony and documents relevant to its investigation into possible obstruction of justice by Trump. However, the White House this week instructed McGahn to defy the subpoena, noting Trump might exert executive privilege to block McGahn from cooperating, possibly setting him up for a contempt of Congress citation.

Australian diplomat whose tip prompted Trump-Russia inquiry: FBI doesn't spy

Texto completo: The Australian diplomat whose tip about George Papadopoulos effectively started the counterintelligence investigation into President Trump's campaign in July 2016 disagrees with the notion that the FBI was "spying" on the Trump team.
"I wouldn't imagine so, no," Alexander Downer, now a former government employee, said in an interview with Sky News. "The's FBI's not — it's not quite like the Australian Federal Police. It's not a spy agency. That's sort of confusing the FBI with the CIA. I mean, why would the FBI be spying on any campaign? It seems so improbable, doesn't it?"
Host Andrew Bolt wasn't convinced. "Well I don't know. I did see the FBI did leak to the New York Times. And they sent a cloaked investigator to follow up your meeting with Papadopoulos," he said, referring to a recent report that said the FBI sent an undercover investigator to meet with Papadopoulos, a Trump campaign adviser, during the 2016 election.
"We don't know," Downer said. "And who knows who leaked, too? You never know the answer to that, do you?"
The debate over the term began at a hearing last month when Attorney General William Barr said "spying did occur" on the Trump campaign. He clarified that he hasn't proven there was any wrongdoing and is looking into alleged misconduct within the Justice Department and FBI, but his "spying" declaration riled Democrats and others. Former FBI Director James Comey said this week, "The FBI doesn't spy, the FBI investigates." But after the Times report came out, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper conceded that what the FBI had been doing “meets the dictionary definition of spying."
Papadopoulos allegedly met Downer at London's Kensington Wine Rooms in May 2016 and told him that the Russians had damaging information on Hillary Clinton, Trump's Democratic rival in the 2016 election. Two months later when WikiLeaks published stolen emails from the Democratic National Committee, Downer informed the U.S. about what he was told. This prompted the FBI's counterintelligence investigation, called Crossfire Hurricane, in July 2016 and was later wrapped in special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. Mueller concluded that inquiry this year having not found sufficient proof to establish criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia.
The man who informed Papadopoulos of this "dirt" was Maltese academic Joseph Mifsud, who has long been suspected of deep ties to Russian intelligence. Although Papadopoulos, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, told investigators Mifsud talked to him about the Russians having "thousands" of Clinton emails, Mifsud denied to the FBI he knew or mentioned anything about emails.
Questions have been raised about whether Downer might have misled the U.S. government about what Papadopoulos told him and why he waited two months to relay the information. Downer, who called himself a "warrior for the Western alliance," said Papadopoulos told him only that the Russians were planning to release information that would be damaging to Clinton's campaign, not that Russia was colluding.
Papadopoulos has said he was "suspicious" of Downer and that the diplomat recorded him illegally with his phone.
Downer, who noted three people were present so he has a witness, denied making a recording. “There’s no defense for him saying it’s some sort of weird conspiracy. I mean, it’s what he told me," he said.

Texto completo: Fittingly coming from the former film producer, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's denial of House Ways and Means Chair Richie Neal's fully legal and justified demand for President Trump's tax returns is a movie we've seen before. Mnuchin has now written three weak "get lost" letters to Neal, leaving the chairman no recourse but the courts. He should win there easily, but expect a drawn-out fight from the administration.
Trying to help Neal is the New York State Senate, which voted Wednesday on straight-up party lines to provide the state tax return of any filer that the relevant congressional committees seek. After the Assembly follows suit, deliver it to Gov. Andrew Cuomo's desk as soon as possible, then face down the inevitable court challenges.
But even that worthy move is no substitute for a superior bill that would publish the New York returns of all statewide elected officials, including the governor, attorney general, controller, U.S. senators and president. Trump could be hiding highly relevant conflicts of interest, as well as information on the sources of his income. The public has a right to know.
That Trump is a chiseler seeking to minimize his tax bill has long been obvious. The New York Times just got ahold of tax records from 1985 to 1994, showing zero taxable income due to hard-to-fathom losses totaling more than a billion dollars. During the 2016 campaign, the Daily News, using publicly-available New York City property tax records, proved that Trump's federal adjusted gross income was under $500,000.
We verified his receipt in 2015 and 2016 of STAR property tax breaks; those are only available to persons with taxable incomes under a half million. As the state and city use income data from the prior two years, it is beyond any question that in 2013 and 2014 Trump was under the threshold.
Get it all out. Do it soon.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump has refused to release his tax returns. He has sued his former accountants and Deutsche Bank to keep them from releasing his returns after they were subpoenaed to do so. And his treasury secretary has refused to provide the returns to Congress.
But bit by bit, The New York Times’ Susanne Craig and Russ Buettner have been gathering returns and tax data from Trump’s earlier years. In the latest installment, they show how Trump claimed over a billion dollars in business losses from 1985 to 1994. In some years, he lost more than any other taxpayer.
In this “Trump, Inc.” podcast extra, we speak to Craig about how she got the story, what she found and what to look for if and when the president’s tax returns are released. “You don’t lose this much money unless you’re a really bad businessman,” Craig told us.
Listen to the Episode
When the Times asked for comment from Trump officials, a spokesperson initially said, “You can make a large income and not have to pay large amount of taxes.” Later, Trump’s lawyer Charles Harder, wrote that the tax information was “demonstrably false.” He cited no specific errors.

Texto completo: Uber prices IPO at $45
SAN FRANCISCO - Uber is about to embark on a wild ride on Wall Street with the biggest and most hotly debated IPO in years.
The world's leading ride-hailing service set the stage for its long-awaited arrival on the stock market next week by pricing its initial public offering at $45 per share late Thursday.
The price is at the lower end of its targeted range of $44 to $50 per share, a decision that might have been driven by the escalating doubts about the ability of ride-hailing service's ability to make money since Uber's main rival, Lyft, went public six weeks ago.
Even at the tamped-down price, Uber now has a market value of $82.4 billion - significantly more than century-old automakers General Motors and Ford Motor.
Co-founder: Time to break up Facebook
Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes says it's time to break up the social media behemoth.
In a New York Times opinion piece published Thursday, Hughes said CEO Mark Zuckerberg has turned Facebook into an innovation-suffocating monopoly.
Hughes called Zuckerberg's power "unprecedented and un-American" and said his co-founder's focus on growth "led him to sacrifice security and civility for clicks."
Hughes roomed with Zuckerberg at Harvard and left Facebook in 2007 to campaign for Barack Obama. Hughes said he no longer has any ownership in Facebook or any other social media company.
Fake German heiress sentenced
NEW YORK - Anna Sorokin, the German con artist who passed herself off as a wealthy heiress to swindle banks, hotels and even close friends as she lived out a high-society, Instagram-ready fantasy in New York, was sentenced Thursday to four to 12 years in prison.
The 28-year-old, who had played with her own tabloid image during the trial by wearing stylish dresses to court, looked despondent as the verdict was announced.
Judge Diane Kiesel said Sorokin had been "blinded by the glitter and glamour of New York City" as she turned to fraud to finance a life she could never afford.
Schick buys Harry's
NEW YORK - Harry's, the upstart shaving company, is being acquired by the owner of Schick razors for $1.37 billion.
Harry's has bedeviled brands like Schick and Gillette for years using innovative subscription plans and sleek packaging.
Under the agreement announced Friday, investors in Harry's Inc. will take a stake of about 11% of Edgewell Personal Care Co., which manages Schick and other brands. Edgewell gets the Harry's brand and access to the company's prized direct-to-consumer marketing base.
Trade deficit increases
WASHINGTON - The U.S. trade deficit increased slightly in March even though the deficit with China fell to the lowest point in five years.
The Commerce Department said Friday that the total deficit in goods and services edged up 1.5% to $50 billion in March, after falling 3.6%in February. The deficit is the difference between what America sells to the rest of the world and what it imports.
Exports rose 1% to $212 billion in March while imports rose a slightly faster 1.1% to $262 billion.

In Carter's rise, a story for our time

Texto completo: As the primaries approached, one Democrat after another announced campaigns for president. Most were senators. Some were governors. One came from a university town in Indiana. They spoke of a need to clean up an executive branch they said was riddled with corruption.
No, this isn't a description of the 2020 campaign. It was 1976 -- the most crowded Democratic presidential field in modern American history, until the current election cycle, which boasts 21.
And, despite worries about a bruising intraparty battle, the little-known peanut farmer who won the primaries also won the White House. His name was Jimmy Carter.
How many Democratic candidates were there in 1976? One historian put the number at 17, though it depends on how you count them. Let's just say the race was remarkably fluid right up until to the last primary.
The first to announce was Rep. Morris Udall of Arizona in late November of 1974, almost a full two years before the election. The longtime congressman came from a famous political dynasty. (Four generations of Udalls have served in various elected offices across the American West.)
The next was Carter, who was weeks away from finishing his term as Georgia governor. He was so unknown that a Gallup poll that asked voters for their impressions of 31 possible candidates didn't even have Carter on the list.
But Carter had a few things going for him.
First, he had visited nearly three dozen states that year in his Democratic Party role coordinating the midterm elections, developing "a reputation as a tactician and an organizer," The New York Times wrote.
Second, he guessed correctly that in the first presidential election since President Richard Nixon's resignation, voters would be looking for an outsider to reform Washington. Even with Nixon gone, resentment toward the president who'd pardoned him, Gerald Ford, was high.
"People are disillusioned with officials in Washington. They are looking for a new face, a new leader whose ideas work," Carter wrote in his first fundraising letter.
Which brings us to one more thing in Carter's favor. After 1968, changes to the nomination process meant party bosses no longer picked a candidate at the convention; instead, primaries and caucuses became the key decider. And crucially, Iowa had moved its caucus to front of the calendar. Carter planned to compete in every primary -- a rare move at the time -- and focused his energy on winning Iowa to build early momentum.
When political veteran Sen. Henry "Scoop" Jackson of Washington, regarded by some as the front-runner, announced his candidacy a few months later, he told reporters he didn't plan to travel much and would campaign from the Senate. And he didn't enter all of the primaries.
The same went for Sens. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas and Birch Bayh of Indiana, and former senator Fred Harris of Oklahoma, who all announced in early 1975. They didn't sign up for all the primaries, though Bayh, like Carter, decided to campaign hard in Iowa.
Then the floodgates opened: Former North Carolina Gov. Terry Sanford; diplomat Sargent Shriver; Pennsylvania. Gov. Milton Shapp; Alabama Gov. George Wallace; and anti-abortion "housewife" Ellen McCormack all got into the race. By the end of 1975, 10 candidates had announced.
Though Wallace wasn't expected to win, he had "perhaps 10 to 20 percent of the electorate," The Washington Post reported, meaning he could end up being a power broker at the convention if no candidate had won a majority of the delegates by then.
There were also a handful of "favorite son" candidates, including District of Columbia Mayor Walter Washington and West Virginia Sen. Robert Byrd. Favorite son was a time-honored tactic whereby a popular state leader would run in the primary in their home state only -- not to win the presidency, but to negotiate concessions from candidates in exchange for the favorite son's delegates. By 1976, this maneuver was essentially obsolete, though few realized it yet.
And even on the eve of the Iowa caucus, more candidates loomed. Idaho Sen. Frank Church believed himself to be the front-runner, Princeton University historian Julian Zelizer wrote in Politico, but he figured he would wait until some of the candidates destroyed each other before entering the race unscathed.
In January of 1976, Carter got what he wanted in Iowa -- sort of. He beat his rivals, but "uncommitted" got the most votes. Still, he was showered with media attention heading into New Hampshire. A month later, he won New Hampshire, with Udall coming in second and Bayh in third.
The momentum was short-lived. On March 2, Jackson won delegate-rich Massachusetts. Carter came in fourth after Udall and Wallace.
There were further setbacks. At a televised presidential forum, The Washington Post described Carter's performance as "calculated evasiveness."
Jackson attacked, saying, "In Iowa, he promises to abolish legalized abortion. In New York, he promises to oppose a constitutional amendment for such change."
Then, when asked by the New York Daily News if public housing should be scattered throughout metropolitan areas, Carter responded, "I see nothing wrong with ethnic purity being maintained." The Congressional Black Caucus complained, and Carter apologized, saying he meant he wouldn't, by government fiat, change a neighborhood's "ethnic character."
Church finally entered the race in mid-March, subsequently winning in Nebraska, Oregon and other Western states.
Then, in a surprise move, California Gov. Jerry Brown announced he would run, just so he could block Jackson from winning in California. He picked up Maryland on the way.
In April, Jackson lost Pennsylvania to Carter and suspended his campaign.
It all came down to the last primaries on June 8: Ohio, New Jersey and California. Carter ignored the latter two, putting everything on Ohio. He won.
Then, according to Zelizer, he got a call from Wallace, offering him his delegates. Wary of the appearance of accepting a gift from the racist Wallace, Carter called Jackson, who agreed to release his delegates to Carter too.
Carter had clinched the nomination, only a month before the convention in New York.
"Everything fell into place so quickly for Carter," The Washington Post reported, "that it was hard to remember how long and how hard he had labored to make that moment inevitable."

Facebook Pushes Back On Co-Founder's Op-Ed

Texto completo: Facebook pushed back Thursday after Chris Hughes, a billionaire co-founder of the company, argued in a New York Times Op-Ed essay that the company should be broken up and regulated.
"Facebook accepts that with success comes accountability," Nick Clegg, Facebook's vice president for global affairs and communication, wrote in a statement. "But you don't enforce accountability by calling for the breakup of a successful American company."
The statement followed a lengthy Op-Ed by Mr. Hughes published online Thursday morning arguing that the social media giant be subjected to extensive government oversight and separated into multiple companies, notably by spinning off the photo-sharing app Instagram and the messenger service WhatsApp. The essay will appear in print on Sunday.
Mr. Hughes was a co-founder of Facebook with Mark Zuckerberg 15 years ago when they were undergraduates at Harvard. He left the company in 2007 to work with the Obama campaign and more recently has focused on the issue of income inequality. In the essay, he said repeatedly that Mr. Zuckerberg is a good, kind person but simply has too much power for any one individual.
"The government must hold Mark accountable," Mr. Hughes wrote in the 5,800-word column, arguing that the social media giant has grown far too powerful.
"From our earliest days, Mark used the word 'domination' to describe our ambitions, with no hint of irony or humility," he wrote. "Over a decade later, Facebook has earned the prize of domination. It is worth half a trillion dollars and commands, by my estimate, more than 80 percent of the world's social networking revenue. It is a powerful monopoly, eclipsing all of its rivals and erasing competition from the social networking category."
[Read Chris Hughes's argument for breaking up Facebook.]
Though others have made similar arguments over the past year, the essay by a longtime confidant of Mr. Zuckerberg drew intense interest, given Mr. Hughes's role in the start of the company and his once close-knit relationship with Mr. Zuckerberg.
Naturally, the debate also played out on Facebook itself and other social media platforms. Some said Mr. Hughes's argument rang hollow because he had made hundreds of millions of dollars from Facebook. Others said that a breakup would not fix the core issues posed by a few companies with so much power over the flow of information.
The specific prescription Mr. Hughes offered was government intervention. He wrote that the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department "should enforce antitrust laws by undoing the Instagram and WhatsApp acquisitions and banning future acquisitions for several years." He called the decision to allow Facebook to buy these two major competitors "the F.T.C.'s biggest mistake."
He also argued that simply breaking up Facebook would not be sufficient. "We need a new agency, empowered by Congress to regulate tech companies," he wrote, saying that "its first mandate should be to protect privacy."
One person who embraced the essay was Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat who has made the breakup of Facebook, Google and Amazon a cornerstone of her presidential campaign. She expressed her support on Twitter and on Medium.
"Weak antitrust enforcement has led to a dramatic reduction in competition and innovation in the tech sector," Ms. Warren wrote. "Venture capitalists are now hesitant to fund new start-ups to compete with these big tech companies because it's so easy for the big companies to either snap up growing competitors or drive them out of business."
Tim Wu, a professor of antitrust law at Columbia Law School and the author of "The Curse of Bigness: Antitrust in the New Gilded Age," also applauded the proposal. "It would be part of an American tradition of breaking up some of the largest tech companies that has produced positive results," he said.
He pointed to the case of AT&T, the telephone monopoly that was disassembled into eight smaller companies in 1984. "A lot of what we now call the internet revolution was a byproduct of the breakup," he said.
But Kent Lassman, the president of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, said industry-specific regulations can backfire. Established business interests will use them to ward off competition, he said. "It is absurd for innovative companies to require constant permission from regulators like the F.T.C. to adapt to a dynamic market."
As a practical matter, a Facebook breakup won't happen anytime soon, said Bill Kovacic, a professor of global competition at George Washington Law School. He said Facebook could argue that it had grown WhatsApp and Instagram into successful businesses with satisfied customers: "How do we know they would have turned out to be an independent and effective competitor?"
He said that Mr. Hughes's essay "dramatically underestimates the difficulty for the government to prevail in such a case."

Texto completo: President Trump has finally proved, beyond any doubt, that there is such a thing as #FakeNews.
In the 1980s and 1990s, the media conspired to perpetrate a vast fraud on the American people. So-called journalists and their complicit editors colluded - yes, that's the word - to convince an unwitting public that Trump was a spectacularly successful businessman.
The scale of the ink-fueled myth has been exposed at last, thanks to 10 years' worth of his tax information obtained by the New York Times, which revealed Trump's enterprises were flopping on an epic scale.
In 1985, Trump reported losses of $46.1 million from his casinos, hotels and apartment buildings, which hemorrhaged $1.17 billion over the next decade. "Year after year, Mr. Trump appears to have lost more money than nearly any other individual American taxpayer," the Times wrote.
You wouldn't have known any of that from a December 1987 People magazine cover that featured the 41-year-old tuxedoed "tycoon" under a headline pronouncing him "TOO DARN RICH."
"Almost everything he touches turns to profit," the magazine marveled, adding: "He says he's too busy to run for President right now, but in a few years, well, who knows?"
It was not the only glossy magazine to be dazzled by Trump's multimillion-dollar toys, including a huge black helicopter with his name on the side, and his claims of a gilded financial empire.
"He is the man with the Midas fist," Newsweek wrote a few months before the People cover.
The Times wrote the earliest classic of the genre with its first profile of Trump back in 1976. The story by society reporter Judy Klemesrud began: "He is tall, lean and blond, with dazzling white teeth, and he looks ever so much like Robert Redford. He rides around town in a chauffeured silver Cadillac with his initials, DJT, on the plates. He dates slinky fashion models, belongs to the most elegant clubs and, at only 30 years of age, estimates that he is worth 'more than $200 million.' "
Evidence suggests that figure was preposterous. As my colleagues Michael Kranish and Marc Fisher noted in their book "Trump Revealed," Trump reported a mere $24,594 in income to the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement that year and said he owed $10,832 in taxes.
At the time, the Times did offer a tiny note of skepticism about Trump's business acumen, in the form of an unattributed quote from a banker who told Klemesrud: "His deals are dramatic, but they haven't come into being. So far, the chief beneficiary of his creativity has been his public image."
Trumping up The Donald's reputation was a mutually beneficial arrangement between the floundering businessman and his media enablers, particularly the New York tabloids, which had a seemingly bottomless appetite for all of this.
"When we would talk particularly to immigrants, recent immigrants who were the readers of the Daily News, they would always want to know about Donald Trump," that paper's gossip columnist George Rush told Kranish and Fisher. "He embodied the American Dream to them. Excessive, conspicuous consumption is not a bad thing in New York to a lot of people."
Trump each year browbeat Forbes to include him on its annual list of the world's richest people - which it obliged him by doing, beginning in 1985 - and then howled that it had underestimated his supposedly vast wealth.
Eventually, Trump's blunders became too big to hide under a pile of press clippings. He was dropped from the Forbes 400 for six years, beginning in 1990, when the magazine posed a question on its cover: HOW MUCH IS DONALD REALLY WORTH NOW?
In December 1992, columnist Gail Collins, then at Newsday, described him as a "financially embattled thousandaire."
An enraged Trump mailed her a copy of her column with comments scrawled throughout, including: "Gail- You are a dog and a liar." He also drew an arrow pointing to her picture and wrote: "The face of a pig - no wonder you are so angry. I would be to. [sic]"
Even now, Trump would rather be thought of as a tax cheat than a loser. "You always wanted to show losses for tax purposes . . . almost all real estate developers did - and often re-negotiate with banks, it was sport," he tweeted in response to the recent Times report.
His backup singers at "Fox & Friends" chimed in, noting that piling up 10 digits' worth of losses was a testament to Trump's financial genius. "If anything, you read this and you're like 'Wow, it's pretty impressive, all the things that he's done in his life,' " co-host Ainsley Earhardt said in wonder. "It's beyond what most of us could ever achieve."
During the final debate of the 2016 campaign, Trump vowed to "run our country the way I've run my company." As we are learning, that is one campaign promise he's on track to keep.

Trump vs. Dems-constitutional crisis?

Texto completo: For Trump, numbers are what really count. Numbers in the billions as he once boasted of his wealth and a claim back in 2015 that he was the richest, most successful candidate to ever seek the Oval Office.
Those claims, like much of the house of cards and lies on which he had built his so-called empire, are beginning to crumble, shattered by revelations of huge losses over the last decade.
The opening lines of The New York Times report Tuesday, May 7, says it all about Trump's financial bragging: "By the time his master-of-the-universe memoir 'Trump: The Art of the Deal' hit bookstores in 1987, Donald 1. Trump was already in deep financial distress, losing tens of millions of dollars on troubled business deals, according to previously unrevealed figures from his federal income tax returns."
Trump has often chided the media for manufacturing "fake news" about him and his policies, but the numbers he boasted about are now back to haunt him. "The numbers show that in 1985, Mr. Trump reported losses of $46.1 million from his core businesses-largely casinos, hotels and retail space in apartment buildings. They continued to lose money every year, totaling $1.17 billion in losses for the decade," the Times report continued.
"In fact, year after year, Mr. Trump appears to have lost more money tiran nearly any other individual American taxpayer, The Times found when it compared his results with detailed information the I.R.S. compiles on an annual sampling of high-income earners. His core business losses in 1990 and 1991-more than $250 million each year-were more than double those of the nearest taxpayers in the I.R.S. information for those years."
At last the nation gets a look at the financial sleight of hand tactics Trump has been using to hide his total wealth, how it was obtained, and why he continues to fight disclosing his tax returns. On Monday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin stated that he would not deliver Trump's tax return to the Congressional Ways and Means Committee, vowing to "fight all the subpoenas."
A standoff and showdown between the Trump administration and Democratic lawmakers seems to be shaping up, just as one has cropped up as the Democrats in Congress demand the full un-redacted Mueller Report. On Wednesday, Trump, according to the Justice Department, asserted executive privilege as members of the House Judiciary Committee prepared to vote on whether contempt charges could be filed against Attorney General William Barr.
Like The New York Times report, particularly the information on Trump's father and the accumulation of wealth and passing it on to his son, the Mueller Report remains crucial on the questions of obstruction of justice, impeachment and a constitutional crisis.

Texto completo: Fittingly coming from the former film producer, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's denial of House Ways and Means Chair Richie Neal's fully legal and justified demand for President Trump's tax returns is a movie we've seen before. Mnuchin has now written three weak "get lost" letters to Neal, leaving the chairman no recourse but the courts. He should win there easily, but expect a drawn-out fight from the administration.
Trying to help Neal is the New York State Senate, which voted Wednesday on straight-up party lines to provide the state tax return of any filer that the relevant congressional committees seek. After the Assembly follows suit, deliver it to Gov. Cuomo's desk as soon as possible, then face down the inevitable court challenges.
But even that worthy move is no substitute for a superior bill that would publish the New York returns of all statewide elected officials, including the governor, attorney general, controller, U.S. senators and president. Trump could be hiding highly relevant conflicts of interest, as well as information on the sources of his income. The public has a right to know.
That Trump is a chiseler seeking to minimize his tax bill has long been obvious. The New York Times just got ahold of tax records from 1985 to 1994, showing zero taxable income due to hard-to-fathom losses totaling more than a billion dollars. During the 2016 campaign, the Daily News, using publicly-available New York City property tax records, proved that Trump's federal adjusted gross income was under $500,000.
We verified his receipt in 2015 and 2016 of STAR property tax breaks; those are only available to persons with taxable incomes under a half million. As the state and city use income data from the prior two years, it is beyond any question that in 2013 and 2014 Trump was under the threshold.
Get it all out. Do it soon.

Texto completo: Revelations of huge past losses fuel Democrats' push for latest returns
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Wednesday that new revelations about President Trump's past tax filings show the need for congressional Democrats to see those returns, which the administration is refusing to provide.
A report published in the New York Times, based on previously unrevealed figures from the president's federal tax returns, says that Trump reported a total of $1.17 billion in losses from 1985 to 1994 from businesses including casinos, hotels and apartment buildings.
While contending the report didn't reveal anything new about the president, Pelosi quoted the 1924 law that is the basis of repeated requests from the House Ways and Means Committee chairman to view Trump's returns. The law says the treasury secretary "shall furnish" tax returns of any individual to the chairmen of Congress's tax-writing committees if asked.
"He's the president of the United States, we're going to try to get some work done with him, but we do have a responsibility to our own oath of office: To protect and defend the Constitution, to do just that. He takes the same oath. I don't think he takes it seriously, so it tells me nothing," Pelosi said of the New York Times report.
"It does tell us, though, that it would be useful to see his tax returns, as the law says, the administration 'shall' give the - 'shall.' It doesn't say 'may, should, could, under certain circumstances.' It says 'shall' give those tax returns to the Ways and Means chairman."
Pelosi's comments at a Washington Post Live event come two days after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin informed Ways and Means Chairman Richard E. Neal (D-Mass.) that he would not be turning over the past six years' worth of Trump's personal and business tax returns as requested.
Mnuchin said that after consulting with the Department of Justice, a determination had been made that releasing the returns would be unlawful because of potential privacy violations. Mnuchin also questioned Neal's basis for seeking the returns, disputing Neal's argument that his request has a legitimate legislative basis to assist with the committee's oversight responsibilities.
Neal suggested Tuesday that his next step could be to take the issue straight to court, where he has long predicted it would end up. Neal said he would be consulting with House lawyers on Thursday before making a decision but noted that the administration has been ignoring subpoenas, suggesting there was no point in taking intervening steps before filing suit.
Pelosi said she would defer to Neal but added: "There are several options. One of them is to go directly to court."
Post reporter Robert Costa, who was interviewing Pelosi, raised the prospect of holding Mnuchin in contempt or even arresting him, but Pelosi laughed that off.
"Well let me just say, we do have a little jail down in the basement of the Capitol," Pelosi said. "But if we were arresting all of the people in the administration, we would have an overcrowded jail situation, and I'm not for that."
Trump has long resisted releasing his tax returns, something every president since Richard M. Nixon has done voluntarily. He's offered varying rationales, including claiming he could not release his returns under audit, even though numerous experts have said that would be no impediment to releasing them if he chose. Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen told Congress earlier this year that Trump's returns were never under audit and that Trump did not want scrutiny of his financial affairs.
The Times report sheds light on why that might be the case. The report finds that during the same period Trump was promoting himself as a business prodigy, he was racking up massive debts from many losing enterprises.
The magnitude of Trump's losses allowed him to avoid paying taxes in eight of the 10 years the Times examined - and he lost more money than almost any other taxpayer over that time, the Times reported.
The decade examined by the Times, from 1985 to 1994, is a different period from the years of returns sought by Neal, from 2013 to 2018. But the findings by the Times puncture elements of the persona Trump built over the years - as a successful businessman - which was a central selling point in his campaign for president.

Texto completo: Iraq plans $53B oil project: BAGHDAD — Iraq is planning a $53 billion megaproject with global energy giants ExxonMobil and PetroChina to use seawater from the Persian Gulf to boost oil production, Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi announced Tuesday. The 30-year project would boost output from Iraq’s southern oil fields, and includes designs to capture natural gas, which is lost to flaring under current practices, Abdel-Mahdi said.
Reuters reporters freed: HONG KONG — Two Pulitzer-winning Reuters journalists held in Myanmar for more than 500 days for their coverage of the crackdown on Rohingya Muslims were freed from jail Tuesday, ending a prolonged detention that has tainted Myanmar and its Nobel laureate civilian leader, Aung San Suu Kyi. Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were released as part of an annual amnesty that has freed thousands of prisoners since last month. An additional 6,000 people were released Tuesday.
Texas seeks to harden schools: AUSTIN, Texas — Nearly a year after a mass shooting at a Texas high school in which eight students and two substitute teachers were killed, lawmakers in the gun-friendly state are close to passing new measures that they say would harden campuses by adding more armed school personnel, beefing up security plans and boosting mental health resources. "What stops people with guns is other people with guns," said state Rep. Tony Tinderholt. "Guns stop gun violence when someone wants to go kill children in a school."
Trump pardons former soldier: WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump has pardoned a former U.S. soldier convicted in 2009 of killing an Iraqi prisoner, the White House announced Monday.
Trump signed an executive grant of clemency, a full pardon, for former Army 1st Lt. Michael Behenna, of Oklahoma, press secretary Sarah Sanders said. Behenna was convicted of unpremeditated murder in a combat zone after killing a suspected al-Qaida terrorist in Iraq. He was paroled in 2014.
Kuchner has immigration plan: WASHINGTON — Reviving a deeply contentious issue that has stymied both Congress and the administration, the White House launched a new bid Tuesday to overhaul a legal immigration system that President Donald Trump has long railed against. Trump invited a dozen Republican senators to the White House to preview the plan, which was spearheaded by senior adviser and presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner.
NYT: Taxes show Trump losses: Donald Trump reported $1.17 billion in financial losses to the IRS between 1985 and 1994, a massive run of red ink that kept him from paying income taxes during most of that period, according to a report published late Tuesday in The New York Times. The Times said it had documented those losses by obtaining official IRS tax transcripts for those years, showing the figures Trump reported on his IRS Form 1040 returns. The scope of those losses was such that, "year after year, Mr. Trump appears to have lost more money than nearly any other individual American taxpayer," The Times said. The Times said a private attorney for the president, Charles Harder, had called its report "demonstrably false."

James Clapper backtracks: FBI's actions meet 'dictionary definition of spying'

Texto completo: Following revelations that the FBI sent an undercover agent to meet with George Papadopoulos in London in 2016, James Clapper was forced to backtrack on his prior comments and admit that this was “spying.”
Earlier in April, Attorney General William Barr had told Congress that “I think spying on a political campaign is a big deal”, and Clapper had immediately slammed the suggestion that the Trump campaign may have been spied on as “stunning and scary.” But last Friday, Clapper, who’d been the director of national intelligence under President Obama, conceded that what the FBI had been doing “meets the dictionary definition of spying."

Tweet
Speaking in front of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on April 10, Barr told the Department of Justice oversight panel that “for the same reason we're worried about foreign influence in elections, I think spying on a political campaign is a big deal.” Barr also said he was “not suggesting those rules were violated” but that he does believe “it's important to look at.”
“I think it's my obligation,” Barr said.
That same night, Clapper went on CNN to speak with Anderson Cooper and blasted Barr, calling his comments “both stunning and scary.”
"I was amazed at that and rather disappointed that the attorney general would say such a thing,” Clapper said. “The term 'spying' has all kinds of negative connotations and I have to believe he chose that term deliberately.”
But in a widely-overlooked interview on CNN on May 3, Clapper admitted that spying had occurred. When asked by Wolf Blitzer whether spying had occurred, Clapper said that “it’s not a term of art used by intelligence people“ but admitted that “I guess it meets the dictionary definition of surveillance or spying, a term I don't particularly like.”
Clapper conceded this point following a May 2 story in the New York Times that revealed that a woman who had been posing as the assistant of Stefan Halper, a Cambridge University professor who himself had worked as a Trump campaign informant on behalf of the FBI, was herself working undercover for the FBI. Going by the alias Azra Turk, this yet-unknown woman was reportedly sent to meet with Papadopoulos by one of the FBI agents who had previously spoken at Halper’s Cambridge Intelligence Seminars.
Barr himself has refused to back down from the use of the word “spying” and, responding to questioning in front of the Senate on May 1, Barr said, “I’m not going to abjure the use of the word 'spying.' I don’t think — you know, my first job was in the CIA — I don't think the word 'spying' has any pejorative connotation at all.”
“To me, the question is always whether or not it is authorized and adequately predicated spying,” Barr said. “I think 'spying' is a good English word that, in fact, doesn’t have synonyms because it is the broadest word incorporating all forms of covert intelligence collections. So I'm not going to back off of the word 'spying' and I use it frequently as the media.”
Attorney General William Barr also told Congress he was “working very closely” with the Justice Department’s Inspector General Michael Horowitz as they both conduct investigations into the investigators who ran the Trump-Russia investigation at the DOJ and FBI. Horowitz has been looking into possible Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuse for more than a year.
Barr told the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that he was looking into the origins of the investigation into the Trump campaign, into any criminal leaks from the FBI or Justice Department to the media, into the possibility that the "Steele dossier" — compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele — was Russian disinformation, and more.

Texto completo: Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said Tuesday that the nation could not “accept” another term from President Trump if the country wants to remain “faithful” to the Constitution.
“We have to make sure — this will sound political but we have to make sure that the Constitution wins the next presidential election,” Pelosi said at an event at Cornell University’s Institute of Politics & Global Affairs.
“We can’t be worrying about well, how long is this going to take? Well, that will take as long as it does. And we will press the case so that in the court of public opinion. People will know what is — is right. But we cannot accept a second term for Donald Trump if we are going to be faithful to our democracy and to the Constitution of the United States,” Pelosi said.

Pelosi’s comments follow her telling the New York Times that she worries Trump will not accept the results of the election.
“We have to inoculate against that, we have to be prepared for that,” she said.
“If we win by four seats, by a thousand votes each, he’s not going to respect the election,” Pelosi said, recalling the 2018 election. “He would poison the public mind. He would challenge each of the races; he would say you can’t seat these people.”
[Opinion: Democrats float theory about Trump not accepting 2020 election defeat, as they refuse to accept election defeats]
Pelosi added in her Tuesday comments that the Democrats needed to fight on all fronts to make sure Trump does not get elected again.
“So we have to operate on many fronts. We have to operate in the Congress, in the courts, and in the court of public opinion, and we must win the next election,” Pelosi said.
Some of the progressive members of Congress have been pushing to get the whole Democratic caucus to support impeaching the president.
In March, Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib submitted a formal impeachment resolution along with Rep. Al Green of Texas.

Texto completo: The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals handed President Trump's administration a win on Tuesday after it ruled the government can send asylum-seekers back to Mexico to wait for a court to adjudicate their petitions.
The judges approved the policy in part due to Mexico's commitment to ensure the safety of the asylum-seekers. "We are hesitant to disturb this compromise amid ongoing diplomatic negotiations between the Untied States and Mexico because ... the preliminary injunction (at least in its present form) is unlikely to be sustained on appeal."

“The Ninth Circuit court’s decision is devastating. Subjecting vulnerable families to this program is inexcusable,” said Taylor Levy, an immigration lawyer in El Paso to the New York Times.

Texto completo: Dr. Jill Biden said Tuesday the public needs to focus on the “good” that resulted from what Anita Hill experienced testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee against Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas while her husband Joe Biden was chairman of the panel.
“They had the phone call,” Jill Biden said in an interview with NBC’s Savannah Guthrie.
“He apologized to her. And the one good thing that has come out of this is that he made sure that there were now women senators on that committee,” she said in a separate clip. “He has written the Violence Against Women Act. So you have to look at the good that came out of that.”

Jill Biden expressed similar sentiments in a recent interview with NPR, where she said "he apologized for the way the hearings were run, and now it's kind of, it's time to move on."
Joe Biden called Hill, who testified before Congress in 1991 that she was sexually harassed by Thomas, to apologize last month for “what she endured” before the Senate Judiciary Committee before he announced he was running for president in the Democratic primary race.
“They had a private discussion where he shared with her directly his regret for what she endured and his admiration for everything she has done to change the culture around sexual harassment in this country,” Kate Bedingfield, Biden’s deputy campaign manager, said in a statement last month.
In response, Hill told the New York Times that she believed the apology was inadequate and that she would not back Biden in his presidential bid.
“I cannot be satisfied by simply saying I’m sorry for what happened to you. I will be satisfied when I know there is real change and real accountability and real purpose,” she said.

Texto completo: If you use location services on your smartphone, this new lawsuit filed might just include you.
All four major cellphone companies have just been hit with a class-action lawsuit over allegations that they sold their customers’ private location data to bounty hunters and low-level law enforcement.
The suit, which was filed by Z LAW on Thursday, claims that AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, and T-Mobile made geolocation data available to a Securus, a broker that allows law enforcement to access your location without a warrant.
Z LAW is a “consumer protection" law firm, according to its website.
The class-action lawsuit covers 100 million customers from Verizon and AT&T and 50 million for T-Mobile and Sprint customers between April 30, 2015, and Feb. 15, 2019.
The suits are seeking unspecified damages. USA TODAY has reached out to each of the wireless service companies for comment on the lawsuit.

The location-selling practice was brought to light after an investigative report from Motherboard was published in January showing that AT&T, T-Mobile and Sprint gave a network of middlemen access to their customers’ real-time location.
The New York Times also ran a report in 2018 saying that the carriers provided the private data to Securus.
Following the reports, 15 senators called on the Federal Trade Commission and Federal Communications Commission to look into how the wireless carriers allowed third parties to track Americans’ cellphones without consent.
"Americans expect that their location data will be protected," the group of senators wrote in an open letter.
"The wireless industry has repeatedly demonstrated a blatant disregard for its customer's privacy. It is, therefore vital that regulators take swift action to ensure that consumers are protected. "

Brownsville Station: A rare success story
By Manny Fernandez in Brownsville, Tex.
In the busiest Border Patrol sector on the southwest frontier -- the Rio Grande Valley, where a tent city was opening this week to ease overcrowding at packed migrant processing centers -- there is one 23-mile stretch where there is no border "crisis."
Brownsville Station.
Some stations along the 1,900-mile border have recently been apprehending hundreds of migrants a day. Brownsville gets 35 to 45, on average. Some Border Patrol stations routinely nab mega-loads of drugs, like the 925 pounds of marijuana intercepted the other day near Rio Grande City, Tex. In Brownsville, 150-pound loads are the average.
What's the secret?
The Border Patrol employs a three-pronged concept as a kind of operational mantra when it comes to securing the border: personnel, technology and infrastructure. In other words, boots on the ground, high-tech gadgets and fencing.
Brownsville Station has some of each.
The result, Border Patrol officials say, is that smugglers tend to push most of the drugs and migrants to less-fortified areas farther west.
In an area of South Texas where heavy drug smuggling and unauthorized migration helped prompt President Trump's declaration of a national emergency on the border, Brownsville has been quietly providing the Border Patrol with a rare success story.
"This is the anomaly in the Rio Grande Valley sector," said Jorge L. Gonzalez, the patrol agent in charge of the Brownsville Station. "We feel that this is a more secure part of the border, where it's harder to actually smuggle things across."
Mr. Gonzalez spoke in a briefing room at the station's headquarters one recent morning. Everyone calls him "J.L." A short and stocky father of three, Mr. Gonzalez grew up in the Rio Grande Valley, in Mission, Tex., and the Border Patrol has defined his personal and professional life. A neighbor who worked for the Border Patrol told him when he was a teenager that he'd make a good agent, and it stuck with him. He joined the agency at 22. He's now 41.
"Besides working at a grocery store, this is the only job I've had," he said.
The wall of digital maps, charts and images behind him illustrated his A.O.R., agency parlance for area of responsibility. The border fence in downtown Brownsville is topped by razor-wire and mesh to prevent people from scaling the wall with ladders. There are roughly 150 sensor-equipped cameras snapping pictures in the area, part of a state program called Operation Drawbridge. Several other surveillance-camera systems pump live video feeds into the station's control room. And that's on top of sensors that detect movement in the brush, plus other sections of border wall that extend outside of town. Some of Mr. Gonzalez's agents patrol the local university on bicycles, to better blend into the campus environment.
"It's a system of systems," Mr. Gonzalez said. "They all complement each other. One stand-alone portion of this will not get it done."
Smuggling patterns are perpetually shifting. In the early 1990s, California's San Diego sector was the busiest. Then the action shifted in the early 2000s to Arizona's Tucson sector. Now, it's the Rio Grande Valley's turn. About 20 years ago, the Brownsville Station was a smuggling hub and had the highest level of illegal activity in the sector. Border Patrol and local officials believe a decade-long buildup of resources has paid off. And it's not all about the wall: the station patrols 23 miles of the border, but only has about nine miles of completed fencing.
"I call it smart money," said Tony Martinez, the mayor of Brownsville. "They spent their money in a smart way."
Not everyone agrees. Migrant advocates and the agency's critics say the Brownsville Station's low apprehension and seizure numbers may have more to do with the cartel-related smuggling dynamics on the other side of the Rio Grande in Mexico than with Border Patrol strategy -- the smugglers may have their own reasons for targeting other areas of the valley.
It's not that they don't try, though. Later that day, Mr. Gonzalez walked on a dirt road beneath a bridge on the American side of the border. A young man across the river, on the Mexican side, took pictures of him -- possibly a scout gathering information, Mr. Gonzalez noted.
The smugglers "nickle-and-dime us," he said, but large dispatches of migrants or drugs were unlikely to get through -- not here.
"There's a higher probability that we're going to catch their cargo," he said. "Whatever that is."

What to read: Your suggestions for books on the border
Last month we offered a reporter's take on the essential books to read about the border, and we asked for your own suggestions on what we missed. Here is a selection of books Crossing the Border readers recommend to better understand what's happening between the United States and Mexico.
"Storming The Wall, Climate Change, Migration and Border Security," by Todd Miller, and "This Land Is Our Land, An Immigrant's Manifesto," by Suketu Mehta.
Reader Ross Connelly writes: "These books make clear that although border security is big in the news in the United States, the issue is global. We need to address the many aspects of the U.S.-Mexican border -- The Wall -- but there is far more to understand."
"All the Agents and Saints: Dispatches from the U.S. Borderlands," by Stephanie Elizondo Griest.
Diana Berry writes that she read the book "after meeting the author at a Writer's Conference in Greensboro, N.C. She tells the stories of both our borders and how they share some issues."
"Down by the River: Drugs, Money, Murder, and Family," by Charles Bowden.
From Robert Collins: "I found it a fascinating tapestry of the interwoven lives of the citizens of El Paso and Juarez."
From Elizabeth Carr: "Any book by Charles Bowden is worthwhile. He was prolific until his death five years ago. I heard him speak once. He spent his life exploring the border area and had a lot to say."
"Borderlands/La Frontera," by Gloria Anzaldúa.
David J. Morris writes: "I just taught Borderlands/La Frontera to my mostly Latinx class here at UNLV and they really took to it. None of them had read Anzaldúa before. The book played a big role in my life because I read it right after I left active duty in the Marines in 1998 and then I took a six-month-long surfing road trip to Oaxaca and back via Baja California. Reading Anzaldúa changed my perception of myself and my sense of America because I'd grown up on the border but I'd always just considered myself an American in the most general sense. After reading Anzaldúa I began to think of myself as something of a border citizen."
"The Coyote's Bicycle: The Untold Story of Seven Thousand Bicycles and the Rise of a Borderland Empire," by Kimball Taylor.
Patricia Noell writes: "This story is set in San Diego/Tijuana. The reader will learn much of the culture and values of the area, as well as how many people cross the border."
"The Devil's Highway," by Luis Urrea.
Many readers, including Peter Maille and Michael Cuslidge, shared this suggestion, which recounts a tragic 2001 crossing that left 16 Mexican migrants dead after they were abandoned by their guide.
More on the Devil's Highway
Mr. Urrea wrote that the Sonoran Desert, home to the Devil's Highway, or El Camino del Diablo, "is known as the most terrible place on earth."
But, like many places along the border, it can be terrible, dangerous and beautiful all at once. Writing for the Times Travel section this week, Michael Benanav explores the contradictory nature and history of the 130-mile dirt road that runs between Yuma and Ajo, Ariz., which is on the National Register of Historic Places.
"The scenery is vast and mesmerizing," he writes:
Ocotillos sprout from arid basins, their spiky tendrils and bright red blossoms swaying in the breeze like some kind of weird desert anemone. There are sand dunes and lava flows and knife-edged mountains slicing skyward from the desert floor. Owls roost in saguaro cactuses, endangered antelopes browse sparse grasses, bighorn sheep leap among rugged crags.
Conquistadors, missionaries, prospectors, traders and others traversed it, beginning in 1540, usually heading to or from California. So many perished along the way, in this place that can feel as hot as hell, that it became known as the Devil's Highway. Historians believe there may been more than 2,000 fatalities in the last half of the 19th century alone.

Congress ready to attack common enemy: Robocallers

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Rep. Darren Soto's phone rang just a half-hour into last week's House Energy and Commerce subcommittee hearing on the surge of robocalls clogging the nation's cellphone lines. He ducked off to take the call only to hear a recorded voice float a lucrative offer to buy his home.
"We're all being inundated," Soto, D-Fla., said plaintively when his turn came to speak at the hearing.
Bipartisanship may be in short supply in the 116th Congress, but Republicans and Democrats have found a common enemy. Swamped by complaints from peeved constituents, lawmakers from both sides of the aisle in both chambers are promising action to halt the influx of automated calls.
Bipartisan, bicameral bills would hold robocallers legally liable for the frauds they are pushing, impose stronger penalties on phone scammers and make telecommunications companies disclose and verify the origin of incoming calls.
"Whenever people come up to me at home, there's two things they tell me," Rep. Billy Long, R-Mo., said. "They say, 'Support the president.' The second thing they say is, 'When are you going to do something about these robocalls?'"
Americans received 48 billion robocalls last year, and unsolicited dials are expected to make up almost half of all calls that Americans receive by the end of 2019, according to YouMail, a robocall blocking service. Only a fifth of those calls are considered legitimate automated alerts, like a reminder of an upcoming appointment.
Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are teaming up to pass legislation that will allow fraudulent callers to be held responsible. In the House, Rep. Frank-Pallone Jr., D-N.J., who leads the Energy and Commerce Committee, is shepherding a package of legislation that would impose stronger penalties on phone scammers and require telecom providers to adopt authentication tools to enable phone carriers to disclose and verify the origin of an incoming call.
"There's no silver bullet," Pallone said. "That's why it is so important that we address this problem from every side."
He will find support on the other side of the Capitol from Sen. Charles E. Grassley, R-Iowa, who partnered with Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., and Sen. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., to introduce similar legislation. Their bill has passed out of committee and awaits a full Senate vote.

Stop poor-mouthing the two-earner family

Texto completo: When it comes to pressures on working parents, it is usually the political left that is loudest in calling for more government intervention to help them. Its focus is on traditional liberal programs like universal child care and mandates for more generous family leave. But some on the political right have recently expressed concern, in this case about two-earner couples.
This campaign on the right got a lot of publicity in January when Fox News host Tucker Carlson asked viewers to hold their applause for rising women's wages, arguing that this higher pay reduces marriage rates, increases out-of-wedlock births and leads to social problems. He has also characterized the mass entry of mothers into the workforce as a "disaster for families."
Carlson is not a lone wolf in pushing this view. While not as blunt as he was, Helen Andrews, managing editor of the conservative Washington Examiner magazine, made a similar case in a recent op-ed in the New York Times. She, too, argues that public policy has gone too far in encouraging women to work.
Why? A large part of her answer is rooted in financial insecurity. She writes: "When mothers started entering paid employment in large numbers in the 1970s, it led to a bidding war over middle-class amenities that left everyone paying more for the privilege of being no better off than before." This, in turn, has made marriage less appealing and less common, she argues, and has contributed to a crisis in the American family.
I share many of the tenets of social conservatives. I believe that strong families should be a central concern of public policy. I am very concerned about the decline of marriage and believe that marriage -- and not just "stable parenting" or cohabitation -- matters enormously, both to individuals and to society. But the thinking represented by Carlson and Andrews is way off base.
Let's start with the incorrect argument that women's contributions to household income have been completely consumed by the increase in costs -- Andrews's "bidding war" -- driven by their decision to work. Estimates show that middle-income households have seen their incomes rise by one-third since 1979, before taxes and government transfers, even after taking into account price increases in overall goods and services, including education, housing and child care.
And after accounting for taxes and transfers -- some of which are designed to offset the higher prices of middle-class amenities -- households' inflation-adjusted incomes have gone up by 46 percent. These gains occurred at the same time that women significantly increased their participation in the workforce.
But let's assume for argument's sake that the concern is correct. Even if all the additional income generated by working women were spent on goods and services whose prices had increased because of their employment, that itself would be evidence that their presence in the labor force is a good thing. Women would be revealing that they believe they are better off working, even if their paid labor doesn't increase their income after expenses. After all, why else would they be working if it didn't make them better off in some broader sense?
The argument that policy has gone too far in encouraging women to work seems to minimize their role in the economy. For much of the post-World War II period, women have entered the workforce as men have exited it. And for decades, a large share of overall economic growth was driven by the fact that women were entering at a faster rate than men were leaving. That's not small beer. Neither is unlocking the talents, ideas and energy of half the human race.
On that last point, remember that the policies some social conservatives want to put the brakes on were not created in a vacuum. The U.S. safety net encourages mothers to work in part because of the view that this is better over the long term for them and their children. And, of course, removing barriers to employment for women overall is a response to centuries of repression and inequality.
The argument of the conservative critics also seems to suggest that female workers are to blame for the higher cost of middle-class amenities. That's both insulting and wrong.
Remember that prices are determined by both supply and demand. Certainly the price of child care has increased because demand for it has risen with more women in the work force. But if the supply of child care had kept pace with demand, the price would have stayed the same. Supply did not increase as aggressively as demand in part because of policies restricting it.
Supply restrictions are a major factor in price increases in health care, housing and education, as well. So are policies that increase demand for those goods and services by subsidizing them. If you're looking for a reason why their costs have risen so much, start with policies that subsidize their demand and restrict their supply, not with women working.
I confess I'm confused by another aspect of these conservatives' argument. In their enthusiasm for families with only one working parent, and their support for helping men's wages and industries specifically, they sometimes write as if women are being forced to work -- as if subsidizing child care or their earnings creates a nudge too strong to resist. This is nonsense. For one, despite the policies the critics bemoan, women still work at lower rates than men.
Andrews writes: Stopping "the trends set in motion by the feminist revolution would leave women more free to follow a diversity of paths." What is stopping women from doing this now? Plenty of households -- those with low and high incomes -- are able to get by with one breadwinner. Just as it is for two-earner households, this is a choice. It comes with its own challenges and benefits.
Trumpian populism has intensified nostalgia for life in the 1950s, including family life. But who, even in the working class, would really trade places with someone living in 1953, with its much lower living standards and opportunities, and racial cruelties and injustices? Probably not many women, let alone racial minorities, that's for sure. And probably not many white men, for that matter.
In the end, the good things about family life that social conservatives rightly celebrate are perfectly compatible with two-earner households. Both spouses working does not necessarily make a marriage weaker. It does not mean children will be less loved and less nurtured. Instead, the choice a two-earner family makes is exactly that -- a choice. And a choice motivated by the best interest of the family is one that should be respected.

Texto completo: If you felt the ground shake and witnessed wild beasts living together in harmony, that was actually a supernatural event triggered when Republicans and Democrats agree on something.
As I listened to NPR, in my car, to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y) talk about his meeting with President Trump on infrastructure, I almost had to pull over. Schumer said, among other things, that Democrats and the president — yes, President Donald J. Trump — "want to get something done on infrastructure in a big and bold way." He said there was "good will" in the meeting.
I first checked the date. It wasn't April 1.
That left only two possibilities. The man I heard on the radio was an impostor. The real Schumer was in a closet somewhere, bound with duct tape and an ether rag stuffed in his mouth. Or that was really him on the radio, talking about how his meeting with Trump was very "constructive."
I suddenly felt lighter.
Could this be a sign that Republicans and Democrats realize they are failing the American people and have awakened, committed to a new sense of cooperation for the benefit of their constituents?
And what could be better than addressing our crumbling infrastructure - roads, bridges, the power grid, water supply? This is good government. Perhaps Congress can finally start doing something to turn that measly 20-percent approval rating around.
And then, like a frying pan in the face, reality arrived.
The infrastructure package would cost about $2 trillion. Neither the Democrats nor the president talked about how they were going to pay for it.
This, of course, is the tricky bit about wanting expensive things — the paying.
I would enjoy a snowmobile, an 80-inch TV and a pizza oven. But I really won't have them until I exchange currency for the items.
It's safe to assume that Trump and the Democrats will have vastly different ideas about how to fund infrastructure improvement.
Raising the gasoline tax, which hasn't been raised since 1993, has been talked about, but Trump is unlikely to go along with any sort of tax increase, no matter what's being taxed.
And the skeptic in me says that Republicans and Democrats, with an election looming in 2020, realize they need to at least pretend to want to get something accomplished so when the whole thing blows up they can say, "Hey, we gave it our best shot. It's their fault."
May 13 will mark the beginning of "Infrastructure Week." I figured I'd let you know in case you want to send a card.
Unfortunately, "Infrastructure Week" has taken its rightful place next to "National Unicorn Day" and Tinkerbell's birthday. You can celebrate all you want, but you're not going to see anything.
If there's one thing, just one, on which Republicans and Democrats should be able to come together, it's infrastructure. Maintaining sound roads and bridges, along with a stout power grid, is fundamental responsibility of our government.
Of course, doing things that are "fundamental" for which it is "responsible" is not a strength of this current iteration of Congress, nor has been the strength of several previous iterations.
And even with infrastructure, there are naysayers.
"We're in the middle of a constitutional crisis here," former Schumer aide Brian Fallon told the New York Times Tuesday. "The most important job the Democrats have right now is to uphold the rule of law against a president who thinks the law doesn't apply to him. We have bigger fish to fry than trying to look like we gave it a shot on infrastructure."
Buzzkill.
And there are plenty of distractions to keep both parties from focusing on infrastructure.
On the day of this writing, Senate Democrats are grilling Attorney General William Barr about what he said regarding the Mueller report before it was released. This Capitol Hill hearing featured all of the political classics — grandstanding, righteous indignation, raised voices, not to mention the call by Hawaii Sen. Mazie Hirono for Barr to resign.
So much for "good will."
I have that heavy feeling again. My optimism is about gone. And now I'm wondering if that shaky ground was really just the start of another sinkhole.

An Outspoken Net Talks About the Team's Future

Texto completo: Charles Barkley and Shaquille O'Neal say it pretty much every night they're on the air during these N.B.A. playoffs: They long to see LeBron James join them for a cameo on Turner Sports' "Inside The N.B.A." set.
They're not alone, either. Virtually everyone in the basketball public wants to see that.
Far less advertised but likewise true: "Inside's" four-man crew, which also features the peerless host Ernie Johnson and Queens' own Kenny Smith, wanted a dose of the Nets' Jared Dudley, too.
There has been no word yet about LeBron, but Dudley's turn arrived Tuesday night. The Nets' veteran forward and unofficial team spokesman joined the game's most decorated broadcast team for a segment in which they discussed some of his defensive techniques and Dudley's contentious interactions with the Philadelphia 76ers stars Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons in the opening round of the playoffs.
"Feels like I made it," Dudley said of the chance to trade quips on air with Barkley and O'Neal.
While Dudley was in transit to Turner's Atlanta studios earlier this week, The New York Times caught up with him by phone to talk about the Nets' Cinderella season, his playoff spat with Simmons and what may loom in Brooklyn's free-agent future.
The interview has been edited for length and clarity.
You can tell us now -- what were your real expectations for this team when you got traded to the Nets? (Dudley was traded to the Nets from the Phoenix Suns in July 2018 in exchange for Darrell Arthur and a protected 2021 second-round draft pick.)
Phoenix wanted me to do a buyout. I didn't want to do a buyout, so I think they had to throw in a second-round pick to get Brooklyn to take my contract. I figured the Nets would want to do a buyout, but Sean Marks called my agent Mark Bartlestein -- and Kenny Atkinson called me -- and they said not only do we want you on the team but we want you to play. I was shocked. And happy.
Then when I got there in August, this team was in full motion. Almost the whole team went to summer league. And when you're in the Eastern Conference, you give yourself a chance if you can just get to .500. Once I got a look at the talent -- Caris LeVert, D'Angelo Russell, Spencer Dinwiddie, Jarrett Allen -- it wasn't long before Ed Davis and I were in the locker room saying, "This could be a playoff team."
Were you guys still saying that when the team was 8-18?
We had a players-only film session after we lost eight in a row instead of having a team meeting. Guys were calling each other out. Young players were asking questions. The next night we beat Toronto at home -- they were the No. 1 team in the N.B.A. at the time. That just kind of got us going.
It wasn't only the talent. Kenny Atkinson does things the right way. He's on top of guys, but he gives you freedom. He holds players accountable. He holds veterans accountable. He holds coaches accountable if they don't do drills correctly. You don't see that from every coach in the N.B.A. You see that he'll bench D'Angelo in the fourth quarter if he needs to. You see that he'll play the guys who are playing the best. I was like, "Man, this guy really wants to win."
You've become known as one of the most outspoken players in the league. How comfortable are you with that label?
Very comfortable -- because of my past. I learned you don't speak on anything unless you have knowledge about it. I don't think I'm someone who knows it all. But, after 12 years, I've seen the good, the bad and the ugly. So I try to be outspoken but not controversial to the point where it's affecting the team or affecting me and what I'm supposed to be doing in my job. I just try to be very forward and honest.
You took a lot of heat in the playoffs for describing Ben Simmons as an "average" player in the half-court game. Any regrets?
I do wish I chose different words. I was breaking down how we were going to guard him -- how you try to limit someone like Ben Simmons. I was just trying to say that we would have our best success if we could get him in a half-court game.
Should I have used the word "average?" Looking back on it, no. It was such a negative reaction after I said it that no one heard I also said he was elite in transition and an elite passer. But, you know, it happens. It's the playoffs. And I understand the reaction. I understand how it goes.
Did anyone with the Nets ask you to tone it down after that?
When it came to the front office, no one said anything about toning it down. It was not intended to be said in a disrespectful manner. And I think I've earned that right in my 12 years. I'm not saying stuff to say stuff.
You will be a free agent in July. How likely is it that the Nets will still have a place for you after their summer business?
Possible. I do think if it was up to Kenny and even Sean Marks, I think they would like me back. But they've got a Plan A, a Plan B and a Plan C -- as they should. That doesn't mean I can't fit into that. But they're close.
Close to what?
It's just set up for one All-Star player to come in and take this team from a six seed to a two seed within one year. They have the infrastructure -- good owner, good G.M., good coach. The practice facility is one of the best in the league. The arena is one of the best in the league. You've got draft picks, cap space, you're in New York City. And the young talent -- when it comes to 25 and under, if it's not the best talent in the league it's second or third.
Will top free agents really consider the Nets when marquee teams like the Knicks and Lakers are flush with salary-cap space?
I really believe that it should be in the top three for any top free agent. No matter where you're at. Do free agents want to play for the Knicks or the Lakers? Or the Clippers or Brooklyn? People talk about those teams like it's a negative, because they're not the big name in town -- and it's not. But the Clippers can do two max slots. So can Brooklyn.
I didn't promote every team I've ever been on. When I left the Clippers in 2014, if anything, I don't want to use the word "bashed," but I might have bashed them. It wasn't a good experience for me. I didn't have the Steve Ballmer experience. But I give them props now. They've done a 180 over there. From the front office changes to Doc Rivers focusing more on coaching to bringing in Jerry West -- give them credit.
I'm not here just to toot Brooklyn's horn. I've sold Brooklyn to other players just because you'd want the same thing. Players want to know the good organizations from the bad.
It sounds like you believe the rumblings out there that Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving -- who are constantly referred to as the Knicks' top two targets -- plan to give the Nets some consideration this summer.
I would be shocked if the Nets don't get a sit-down.

Texto completo: NEW YORK - New York City has thousands of buses that trek across the city - often in slow motion - on routes that stretch up to nearly 20 miles. Along the way, they make dozens of stops.
Then there is the B39. It goes all of 1.8 miles and makes just three stops.
This little-known bus travels from one side of the Williamsburg Bridge to the other before circling back, like a windup toy stuck on an endless loop between the edges of Brooklyn and Manhattan.
Round and round it goes. It crosses the East River 58 times a day, less often in bad traffic.
Only about 220 people ride the bus on a weekday, the city's lowest daily bus ridership. It is a money loser for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
But for its regular riders the bus is a lifeline. It carries those in wheelchairs, a vital option when the elevator at the closest subway station is not working. It allows the frail, the old and the sick to rest their feet. (Getting a seat is never a problem.) It is an alternative, and an escape, from the crowded subway lines, walkway and bike path that also cross the bridge.
"This bus is very important to a lot of us," said Herbert King, 75, whose walker was parked next to his bus seat. "If it weren't for this bus, we'd all be in trouble because what are we going to depend on?"
Even as cities across the country overhaul outdated bus systems to become more efficient, there are some distinctive bus routes that add a bit of character to the public transit experience.
They may be short - barely going anywhere. They may draw relatively few riders. They can seem unnecessary especially when there are other, faster transit options. Some are downright quirky.
In Houston, Route 311 runs only on the first Tuesday of every month to take potential bidders about a mile from a transit center to a public auction where county officials sell off real estate properties with unpaid tax bills.
Denver has a fleet of free electric buses that only run along a single downtown street, making 18 stops in 1 mile, to provide door-to-door service to local businesses.
In Seattle, three buses serving routes 118 and 119 actually roll on to a ferry from downtown to Vashon Island in Puget Sound.
New York's B39 is all that remains of the trolley car system across the Williamsburg Bridge, which opened in 1903, and carried many immigrants from the tenements of the Lower East Side to Brooklyn and beyond.
There was a "living connection between the two sides" of the East River as families crossed back and forth to work, visited relatives and friends, worshipped at synagogues and even took English lessons, said David Favaloro, director of curatorial affairs for the Tenement Museum on the Lower East Side.
The trolleys were replaced in 1948 by buses.
(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
Today, the B39 fleet has shrunk to just a single bus that runs every half-hour from about 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. It is the second shortest of the MTA's more than 300 bus routes. The shortest is the 1.3-mile B42 route that connects Canarsie, Brooklyn, to a subway station and bus transfer hub. The longest is the S78's 19.5-mile trip across Staten Island with 117 stops.
The transportation authority spends $565,000 annually to operate the B39. With a total of 74,000 passengers in all of 2018 - down from 104,000 in 2014 - it would have collected only $203,500 if everyone paid the full fare of $2.75. (Of course, the authority loses money on many bus routes).
The B39 was supposed to be suspended as part of the shutdown of the L line, which links Brooklyn and Manhattan. The plan was to replace it temporarily with expanded bus service to carry displaced L train riders. But like many commuters, the B39 received a reprieve when Gov. Andrew Cuomo intervened at the last minute to avert a full shutdown.
It was the second close call for the B39. In 2010, the route was eliminated in sweeping budget cuts. But riders protested, the authority relented and the bus was restored in 2013.
Joseph Schwieterman, a professor of public service at DePaul University in Chicago who has studied urban bus systems, said that such little-used routes can be "alarmingly expensive." Cities often hang on to them even when they no longer make economic sense to avoid backlash from a small number of loyal riders, he said.
The B39 starts in Brooklyn at the Williamsburg Bridge Plaza, at the foot of the bridge, then crosses the river and makes two stops on the Lower East Side. Then it swings around and stops twice to pick up passengers as it heads back to the bridge plaza.
"The B39 provides a critical connection between Brooklyn and Manhattan for customers who need additional accessibility options," said Maxwell Young, spokesman for the transportation authority.
Pete Lopez, 63, a retired teacher in Williamsburg who has been riding the B39 for decades, said he has come to rely on it because he has trouble walking - "my feet gave up on me" - and does not want to attempt the stairs at subway stations. "It's my buddy," he said. "I need this bus, and as I get older, I need it more."
Other regulars said that hopping onto the B39 is far more pleasant than squeezing onto the subway. "You don't have to wait with a lot of people," said Anna Marte, 62, a Lower East Side resident who takes the bus at least once a week. "Nobody pushes you."
But Marte does have to wait. With only one bus running, there can be long delays if it gets trapped in traffic on the bridge. After waiting 40 minutes the other day, Marte finally just headed to the subway. It would be another 10 minutes before the B39 turned up. By then, no one was at the stop.
Angel Arroyo, who was behind the wheel of the B39, recalled that a cement truck broke down on the bridge a few months ago and had to be towed. He was delayed by nearly an hour. "No one else was on the bus - that was a good thing, otherwise, it would have been, 'Let me off, I'll swim,'" he said. "You can't do anything about it. You just have to sit there and wait it out."
Arroyo, 52, said he does not mind driving in circles. Where else, he said, would he have panoramic river views at his feet? "Sometimes you want to get away from the hustle and bustle," he said. "For me, this is peace of mind."
The bus ride is comforting, as well, for many of Arroyo's regulars. Most are older than 50, including a 94-year-old man who takes the bus to church every Sunday. Some stand up in front with him after swiping their fare cards to talk.
"We're like a family on the bus - everybody knows everybody," said Jeffrey Brown, 61, as he rolled onto the bus in a wheelchair. - (The New York Times)

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
We all make choices about food every day, and those choices are connected to our changing climate. About one-quarter of all planet-warming greenhouse gases emitted each year are a result of how the world eats. If you eat food, you are part of the system.
As the Climate editor at The New York Times, I hear from readers frequently with questions about their major climate concerns. A lot of people ask about food because they feel like it's something they can control. Readers face so many choices, many of them confusing, about what to buy and what to eat. Part of our mission at The Times is to help people understand the world, so we saw an incredible opportunity.
We decided to create a big, first-of-its-kind collaboration: joining the Food and Climate reporters and editors to give readers something comprehensive, something that could help answer the big questions about how what we eat intersects with climate change. And who knows food better than The Times's Food desk?
"As both a food editor and a home cook, I had questions, and they bubbled up constantly," said Emily Weinstein, a deputy Food editor who suggested the collaboration. "Every time I bought groceries I wondered what the best choice was from an environmental perspective: Should I buy greens in a plastic bag or a plastic tub? Was canned tuna bad? Was salmon bad? Beef was probably bad -- but what about beef from the farmers' market?"
We gathered editors from both desks to shape the collaboration, and decided that the Food section would do an entire issue dedicated to climate. It would be "Climate Week" at the Food desk and "Food Week" at the Climate desk. ("Every week is food week!" said one of the editors on Climate.)
We invited Brad Plumer, a Climate reporter, and Julia Moskin, a Food reporter, to join with Rebecca Lieberman, Eden Weingart and Nadja Popovich, who are visual journalists, to find answers to dozens of climate-related food questions and decide the best way to present that to readers. Their comprehensive visual story became the anchor of the collaboration.
"It was so obvious we needed to do this," said Sam Sifton, the Food editor at The Times. "The science, after all, is clear. The climate is changing. And a lot of home cooks have been left paralyzed at the stove or in the marketplace as a result. What, in general, are we supposed to buy and cook, if we want to help reduce our carbon footprints, the carbon footprints of our nation, our world?"
We also wanted to make this personal, because food choices are incredibly personal. We were all curious about how our food choices compared with those of other Americans. The result: a quiz to calculate the climate impact of the foods most similar to what you ate for breakfast, lunch and dinner yesterday. It's a good tool to see which foods have the highest impact. One takeaway: You don't have to become a vegetarian to reduce your climate footprint. Simply eating less meat and more plants, or choosing chicken instead of beef, can make a difference.
Reporters from both desks jumped to pitch stories. Kim Severson wrote about how climate change is making it harder to grow peaches in Georgia and blueberries in Maine. Somini Sengupta gives readers five ways to eat sustainably, using examples from traditional cuisines around the world. Eric Asimov showed us how vineyards and wineries are facing changes. Tejal Rao went to Napa, Calif., to write about drought-tolerant tomatoes, and Melissa Clark wrote about how we should all eat more seaweed.
And there are dozens of recipes, too: for weeknight vegan dinners, for sustainable seafood, for all kinds of bean and lentil meals.
"Food can be a remarkably good way to tie abstract ideas to personal experience," Ms. Weinstein said. "In this case, connecting the climate change threat to the very human, everyday choices of what you'll buy, and cook, and eat."

Texto completo: [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox .]
NEWARK -- The backlash over New Jersey's lucrative corporate tax incentives grew on Thursday when it was disclosed that four politically connected companies received nearly $ 300 million in tax breaks based on questionable claims that they would otherwise move out of state.
The four companies all had close ties to George Norcross, a powerful Democratic leader in the southern part of the state.
A state official revealed that three of the companies had indicated that they were considering moving to Philadelphia in order to qualify for tax breaks to stay in New Jersey, but in fact did not have viable offers to go there.
The fourth business identified a potential relocation site in Philadelphia four days before the state approved its $ 40 million tax credit in 2014, the official said.
The revelations about those companies, which all sought to move to the city of Camden with sizable tax credits, under a 2013 law known as the Economic Opportunity Act, were made public during a daylong hearing by a panel of investigators appointed by Gov. Philip D. Murphy, a Democrat.
The task force is examining whether $ 11 billion in economic development programs have delivered significant economic benefits or have been a boon to politically connected firms and companies.
An investigation by The New York Times found that lawmakers allowed a real estate lawyer, Kevin D. Sheehan, whose influential law firm has close ties to Democratic politicians and state legislators, to edit drafts of the 2013 law that unlocked sizable tax breaks for his firm's clients.
The testimony on Thursday by current and former officials at the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, which oversees the tax credit programs, raised serious concerns about the law, the lack of oversight in reviewing applications and the way some tax credits were awarded.
A former president of the authority, Tim Lizura, also acknowledged that many last-minute changes to the law were made by Mr. Sheehan. The Times found that those alterations were done without any public disclosure.
Companies had been awarded $ 4.9 billion under the 2013 legislation by moving to New Jersey or remaining in the state and creating and retaining jobs.
The hearing was the second held in recent months by the task force, which in April referred evidence to federal prosecutors for possible criminal charges. It is not immediately known whether the evidence might lead to charges or what might result from Thursday's testimony.
But a member of the task force said companies could be held criminally liable.
"There is real criminal exposure for companies that lie to the E.D.A.," said Pablo Quiñones, a special counsel on the task force.
For several hours, another special counsel, Jim Walden, displayed some of the specific edits of the bill on a large screen. Some changes, he noted, were intended to allow specific companies, such as Subaru of America, to claim hundreds of millions of dollars in additional tax breaks.
Several companies had business ties with Mr. Sheehan's firm, Parker McCay, Mr. Walden said.
Mr. Sheehan did not register with the state as a lobbyist for the Economic Opportunity Act, and his firm told The Times that its work on the legislation did not amount to lobbying.
"Parker McCay was asked by policymakers, including those in the Legislature, to review this legislation and offer input and suggestions on ways it could be strengthened to help Camden and other localities in South Jersey, which have historically lost out to North Jersey in receiving economic benefits from the state," the company said in a statement on Thursday.
Beside his work on the bill, Mr. Sheehan also helped the four businesses who were considering a move to Philadelphia -- Cooper Health System; Conner Strong & Buckelew; the Michaels Organization; and N.F.I. -- assemble their tax credit applications, Mr. Walden said.
Cooper Health was awarded nearly $ 40 million in tax credits to relocate to Camden. It submitted an application on Nov. 7, 2014, and stated that none of its employees were at risk of losing their jobs and wrote "TBD" in response to a question about whether it was considering leaving the state, according to a copy of its application shown during the hearing.
The next month, a Cooper Health executive told the state that it had located a property in Philadelphia. Four days later, the Economic Development Authority approved its tax credit submission.
A Cooper Health spokesman said on Thursday that the company was truthful in its application and had hired more employees than it had proposed. A representative for Conner Strong & Buckelew said that suggestions made during the hearing were inaccurate and that the company was seriously considering a move out of state to consolidate its offices.
The building that Cooper Health eventually moved into had been owned by the Economic Development Authority, according to records obtained by The Times. The agency sold the site in late December 2014 to a nonprofit organization, which sold it that same day to a real estate investment group, documents show.
Intersecting nearly every piece of the testimony on Thursday, even though their names were rarely mentioned, were the Norcross brothers.
Parker McCay's chief executive is Philip Norcross, whose brother is George Norcross, an insurance executive at Conner Strong and the chairman of the board of trustees of Cooper Health System.
A third brother, Donald Norcross, is a former Democratic state senator who represented Camden and had been a sponsor of the 2013 law; he is now a United States representative.
Conner Strong, the Michaels Organization and N.F.I. submitted tax credit applications on the same day in October 2016. They collectively sought $ 245 million to relocate together to a new 18-story tower on the Camden waterfront. Without the tax credit, they were considering moves to office towers in Philadelphia, the companies claimed.
But by the time they applied for the credits, the offers to lease space in Philadelphia had expired, according to David Lawyer, an official with the Economic Development Authority who had reviewed the applications for the task force.
The companies later submitted new leases, but those offers should also have raised red flags, Mr. Lawyer said.
The companies had proposed new lease configurations in Philadelphia, with far different office layouts that had employees scattered on different floors, he said.

Texto completo: How far will Trump goto retain power? The 2020 election is going to be ugly in many different ways. It has been obvious for some time that President Trump is planning to promote hatred and division, but one thing we haven't yet focused on is how he will use the resources of the federal government to make sure he wins reelection.
Indeed, Trump may already be preparing to mobilize the federal government's resources to destroy his opponent, whoever that turns out to be. The New York Times has a new piece featuring what is sometimes called an oppo drop: a news article about a politician initiated by a political rival passing damaging information to reporters. It happens all the time, and it's not necessarily illegitimate as journalism, because the information itself may be relevant and the journalist does his or her own investigation to verify what they've been told.
But in this case, the Times acknowledges the story's provenance right in the headline: "Biden Faces Conflict of Interest Questions That Are Being Promoted by Trump and Allies."
I'm hardly Joe Biden's biggest fan, but this story seems particularly weak in its implication that Biden did anything remotely wrong. What it comes down to is that, as vice president, he advanced Obama administration policy by pressing Ukraine to fight corruption, a perfectly worthy goal shared by lots of countries.
At the time, Biden's son Hunter was working for a Ukrainian company called Burisma Holdings that was being investigated by the country's chief prosecutor, who was widely believed to be corrupt. Which brings us to the most critical part of this story, how Trump is already using his office to go after Biden. The Times reports, "The Trump team's efforts to draw attention to the Bidens' work in Ukraine, which is already yielding coverage in conservative media, has been led partly by Rudolph W. Giuliani, who served as a lawyer for Mr. Trump in the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. . . . Mr. Giuliani declined to comment on any such phone call with Mr. Trump but acknowledged that he has discussed the matter with the president on multiple occasions. Mr. Trump, in turn, recently suggested he would like Attorney General William P. Barr to look into the material gathered by the Ukrainian prosecutors."
So what we have here is the president's lawyer, with the direct involvement of the president himself, pushing a foreign official to open an investigation for the obvious purpose of embarrassing a potential rival, while the president is pushing the Justice Department to act in ways that could harm that rival as well.
That should be a scandal in and of itself. And I can't say this strongly enough: This is only the beginning . We haven't yet seen how far Trump is willing to go to retain power.

Texto completo: Los fiscales federales continúan descubriendo nuevos padres que pagaron sumas millonarias para asegurar los estudios de sus hijos en las más importantes universidades de Estados Unidos.
Un nuevo escándalo involucra a la familia de una estudiante de China que presuntamente pagó $6.5 millones de dólares para ingresar a Stanford, una de las universidades más prestigiosas del mundo.
La noticia, que fue reportada inicialmente por Los Angeles Times, asegura que Yusi Zhao, conocida como Molly, ingresó a la universidad de Stanford a inicios del 2017 gracias a la suma millonaria que su familia pagó a William “Rick” Singer, quién fue admitida para hacer parte de un equipo deportivo de navegación de la universidad. Según el New York Times, la estudiante fue expulsada de la universidad en abril de este año, pero no está claro si Zhao y su familia están siendo investigados en Estados Unidos.
En un nuevo artículo publicado hoy, Los Angeles Times asegura que otra familia china pagó $1.2 millones de dólares para que sus hijas fueran admitidas a la universidad Yale.
Mientras las investigaciones continúan, las personas siguen esperando cuál será la próxima celebridad o influyente empresario en caer por participar en este esquema de estafa . Según el New York Times, cientos de padres están buscando abogados defensores para protegerse de esta oleada de destape de sobornos y de humillación pública que se convirtió en el escándalo de admisiones a universidades más grande en la historia de Estados Unidos.

Texto completo: Speakers at three central Maine commencements run the gamut from retired U.S. Army sergeant to Pulitzer Prize-winning author.
Keynotes run gamut from retired US Army sergeant to Pulitzer Prize-winning author

The director of operations for a project management company in the nuclear industry, a retired U.S. Army sergeant and a Pulitzer Prize-winning author will speak at graduations at three central Maine institutes of higher learning next month.
Elizabeth Strout, winner of the 2009 Pulitzer Prize in fiction for her book “Olive Kitteridge,” will speak at the University of Maine at Farmington’s graduation on Saturday, May 11, at 10:30 a.m., the university announced Monday.
“Elizabeth Strout’s extraordinary career has its roots in a deeply abiding sense of Maine’s unique spirit,” said Eric Brown, UMF interim president, in a news release.
“Her writing is authentic, unabashed in its rendering of the full range of human experience, from the troubled to the triumphant, and a wonderful example of the power of story in shaping life’s meaning. We are thrilled to have her address our 2019 graduating class.”
Strout was born in Portland and raised in small towns in Maine and New Hampshire, according to the release.
She is also the author of “Anything Is Possible,” her most recent book and winner of The Story Prize; “The Burgess Boys,” named one of the best books of the year by The Washington Post and NPR; “Abide with Me,” a national bestseller; and “Amy and Isabelle,” winner of the Los Angeles Times Art Seidenbaum Award for First Fiction and the Chicago Tribune Heartland Prize.
UMF’s graduation will take place at 10:30 a.m. Saturday, May 11, behind the Olsen Student Center and is open to the public.
At Thomas College, Todd Smith, president of TSSD Services, an Oakland-based project management company specializing in the nuclear industry, will be the commencement speaker.
Smith, who graduated from Thomas with a B.S. in Accounting in 1992 and an M.B.A. degree in 1999, has been a Thomas College Board of Trustee member since 2004, and became co-chair of the board in 2010.
According to the college, his leadership and philanthropy helped lead to program and scholarship expansion and facility expansion including the construction of the Harold Alfond Academic Center, the Kennebec Savings Turf Field Complex and the Henry and Ellen Hinman Residence Hall.
The ceremony will take place Saturday, May 11, at 1 p.m. in the Alfond Athletic Center at Thomas.
Retired United States Army Staff Sergeant Travis Mills will deliver the commencement speech at Unity College.
In April 2012, Mills was critically injured on his third tour of duty in Afghanistan by an IED while on patrol, losing portions of both legs and both arms.
He is one of only five quadruple amputees from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to survive his injuries.
He has since started the Travis Mills Foundation, and has a New York Times bestselling memoir, “Tough as They Come.”
The ceremony will be held Saturday, May 11, starting at 11 a.m. in Tozier Gymnasium.
Colby College’s commencement is scheduled for 10 a.m. on Sunday, May 26, on the Miller Library Lawn. A speaker has not yet been announced.

Texto completo: "The recession talk in late 2018 got way, way out of hand," New York Times economic reporter Neil Irwin tweeted a few days ago. Indeed it did. Irwin’s tweet came shortly after the government released figures showing the economy grew at a 3.2% annual rate in the first three months of this year. The number was good by anyone’s measure, significantly outpacing predictions. And it raised a question: What about all that recession talk of the last few months? What was going on?
Certainly, there were some economists who looked at various indicators — housing, energy, the international economy — and feared an economic slowdown was on the way. But in the popular conversation — the world of columnists and cable TV talkers — much of the economic chatter was really about President Donald Trump. A worsening economy, some said, would show how wrong the president’s policies have been and would be the worst possible news for his 2020 re-election bid. Now, though, the case is a bit harder to make, with 3.2% growth, plus low unemployment, plus — perhaps most important — wage increases that have not been seen in years.
Still, the presidential campaign is under way, and Democrats will try to portray — actually, they’ll have to portray — the president’s policies as an economic mess. The question is whether it will work. Republican strategists are of two minds. On one hand, some still bear the scars of the 1992 election, when Bill Clinton managed to convince voters that the economy, which was in the early stages of a recovery, was in desperate shape. The lesson: Creating a perception of the economy was more important than the economy itself.
On the other hand, some Republicans believe it will be difficult for any Democrat — Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, anyone — to talk down a healthy economy.
"We, of course, have no idea what the economy will be like in a year and a half," said strategist Curt Anderson in another email exchange. "But if it stays similar to how it is now, the Democrats will not be successful in talking it down."
While an economic downturn would obviously hurt Trump, Anderson sees the possibility of another dynamic entirely.
"When the economy is good, voters don’t say that the economy is their No. 1 issue," he explained. "We have several polls this year where the voters list the economy as their third- or fourth-most important issue ... Often voters will migrate to other issues when the economy is good."
In that rather ironic scenario, a good Trump economy could give voters the freedom to focus on things they don’t like about the president.
In any event, Trump’s job will be to convince voters not only that his economic policies are working, but that Democratic proposals — the Green New Deal, Medicare for All, tuition-free college and more — would destroy the economy that has gone well during the early Trump years.
So far, despite all the pessimistic talk, that’s not a hard argument to make. And if the indicators hold up, the president will hold a strong hand, whatever his real or perceived liabilities, in November 2020.

Texto completo: We already know what the Phoenix Suns' new head coach will be — their fifth one in five seasons.
What he or she needs to be is more important.
Philadelphia 76ers assistant Monty Williams remains the top target, and his second interview with the Suns is imminent. Suns officials met with him Friday in Toronto and will likely do so again later this week.
The 76ers' second-round series against the Raptors is tied 1-1 as they'll play Game 3 on Thursday and Game 4 on Sunday in Philadelphia. Whenever or wherever the next meeting is, Suns team owner Robert Sarver is expected to attend, as was first reported by Stadium NBA Insider Shams Charania.
The Suns didn't make an offer the first time they met with Williams. They may very well do so after this second interview.
What kind of coach do the youthful Suns need, though?
Simple, yet thorough Devin Booker often said last season the Suns were at their best when they were "just playing basketball" and weren't calling plays.
There was some truth to that, but the Suns can't just free flow all the time.
The best teams consistently execute, particularly in the half court, and know how to get their best players the ball within the framework of their offense.
That tends to separate the teams that make the playoffs and the ones that advance in the postseason.
The Suns must improve their execution of plays and carrying out defensive concepts. Too many the times they weren't connected on both ends and it'll be up to the new coach to ensure there are fewer of those instances.
That might mean Phoenix switches everything on defense regardless or runs fewer plays. Opponents may find it easier to game plan, but the Suns being able to execute what is being asked at a consistently high level will make them a more difficult team to beat.
Igor Kokoskov had hundreds of plays, but he was dialing back their implementation as early as training camp, in part because he had several young players who hadn't played much — or at all — in the league. The Suns had five rookies, and Josh Jackson was entering his second NBA season.
Adapt, change philosophy to fit If Kokoskov had been given a veteran team with which he could have just said, 'Hey, do this, this and this,' his time in Phoenix might have worked out better. He had to do more teaching and coaching in Phoenix with a young team that got even younger after the Suns bought out Tyson Chandler's contract and traded Trevor Ariza by mid-December.
Teaching is one of Kokoskov's strengths, but there was clearly a disconnect between what he taught and how the Suns played. Every coach has a philosophy, but this new one needs to make it fit so the players can grasp it and carry it out on the court.
"My approach to player development is one where the development has to translate," Suns General Manager James Jones said days after firing Kokoskov this month.
"So you can work on all of the individual skills, the group skills, but if they don't translate, then that's not development. So (the new) coach that we have will be a guy that's on the floor. He'll be a guy that's intimately involved in crafting our player-development plans, but he'll also be responsible for making sure that on the floor, these skills translate."
The New York Times' Marc Stein is reporting the Suns are looking to hire Riccardo Fois to lead their player development. Fois has been Gonzaga's coordinator of analytics for four seasons, but he's also personally trained Indiana Pacers power forward Domantas Sabonis, who played for the Bulldogs in college.
This hire addresses player development, but how he meshes with the new head coach will be important.
Experienced and firm Players tend to challenge coaches regardless of the level.
So imagine that at the highest level. Being professional means respecting the coach, but that becomes a challenge when the team isn't winning.
The Suns had their second-worst record in franchise history at 19-63 last season. It's safe to say Kokoskov found himself in a challenging situation.
That's why Williams stands atop Phoenix's list of head-coaching candidates. Yes, he has a losing record (five seasons, 173-221) as a head coach, but he has that experience of leading an NBA team.
Phoenix could miss out on an assistant who is ready to be a head coach like Eric Spoelstra was in Miami, but hiring someone with NBA head-coaching experience gives him more credibility with the players.
The Suns finished the season with a very young core that's only going to get younger if they get a top three pick in the upcoming NBA draft and select one of Duke's two freshman phenoms — Zion Williamson or RJ Barrett — or Murray State point guard Ja Morant.
Connect emotionally, define roles Much was made of Kokoskov not sticking up for his players by drawing technical fouls after questionable calls. Kokoskov lacked a connection with his younger players and that played a part in him being fired after just one season, according to league sources.
So the new coach should establish that bond early, yet establish he's in charge, too.
This isn't a job for the meek. The next coach is going to have to wear a few hats to make it really work.
Young players are often labeled as difficult to coach, but they can thrive under discipline, especially when they understand the rationale and it translates to better play — and wins.
During the season, rookie 7-footer and top overall pick Deandre Ayton said the Suns needed to "practice how they want to play more."
"Coach emphasizes sacrifice, but teach us exactly what that means as young players," Ayton said after a loss Jan. 19 at Charlotte.
"What do we have to give up, or offer up? Tell us our roles. That's the main reason to know what to sacrifice. Explain it and we'll know what our sacrifices are and whoever don't do their job, confront them. Simple as that."
Phoenix's new coach can't have his players, especially the better ones like Ayton, wondering what they should do or how they should do it.
Coaches will always garner most of the blame for failure, but Phoenix's new coach has to, above all else, consistently make sure the players know what they're doing, why they're doing it and put them in the best situation to win, night in and night out.
It sounds easy, but it isn't. That's why it's so important for Phoenix to find "the right guy," as Jones puts it. If the Suns don't, they could very well be in this position again next year.
Suns stars Deandre Ayton, left, and Devin Booker are the core of a young group of players the organization hopes to build around.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump, still seething over a major firefighters union's endorsement of former Vice President Joe Biden, retweeted nearly five dozen tweets on Wednesday rebuffing Mr. Biden's claim to support from firefighters.
The 58 retweets before 6:30 a.m. ought to make the case that while the firefighters union's leadership supports Mr. Biden, many firefighters support Mr. Trump. While the retweets - which included a parody account - did not conclusively make that case, the spree belied Mr. Trump's public claims that he is not concerned about the prospect of facing Mr. Biden in the 2020 general election.
Mr. Biden responded during a campaign stop Wednesday in Iowa, joking that he expects to "be the object of [Mr. Trump's] attention for a while."
"I understand the president's been tweeting about me this morning for a while. I wonder why he's doing that?" Mr. Biden said.
Privately, Mr. Trump has worried for weeks about Mr. Biden's appeal to voters in the Rust Belt states that helped deliver the president's 2016 victory. In the first week of Mr. Biden's candidacy, Mr. Trump has failed to keep those concerns private.
Mr. Trump's tweets also marked the latest instance of the president rejecting the advice he has gotten in recent weeks: to avoid taking any top Democratic candidate on one-on-one at the risk of boosting their chances of securing the Democratic nomination.
The president's retweets highlighted support from people who claimed to know or be firefighters who support Mr. Trump, not Mr. Biden, despite the International Association of Fire Fighters' endorsement of Mr. Biden.
"I've done more for Firefighters than this dues sucking union will ever do, and I get paid ZERO!" Mr. Trump claimed early Wednesday morning, before diving into the five dozen retweets.
One account, whose author claimed their husband was a longtime New York firefighter and would be voting for Mr. Trump in 2020, changed its name to "F*** Donald Trump" after the president retweeted it. The author - who replaced the account's avatar of a woman with a "Bernie 2020" logo - then wrote, "What a great morning. In all seriousness, our president is an awful, hateful human being who wants nothing more than to keep the status quo and hatred prevalent in our country."
A CNN poll conducted by SSRS after Mr. Biden's announcement last week cemented his status as the Democratic front-runner, with 39% of voters who are Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents saying he is their top choice for the nomination.
Mr. Biden has highlighted his longstanding support for trade unions and his appeal to blue-collar workers across the country.
"I am a union man," Mr. Biden said during his first campaign rally, held in Pittsburgh's Lawrenceville neighborhood. He was flanked by members of the firefighters' union.

WOULD $3B FINE HURT FACEBOOK, BUT HELP PRIVACY ISSUES?

Texto completo: You've heard of too big to fail. Well, now there is too big to fine.
The Federal Trade Commission is expected to slap a fine on Facebook of $3 billion to $5 billion, according to the company's last earnings call. That's a lot of money to you and me. But it's peanuts to the Menlo Park, Calif., social media giant.
Facebook just posted revenue of $15 billion for the last quarter, ahead of Wall Street expectations. The company says it has set aside $3 billion for the fine, roughly 6% of its cash and marketable securities on hand.
Much of that revenue is from selling ads to companies that, with its users' personal data, can be targeted at those most receptive.
Apparently users don't care that their own data is being used to target them or don't have a problem with trading privacy for free services. Facebook added 48 million daily active users in the first quarter to hit 1.449 billion, up 3.42%.
Facebook's stock was up more than 8% in after-hours trading after the social media company announced the allocation for the FTC fine.
The FTC's probe has sought to determine if Facebook's entanglement with political consultants Cambridge Analytica and other actions violated a 2011 agreement with the U.S. government to improve its privacy practices, according to the Washington Post.
The fine would be the largest privacy fine levied in the U.S. The next largest was levied on Google in 2012, when the Mountain View, Calif., company had to pay $22.5 million to settle charges that it misrepresented to users of Apple's Safari Internet browser that it would not place tracking "cookies" or serve targeted ads to those users.
In Europe, regulators have been more active, slapping Google and other U.S. firms with major fines. Google now owes almost $10 billion in such penalties for alleged anti-competitive behavior. EU watchdogs also hit Apple with a back-taxes bill of more than $15 billion.
Fines in the U.S. are not levied because of specific privacy law. The U.S. has no nationwide privacy law, although a proposed one has been floating around Congress. Every day it is not acted on leaves the horse out of the barn longer.
The FTC fine could come with new restrictions on how Facebook collects or uses data, the Verge reported.
"At the core of these hypothetical arguments is the large question of not only how to regulate Facebook but of how to conceptualize an entity that operates largely without meaningful competitors and collects troves of information on more than two billion human beings," wrote Charlie Warzel in The New York Times.

Testimony puts Trump's actions in best light, despite probe's findings

Texto completo: It was one of the most dramatic cases of potential obstruction of justice laid out by federal investigators: President Trump directing the top White House lawyer to seek the removal of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III - and then later pushing him to deny the episode.
But Attorney General William P. Barr on Wednesday played down evidence that Trump sought to fire the head of the investigation bearing down on him, emphasizing in testimony before a Senate committee that the president may have had valid reasons for his actions.
It was a surprise recasting of the account of then-White House counsel Donald McGahn, who told investigators that Trump called him twice in June 2017 at home, pressuring him to intervene with the Justice Department to try to get Mueller removed. McGahn told federal investigators that he planned to resign rather than comply. And he said he later refused a demand by Trump that he write a letter denying news accounts of the episode.
In Barr's telling, however, Trump may have merely been trying to correct media reports he believed were inaccurate. He cited the president's public explanations of his behavior - even though the president refused to provide testimony about it under oath. And he discounted as weak the case that Trump's actions were part of a criminal effort to thwart a federal investigation - despite the fact that Mueller said in his report that "substantial evidence" indicated the president was acting to prevent scrutiny of his conduct in the obstruction inquiry.
"It would be difficult for the government to prove that beyond a reasonable doubt," Barr said of the idea that Trump was trying to get McGahn to create a fraudulent record to fend off prosecutors. "There are very plausible alternative explanations."
In a day of sometimes prickly testimony, the focus on Barr's view of the McGahn episode provided the most revealing look yet at Barr's rationale for determining there was not sufficient evidence to charge Trump with trying to thwart the probe.
Over and over again, the attorney general expressed skepticism about the evidence laid out in the special counsel report, which detailed 10 episodes of possible obstruction by the president. In four cases, Mueller cited "substantial" evidence to support charges.
The special counsel declined to offer an assessment of whether Trump's actions amounted to a crime. But at the end of his 448-page report, Mueller pointedly wrote, "If we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state."
Mueller had conservatively hewed to a Justice Department opinion that says a sitting president cannot be prosecuted, determining that such a decision meant he also could not accuse Trump of criminal conduct. But legal experts said that the evidence detailed in the special counsel report would normally warrant bringing charges.
Jessica Levinson, professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, said Barr's dismissal of strong evidence of obstruction in the McGahn episodes "strains common sense" and raises concerns that he is acting in bad faith.
"For the attorney general to say, 'There's no there there,' is entirely consistent with what he's been saying, but it is against the explicit findings of the Mueller report," Levinson said.
McGahn's lawyer, William Burck, declined to comment.
Democrats accused Barr of playing down Mueller's findings and serving as the president's protector.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), a former prosecutor, was among those on the Senate Judiciary Committee who questioned the attorney general's conclusion that there was no obstruction-of-justice case against the president.
"You look at the totality of the evidence," she said. "That's what I learned when I was in law school."
"There's ample evidence on the other side of the ledger," Barr countered later.
He repeatedly said to the committee that because Trump had the constitutional authority to fire Mueller, proving he was driven by a motive to block the investigation is incredibly difficult.
"In this kind of situation, where you have a facially innocent act that's authorized by the Constitution, it's hard to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that it's corrupt," Barr said.
The attorney general also repeatedly emphasized evidence and legal theories that put the president in the best light.
He suggested that Trump had not actually directed McGahn to seek Mueller's removal when the president urged him to call Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein and tell him the special counsel had conflicts of interest that should prevent him from serving. McGahn told investigators that he recalled the president saying at one point, "Mueller has to go," and "Call me back when you do it."
But Barr said Trump might have been merely passing along a concern.
"The president later said that what he meant was that the conflict of interest should be raised with Rosenstein, but the decision should be left with Rosenstein," Barr said.
And even if Trump had wanted Mueller removed because of conflicts, Barr said, that wasn't criminal. It would have led to naming a new special counsel, not the end of the investigation.
Democratic senators reacted incredulously.
Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) complained that Barr was trying to stage some complicated "Kabuki dance" to distract from the copious evidence that Trump's instructions to McGahn rose to the level of criminal conduct.
"I think the president's intent was very clear. He wanted this to end," Durbin said of the Russia investigation. "Over and over again, this president was very explicit."
Mueller's report notes that Trump's calls to McGahn in June 2017 were part of an ongoing effort to get rid of the special counsel.
"McGahn spoke with the President twice and understood the directive the same way both times, making it unlikely that he misheard or misinterpreted the President's request," the special counsel wrote, describing the former White House counsel as a credible witness with no motive to lie.
After the New York Times published a story in February 2018 saying Trump ordered McGahn to fire Mueller, the president told McGahn he needed to write a letter denying the stories, according to the report.
In a tense Oval Office meeting, McGahn stood his ground.
"Did I say the word 'fire?' " Trump asked McGahn, according to the report.
"What you said is, 'Call Rod [Rosenstein], tell Rod that Mueller has conflicts and can't be the Special Counsel,' " McGahn responded.
"I never said that," Trump said.
Barr told the Senate panel Wednesday that "it could also have been the case that . . . he was primarily concerned about press reports and making it clear that he never outright directed the firing of Mueller." He said that Trump may have had a valid reason to press about Mueller's potential conflicts of interest.
But the special counsel's report noted that very concern had been shared days earlier with Justice Department officials by the president's personal attorney.
Levinson, the law professor, said McGahn's account, told to investigators under penalty of false statements, is the one to credit.
"This is not a he-said, he-said between equal narrators," she said.
Barr did not mention another factor that the Mueller team believed negated the theory that Trump was worried only about the bad press. The president persisted in trying to get McGahn to create a written record but was not making an effort to seek a correction in the Times story, the report said.
"The evidence . . . indicates the President was not focused solely on a press strategy, but instead likely contemplated the ongoing investigation and any proceedings arising from it," the report said.
Barr also sought to give Trump the benefit of the doubt in his request that McGahn deny he sought Mueller's removal, saying the president may have genuinely believed the account was false.
"I think it would be plausible that the purpose of McGahn memorializing what the president was asking was to make the record that the president never directed him to fire [Mueller]," Barr said.
The attorney general cited another potential explanation for the president's actions: Trump, he said, had been "falsely accused" of conspiring with Russia through his campaign. It wouldn't be a crime to seek to replace an independent counsel if Trump "felt that this investigation was unfair, propelled by his political opponents and was hampering his ability to govern."

Texto completo: Berkeley chef-author Samin Nosrat and Los Gatos-based Netflix were the Bay Area's big winners at the 2019 James Beard Foundation Awards for media and cookbooks.
Their docu-series, "Salt Fat Acid Heat," won honors for television program shot on location.
Based on Nosrat's best-selling, James Beard Award-winning book of the same title, the Netflix series presented a guide to the basic elements of good cooking in travelogue fashion.
Nosrat traveled to home kitchens in Italy, the southern islands of Japan, the Yucatán and back to Berkeley's acclaimed Chez Panisse restaurant where she started her culinary career to demystify and explore the central principles of what makes food delicious.
Her backstory is unusual in that she never went to culinary school or intended to work at Chez Panisse. In 1997, Nosrat, then a student atUC Berkeley, saved up for months to have a meal at Chez Panisse. It turned out to be a life-changing experience. Not long after, she wrote a letter to owner Alice Waters detailing her thoughts on the meal and asking for a job. She began working there, busing tables and later working in the kitchen, the day after her interview.
Twenty years later, she won the cookbook award.
The three biggest awards of the night, announced in New York City, went to Marcus Samuelsson the "No Passport Required" chef whose personal journey has taken him from Ethiopia to Sweden to Harlem for personality of the year; The New York Times for publication of the year; and "Cocktail Codex" for book of the year.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein submitted his resignation Monday, ending a two-year run defined by his appointment of a special counsel to investigate connections between Donald Trump's presidential campaign and Russia. His last day will be May 11.
Rosenstein's departure had been expected following the confirmation of William Barr as attorney general. The White House nominated a replacement for the department's No. 2 slot weeks ago.
In his resignation letter to Trump, Rosenstein paid tribute to Trump, even praising the president's sense of humor, despite being the subject of some of Trump's most biting jabs. Trump once retweeted an image that showed Rosenstein and other officials jailed for treason.
Rosenstein intended to leave around mid-March but stayed on for the completion of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. Mueller last month submitted his report to the Justice Department, and Rosenstein was part of a small group of department officials who reviewed the document and helped shape its public release. After Mueller didn't reach a conclusion on whether Trump had obstructed the investigation, Barr and Rosenstein stepped in and determined the evidence wasn't enough to support such an allegation.
Rosenstein appointed Mueller in May 2017 following the recusal of then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions and oversaw much of his work. His exit leaves the department without the official most closely aligned with the probe as officials grapple with public and congressional scrutiny of the special counsel's findings and the department's handling of the report.
He not only supervised Mueller's work for much of the last two years but also defended the investigation against attacks from congressional Republicans and Trump, who has blasted the probe as a "witch hunt. In so doing, Rosenstein sometimes found himself at odds with Trump. He was nonetheless spared the brunt of anger directed at Sessions, whose recusal from the Russia investigation infuriated the president, leading to his forced resignation last November.
As deputy, Rosenstein was a central character in some of the most consequential, even chaotic, moments of the Trump administration. He wrote a memo criticizing James Comey that the White House used as justification for the firing of the FBI director, then a week later appointed Mueller to investigate the Trump campaign's ties to Russia. That investigation swiftly grew to include whether the firing of Comey constituted obstruction of justice.
Integral to the start of the investigation, Rosenstein was also present for the very end, standing silently on stage behind Barr two weeks ago when the attorney general cleared the president of obstruction, praised the president's cooperation with the investigation and maintained several times that there had been no collusion between the campaign and Russia.
In his resignation letter, Rosenstein said most deputies stay in their post for about 16 months; Rosenstein will have served about two years.
"I am grateful to you for the opportunity to serve; for the courtesy and humor you often display in our personal conversations; and for the goals you set in your inaugural address: patriotism, unity, safety, education, and prosperity, because a nation exists to serve its citizens,' Rosenstein wrote.
The deputy attorney general position is a hugely significant job, responsible for overseeing the daily operations of the Justice Department and the work of United States attorneys across the country. Trump has nominated Deputy Transportation Secretary Jeffrey Rosen as Rosenstein's replacement.
Though Rosenstein's exit was orderly, his relationship with the president had waffled over time. His job status appeared perilous last September following news reports that he had discussed secretly recording Trump and invoking a constitutional amendment to remove him from office. He hung on for several more months and appeared to turn the page, at least publicly, after a private meeting with Trump aboard Air Force One.
Rosenstein appointed Mueller after Sessions, who ordinarily would have overseen the investigation, recused himself in March 2017 because of his close involvement in the Trump campaign. The appointment came one week after Trump fired Comey, an action Rosenstein laid the groundwork for by writing a memo that sharply criticized Comey's handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation.
The White House initially cited the memo as justification for the firing, but Trump has said he was thinking of "this Russia thing when he fired Comey.
Over the next two years, with Sessions recused from the Russia investigation, Rosenstein set the boundaries of Mueller's investigation, approved investigative steps and, in place of the rarely seen special counsel, twice announced criminal indictments from the Justice Department podium against Russians accused of election interference.
The investigation overshadowed the rest of Rosenstein's work even as he joined Sessions in talking up the president's agenda, including announcements on combating violent crime and opioid addiction.
Rosenstein endured in the job beyond Sessions, but there were moments when his position appeared in the balance.
Trump lamented to The New York Times in July 2017 that "there are very few Republicans in Baltimore, a reference to Rosenstein's prior job as the U.S. attorney in Maryland. Rosenstein was appointed to that position by Republican President George W. Bush and remained for the entire Obama administration.
That same summer, Trump tweeted: "I am being investigated for firing the FBI Director by the man who told me to fire the FBI Director! Witch Hunt.
Trump lashed out the following April after the FBI raided the office of his former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, and months later retweeted the image that showed Rosenstein, Comey and other investigators behind bars.
In September, The New York Times reported that after Comey's firing, Rosenstein and other top law enforcement officials had discussed secretly recording the president to expose chaos inside the White House and invoking the 25th Amendment, which allows the Cabinet to seek the removal of a president deemed unfit for office.
The Justice Department issued statements challenging the reporting, but former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe - who was in the room - has said he got the sense that Rosenstein was "counting votes about which Cabinet members he could enlist in the effort.
Rosenstein arrived at the White House days after the reporting expecting to be fired, but he was instead allowed to stay on after private conversations with Trump's then-chief of staff, John Kelly, and the president himself.

Mueller imperative: Defending elections must be top priority

Texto completo: For all the noise over the Mueller report, we’re hearing disturbingly little about what may be its most urgent subject: the serious and continuing threat posed by Russian interference in U.S. civic life.
Americans have spent a lot of energy and ink putting forth wildly opposite views of what the report tells us about Donald Trump and his presidency. In The Dispatch’s view, it confirms deeply unethical behavior by the president that should be addressed by Congress.
But that’s a political fight and not our focus here.
The report’s findings are stunning. Many facts and incidents had been reported earlier by journalists, but their confirmation by the investigation of special counsel Robert Mueller should make resisting that interference a top national priority.
The 2016 intrusion probably wasn’t the beginning and certainly wasn’t the end of sophisticated cyber-interference. And Russia likely is not the only foreign power interested in trying to butt in.
Now that Russia’s 2016 effort against the U.S. — “sweeping and systematic,” in Mueller’s words — has shown how easy it is to deceive and manipulate social-media users on a mass scale, more disreputable regimes will give it a try.
From this point on, the constitutional and cultural safeguards that long have made U.S. elections trustworthy won’t be enough. Ensuring a fair and valid result will require a robust defensive effort with at least three fronts: detecting and blocking disinformation; protecting election systems from hacking; and — probably the hardest one — learning to consume information more carefully.
Those undertaking defense of our democracy shouldn’t expect much help from Trump or his inner circle. His son-in-law Jared Kushner publicly characterized the massive Russian campaign — involving the military and a private troll farm with more than 1,000 employees — as “a couple Facebook ads,” and he declared the Mueller investigation itself “way more harmful” to the country.
And a New York Times story detailed the Trump White House’s actual discouragement of those in his administration who have tried to sound the alarm.
To many, former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen is infamous for backing Trump’s policy of separating migrant children from their parents at the Mexican border. But according to four senior officials who spoke to The Times anonymously, Nielsen fought hard to set up a government-wide strategy to defend the 2020 presidential election against Russian interference.
She was shut down repeatedly because Trump doesn’t want to hear about it.
White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney reportedly told Nielsen that, in Trump’s eyes, expressing concern about Russian interference is the same as questioning the legitimacy of his election — a recklessly self-centered view but unfortunately not surprising.
While government intelligence agencies have warned repeatedly of the danger posed by sophisticated foreign disinformation campaigns, Trump has done little to put presidential muscle behind a defense.
If that doesn’t change, then Congress should take the lead on this issue, too. And while House-majority Democrats likely will work without bipartisan cooperation to address Trump’s efforts to obstruct the Mueller investigation, we hope patriotic Republicans will join them on the matter of fighting foreign election interference.
To protect votes once they’ve been cast, the nation’s best cybersecurity minds should be put to work ensuring that state and local voting systems are invulnerable to hacking.
As 2020 approaches, Americans need to retake control of our own national political conversation. And we need help from national leadership to do it.

Texto completo: The conservative media world, along with all but a few Republican members of Congress, are in the process of handing Vladimir Putin his greatest victory yet. They are ignoring the copious evidence in the Mueller report that Russia interfered in our election -- and continues to do so. Pace Jared Kushner, it was a whole lot more sinister than a "couple of Facebook ads."
The narrative has now taken hold that the Mueller investigation originated with the Steele dossier. On Fox News, Ed Henry said that the FBI relied on the dossier to "get this whole thing going." Breitbart referred to the debunked "Russia hoax," and a Wall Street Journal editorial demanded to know how "the partisan propaganda known as the Steele dossier become the basis for an unprecedented FBI probe of a presidential campaign ..."
As the Mueller report makes clear, and as even the infamous "Nunes memo" of 2018 conceded, the investigation did not begin with the dossier. It began when a foreign government (believed to be Australia) "informed the FBI about its May 2016 interaction with (George) Papadopoulos and his statement that the Russian government could assist the Trump Campaign."
Sixteen members of the Trump campaign had direct ties with Russians or Russian agents, including President Donald Trump. Some of these were benign. Some were not. Paul Manafort was sharing polling information and plans for winning midwestern states with Konstantin Kilimnik, who has ties to Russian intelligence. Is it the received Republican wisdom now that this was not, at the very least, eyebrow raising?
As for Trump's connections to Russia, we now know that they existed throughout most of the campaign, even as he was issuing tweets like this one on July 26, 2016: "For the record, I had ZERO investments in Russia." And saying that it was crazy to suggest that Russia was "dealing with Trump." In fact, he had been negotiating one of his largest real estate projects ever, for a Trump Tower Moscow, until just the previous month.
But even if the investigation had begun with the Steele dossier, so what? As they say in legal circles: res ipsa loquitur -- "the thing speaks for itself." The Mueller report is sober and meticulous. The dossier is hardly mentioned. If Republican partisans skip over the documentation of Russian meddling because they've internalized Trump's sense of grievance, they are disserving the nation.
The Russian interference was and is far more extensive than a few Facebook and Twitter posts, though those were noxious enough. The IRA (Internet Research Agency), an arm of the Russian intelligence services, along with the GRU (Russia's foreign intelligence service), also organized "dozens" of actual rallies, hacked into the computers of the Democratic Party, maliciously spread falsehoods, stoked already existing divisions between Americans of different races and ethnicities and planted malware. More worrying, the report notes that the Russians aimed at actual voting infrastructure:
"Victims included U.S. state and local entities, such as state boards of elections, secretaries of state, and county governments, as well as individuals who worked for those entities. The GRU also targeted private technology firms responsible for manufacturing and administering election-related software and hardware, such as voter registration software and electronic polling stations.
"In August 2016, GRU officers targeted employees of (redacted), a voting technology company that developed software used by numerous U.S. counties to manage voter rolls ..."
The independent counsel did not further investigate these attempts to subvert elections because the "Office understands that the FBI, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and the states have separately investigated that activity."
Or perhaps not. According to The New York Times, former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen wanted to make blocking Russian interference in the 2020 election a top priority. She was warned off by Trump's chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, who made it clear that the president still regards any mention of Russia as a personal slight.
In a continuation of patterns established under communism, Russia has exerted malign influence on elections in many nations. Throughout the democratic world, they seek to sow the kind of division and distrust they enjoy in mother Russia. Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Ukraine, Hungary and other former Soviet captives have been particularly hard hit, but the Russians have also stirred the pot of Catalan succession in Spain, boosted Marine Le Pen in France, and helped Brexit in Great Britain. In 2017, the Netherlands switched to all paper ballots to prevent Russia from hacking its election.
What is the difference between other democracies and the U.S.? Only here does dismissing the threat of Russian interference now equate with loyalty to the president.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein submitted his resignation Monday, ending a two-year run defined by his appointment of a special counsel to investigate connections between Donald Trump's presidential campaign and Russia. His last day will be May 11.

Rosenstein's departure had been expected following the confirmation of William Barr as attorney general. The White House nominated a replacement for the department's No. 2 slot weeks ago.

In his resignation letter to Trump, Rosenstein paid tribute to Trump, even praising the president's sense of humor, despite being the subject of some of Trump's most biting jabs. Trump once retweeted an image that showed Rosenstein and other officials jailed for treason.

Rosenstein intended to leave around mid-March but stayed on for the completion of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. Mueller last month submitted his report to the Justice Department, and Rosenstein was part of a small group of department officials who reviewed the document and helped shape its public release. After Mueller didn't reach a conclusion on whether Trump had obstructed the investigation, Barr and Rosenstein stepped in and determined the evidence wasn't enough to support such an allegation.

Rosenstein appointed Mueller in May 2017 following the recusal of then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions and oversaw much of his work. His exit leaves the department without the official most closely aligned with the probe as officials grapple with public and congressional scrutiny of the special counsel's findings and the department's handling of the report.

He not only supervised Mueller's work for much of the last two years but also defended the investigation against attacks from congressional Republicans and Trump, who has blasted the probe as a "witch hunt." In so doing, Rosenstein sometimes found himself at odds with Trump. He was nonetheless spared the brunt of anger directed at Sessions, whose recusal from the Russia investigation infuriated the president, leading to his forced resignation last November.

As deputy, Rosenstein was a central character in some of the most consequential, even chaotic, moments of the Trump administration. He wrote a memo criticizing James Comey that the White House used as justification for the firing of the FBI director, then a week later appointed Mueller to investigate the Trump campaign's ties to Russia. That investigation swiftly grew to include whether the firing of Comey constituted obstruction of justice.

Integral to the start of the investigation, Rosenstein was also present for the very end, standing silently on stage behind Barr two weeks ago when the attorney general cleared the president of obstruction, praised the president's cooperation with the investigation and maintained several times that there had been no collusion between the campaign and Russia.

In his resignation letter, Rosenstein said most deputies stay in their post for about 16 months; Rosenstein will have served about two years.

"I am grateful to you for the opportunity to serve; for the courtesy and humor you often display in our personal conversations; and for the goals you set in your inaugural address: patriotism, unity, safety, education, and prosperity, because ‘a nation exists to serve its citizens,'" Rosenstein wrote.

The deputy attorney general position is a hugely significant job, responsible for overseeing the daily operations of the Justice Department and the work of United States attorneys across the country. Trump has nominated Deputy Transportation Secretary Jeffrey Rosen as Rosenstein's replacement.

Though Rosenstein's exit was orderly, his relationship with the president had waffled over time. His job status appeared perilous last September following news reports that he had discussed secretly recording Trump and invoking a constitutional amendment to remove him from office. He hung on for several more months and appeared to turn the page, at least publicly, after a private meeting with Trump aboard Air Force One.

Rosenstein appointed Mueller after Sessions, who ordinarily would have overseen the investigation, recused himself in March 2017 because of his close involvement in the Trump campaign. The appointment came one week after Trump fired Comey, an action Rosenstein laid the groundwork for by writing a memo that sharply criticized Comey's handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation.

The White House initially cited the memo as justification for the firing, but Trump has said he was thinking of "this Russia thing" when he fired Comey.

Over the next two years, with Sessions recused from the Russia investigation, Rosenstein set the boundaries of Mueller's investigation, approved investigative steps and, in place of the rarely seen special counsel, twice announced criminal indictments from the Justice Department podium against Russians accused of election interference.

The investigation overshadowed the rest of Rosenstein's work even as he joined Sessions in talking up the president's agenda, including announcements on combating violent crime and opioid addiction.

Rosenstein endured in the job beyond Sessions, but there were moments when his position appeared in the balance.

Trump lamented to The New York Times in July 2017 that "there are very few Republicans in Baltimore," a reference to Rosenstein's prior job as the U.S. attorney in Maryland. Rosenstein was appointed to that position by Republican President George W. Bush and remained for the entire Obama administration.

That same summer, Trump tweeted: "I am being investigated for firing the FBI Director by the man who told me to fire the FBI Director! Witch Hunt"

Trump lashed out the following April after the FBI raided the office of his former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, and months later retweeted the image that showed Rosenstein, Comey and other investigators behind bars.

In September, The New York Times reported that after Comey's firing, Rosenstein and other top law enforcement officials had discussed secretly recording the president to expose chaos inside the White House and invoking the 25th Amendment, which allows the Cabinet to seek the removal of a president deemed unfit for office.

The Justice Department issued statements challenging the reporting, but former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe -- who was in the room -- has said he got the sense that Rosenstein was "counting votes" about which Cabinet members he could enlist in the effort.

Rosenstein arrived at the White House days after the reporting expecting to be fired, but he was instead allowed to stay on after private conversations with Trump's then-chief of staff, John Kelly, and the president himself.

Lab Coat Can Host Dangerous Bacteria

Texto completo: A recent study of patients at 10 academic hospitals in the United States found that just over half care about what their doctors wear, most of them preferring the traditional white coat.
Some doctors prefer the white coat, too, viewing it as a defining symbol of the profession.
What many might not realize, though, is that health care workers' attire -- including that seemingly "clean" white coat that many prefer -- can harbor dangerous bacteria and pathogens.
A systematic review of studies found that white coats are frequently contaminated with strains of harmful and sometimes drug-resistant bacteria associated with hospital-acquired infections. As many as 16 percent of white coats tested positive for MRSA, and up to 42 percent for the bacterial class Gram-negative rods.
Both types of bacteria can cause serious problems, including skin and bloodstream infections, sepsis and pneumonia.
It isn't just white coats that can be problematic. The review also found that stethoscopes, phones and tablets can be contaminated with harmful bacteria. One study of orthopedic surgeons showed a 45 percent match between the species of bacteria found on their ties and in the wounds of patients they had treated. Nurses' uniforms have also been found to be contaminated.
Among possible remedies, antimicrobial textiles can help reduce the presence of certain kinds of bacteria, according to a randomized study. Daily laundering of health care workers' attire can help somewhat, though studies show that bacteria can contaminate them within hours.
Several studies of American physicians found that a majority go more than a week before washing white coats. Seventeen percent go more than a month. Several London-focused studies had similar findings pertaining both to coats and ties.
A randomized trial published last year tested whether wearing short- or- long-sleeved white coats made a difference in the transmission of pathogens. Consistent with previous work, the study found short sleeves led to lower rates of transmission of viral D.N.A. It may be easier to keep hands and wrists clean when they're not in contact with sleeves, which themselves can easily brush against other contaminated objects. For this reason, the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America suggests clinicians consider an approach of "bare below the elbows."
With the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer -- often more effective and convenient than soap and water -- it's far easier to keep hands clean than clothing.
But the placement of alcohol-based hand sanitizer for health workers isn't as convenient as it could be, reducing its use. The reason? In the early 2000s, fire marshals began requiring hospitals to remove or relocate dispensers because hand sanitizers contain at least 60 percent alcohol, making them flammable.
Fire codes now limit where they can be placed -- a minimum distance from electrical outlets, for example -- or how much can be kept on site.
Hand sanitizers are most often used in hallways, though greater use closer to patients (like immediately before or after touching a patient) could be more effective.
One creative team of researchers studied what would happen if dispensers were hung over patients' beds on a trapeze-bar apparatus. This put the sanitizer in obvious, plain view as clinicians tended to patients. The result? Over 50 percent more hand sanitizer was used.
Although there have been fires in hospitals traced to alcohol-based hand sanitizer, they are rare. Across nearly 800 American health care facilities that used alcohol-based hand sanitizer, one study found, no fires had occurred. The World Health Organization puts the fire risk of hand sanitizers as "very low."
An article in The New York Times 10 years ago said the American Medical Association, concerned about bacteria transmission, was studying a proposal "that doctors hang up their lab coats -- for good." Maybe one reason the idea hasn't taken hold in the past decade is reflected in a doctor's comment in the article that "the coat is part of what defines me, and I couldn't function without it."
It's a powerful symbol. But maybe tradition doesn't have to be abandoned, just modified. Combining bare-below-the-elbows white attire, more frequently washed, and with more conveniently placed hand sanitizers -- including wearable sanitizer dispensers -- could help reduce the spread of harmful bacteria.
Until these ideas or others are fully rolled out, one thing we can all do right now is ask our doctors about hand sanitizing before they make physical contact with us (including handshakes). A little reminder could go a long way.

Texto completo: E.J. Dionne Jr.'s superb 25 April op-ed, "Where are our impartial guardians?," was a sobering reminder of the diminution of the Supreme Court as the final independent authority concerning our laws and the Constitution. The justices' relatively recent acquiescence to the positions of the party that nominated them brings into question its objectivity and impartiality.
As I look back on my life, I take great comfort, even pride, in Supreme Court decisions on controversial cases such as Brown v. Board of Education (1954), New York Times Co. v. Sullivan (1964) and Loving v. Virginia (1967). All were unanimous - 9-to-0 - decisions reflecting not only fundamental interpretations of the law but also, and more important, our Constitution's guiding principles and values.
On the other hand, decisions such as Bush v. Gore (2000) and Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (2010), both 5-to-4 decisions, were recognized by many as driven by politically partisan views.
As Mr. Dionne correctly pointed out, it appears that the Supreme Court is willing to do the same in the case involving the 2020 Census. The current environment in the Supreme Court results in, at best, a perceived lack of objectivity and, at worst, the demise of the Supreme Court's aura of impartiality, calling into question the court's credibility.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump started a recent morning with a pair of angry tweets at The New York Times, demanding that his hometown paper "get down on their knees & beg for forgiveness" over its coverage of the Russia probe. "They are truly the Enemy of the People!" he wrote in his latest withering attack on the free press.
But by midday, the president was hobnobbing in the Oval Office with a group of White House news photographers, signing their photos of him and joking that they should hold a fundraiser at his golf course. Trump kept some of the prints and returned others with such praise as "Fantastic Job!" and "Amazing Talent!" in his distinctive handwriting. He chatted with Doug Mills, The Times' lead White House photographer.
The president's participation, for the third year in a row, in a private reception to celebrate the winners of the White House News Photographers Association's annual awards reflected a sharp dichotomy in how the former reality television star views the pack of correspondents that covers his every public move.
Although Trump has waged rhetorical war on newspaper writers and cable television correspondents, he has been more appreciative of the photographers who produce two-dimensional images the visually minded president has often admired.
Trump has been so taken with photos of himself published in newspapers that aides have requested high-quality prints on his behalf, and the president has retweeted images from photojournalists on social media.
"It seems like he does appreciate the photographers when we go in there," said WHNPA President Whitney Shefte, a Washington Post multimedia journalist who, along with Post photographer Jabin Botsford, were among those honored at the reception. "Last year, he said something like, 'You do great work.' It's a very different message than what he says publicly."
The WHNPA has been meeting with presidents since, at least, the administration of Harry Truman, who was named honorary president of the "One More Club," a moniker that referred to their insistence on constantly yelling out for another photo. The organization is independent from the White House Correspondents' Association, which hosts the annual fundraising dinner that Trump has boycotted since taking office.
WHCA President Olivier Knox, the chief Washington correspondent for SiriusXM, said past presidents, like Trump, have generally displayed a greater affinity for news photographers than writers or television pundits because they are viewed as less threatening.
While all presidents have been mindful of their image, Trump - whose private charity spent $30,000 on two portraits of him and whose golf resorts displayed a fake Time magazine cover bearing his visage - is perhaps the most hyper-attuned to the cameras.
During a luncheon at his first high-stakes summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore last summer, Trump jokingly instructed photojournalists to make the two leaders "look nice and handsome and thin."
Trump's tone is perhaps most striking in the way he has dealt with his hometown paper, The New York Times, which he has denounced as "failing" - even though the publication has thrived with more than 4 million total subscribers.
In early February, Trump jousted with the Times' publisher over the dangers posed by his hostility toward the press corps and complained that he felt entitled to "a great story" from the newspaper.
But by the end of that month, during a dinner with Kim at their second summit in Hanoi, Trump pointed at Mills, The Times photographer, and called him "one of the greatest photographers in the world."
That praise came after White House aides had attempted to bar newspaper and wire service writers from the photo op because they had shouted out questions at a prior event. The aides relented and allowed in one writer only after the photographers threatened to boycott coverage.
Some photographers have expressed a measure of satisfaction in the access they have to Trump. During Obama's tenure, the WHCA logged formal complaints over photojournalists being excluded from events that were open to official White House photographer Pete Souza, who has since published two books of his work.
Mills, a member of the WHCA board, said that Trump has offered more daily access, for longer sessions, than any president since he began covering the White House during the Reagan administration.
"For a photographer, you couldn't ask for anything better," Mills told the Lafayette (Indiana) Journal & Courier this month. Trump's official White House photographer, Shealah Craighead, has had a lower public profile than Souza.
WHNPA Vice President Jim Bourg, a photo editor at Reuters news service, also said that photographers see Trump more often than they did other presidents. But he added that access at campaign rallies has been more restrictive, and he noted that the president has declined to attend the annual WHNPA gala dinner the past two years.
The group, which also represents video journalists, has issued a critical statement over reports that the White House disseminated altered video of CNN's Jim Acosta after a contentious Trump news conference last fall, and it called on the president to temper his hostility toward the media after a BBC cameraman was assaulted by a Trump supporter at a rally in El Paso, Texas, in February.
But such criticism hasn't dissuaded Trump from asking for favors from the photographers. During a flight on Air Force One last August, a White House aide asked another New York Times photojournalist for a high-resolution print of a photo he had published of Trump boarding the presidential jet a day earlier amid a cloud of smoke from a ceremonial cannon in Fort Drum, N.Y.
The aide handed him a clipping of the newspaper on which Trump had underlined the photographer's name in black marker.

Texto completo: Vote to insure well-being of the country
My husband, Rev. Thomas N. Thomas, is gravely ill. Many of his friends, colleagues and former parishioners say, "What can I do?" This is what you can do: go out and vote on May 21.
Tom believes in the democratic process and was planning to be out knocking on doors. Do that job for him. Encourage people to go out and vote. Better yet, encourage people to be informed about issues and go out and vote for the candidate who best represents what they want for our future. Give respect to all candidates who run for office, and go out to vote on May 21.
Don't just do this for Rev. Thomas. Do this for yourself and for the future well-being of this nation.

Stephen Moore a bad choice for Federal Reserve board
President Trump wants Stephen Moore to have a seat on the board of governors of the Federal Reserve. Moore has been economist at the Heritage Foundation and regularly lectures on the right-wing circuit.
Over the past few years he has often enunciated positions on monetary policy and has a record characterized as "inconsistent with any set of economic principles, but reliably faithful to the short-term interest of the Republican Party," as The New York Times wrote on its opinion page. He subscribes to "an economic theory that says we must heap more on the platters of the rich, for only so will more crumbs fall to the poor," as William Sloan Coffin wrote.
He is often wrong. He predicted George W. Bush's policies would produce an economic boom that never happened, Obama's policies would lead to runaway inflation which never happened and tax cuts in Kansas would produce a boost in the economy, which languished. During the Obama era, Moore complained interest rates were too low and with the Trump era with rates nearly the same, he complains they are too high.
Moore will, if confirmed, join Betsy DeVos, Wilbur Ross, Rick Perry, Larry Kudlow and other members of our kakistocracy (government of the worst).

Hellbender vote shows where politicians' priorities lie
I like to give credit where credit is due. Our state legislators took time out of their busy re-election campaigning to vote for our state's official amphibian, the hellbender.
Aren't these the type of issues we elected them to decide on?
The official state amphibian is far more important than things like school funding and property taxes. Keep up the good work.

Blame for offensive song goes beyond Kate Smith
Who do we blame for the performance of an offensive song?
Let's be fair and spread the blame accordingly. Someone wrote offensive lyrics; someone else published and promoted the songs. They were recorded and purchased by the general public.
Where do we start placing the blame? It goes well beyond Kate Smith.

Flyers should not have caved in to liberals about Kate Smith
One of the most popular songs of World War II was Kate Smith's "God Bless America." I was a young boy growing up during the war, and this song personified the whole reason we were fighting the Axis powers in a life and death struggle for liberty and justice for all.
Now some people have decided that a song from a 1931 Broadway musical satirical show was racist. So now Kate Smith was a racist and her songs have to be removed? How long do we have to put up with these claims that everything from the past was racist and has to be removed for our consciousness?
I am sick and tired of these liberals who grew up in a country of good and plenty finding fault with us senior citizens who won two world wars fighting for the freedoms that they enjoy today. Enough is enough.
And I am tired of organizations such as the Yankees and the Flyers caving in to the liberals. So I will never, ever patronize any of the products advertised by the players and their respective organizations.

Over protecting children sets them up for failure
At a recent event which I volunteered at, I had an opportunity to listen to kids and adults from the Lehigh Valley. Some of the conversations included things like bullying, football, safety equipment, home schooling, etc. The common thread in these discussions was not being able to deal with life and the protections that are needed for kids to help them cope.
Generations of Americans have been able to thrive without interference, intrusion, outside support, special equipment, special medications, etc. What I see is not letting kids fight their fights, not letting them get bumped around by life, we are setting them up for failure in the real world.
The over-protection of our children can have a negative outcome.
Let the kids learn about life by living it. Give them the opportunity to fail and make adjustments to get back on their feet. They can do it.

We should curb the influence of money in Congress
Like it or not, the current occupant of the White House is but a reflection of the frustration people have with their government. Congress has become little more than a debating society playing the blame game. The people's business is all too soon forgotten once the elections are over.
Big Money in the form of corporations and monied partisan donors dominate what does or does not get done in Congress. The answer to this dysfunction is not to be found in electing a stronger "king," it is to be found in correcting the fundamental flaws in our system. Until we find a way to curb the influence of money in our Congress, we can expect more of the same from a system that is out of balance and out of step with the people it is supposed to represent.
Perhaps it is time to revisit and strengthen the Constitution so that the legislative branch of government can once again function as designed by the founders? Until the people demand reform, we can expect more of the same political dysfunction that is ruining the country.

Texto completo: Imagine you're a war reporter. You go where the battle is, find out what's happening and write it up as accurately as possible. That's about half of my job description as a theater critic for The New York Times. Between 100 and 150 times a year, I head into the "war zone" that is the professional theater and report on what I find there. What was the conflict? Was the play a bomb?
But because theater is a uniquely live interaction, "what I find there" also means what I feel there. Critics are reporters not just of what happened but also of their own responses, trying to put into clear language how what they see affects them. Which means that, unlike war reporters, we aren't aiming for objectivity. Instead, we're delivering opinions about what's funny or smart or moving -- and what's not. Of course, you may love exactly what I hate, or vice versa, and we're both right! My goal with a well-written review is to be a reliable GPS device, helping people figure out whether a play or musical is up their alley.
To achieve that reliability, I try to be fair and informed. Theater critics in New York are invited to special performances called press previews, usually in the last few days before the official opening. That gives us a day or two to think and study. Before reviewing a new play, I'll read the script and try to learn about its author's intentions. For a revival of an old one, I'll hunt down earlier reviews. For a musical, I'll do either or both of the above, and listen to the songs if they're available. I'll also research the play's subject. Immigration? Gun violence? L.G.B.T. inclusion? I want to understand what the playwright and the production are trying to tell us in the context of our current world.
I love that part of the work. The part I don't love: Deciphering the notes I took in the dark. But sometimes those notes are the best record of the unfiltered truth. There's no denying a row of scrawled exclamation points. Or, underlined three times, "Will this ever end?"
It will, and if you're a critic, that's when the fun begins. ◊

Texto completo: "To Kill a Mockingbird," by Harper Lee, is a classic coming-of-age novel that is usually assigned in high school. But to my surprise, when I asked my teacher when we would be reading it, she said that it was now on the optional-reading list because of its controversial topics and vulgar language. In December, the story was brought to the Broadway stage. I was asked to review the play, so I read the book and even sat down with the New York Times theater critic Jesse Green to learn how to do my review justice.
The 1960 novel is narrated by a young girl whom everyone calls Scout. She and her brother, Jem, are raised by their father, Atticus, with the help of Calpurnia, a black woman who works in their home in Maycomb, Ala. Maycomb is small-minded, segregated and bigoted, like many Southern towns in the 1930s. The story focuses on a trial in which a black man's life is at stake: Tom Robinson has been falsely accused by a white woman of sexual assault. Atticus, a lawyer, works hard to defend the innocent man, but Robinson is convicted anyway by an all-white jury. Scout and Jem are sickened by this ordeal, and we witness their perspective on this troubling incident.
Entering the Shubert Theater, I was unsure of what to expect, but it became immediately clear that this play, written by Aaron Sorkin and directed by Bartlett Sher, wasn't a duplicate of the book but was instead a fresh take on its story. For the most part, I appreciated the modernizations, especially the live organ and guitar music that onstage musicians wove into the story, which added emotion and set the tone for different scenes.
But some changes left me conflicted. In "To Kill a Mockingbird," and most literature written by white authors around this time period, it was typical for black characters to be half-drawn -- used as props to help propel the story forward. The play more fully developed Calpurnia by giving her a larger speaking role and creating a deeper relationship with Atticus. (Onstage, they banter and tease each other. She even gets angry and yells at him.) But I wasn't sure if this was the right decision.
I understand the urge to update a racist and oppressive story, but in 2019, "To Kill a Mockingbird" has become its own historical artifact about racism -- and not just in the way Lee intended. As I read through the novel, I noticed not just the racism embedded in the plot but also how the book played into its own stereotypes. The book is all told through the author's lens, her midcentury way of looking at racism. That's part of what we're losing: When flipping through the pages, I often felt uncomfortable. But it was the good kind of uncomfortable, one I felt I could learn from. ◊

Oliver North steps down as National Rifle Association president amid power struggle

Texto completo: INDIANAPOLIS — Oliver North announced Saturday that he would not serve a second term as the National Rifle Association’s president, deciding to step down as the organization grappled with a bitter dispute over its future and its worst leadership crisis in decades.
He made the announcement as the NRA faced a challenge from New York Attorney General Letitia James, who had opened an investigation into the gun group’s tax-exempt status.
On Friday, James’ office sent letters instructing the NRA and affiliated entities, including its charitable foundation, to preserve relevant financial records. Some of the NRA’s related businesses also received subpoenas, according to people with knowledge of the inquiry. A lawyer for the NRA confirmed the investigation.
The move by James came amid a stunning internal power struggle that took a major turn Saturday when North, in a letter that was read on his behalf at the NRA’s convention, said he would not be renominated. He and insurgents in the NRA this past week had been trying to oust Wayne LaPierre, the group’s longtime chief executive.
“It was a great privilege to serve as your president this past year,” North said in the letter. He added that the NRA had “a clear crisis” that it needed to deal with “immediately and responsibly,” and that he had recently created a committee to investigate financial improprieties.
His move appeared to end the struggle against LaPierre, though it was likely that their dispute would be fully resolved at a board meeting Monday. Supporters of North spoke up during a contentious gathering after his statement, but LaPierre appeared to hold substantial support in the room.
Their standoff began Wednesday, when North urged LaPierre to resign. On Thursday, LaPierre sent a letter to the board in which he accused North of threatening to release damaging information about him and other executives if he refused to step down.
The shadow cast by James’ looming action had in some ways spurred the confrontation unfolding at the NRA’s annual convention.
Even before her election in 2018, James had promised to investigate the organization’s tax status, and had told Ebony magazine that the NRA held itself “out as a charitable organization” but was actually “a terrorist organization.”
She has special jurisdiction over the group because it was chartered in New York. Her office has broad authority to investigate nonprofits and can seek a number of potential remedies against them in court; a previous inquiry by James’ predecessors led to the shuttering of President Donald Trump’s charitable foundation, a far smaller enterprise.
“The NRA will fully cooperate with any inquiry into its finances,” said William Brewer, the NRA’s outside counsel, in a statement Saturday. “The NRA is prepared for this, and has full confidence in its accounting practices and commitment to good governance.”
James’ office declined to comment.
Brewer has assailed James in the past for threatening to investigate the NRA before she was elected, saying she was embarking on “a taxpayer-funded fishing expedition.”
But such warnings were taken seriously, and in August the NRA embarked on a review of its relationships with all of its contractors.
NRA officials, including LaPierre, have said that its most prominent contractor, the Oklahoma ad firm Ackerman McQueen, did not comply with its requests to turn over financial records, a contention that Ackerman has contested.
The dispute led the NRA to sue Ackerman this month, and the lawsuit is at the heart of the organization’s infighting. North is an employee of Ackerman and is paid “millions of dollars annually” by the company, LaPierre told the board Thursday night. North had sided with Ackerman in the legal battle, alarming some board members.
The legal fight has crippled a long-standing relationship between the NRA and Ackerman, two organizations that are tightly intertwined. Ackerman came up with memorable lines such as Charlton Heston’s proclamation that his gun would have to be pried “from my cold, dead hands.” Ackerman also developed NRATV, a controversial online streaming network that had aroused concerns among some board members for straying too far from gun rights. The network’s personalities warned of race wars and portrayed the talking trains in the children’s show “Thomas & Friends” in Ku Klux Klan hoods.
There are a number of potential issues that could arise in James’ inquiry. Earlier this year, the New York Times reported that the NRA’s affiliated charity, the NRA Foundation, had transferred more than $100 million since 2012 to the NRA, and that it also lent the NRA $5 million in 2017. Donations to the NRA Foundation are tax-deductible, while those to the NRA are not, and the transfers concerned some tax experts.
The Times also reported that the NRA had paid $18 million since 2010 to a company that produces “Under Wild Skies,” a hunting show on NRATV. Tyler Schropp, the NRA’s advancement director, had a stake in the production company until at least 2017; nonprofit rules require a cautious approach for transactions that benefit key executives.
North cited reporting by all three organizations as the impetus for actions he had recently taken, saying “these allegations of financial improprieties could threaten our nonprofit status.”
The Wall Street Journal has reported on multiple transactions benefiting firms with ties to NRA officials, while the New Yorker further scrutinized internal conflicts within the organization.
The latest developments come amid a variety of challenges for the NRA, including lagging contributions and an increasingly well-financed gun control movement, motivated by a string of mass shootings.
And the attorney general’s inquiry is not the only threat the gun group faces in New York. The NRA is already in a legal battle with the administration of Gov. Andrew Cuomo over insurance it offers to gun owners.
Speaking at the convention Saturday, LaPierre lashed out at Cuomo, saying he “hates the NRA and he hates our freedom.” He also asked how James’ description of the NRA as a “terrorist organization” made its members feel. The crowd answered with a cascade of boos.
Going back to the late 1970s, the NRA has had upheavals every couple of decades that have altered the organization’s trajectory. Board members see their meeting Monday as the latest such defining battle.
North, who was recently installed as president, was the central figure in the Reagan-era Iran-Contra controversy, in which senior officials in Reagan’s administration secretly facilitated the sale of weapons to Iran, then redirected some of that money to rebels fighting the socialist government in Nicaragua. North remains a hero to many on the right.
His announcement caught high-ranking members of the organization off guard. One member approached a reporter Saturday outside a ballroom where the group was meeting, and asked, “Can you tell me what’s going on?”

Texto completo: NASHVIILLE, Tenn. -- BrenÃ© Brown's books on shame, vulnerability and courage have given her A-list fans like Oprah and Melinda Gates and made her a go-to leadership consultant for both Pixar and the Seattle Seahawks.

But Brown, a research professor at the University of Houston's Graduate College of Social Work, thought she'd spend her career writing for other academics, not making the New York Times' best-seller list.

"My goal was to put it in peer-reviewed articles that no one would read but like five people and they would just read it to check to make sure they were quoted," Brown told The Associated Press from her home in Houston.

Five best-selling books later, Brown is debuting her first Netflix special, "BrenÃ© Brown: The Call to Courage," based off her two decades of research. The special is a bit of an experiment for the streaming service, whose categories Brown doesn't neatly fit into.

"Am I comedy? Documentary? True crime?" Brown joked.

Brown's skill as a writer and speaker is that she doesn't sound like a typical self-help or leadership expert who is shouting motivational speaker mantras. She has a researcher's mind for patterns and a storyteller's gift of language. She peppers her talks with plenty of Texas colloquialisms, like "There's nothing in the middle of the road but white stripes and dead armadillos." She tells personal anecdotes about her kids and her husband to illustrate her broader ideas about parenting, compassion, leadership and more.

"People will come up to me and say, ‘I already knew everything you said. I just didn't have the language to say it. I didn't know we were allowed to talk about it,'" said Brown. "And so I think I just put language around feelings and experiences and thoughts that we all have."

She can also curse like a true Southern lady, which is just enough to set people at ease and give them a laugh. "Not like Andrew Dice Clay," she said. "An appropriate amount of cursing."

In the special she talks about her 2010 speech on vulnerability that has become one of the most watched TED Talk speeches, now viewed about 39 million times. Her most recent book, "Dare to Lead: Brave Work. Tough Conversations. Whole Hearts," is a playbook for leading with empathy.

When asked about leadership qualities she hopes to see among candidates for the upcoming 2020 U.S. presidential election, Brown took a long pause.

"I am one-inch away from being completely disenchanted with politics but I'm holding on. I'm white-knuckling it right now," she said. "I need a political system where the people who make the decisions actually are required to live by them and are not in such an elite position where they make policy and laws and financial decisions that don't affect them."

The Netflix special is good timing for Brown, who has spent years traveling all over the country giving speeches to corporations, entrepreneurs, women's conferences and leadership training events.

Her youngest child is in middle school and she's moving into a period of her career where she's doing less of those speaking opportunities in order to be at home. But with Netflix, she has a chance to continue building on the conversations she started with her books.

"This opportunity from Netflix just felt like such a deeply important gift," Brown said. "This thing is going to drop in 190 countries."

Government shouldn't be raising minimum wage

Texto completo: After listening to politicians for decades, France now has a saying: "With enough ifs, we could put Paris in a bottle." Even if we elect geniuses, all geniuses are like everyone else at many things. It is when they come up with urgent schemes that they have very little knowledge of, or experience in, or proof of them working elsewhere, that we suffer negative consequences.
We get a negative effect from a cause created by being misinformed.
I've talked a bit about GovGuam's unfunded retirement fund liability — 24 years ago is was $1.3 billion and recent reports, after years of positive markets, it is still at $1.27 billion. The new hybrid retirement plan created an immediate $178 million of unfunded liability. See any senator proudly proclaiming they did that to the people?
Don't kid yourself, the politicians know how to fix the situation at GMH. Instead of robbing Peter to give to or protect Paul, they know there is only one way to fix it — to hire experienced management and get out of the way completely. Let them do what is necessary to run it like a real business, paying top dollar for the skill sets they need, to suffer the consequences of bad decisions and have experts on their board.
Cause and effect is about to come into play again as minimum wage is going to be discussed. Ask a simple question: If increasing minimum wage has no negative impact, why not make it $50 an hour? If there is no answer to this or they admit there will be negative impact, make them tell us what those effects are.
Then ask them why employers pay the majority of people more than minimum wage when they don't have to. See if they understand that the free market determines the most efficient wage based on productivity. They are hoping to pass an increase before they do the study, as the study will point out that we are in a labor market, wages are already going up because of our shortage of labor for the buildup.
Economist Donald Boudreaux explains in the New York Times: "Wages do not depend on what workers 'need,' wages depend on what they produce." An economy cannot pay $10 for $8 of production; it will go broke. Just as no physicist will claim water runs uphill, no self-respecting economist would claim higher minimum wages increases employment.
No one sees the job that is never created because of government fiat. We only see the obvious — higher wages for those working. And when the non-wage perks of the job go away because they must be replaced with higher wages, the worker has to pay for those benefits after first paying taxes on the additional income.
Politicians like to say the cost of living has gone up so workers need more income. Why not first ask what caused the increased cost of living. Could the reason be from power, sewer, water, garbage, fuel taxes, a huge real estate tax increase, to an increase in the GRT that they passed? As a famous person said, "We have met the enemy and it is us!"
Ask them: "Increasing the cost of wages, will it increase or decrease the number of Guamanians who want to start their own business? Will it perpetuate or decrease small business activity and make it better for large businesses?"
Breaking out of poverty is difficult for many people, and the evidence and logic is that minimum wage adds to that difficulty. Workers are fired, hours are cut, jobs are not created, non-wage perks, including insurance, free parking, free meals, and vacation days evaporate, annual bonuses shrink, prices rise (squeezing the little guy the most), big businesses gain an artificial competitive advantage over their smaller competitors, and crime rates rise. It is a bleak litany. It amounts to economic illiteracy.
These distortions are the byproduct of government intervening to raise wages. The head of the Detroit NAACP testified that "minimum wage increases and drug legalization will hold minorities in bondage." These issues and all our debt will suck the millennials dry. Give them a chance to stay on Guam.

A Rare Visit to Senegal

Texto completo: Putting a sardonic spin on a modern classic of misanthropy, the movie "Hyenas" transposes a dark comedy by the Swiss dramatist Friedrich Durrenmatt to rural Senegal. Specifically, it sets the play, known in English as "The Visit," in the dusty, drought-stricken town called Colobane after the birthplace of the film's multitalented director, Djibril Diop Mambéty (1945-98).
"Hyenas" -- which was made nearly two decades after Mambéty's first feature, the African new-wave landmark "Touki Bouki" -- was greeted with great anticipation when it was shown at the 1992 New York Film Festival. Largely unavailable since, it has been newly restored and is showing at Metrograph.
[Video: A preview of the film. Watch on YouTube.]
"The Visit," described by The New York Times as "a bold, grisly drama of negativism" when it opened on Broadway to great acclaim in 1958, concerned the revenge of a once-despised, now enormously rich woman. Returning to the impoverished town that cast her out some decades before, she offers to reward its inhabitants if they take the life of the man -- now a hapless, aging grocer -- who long ago seduced and abandoned her. The townspeople are initially indignant, but ...
Mambéty sticks close to the original while transforming the drama into a village folk play, interspersed with songs and dances. (The score, which mixes traditional music with Western movie motifs, is by his younger brother, the singer-songwriter Wasis Diop.) He cast nonactors in the film's two lead roles, with the lean and dignified Mansour Diouf as Dramaan Drameh, the chosen victim, and Ami Diakhate, discovered by Mambéty selling soup in a Dakar market, playing Linguère Ramatou, the old woman.
At once symbolic and concrete, the film is further punctuated by images of watchful animals -- "frequent shots of fiery-eyed hyenas restlessly stalking the outskirts of the town like evil spirits alert to the scent of decay," as Stephen Holden wrote in his New York Times review.
Durrenmatt's play is, among other things, a satire of bourgeois democracy. "Hyenas" evokes a more archaic form of governance. Although the film's ending, when Dramaan is put on trial, is reminiscent of Greek tragedy, the justice meted out observes local custom. The drama of "Hyenas" is given a specifically developing-world significance. Described as "richer than the World Bank," Linguère effectively seduces the villagers with consumer goods like air-conditioners, refrigerators and TVs.
Not just money but modernization is the bait. (In interviews, Mambéty suggested that Linguère is the grown version of the radical student Anta who leaves Africa for Europe in "Touki Bouki.") Not above such temptation, Mambéty pointedly casts himself in a small but significant role as a former judge who serves as Linguère's retainer. The final shot has an earth mover bulldozing a field outside the town.
Mambéty never made another feature, although he did leave a 45-minute short meant to be part of a larger trilogy. A bold and splashy homage to Dakar's street children, "The Little Girl Who Sold the Sun" (which can be streamed via Kanopy) is as affirmative as "Hyenas" is pessimistic.

Director's Family Fights for Control of His Affairs After Stroke

Texto completo: The family of John Singleton, the director, producer, and screenwriter best known for his 1991 film "Boyz N the Hood," is fighting for control of his business affairs after he suffered a stroke. His mother is seeking to be appointed his temporary conservator, and claims Mr. Singleton is in a coma, which several of his children dispute.
Mr. Singleton, 51, had a stroke on April 17 and was hospitalized in an intensive care unit. At the time, his family said in a statement he was under "great medical care."
A native of South Los Angeles, Mr. Singleton has directed more than 10 films and TV series, including the recent FX crime drama "Snowfall" starring Damson Idris. Mr. Singleton was nominated for an Oscar for best director for "Boyz N the Hood," his debut feature film. He has also directed classics like "Poetic Justice" and "Rosewood."
His mother, Shelia Ward, filed papers in court in Los Angeles on Thursday seeking to be named his conservator, or guardian. In the papers, Ms. Ward said her son was in a coma.
The papers say that at the time of the stroke, Mr. Singleton was engaged in several business deals and had been set to sign a lucrative settlement agreement on or around April 30. The documents say that if a conservator cannot sign the papers on his behalf, it will mean a big financial loss.
Ms. Ward requested to be named his conservator for now because her son had not signed any health care directive or power of attorney that would let someone make medical or financial decisions for him, the papers said. As is required in a conservatorship case, the papers included a declaration from a doctor attesting to Mr. Singleton's impaired state, though the declaration did not specify whether he was in a coma.
In an email to The New York Times, his daughter Cleopatra Singleton disputed Ms. Ward's claim about her father's condition. "My father is not in a coma," Ms. Singleton said. "My father had a stroke on April 17, 2019, and at this point we are optimistic about a full recovery."
"Myself, several of my siblings, and my father's father will oppose my grandmother's application to be appointed my father's legal conservator," she continued.
It is not the first time his family has feuded publicly -- one of his sons wrote an open letter in 2016 accusing Mr. Singleton's mother of being manipulative and controlling. Mr. Singleton's lawyer, agent and manager declined to comment on his condition.
A lawyer for his mother did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Take, for example, Rancho Santa Margarita teen Nick Werfelmann. The Tesoro High student and social media slime sensation just bought a 2019 Tesla Model 3 for $45,000. With cash. He’s 16.
You can meet him Sunday, April 28, at the SoCal Slime Bonanza at The District at Tustin Legacy. He’ll be among 40 of Southern California’s social media slime celebs selling their creations.
Ashley Kua, 16, will also be there. The Valencia girl has 1 million followers on her Instagram account @slimeyoda. Off the top of her head, she said she has about $300,000 in slime profits saved up for college, give or take.
If you are completely confused about how slime turns into money then go online right now and punch in the word slime.
Thousands of videos will pop up: mesmerizing close-ups of hands methodically poking, slapping, stretching and caressing colorful blobs and bowls of slime. This isn’t the gross green slime you see on Nickelodeon, by the way. We’re talking about slime that resembles liquid and makes a splashy sound when you play with it. Slime that is fluffed up with shaving cream or jiggly like Jell-0.
Some slimes are a translucent sea green that you can plunge your hands into, others are like rainbow-colored taffy.
As pretty as they look, the real appeal is the sound they make when they are manipulated. Depending on the ingredients you add (foam beads, Vaseline, instant snow) they might crackle, crunch, or even make a slurping sound. Think of the satisfaction of popping bubble wrap and you get the idea.
Young and old alike have sworn by the therapeutic value of slime videos. Some even say they get an autonomous sensory meridian response: a relaxing tingle, often starting in your scalp and traveling south, triggered by a soft, repetitive sound.
Now, stay alert, because this is where the money comes in. Slimer kids (and most are kids) don’t just make free videos for you to watch; they sell their creations. Nick has sold about 14,000 slimes, he guesses, since making his first video when he was 14 years old — on Feb. 21, 2017 (he has the date memorized). They sell for $5 to $15 (for a 16-ounce container).
Nearly 500,000 fans follow his Instagram accounts @itsslimetyme and @theveganslimer. Most of his customers are girls ages 10 to 15, but he does get comments from older clients saying that playing with his slimes help their anxiety and their arthritis.
Nick’s biggest seller is his Strawberry Twizzler, which smells like strawberry licorice. A video of his hands kneading a giant mound of Strawberry Twizzler has gotten 11 million views.
Perhaps the most viewed slime video of all time, though, was made by a former Riverside waitress named Karina Garcia, a.k.a The Slime Queen, according to a New York Times story.
As of today, a video of her making a 100-pound slime ball has gotten more than 26 million views. When the Times story came out (July 2017), she also had advertising partnerships worth up to $200,000 — a month. But then, she has a YouTube channel with 9 million subscribers.
All slimes, by the way, begin with basic ingredients that are both cheap and easy to find: glue and Borax and food dyes and essential oils. Some of the scents are mouth-watering.
Ashley’s biggest seller is her I Loaf You Puff.
“It literally smells like dinner rolls,” she says. “And it feels super smooth, really velvety.”
Her other top seller is Yummy Gummy Freeze, which smells like tropical fruit and feels cold in your hands, like a Slushee.
The junior at Trinity Classical Academy, a private school in Valencia, dreamed of med school but now that her slime sales are booming she wants to study business or advertising, preferably at Stanford, Duke, University of Pennsylvania or Brown. She’s hoping her slime profits will cover tuition.
Ashley said she got into slime two years ago after seeing a video and instantly feeling relaxed.
“It’s, OK, I have a 10-minute break, let me play with some slime,” she says. “When I’m stressed out, when I feel kind of fidgety, it’s something I can squish; kind of like a stress ball, but better.”
Ashley has sold about 25,000 slimes online and another 15,000 at conventions, mixing up batches when she’s not doing homework or playing in tennis tournaments.
Nick says he ships up to 400 orders a week; thus the Tesla. He uses it to make post office runs.
The car purchase didn’t wipe him out, by the way. He guesses he’s got another $20,000 to $30,000 for college (plus another year of sales before graduating high school). He couldn’t give an exact total because it’s in several accounts and he hasn’t added it all up lately.
The Tesla arrived several weeks ago. In a role reversal, his parents have taken to borrowing it.
“It’s like kinda crazy,” says Nick, who’s only had his driver’s license for eight months. “I just go with the flow. My parents are really supportive.”

Texto completo: Former Vice President Joe Biden said Friday on "The View" he doesn't think he treated Anita Hill badly during her questioning in front of an all-male Senate panel in 1991.
“I did everything in my power to do what I thought was within the rules,” Biden said. "If you go back and look at what I said and didn't say, I don’t think I treated her badly. "
Biden, who announced Thursday he will run for president, was the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee when Hill came before the panel to discuss her sexual harassment allegations against then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas. Biden has taken criticism for the committee's treatment of Hill, who sometimes faced misogynistic questioning.
The questioning came after Hill told the New York Times she was left not "satisfied" after a recent conversation Biden. Biden's campaign said he had talked to Hill to express his regret over her treatment during the hearings.
"I cannot be satisfied by simply saying I’m sorry for what happened to you," Hill told the Times. "I will be satisfied when I know there is real change and real accountability and real purpose. "
Biden told the all-female hosts of "The View" that he waited 28 years to call Hill because he did not want to invade her space.
Campaign launch: Joe Biden uses Charlottesville as motivation for 2020 run: 'We are in the battle for the soul of this nation'
Biden fallout: Anita Hill not 'satisfied' after Joe Biden expressed regret over Clarence Thomas hearings, report says
Twitter bash: President Donald Trump on Joe Biden's 2020 run: 'He's not the brightest lightbulb in the group'
Obama: Joe Biden said he asked Barack Obama not to endorse him in 2020 presidential campaign
Biden said that he did not want to judge whether his apology was "sufficient. " He praised Hill for being an inspiration to the current Me Too movement and providing momentum to Biden's efforts to push through the Violence Against Women Act, what he's called his proudest legislative achievement.
"I'm sorry the way she was treated," Biden said. "I wish we could have figured out a better way to get this thing done. I did everything in my power to do what I thought was in the rules to be able to stop things. "
Biden entered the crowded 2020 Democratic presidential as the front-runner, but is certain to face more questions about Hill's treatment as the campaign moves along.
In the lead-up to announcing his candidacy, Biden faced criticism from several women who allege they had encounters with the former vice president in which he touched them inappropriately or invaded their private space.
He reiterated Friday that he feels badly for making the women feel uncomfortable, but also said he's never touched anyone with ill intent.
"I have to be, and everybody has to be, much more aware of the private space of men and women,” Biden said. “I am much more cognizant of that. ”
He told "The View" hosts that he found himself questioning whether or not he should hug them as he walked out on the television show's set.
“I actually thought in my head when I walked out here,” he said. “I mean, do I? We’re friends. But I have to be aware of it. I have to be more cognizant. ”

Biden's experience could be 2020 baggage

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Joe Biden entered the 2020 race for president Thursday at the top of the polls, with universal name recognition and the still-fresh sheen of his time as a popular vice president to Barack Obama.
Biden brings 40 years of political baggage that could force him to explain or apologize for dozens of past positions that are out of step with a Democratic Party that is being pulled further left.
How Biden chooses to frame a Washington record that stretches back to the Nixon administration could determine the course of his candidacy.
"I don't believe there's any precedent for a candidate like Biden," who cast thousands of votes on the Senate floor and in committee during his career, said Joesph Pika, a professor emeritus at the University of Delaware who has followed Biden's career.
"All those votes can be sliced and diced by critics to prove almost anything they want - inconsistencies, errors in judgment, wrong choices," Pika said. "And with experience in  national office spanning nearly a half century, the issues have changed and evolved, as has the expert thinking about best solutions."
During Biden's decades in the Senate, he championed "tough-on-crime" criminal justice policies now thought to have contributed to mass incarceration, a modern civil rights issue that could be important in early voting states such as South Carolina. He cast votes that would have curtailed women's access to abortions. And he pushed for the passage of a law that stripped bankruptcy protections from millions of Americans in 2005.
It remains to be seen how much his opponents will focus on that history during the Democratic primary campaign, which is still in its early phase. But even before he announced his candidacy, Biden was already positioning himself to respond to critics from the "New Left."
"I've got the most progressive record of anyone running," he said at a March event in Delaware. Biden's campaign did not respond to interview requests for this story.
Biden's supporters and some political experts have described now-controversial positions as the unavoidable legacy of a career in national politics that dates back to 1973 - before some of his opponents were even born. Biden, who has waged two previous presidential bids and served eight years in the Obama White House, has arguably been vetted more thoroughly than any other candidate.
"If he has to respond to everything he did in 1974, it's going to be an unpleasant campaign for him," said Ross Baker, a Rutgers University political scientist who specializes in the Senate. "I think he has to make a statement right at the outset that times have changed. He has changed with the times, as have many people."
But despite his time on the public stage, Biden's record could get a new airing and his popularity could dip if opponents decide to seize on aspects of his past that have not aged well.
"He's much too big of a fish to be ignored by his rivals, and they'll have to tear him down," columnist Matt Yglesias wrote for Vox in January. "The entire spectacle of once again re-fighting every intraparty battle from the past two generations would be bad for almost everyone at a time when Democrats should be talking about their ideas for the future."
But Biden may be able to point to his more recent actions as evidence that his views have evolved.
He was one of 32 Democratic senators, for example, to vote in 1996 for the Defense of Marriage Act, which defined marriage as between one man and one woman. But by 2012, he had declared his full support for gay marriage on national television, propelling Obama, who had been lukewarm on the topic, to do the same a few days later.
Biden, a practicing Catholic, voted in the '70s, '80s and '90s against federal funding for abortions and to override President Bill Clinton's veto of a controversial ban on the late-term procedure termed "partial birth" abortions. Those views had evolved by the time he was in the White House. In 2012, he said the government does not have "a right to tell other people that women, they can't control their body," according to The New York Times.

Texto completo: Victor "Trae" Apodaca III, former owner of Downtown El Paso's Café Central and owner/operator of Apodaca Bail Bonds, died Tuesday. He was 55.
Apodoca died in an El Paso hospital after having complications during the weekend from heart surgery, which he had undergone about two weeks ago, said Arlene Jones, executive assistant at Apodaca Bonding, the company that's been in Apodaca's family for generations.
"We have lost a true gentleman, an icon to the restaurant industry and a legend in our community," said Leo Duran, owner of L&J Cafe in Central El Paso. "You could always count on him for guidance, and his wisdom and assistance."
A long list of friends, colleagues and family members mourned his loss in posts on Apodaca's Facebook page.
Apodaca bought Café Central in 1991, and operated it for 18 years before selling it in 2009, according to El Paso Times archives. The upscale restaurant became well-known in El Paso and nationally. A New York Times travel piece lavished praise on the restaurant in 2006.
"Food and wine was his passion," said Keith Mahar, an El Paso insurance broker and close friend of Apodaca.
"He was very giving. He would give you the shirt off his back," Mahar said. He also was a good father, who has three children, he said.
"He touched so many people," Mahar said.
He continued with his love of cooking and often brought dishes he cooked to the office, said Jones at Apodaca Bonding.
"He had a heart of gold. He was not just your boss; you became family" as one of his employees, Jones said.
Apodaca was married to Shirlyn Apodaca. His three children are Cristian Apodaca, Brandice Bradley, and Johnny Bowden, according to his obituary. He has a sister, Michelle "Missy" Apodaca, an Austin lawyer, and brother, Tom Apodaca, a former North Carolina state senator.
A "gathering service" will be from 5 to 7 p.m. Thursday, with a remembrance service at 5:30 p.m., at Martin Funeral Home West at 128 N. Resler Drive, in West El Paso. A "celebration of life service" will be 11 a.m. Friday at the same funeral home.
Some condolences on social media.

Kirstjen Nielsen's cybersecurity efforts blocked

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — In the months before Kirstjen Nielsen was forced to resign, she tried to focus the White House on one of her highest priorities as homeland security secretary: preparing for new and different Russian forms of interference in the 2020 election.
President Donald Trump’s chief of staff told her not to bring it up in front of the president.
Nielsen left the Department of Homeland Security this month after a tumultuous 16-month tenure and tensions with the White House. Officials said she had become increasingly concerned about Russia’s continued activity in the United States during and after the 2018 midterm elections — ranging from its search for new techniques to divide Americans using social media, to experiments by hackers, to rerouting internet traffic and infiltrating power grids.
But in a meeting this year, Mick Mulvaney, the White House chief of staff, made it clear that Trump still equated any public discussion of malign Russian election activity with questions about the legitimacy of his victory. According to one senior administration official, Mulvaney said it “wasn’t a great subject and should be kept below his level.”
Even though the Department of Homeland Security has primary responsibility for civilian cyberdefense, Nielsen eventually gave up on her effort to organize a White House meeting of Cabinet secretaries to coordinate a strategy to protect next year’s elections.
As a result, the issue did not gain the urgency or widespread attention that a president can command. And it meant that many Americans remain unaware of the latest versions of Russian interference.
This account of Nielsen’s frustrations was described to the New York Times by three senior Trump administration officials and one former senior administration official, all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity. The White House did not provide comment after multiple requests Tuesday.
After this article was published online Wednesday, Mulvaney said through a spokesman, “I don’t recall anything along those lines happening in any meeting.”
While U.S. intelligence agencies have warned of the dangers of new influence campaigns penetrating the 2020 elections, Trump and those closest to him have maintained that the effect of Russia’s interference in 2016 was overblown.
Before she resigned under pressure April 7, Nielsen and other officials looked for other ways to raise the alarm.
The opening page of the Worldwide Threat Assessment, a public document compiled by government intelligence agencies that was delivered to Congress in late January, warned that “the threat landscape could look very different in 2020 and future elections.”
“Russia’s social media efforts will continue to focus on aggravating social and racial tensions, undermining trust in authorities and criticizing perceived anti-Russia politicians,” the report noted. It also predicted that “Moscow may employ additional influence tool kits — such as spreading disinformation, conducting hack-and-leak operations or manipulating data — in a more targeted fashion to influence U.S. policy, actions and elections.”
By comparison, cyberthreats have taken a back seat among security priorities at the White House.
Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, eliminated the position of cybersecurity coordinator at the White House last year, leaving less experienced aides to deal with the issue. The National Security Council insisted that the White House had been more active on cybersecurity issues in the past year than it had before the change. In January, Nielsen fumed when 45% of her cyberdefense work force was furloughed during the government shutdown.
Nielsen grew so frustrated with White House reluctance to convene top-level officials to come up with a governmentwide strategy that she twice pulled together her own meetings of Cabinet secretaries and agency heads. They included top Justice Department, FBI and intelligence officials, many of whom later periodically issued public warnings about indicators that Russia was both looking for new ways to interfere and experimenting with techniques in Ukraine and Europe.
One senior official described Homeland Security officials as adamant that the U.S. government needed to significantly step up its efforts to urge the American public and companies to block foreign influence campaigns. But the department was stymied by the White House’s refusal to discuss it, the official said.
As a result, the official said, the government was failing to adequately inform Americans about continuing influence efforts.

Texto completo: NORMAL  Spider Saloff, known for her performances of jazz and the Great American Songbook, will highlight an evening of entertainment at a fundraiser concert for Autism McLean on Saturday.
The cabaret show will begin at 7:30 p.m. at Heartland Community College's Astroth Community Education Center. Doors will open at 6 p.m. for drinks and light snacks catered by Baxter's American Grille, Bloomington.
This is a return engagement for Saloff, who is based in Chicago but has performed all over the world, including the Ravinia Music Festival, New York's Lincoln Center and in Poland, Russia and the United Kingdom.
We had a wonderful time last year, said Saloff, who will be joined by featured guest artist Bruce Breitweiser of Bloomington on saxophone, Jeremy Kahn on piano and Jim Cox on bass. Not only is it for a good cause, it's just an entertaining evening.  It's festive.
The New York Times says Saloff has a wicked way with a lyric and a glint of self-controlled mischief.
She will perform selections from different composers and artists at the concert. Among them will be music made famous by Nat King Cole, who would have been 100 years old this year; an original song by Peggy Lee; and compositions by George and Ira Gershwin and Rodgers and Hart.
Saloff said she also will have some real oddities from the 20s.
The Great American Songbook is the ultimate American music, crossing over genres all the time, from opera singers to rock musicians, said Saloff. That's why I enjoy performing it. It's iconic and it's timeless.
As for jazz, I always loved jazz from the time I was a child, she said. I pretended to like pop music, then I'd sneak off and listen to my dad's Billie Holiday records.
Thanks to event sponsorships, all proceeds from ticket sales will benefit Autism McLean. The organization has been supporting individuals with autism spectrum disorder since 2002. It offers recreational activities, educational grants, family support, summer camps and resource information.
I love to share my gifts for a good purpose, said Saloff. It's amazing what Autism McLean has done for this cause.

Steve King is no Christ figure and should not be in Congress

Texto completo: When Pontius Pilate asked Jesus of Nazareth if he was a king, little did he expect that a King would later liken his own suffering to that of Jesus.

U.S. Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, continued on Tuesday his ongoing efforts to prove his unfitness for office. Stripped of his committee assignments earlier this year after another in a long series of comments widely deemed racist in nature, King told constituents at a town hall meeting that prayer gave him a certain “peace” in facing rebukes from “400 and some accusers” among his congressional colleagues.

“We just passed through Easter and Christ’s Passion,” he said, “and I have a better insight into what he went through for us, partly because of that experience.”

Yes, he really said that. A man with a documented record of supporting people and causes affiliated with white supremacy, who keeps doing so for years after being criticized for it, cannot reasonably claim he is innocent of white supremacist sympathies.

To be sure, the media has overreacted to a few individual statements and actions of King. The New York Times, for example, apparently and quite absurdly thinks that making English the official language in Iowa is evidence of racism.

But, among his many lowlights, King has repeatedly promoted neo-Nazis on Twitter, trafficked in obviously bigoted tropes about Mexicans, and lamented that the term “white nationalism” is wrongly thought offensive. He is hardly an innocent sufferer of false accusations, much less a Christlike one. And, of course, suffering a series of largely true verbal criticisms hardly compares to being beaten, flayed, scourged, and crucified.

King isn’t even contrite, having insisted, repeatedly, that he has “nothing to apologize for.”

Even before King’s latest wildly inappropriate remarks, the two main papers serving his state and district had called on him to resign. The Sioux City Journal wrote that its resignation demand was a way to “reject, in all their reprehensible forms, inequality and intolerance.”

The Iowa newspapers are right. Steve King is no martyr. He’s a pathetic figure and an embarrassment to Congress. He should resign.

Texto completo: Pete Buttigieg doubts Bernie Sanders’ chances of beating President Trump in 2020.

Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., told the New York Times his Democratic primary opponent’s leftist proposals are not as edgy as they were during the 2016 campaign.

“People were refreshed by the novelty of that boldness,” Buttigieg said of the Vermont senator, also questioning whether a 77-year-old democratic socialist could win a general election.

“I have a hard time seeing the coalition ultimately coming together there,” he said.

Sanders’ campaign manager Faiz Shakir dismissed Buttigieg’s comments, saying the senator has a “unifying progressive agenda” that makes him “the best-positioned candidate to defeat Donald Trump in the general election.”

Buttigieg, 37, also recently compared Trump voters with those who voted for Sanders in 2016.

Both blocs wanted to “blow up the system,” he said. “Which could lead you to somebody like Bernie and it could lead you to somebody like Trump. That’s how we got where we are.”

Buttigieg and Sanders are among nearly two dozen Democratic candidates running for the party’s nomination in 2020.

Texto completo: The Glenbard Parent Series has selected the critically acclaimed young adult novel "Dear Martin" as its 2018-19 second semester community read. GPS will host New York Times best-selling author Nic Stone at 7 p.m. Thursday, April 25, at Glenbard North High School, 990 N. Kuhn Road in Carol Stream.
All students and caregivers are encouraged to attend. Glenbard North students will hear Stone during the day at an author event sponsored by the school’s English department.
"Dear Martin" is a moving portrait of a college-bound, African-American young man struggling to make sense of our culture’s persistent racial and social injustice. Torn between his prep school world and that of his economically disadvantaged peers from the neighborhood, Justyce turns to the teachings of Martin Luther King Jr. for greater understanding, particularly after an altercation between his best friend and a white police officer. This prize winning New York Times best seller examines racial profiling in a realistic, powerful, and memorable way.
Stone also wrote the award-winning young adult novel "Odd One Out."
Author Nic Stone was born and raised in Atlanta and graduated from Spelman College. She worked extensively in teen mentoring and lived in Israel for a few years before returning to the U.S. to write full-time. Growing up with a wide range of cultures, religions, and backgrounds, Stone strives to bring these diverse voices and stories to her work.
Continuing professional development units are available for the April 25 event.
The Glenbard Parent Series is generously sponsored by the Cebrin Goodman Center, Cooperative Association for Special Education (CASE), College of DuPage, DuPage Medical Group, Emmy Gaffey Foundation, Glenbard Early Childhood Collaborative, Holiday Inn/Carol Stream, Prevention Leadership Team of the DuPage County Health Department and Community Consolidated School District 93 Early Childhood Collaborative.

PROTEST PLANNED OVER PIRRO SPEECH AT ST. BARNABAS EVENT FOURTH SPONSOR PULLS SUPPORT FOR FOUNDER'S DAY EVENT

Texto completo: After officials from St. Barnabas Health System refused to meet to talk about the upcoming speech by Fox News commentator Jeanine Pirro at St. Barnabas' Founder's Day fundraiser on Thursday, the head of a local Islamic organization pulled together a protest of the event supported by nine other Pittsburgh-area community and religious-based organizations.
"We have been very concerned about all the very strong and nonfactual propaganda that Jeanine Pirro has been doing on television, slandering the Islamic community," said Safdar Khwaja, president of the Pittsburgh chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. "So we gave [St. Barnabas] a chance to hear us out and prevent a protest. But it wouldn't hear us out."
As a result, CAIR has organized a protest set to begin just before the Founder's Day cocktail reception at the Pittsburgh Marriott North in Cranberry begins at 5:30 p.m. Thursday.
St. Barnabas officials did not return calls or emails sent by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette seeking comment.
Mr. Khwaja, who already has told Cranberry police of the planned action, said he expects 20 to 50 or more people to peacefully protest, with signs and chants, near the Marriott entrance. Ms. Pirro is scheduled to speak sometime after 7:30 p.m.
CAIR and the other groups were incensed when they learned Ms. Pirro was still coming to speak in Pittsburgh, even after her employer, Fox News, punished her for comments she made on her show, "Justice With Judge Jeanine" on March 9.
During that show, she asked of new U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., who wears a hijab, a traditional covering worn by Muslim women: "Is her adherence to this Islamic doctrine indicative of her adherence to Sharia law, which in itself is antithetical to the United States Constitution?"
Fox News condemned her remarks and then pulled her show the following week.
After the March 9 comments, multiple people called or wrote the 10 lead sponsors of the Founder's Day event, asking them to withdraw support.
Three of them - Trib Total Media, Dollar Bank and UPMC Health Plan - withdrew their support last month.
Just this week, at least one more sponsor - CHS Alera Group - told one of those people who reached out to the sponsors that it was also withdrawing support. Calls from the Post-Gazette seeking comment to Alera Group executives on Tuesday were not returned.
The man who wrote to the 10 companies - a local Democratic supporter who asked to remain anonymous for fear of being verbally attacked for his actions - said he still has not heard from the other six companies supporting the Founder's Day event. But he was excited to hear about the protest on Thursday.
"I think it's wonderful," he said. "I think that people need to come out and stand up when people like this espouse views like this."
Some of the community and religious-based groups supporting CAIR's protest agreed.
Sister Janice Vanderneck, founder of Casa San Jose, a Latino support organization in Pittsburgh, said her organization decided to support the protest on Thursday after CAIR asked them because "incendiary language, language that incites people to anger, is one of the worst things happening in our country right now."
"Religious bigotry is rampant," she said. "Jewish people are being attacked and killed. Muslim people are being attacked and killed. And we just saw Christians in Sri Lanka are being attacked and killed."
Dan Galvin, spokesman for the Western Pennsylvania chapter of Veterans for Peace, said the decision to support CAIR's call for a protest was an easy one: "As veterans dedicated to preventing violence, we stand in support and solidarity with CAIR against someone who speaks against Muslims and other religious groups."
"Hate speech toward any group is unacceptable," he said.
Jamaal Craig, executive director of the Pennsylvania Interfaith Impact Network, which represents 42 Jewish, Muslim, Christian and other congregations, said events in the region make Ms. Pirro's presence even more hard to take.
"When you look at the climate here . and you have situations like Tree of Life [terrorist attack] and [the attack on a Muslim student at] Chartiers Valley," he said, "it only perpetuates the hateful rhetoric that already exists to have her speak here."
Mr. Khwaja, a retired engineer from Monroeville who used to work for Westinghouse and Emerson, said he hoped to simply have a sincere conversation about Ms. Pirro's presence when he reached out to St. Barnabas's president, William Day, through a friend who is a doctor with some connections to St. Barnabas.
"But Mr. Day would not even entertain the idea," he said.
He also tried to reach Jim Roddey, the former Allegheny County executive who is a spokesman for St. Barnabas.
Mr. Khwaja, who is Muslim, said he got to know Mr. Roddey a little when he was an engineering executive and Mr. Roddey ran the county government and was hoping to boost jobs in the area. He said Mr. Roddey even came to his mosque in Monroeville for a visit.
But "I couldn't even get a call back from his secretary" in the last few weeks after he reached out to him, Mr. Khwaja said.
As upset he is by Ms. Pirro's remarks, Mr. Khwaja - who said he's an independent politically - said he's just as upset by St. Barnabas' refusal to discuss her views and her presence.

Texto completo: Avondale police falsely arrested and imprisoned a man after attempting to connect him with a murder based on his smartphone's location data, according to a report from The New York Times.
The report, which was published April 13, claims Jorge Molina was imprisoned for nearly a week in December after investigators obtained location data from Google indicating Molina's phone was in the area when the murder of Joseph Knight had occurred nine months prior.
Knight was shot in the 700 block of North Fourth Street just before 12:15 a.m. on March 14, according to Avondale police.
Security footage showed a person firing a gun from a white Honda Civic — a car model Molina owned — but didn't capture a license plate or shooter, the story says.
Knight is shown getting off his bike in front of his apartment just before nine shots were fired from the Civic's driver's side window, records say.
Knight worked the swing shift at a nearby airport and rode his bicycle to save money. He lived alone and had two pets, according to the records.
The Times story states prosecutors didn't pursue charges against Molina and that he was released from jail shortly after the case against him "fell apart."
The Maricopa County Sheriff's Office confirmed Saturday that Molina was not in custody and was released shortly after 1 p.m. on Dec. 19, 2018.
Avondale police worked with Riverside County law enforcement agencies to arrest Marcos Cruz Gaeta last month in connection with the Avondale murder and another homicide Gaeta's suspected of committing in Indio, California, in 2016.
The Times story says police arrested Molina's mother's ex-boyfriend — who sometimes drove Molina's car — in connection with Knight's homicide but doesn't name Gaeta.
Neither the Avondale Police Department nor the Maricopa County Attorney's Office immediately responded to questions about the case.

The media is the 'enemy,' but photographers aren't so bad

Texto completo: President Trump started Tuesday with a pair of angry tweets at the New York Times, demanding that his hometown paper "get down on their knees & beg for forgiveness" over its coverage of the Russia probe. "They are truly the Enemy of the People!" he wrote in his latest withering attack on the free press.
But by midday, the president was hobnobbing in the Oval Office with a group of White House news photographers, signing their photos of him and joking that they should hold a fundraiser at his golf course. Trump kept some of the prints and returned others with praise such as "Fantastic Job!" and "Amazing Talent!" in his distinctive handwriting. He chatted with Doug Mills, the Times's lead White House photographer.
The president's participation, for the third year in a row, in a private reception to celebrate the winners of the White House News Photographers Association's annual awards reflected a sharp dichotomy in how the former reality-television star views the pack of correspondents that covers his every public move.
Although Trump has waged rhetorical war on newspaper writers and cable television correspondents, he has been more appreciative of the photographers who produce two-dimensional images the visually minded president has often admired.
Trump has been so taken with pictures of himself published in newspapers that aides have requested high-quality prints on his behalf, and the president has retweeted images from photojournalists on social media.
"It seems like he does appreciate the photographers when we go in there," said WHNPA President Whitney Shefte, a Washington Post multimedia journalist who, along with Post photographer Jabin Botsford, were among those honored at the reception. "Last year, he said something like, 'You do great work.' It's a very different message than what he says publicly."
White House officials did not respond to requests for comment.
The WHNPA has been meeting with presidents dating, at least, to Harry Truman, who was named honorary president of the "One More Club," a moniker that referred to photographers' insistence on constantly yelling out for another photo. The organization is independent from the White House Correspondents' Association, which hosts the annual April fundraising dinner that Trump has boycotted since taking office.
On Saturday, Trump again will skip the dinner in favor of a campaign rally in Green Bay, Wis.
WHCA President Olivier Knox, the chief Washington correspondent for SiriusXM, said past presidents, like Trump, have generally displayed a greater affinity for news photographers than writers or television pundits because they are viewed as less threatening.
He recalled an occasion when first lady Laura Bush was peppered with questions from reporters during a rare visit to the media workspace at the White House.
But when she entered an area where photographers are seated, the questions stopped. "Welcome to 'stills country,' " one told her, meaning photojournalists who do not take video.
"I like 'stills country,' " the first lady replied, according to Knox.
While all presidents have been mindful of their image, Trump - whose private charity spent $30,000 on two portraits of him and whose golf resorts displayed a fake Time magazine cover bearing his visage - is perhaps the most hyper-attuned to the cameras.
During a luncheon at his first high-stakes summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore in the summer, Trump jokingly instructed photojournalists to make the two leaders "look nice and handsome and thin."
Trump's tone is perhaps most striking in the way he has dealt with the New York Times, which he has denounced as "failing" - even though the publication has thrived, with more than 4 million total subscribers.
In early February, Trump jousted with the Times's publisher over the dangers posed by his hostility toward the press corps and complained that he felt entitled to "a great story" from the newspaper.
But by the end of that month, during a dinner with Kim at their second summit in Hanoi, Trump pointed to Mills, the Times photographer, and called him "one of the great photographers in the world."
That praise came after White House aides had attempted to bar newspaper and wire service writers from the photo op because they had shouted out questions at an earlier event. The aides relented and allowed in one writer only after the photographers threatened to boycott coverage.
Some photographers have expressed a measure of satisfaction in the access they have to Trump. During President Barack Obama's tenure, the WHCA logged formal complaints over photojournalists being excluded from events that were open to official White House photographer Pete Souza, who has since published two books of his work.
Mills, a member of the WHCA board, said Trump has offered more daily access, for longer sessions, than any president since he began covering the White House during the Reagan administration.
"For a photographer, you couldn't ask for anything better," Mills told the Lafayette (Ind.) Journal & Courier this month. Trump's official White House photographer, Shealah Craighead, has had a lower public profile than Souza.
In a conversation with his newspaper in March, Mills was asked about Trump's praise in Hanoi. Trump "obviously looks at my pictures and likes them - but not all of them," he replied. "And that's not my job, for him to like them all. I think he understands that I've been around there a long time and that I am a fair news photographer who does not have an agenda."
WHNPA Vice President Jim Bourg, a photo editor at Reuters news service, also said that photographers see Trump more often than they did other presidents. But he added that access at campaign rallies has been more restrictive, and Trump did not attend the organization's annual gala dinner the past two years.
The group, which also represents video journalists, has issued a sharply critical statement over reports that the White House disseminated altered video of CNN's Jim Acosta after a contentious Trump news conference in the fall, and it called on the president to temper his hostility toward the media after a BBC cameraman was assaulted by a Trump supporter at a rally in El Paso in February.
But such criticism hasn't dissuaded Trump from requesting favors from the photographers. During a flight on Air Force One in August, a White House aide asked another New York Times photojournalist for a high-resolution print of a photo he had published of Trump boarding the presidential jet a day earlier amid a cloud of smoke from a ceremonial cannon at Fort Drum, N.Y.
The aide handed him a clipping of the newspaper, on which Trump had underlined the photographer's name in black marker.

Correspondents' dinner did need to slim down

Texto completo: For years, the White House Correspondents' Association annual dinner was an embarrassment.
Although, for many, an eagerly awaited and richly relished one.
It involved journalists cozying up to the government officials they are supposed to treat with a sense of adversarial independence, all while trying to get selfies with the likes of Helen Mirren, Jeff Goldblum and Scarlett Johansson.
"The main purpose of the evening," John Oliver quipped, "seems to be providing photos of glamorous celebrities completely unaware of who they're standing next to."
President Trump has changed all that. By refusing to attend the dinner himself and by making the government-press relationship truly adversarial - "enemy of the people," etc. - he's sandblasted the high gloss off the party.
What's left is a high-minded journalism awards dinner, which is what the organizers, all along, defended it as.
"A celebration of the First Amendment and the importance of a free and independent news media to a healthy republic," was how Olivier Knox, WHCA president and chief Washington correspondent for SiriusXM, recently characterized it. (My colleagues Josh Dawsey and Ashley Parker are among this year's awards recipients.)
It was not always thus.
Last year, in an already fizzling-out event, featuring comic Michelle Wolf, things got even more uncomfortable in the claustrophobic Washington Hilton ballroom.
By the day after the party, Fox News chief national correspondent Ed Henry and NBC News anchor Andrea Mitchell were calling for the WHCA to apologize to Trump spokeswoman Sarah Sanders.
Sanders had been in the audience as Wolf took her shots: "She burns facts, and then she uses that ash to create a perfect smoky eye. Maybe she's born with it; maybe it's lies. It's probably lies."
Wolf was right, of course, as was proved in the Mueller report, which documents one of Sanders's many shameless whoppers: that countless FBI officials were celebrating the firing of FBI Director James B. Comey.
But the 2018 party's aftermath featured all sorts of second thoughts about the appropriateness of the frontal attack and the unseemly setting.
"Unfortunately, I don't think we advanced the cause of journalism tonight," tweeted Peter Baker, chief White House correspondent of the New York Times. (The Times, for the most part, has not attended the event in recent years.)
Cracks began to appear in the dinner's shiny facade not long after President Trump's inauguration.
In 2017, Graydon Carter, then editor of Vanity Fair, said he'd go fishing in Connecticut instead of hosting the magazine's usual hot-ticket after-party. Asked why he was bailing out, Carter responded: "Trump, and the fish."
From there, it was only a matter of time.
"Gone for good, it seems, are the Oscars-esque rarefied air of the Bloomberg/Vanity Fair, People/Time and Google affairs. The Correspondents' Jam hosted by Rolling Stones touring keyboardist Chuck Leavell, which featured bands fronted by journalists and a few celebrity ringers, is a no-go this year because of the band's previously scheduled tour," reported Emily Heil and Helena Andrews-Dyer, who write the Reliable Source column in The Washington Post.
There will be pre-parties and after-parties, and no doubt plenty of government-press schmoozing throughout the weekend.
That part of it could still stand some reforming.
"If you're a reporter, you shouldn't be taking selfies with the defense secretary," Patrick Gavin, formerly of Politico, once told The Wrap. Gavin produced the 2015 documentary "Nerd Prom: Inside Washington's Wildest Week," a sendup and exposé of the annual dinner's old ways.
As for entertainment at this year's dinner, it'll be a keynote speech by Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Ron Chernow, author of "Grant" and the Alexander Hamilton biography that inspired the blockbuster Broadway musical "Hamilton."
All very virtuous.
"As boring as a dentists convention," predicted former Reliable Source columnist Richard Leiby, now an editor in the Style section.
President Trump won't attend. He'll be doing a rally in Wisconsin that day. (Last year, he rallied his base in Michigan.)
"Too negative," he said recently about the dinner, though on Tuesday he was in his usual form, slamming MSNBC's Joe Scarborough as "psycho," and Paul Krugman, the Nobel Prize winner and New York Times columnist, as "stupid."
Regarding his planned absence from the dinner, Trump added: "I like positive things."
But he'll be certainly there in spirit.
Trump is certainly no friend of the free press, but in his role as dinner-damper, he's done journalists a huge favor.

Clinton press secretary: Dems should keep Trump in office to destroy Republican Party

Texto completo: A former White House press secretary under President Bill Clinton urged Democrats to forgo impeaching President Trump because, he said, keeping him in office will obliterate the Republican Party.

“Mr. Trump is three years into destroying what we know as the Republican Party. Another two years just might finish it off. Trumpism has become Republicanism, and that spells electoral doom for the party,” Joe Lockhart, Clinton’s press secretary from 1998 to 2000, wrote in a New York Times op-ed published late Monday night.
Joe Lockhart

Lockhart argued Trump deserves to be impeached because he is unfit for office, but allowing him to finish his term will be more beneficial to Democrats because the Republican Party has become the party of Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson, and will push more voters to back Democrats.

A push for impeachment would only end up uniting a “fraying” Republican Party, Lockhart said, citing Democrats’ election successes after Clinton was impeached.

“Allowing Mr. Trump to lead the Republican Party, filled with sycophants and weak-willed leaders, into the next election is the greater prize. Democrats have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to realign American politics along progressive lines, very much like Ronald Reagan did for Republicans in the 1980s,” he said.

“Trumpism equals Republicanism as long as Donald Trump is at the top of the ticket. And a real shift to progressivism in America will be delivered by a devastating rebuke of the president and his party, a rebuke that will return control of the Senate and state houses across the nation. Politics is always a gamble — and this is the best bet we’ve had in a long time,” he continued.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has thus far dismissed the prospect of impeaching Trump. In a call with her colleagues Monday, she said Democrats instead would focus on investigating Trump.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Expanding the boycott of an annual press gathering, White House aides told staff members Tuesday that President Donald Trump doesn't want them to attend Saturday night's White House Correspondents Association dinner.
Trump himself said earlier this month he would not be going to the dinner, calling it "too negative" and "I like positive things;" instead, the president will host a political campaign rally in Green Bay, Wisc. , a pivotal state in the 2020 presidential election.
Aides, some of whom attended last year's event, were told at a staff meeting that Trump did not want them to go, officials said.
It appears that officials will heed the president's request.
"The President and members of his administration will not attend the White House Correspondents Dinner this year," the White House said in a written statement issued later in the day.
Olivier Knox, president of the White House Correspondents' Association, said of the boycott: "We’re looking forward to an enjoyable evening of celebrating the First Amendment and great journalists past, present, and future. "

The decision came the same morning that Trump posted a number of tweets attacking the media, particularly MSNBC's Morning Joe to The New York Times.
"I wonder if the New York Times will apologize to me a second time, as they did after the 2016 Election," Trump said in one tweet. "But this one will have to be a far bigger & better apology. On this one they will have to get down on their knees & beg for forgiveness-they are truly the Enemy of the People!"
The Times has never apologized to Trump for its coverage of the president.
Trump also did not attend the dinner during his first two years in office. He is the first president to intentionally skip it since Jimmy Carter in 1980.
President Ronald Reagan did not personally attend the dinner in 1981 – he was recovering from an assassination attempt – but he did phone in some remarks to the crowd.
After last year's White House Correspondents Association dinner, Trump and other administration officials criticized comedian Michelle Wolf for a barbed monologue that included attacks on White House press secretary Sarah Sanders.
There will be no comedian this year; instead, the association invited presidential historian Ron Chernow to speak.
Before Trump, the dinner traditionally featured comics who made fun of the president – and other politicians – and offered presidents the chance to retaliate with comedy routines of their own.
Perhaps most famously, in 2011, President Barack Obama mocked an audience member who had questioned his U. S. citizenship and was contemplating a campaign against him.
That dinner guest? Donald J. Trump.

Texto completo: My editor said I was mistaken when I began a Trump impeachment column by quoting U.S. House Speaker Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

"She's not the speaker," he said, "Nancy Pelosi is."

"Sir," I responded, "with all due respect, I beg to differ. Nancy Pelosi may wield the gavel, but the power behind the throne is AOC.

"Bull," he said.

"Or, to put it in a more learned way," I said, "Nancy Pelosi may be speaker du jour (by law) but Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is speaker de facto (in fact.)"

Because he looked confused, I added, "It's like the tail wagging the dog."

Dazzled by my knowledge of Latin, the law, and dogs he backed off.

"Whatever," he mumbled over his shoulder as he walked away.

Seriously, the charismatic, 29-year-old freshman member of the House from the Bronx is not only the biggest political media personality in Washington, but throughout the country as well. Six months ago she was tending bar.

With her skillful use of social media, including her domination of a fawning press, Ocasio-Cortez, an outspoken leftist, has rocketed to the top of the Democrat political hierarchy. Can a book deal be next?

In many ways, she is bigger than Pelosi. She is also better known than at least half of the 18 or so frenzied Democrats running for president.

While she was called a "pompous little twit" over her Green New Deal proposal by the former head of Greenpeace Canada, she is the biggest pompous little twit in the Americas, including Canada.

Her influence is such that even people who should know better, have embraced her and her far-leftist issues, like the Green New Deal. U.S. Sen. Eddie Markey fell all over it, embracing her as though she had just handed him a double martini with an organic olive.

And no sooner did AOC announce her support for the move to impeach Trump, then Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts' other poor excuse for a U.S. senator, quickly followed suit.

Attempting to revive a presidential campaign that is going nowhere, Warren, a law professor and former Cherokee, became the first Democrat running for president to call for Trump's impeachment over the "severity of misconduct."

No doubt other Democrat presidential candidates in this posse of panderers will do the same.

The Mueller report cleared Trump of any collusion with the Russians, which the corrupt main stream media and Democrats falsely accused him of for two years. Nor did Mueller find enough evidence to charge Trump with obstruction.

But it does not matter. Half-crazed Democrats and their allies in the New York Times, Washington Post, CNN and the television networks see a different truth.

They will see to it that Trump and the Mueller report will continue to dominate the workings of Congress and hinder action on important issues like immigration, infrastructure, the economy and who knows what else will go unattended. They will do anything it takes to deny Trump a win.

Washington Democrats hate Trump so much that they want not only to defeat him but to destroy him over bogus accusations, no matter what harm it does to the country. This includes an impeachment of a president who was duly elected by the American people.

Pelosi and her leadership team in the House know that an attempt to impeach Trump will only come back to haunt the Democrats the way it haunted the Republicans when they impeached President Bill Clinton in 1999.

But Pelosi may not be able to stop it. Several of her committee chairs have already announced they will hold hearings on aspects of the Mueller report, despite her comments that impeachment should not be pursued.

This includes Rep. Jerry Nadler of New York, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, who is practically foaming at the mouth to get Trump.

Coupled with AOC and the party base, which want impeachment, these are signs that Pelosi is losing control of the House.

So, it is no wonder that Pelosi cringes when the name of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez comes up, as Pelosi did during her recent interview on "60 minutes."

AOC and her two fellow travelers -- Rep Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, are driving Pelosi over the edge.

If Trump is to be saved from impeachment by the House -- and then tried by the Senate -- it will be by Pelosi, who does not believe Trump was fit to be president in the first place. How's that for irony.

But Pelosi has to beat "Speaker" Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez first.

Should McSally rethink view of Mueller report?

Texto completo: Shortly after the release of the Mueller report, Sen. Martha McSally went along with President Donald Trump's "game over" assessment, a disappointing but not unexpected response from a politician more interested in her political future than getting to the truth, preserving the Constitution, putting country over party ... you know ... that apparently inconsequential stuff in her oath of office.
McSally tweeted: "I am grateful for the utmost professionalism and diligence displayed by Attorney General Barr to release as much of the report as transparently as possible. What is clear is that the Russians sought to influence the 2016 election and sow discord in our country."
Utmost professionalism? Even for a Trump toady that's extreme.
Attorney General William Barr has been acting like anything but the chief law enforcement officer of the land.
Consider that even Chris Wallace of Fox News called him out, saying of Barr's so-called press conference, "The attorney general seemed almost to be acting as the counselor for the defense, or the counselor for the president, rather than the attorney general. I suspect that Democrats' heads on Capitol Hill were exploding, and they are going to come down very sharply about the way that Bill Barr today laid this out."
Because they should.
Because we all should.
At the very least McSally could have taken a (slightly more honest) middle-of-the-road approach, saying she was grateful for the report and looking forward to having everyone's questions answered. And all issues resolved. Because there are plenty.
Utah Republican Sen. Mitt Romney, for example, issued a statement about the report — after reading it — that said in part: "I am sickened at the extent and pervasiveness of dishonest and misdirection by individuals in the highest office of the land, including the president. I am also appalled that, among other things, fellow citizens working in a campaign for president welcomed help from Russia — including information that had been illegally obtained; that none of them acted to inform American law enforcement..."
Like the troubling news, in a New York Times analysis, that during the campaign and later presidential transition period, Trump and 18 of his associates had at least 140 contacts with Russian nationals and WikiLeaks.
Then there's the belief that special counsel Robert Mueller didn't indict the president only because of the restrictions he was working under, and that he provided plenty of evidence for Congress to do so.
The report took a couple of years to complete. It's not unreasonable to expect members of Congress to take the time to go over it and see if there are things they should follow-up on.
Instead Sen. McSally went full Team Trump. A decent campaign strategy, perhaps. But in terms of her credibility ... game over.

Former Gov. Whitman will lead national 'civility' group

Texto completo: A deeply alarmed Christie Whitman has tried a variety of ways to stem the rising tide of Trumpism.
The former New Jersey governor made headlines (and videos) calling Trump "unfit" for office and urged him to resign. Whitman, a lifelong Republican, endorsed Democrat Hillary Clinton for president. And Whitman compared the president — an ex-casino mogul she once clashed with during her tenure as governor in the 1990s — to some of the "worst dictators in history."
Her one-woman resistance hasn't worked.
Now, Whitman has ditched the frontal assault and has embraced a long-range, grass-roots approach. Whitman has been named advisory board co-chairwoman of the National Institute for Civil Discourse, an eight-year-old advocacy and training group that seeks to reverse the deepening polarization of the body politic.
Whitman replaces former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who announced her retirement from public life last October. The group's other co-chairman is former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D.
The institute has a fairly simple overarching plan. It wants political foes to begin treating each other with respect. And with respect comes a tendency to listen, and maybe negotiate along a common ground — a tradition that eroded under the Tea Party fury a decade ago and has all but vanished in Trump era
"You've got to have the conversation and you've got to start listening," Whitman said in a recent interview.
The institute was created shortly after the shooting in Tucson, Arizona, that killed six people and wounded 13 others, including former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords. Ironically, days before the shooting, Giffords began discussions about creating a center to advance civil conversation, according to the NICD's website.
The group's mission of restoring civility at the grass-roots level of politics was spawned by an across-the-aisle concern that echo-chamber partisanship is destroying the art of compromise, and hence the very underpinnings of Democracy. Partisan voters took their cues from the loudest demagogues, who drown out the demands of the nation's vast middle of independents and moderates.
Attacks on lawmakers — the Giffords shooting, the shooting of House Republican leader Steve Scalise, the 2001 anthrax mailings to political figures, including Daschle — also stirred worries that a breakdown in civil discourse was giving way to extremism.
Trump's election, fueled largely by a mobilized right-wing base, has brought all of those worries to a boil.
Unlike other newly elected presidents, Trump refused to broaden his agenda and his appeal beyond his hard-line, white nationalist supporters, who view compromise as weakness, even betrayal.
And for Whitman, Trump's personalized attacks plunged sharp-edged political dialogue to a crude new low. She singled out Trump's mocking of a New York Times reporter with disabilities during the 2016 campaign.
"This isn't who we are," Whitman lamented.
Keith Allred, the institute's executive director, said Trump's style helped crystallize the long-brewing concerns about polarization and decline in civility.
"There are deeper, systemic things that are going on that will be with us long after Trump," he said in an interview. "But he has put such a kind of extreme and vivid face on the problem that I think he has gotten people to wake up to it and focus on it."
The institute doesn't simply broadcast a clarion call for civility through its network of prominent political and media figures — the NICD's board ranges from former President Bill Clinton and former Secretaries of State Colin Powell and Madeleine Albright to NPR host Scott Simon and Yahoo News anchor Katie Couric.
The organization conducts a series of workshops in schools, community groups and, perhaps most importantly, legislatures, which have traditionally served as the de facto training ground for future members of Congress. Half of New Jersey's House delegation, for example, are former state legislators.
The group's "Building Trust through Civil Discourse" workshop has been held in 16 states, is a half-day attempt to prod officials to reconsider each other on common ground. Participants are prodded to craft "rules of engagement" for the discussion, which effectively serves as a manifesto of civility — no talking past each other, a ban on disparaging each other, and a commitment to "listen first."
They are asked to explain, "not in a canned campaign speech," about what brought them into politics, Allred said. They then explain why they love their home state. From there they break out in groups and make recommendations.
In Maine, lawmakers agreed to alternate legislative seating between Democrats and Republicans rather than have the parties segregated, as is commonly done. The effort has led to more bipartisan legislation, increased dialogue across the aisle, significant procedural changes, and legislators holding civil conversations with their constituents, the NICD contends.
"They start seeing fellow legislators as human beings," he said. More than 850 lawmakers have participated in the workshops.
With the power of party bosses and county chairmen in New Jersey's politics, high-minded workshops might seem like a waste of time. This is also a state that produced Chris Christie, a smash-mouth politician known for his name-calling skills, and who happens to be Trump's chief defender in New Jersey.
Just last week, the former governor broke his vow of silence and unleashed a Trumpian attack on his successor, Democrat Phil Murphy, at a hunters' event last Sunday, mocking his manner of speech and asserting that Murphy is "not from here," a reference to Murphy's Massachusetts upbringing.
Yet New Jersey has a long tradition of transactional politics, which has led lawmakers to abandon their partisan loyalties in pursuit of a good deal. And that "deal" often includes a hefty price tag.
For Whitman and the NICD, the campaign is less about the outbursts of the moment and more about the conduct of the future. Allred noted confidently that the nation has gone through deep, seemingly unbridgeable divides in the nation's history, only to rebound when the public realizes that things have reached a crisis stage.
Ironically, Trump's conduct has helped the group make its case.
"You've got to start somewhere," Whitman said.

Early line indicates New Mexico's sportsbooks are good for business

Texto completo: The business of legalized sports betting in New Mexico is, to borrow the phrase, paying off.
The state's only legal sportsbooks -- at Buffalo Thunder Resort & Casino north of Santa Fe and Santa Ana Star Casino northwest of Albuquerque -- are up and running. By most accounts, business is better than expected.
Activity at both venues is up, organizers say, and the early reviews from consumers are positive.
"I think it's only going to get bigger because what they're doing right now seems to be working," said Santa Fe
resident Terence Mirabal, a casual sports bettor who has traveled to Las Vegas, Nev., several times and acknowledged that having a local option is appealing.
"Knowing there's something just down the road is great," he said, "because, really, this is something you kind of had to wait to do until you were in Vegas."
That's just the kind of reaction casino operators were hoping for after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a decades-old federal law nearly a year ago prohibiting most states from allowing casinos to start their own sportsbooks.
That cleared the path for states like New Jersey and Delaware to launch their own government-endorsed forms of gaming. Mississippi and West Virginia quickly followed suit, with New Mexico becoming the fifth state outside Nevada to allow sports betting.
Though sports gambling outside Las Vegas was seen as a potential revenue stream that could turn into a gusher, the New York Times recently reported several states considering legislation that would open sports betting to the public are backing off after their initial ardor.
Why? In some places, it hasn't brought the windfall that was expected. The Times reported that West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Mississippi have received only half the tax revenue they anticipated, according to those states' data.
But in New Mexico, where complex gambling compacts allow tribal casinos to open and operate sportsbooks without direct state legislation, sports fans' hunger for gambling -- and casinos' willingness to satiate it -- seem like a natural combination.
Robert Mann, a contributing writer for SportsHandle.com, a website dedicated to news and trends in the sports gaming industry, said New Mexico's unique state-tribal gaming compacts give the pueblos plenty of autonomy in sports gambling.
"The laws are so different there," he said. "It gives a lot of these tribes freedom to do things their own way."
Buffalo Thunder already had
a Las Vegas-style race book before the Supreme Court's
decision, using a Nevada-based firm, Las Vegas Dissemination Company, as its oddsmaker. LVDC Sales Director Jay Vaccaro
said the two partnered again to expand into a full-fledged sportsbook with the company offering on-site training for staff as well as the installation of the necessary infrastructure within a matter of weeks.
Santa Ana's sportsbook was installed in the fall by Las Vegas firm USBookmaking.
Buffalo Thunder's layout comes with amenities that Santa Ana lacks, such as multiple TV screens to watch live sporting events and a wider array of betting options at the window. Everything was already in place at Buffalo Thunder, so it has been a natural transition to not only place bets on game days but on future events as well.
Vaccaro said Buffalo Thunder began taking bets on the opening week of the NFL season as well as laying odds on division winners and the Super Bowl. Making the entire process run smoothly was his company's first mission. Sustaining a level of marketability and having the sportsbook become a proven moneymaker for the casino, however, is the ultimate goal.
"We understand the tribal
gaming world and we respect that world, and the tribes go along with what their compacts allow them to do," he said. "We're about driving business and making sure it runs smoothly, so now it's something where everyone who walks in there can have the things that Las Vegas casinos have."
Mann said the idea of any sportsbook is to simply give
the would-be bettor more
options when strolling through
a casino.
"If it's increasing the amount of people that come in, then it's worthwhile even if they just break even," Mann said. "It's about increasing foot traffic."
The thinking goes that if someone is willing to visit the sportsbook and place a bet on, say, the Golden State Warriors or Ohio State Buckeyes, they'll stay for dinner or sit down to play the slots or table games.
"Just look at it as a spoke in a wheel," Mann said. "One spoke is slot machines, one spoke is a restaurant, one spoke is table games and one spoke is the sportsbook, and everything kind of works in successful operations. All the spokes work together; one feeds the other."
It's too early to tell if either New Mexico sportsbook will be a moneymaker, although observers say early indications are promising.
"You've got, what, half a million people [in Albuquerque]
and quite a bit living around Santa Fe?" Mann said. "You keep things small, see what kind of traffic you can get in there and, yeah, I think it's sustainable. If it's done right, it's always sustainable."
Santa Ana's sportsbook has been online since October,
while Buffalo Thunder opened last month. Both opened with a $500 betting limit, but Mann pointed out that a good barometer for a sportsbook's health is its willingness to raise the limit.
Buffalo Thunder upped its maximum to $1,000 for the NCAA Tournament and plans to do so again once the NFL season begins.
"After the tournament, as everything else, volume decreases," Vacarro said. "People came [to Buffalo Thunder] just for the NCAA Tournament and, actually, we had a very good
turnout there. People came from all over just knowing that the sportsbook was there."
In many respects, Buffalo Thunder and Santa Ana have served as a litmus test for other casinos to observe and make their own judgments on whether to invest in their own sports betting venues. USBookmaking and LVDC have been in negotiations with other New Mexico pueblos to expand, although with whom and when remain closely guarded. The local casinos are known as being very private about daily operations.
Several calls and messages left for representatives at Buffalo Thunder were never returned, nor were inquiries to the New Mexico Attorney General's Office seeking comment regarding any attempts by the state to provide legal framework for sports betting.
The New Mexico Gaming Control Board, which also did
not respond to several inquiries for this story, reported overall gambling revenues of $193 mil-lion through bets placed at the
14 tribal casinos in the final quarter of 2018. That translated into approximately $18 million for the state, money that goes into the general fund through the State Treasurer's Office.
The annual payout to the
state totaled $72 million in
2018 based on approximately $800 million in revenue. Because of the complexity of the gaming compacts and the short amount of time they've been active, it's still unclear if or when the state will see any revenue from sportsbooks.
"You've seen some states
put this on the back burner
and not really consider it, but New Mexico's laws are defin-
itely unique to what you have there," Mann said. "In a lot of ways, the casinos can do whatever they want. I'm interested
to see how it will work but,
yeah, I think it's something that can work. I'm not sure how
much money they'll bring in, so
it all kind of goes back to the spokes in a wheel. If it's working, why wouldn't everyone else try to do it, you know?"
It appears there have been few public complaints so far.
Kandace Blanchard, founder and clinical director of the
New Mexico Council on Prob-lem Gaming, said last week
that there have been three calls
of any significance to her organization, none of which was considered a crisis. The majority of her clients say they don't go
to the casinos to bet on sports and most use a bookie to ensure their winnings aren't tracked or taxed.
For bettors like Mirabal, it's all about the experience. A successful sportsbook, he said, can only be a good thing for the bean counters who turn a profit at the end of the day.
"If you really think about it, you probably put in a little
extra money when you go play slots or you might put a little extra if you go play blackjack,"
he said. "I'm assuming that's
what the normal gambler would do for sports betting. The more you look, the more curious you get. That's what they want from you."

Texto completo: President Trump reportedly once snapped at former national security adviser H.R. McMaster for taking notes during meetings at the White House.

A frequent note-taker, McMaster infuriated the president with his practice. “Why are you always writing in that book?” Trump once said to McMaster, according to a report from the New York Times. McMaster's mumbled response, which people in the room could not recall, did not please Trump.

Since leaving the Trump administration, McMaster has spoken out about his time the White House, sometimes corroborating reports from the West Wing. For instance, after it was reported former National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn removed a trade-related document from Trump’s desk to stop him from signing it, McMaster defended the action, describing it was “wholly appropriate.”

McMaster, who was replaced by John Bolton as national security adviser last year, also took heat for the leaks from the West Wing. He issued a memo to staff about leaks that was later leaked to the press. McMaster later shared two reasons why he believed there were so many leaks.

UBER IPO CLASSIC CASE OF RICH GET RICHER

Texto completo: There's obviously no turning back now. The marketplace has spoken, and ride-sharing companies like Uber and Lyft are here to stay.
Gone, though, are thousands of middle-class wage and benefit jobs that taxi drivers, particularly in the big cities, held down since the advent of the automobile.
Some of it was their fault. Cab companies have always been notoriously bad in the public relations department. Customers weren't always treated well and making sure cabs were clean and odor-free was never on the top of the list. And they were notoriously slow at keeping up with the times. How many years went by, for instance, before they accepted credit cards that were already ubiquitous everywhere else?
But in this era of the ever-widening wage gap in America, as the rich get richer and the poor poorer, the Ubers and Lyfts of the world are giving us another lesson in why that's so.
Next month, Uber will make an initial public stock offering - or IPO, as Wall Street calls them.
The bright young techies at the top of the company will come away millionaires and a few, billionaires, and a whole bunch of Wall Street money manipulators will cash in. Following the IPO, the ride-sharing outfit that has flouted local laws and regulations to give itself an unfair advantage over cabs is expected to be worth a record $100 billion.
Among the lucky winners will be Uber's founders (one of them, the notorious Travis Kalanick, already collected $1.4 billion by selling one-third of his shares when he was forced out of management), the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund, mutual fund giant Fidelity and other venture capitalists.
Not so lucky are the thousands of Uber drivers who use their private cars to pick up and drop off people who once used taxis and then share the fares with Uber corporate.
Even the greediest financier should agree it isn't fair.
Where union-represented cab drivers of old had health insurance and pensions, Uber drivers are classified as "independent contractors." They get no benefits and each April 15 have to pay taxes on the money they earned, since there isn't any withholding to make it less painful.
In a business section story earlier this week, The New York Times reported on this disparity by interviewing a number of Uber drivers who are starting to feel left out.
Among them was a driver who has been with Uber since it was founded in 2012. He has made more than 25,000 trips in those years. Peter Ashlock's Nissan Altima has 218,000 miles on it. His passengers, the paper says, give him 4.93 out of five stars. Yet, his adjusted gross income for 2018, his best yet, was roughly $40,000. He has had to max out his credit card for car repairs and he needed to come up with $5,000 to pay taxes on April 15.
A former cab driver himself, he says Uber's biggest innovation, far as he can tell, is getting the drivers to pay the overhead instead of the companies.
Ashlock told The Times that he's proud of his high rating from his customers, even though he's not making much of a living.
His favorite review from his passengers?
"Dude drove like a cabdriver."

Fake photo used to push theory terrorists set fire at Notre Dame -BYLN- By Bob Oswald

Información de publicación: Daily Herald ; Arlington Heights, Ill. [Arlington Heights, Ill]. 21 Apr 2019.

Texto completo: As the 850-year-old Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris was in flames last week, social media was filled with images posted by people at the scene.
But one photo of two men laughing as the cathedral burns behind them was doctored to fuel anti-Muslim rhetoric and falsely claim the fire was set by terrorists, according to PolitiFact.com.
The photo was shared on Facebook with the caption, "Muslims laughing while Notre Dame is burning."
French authorities have said they are not investigating arson or terrorism as a cause of the fire.
According to PolitiFact, the picture was posted on the day of the fire on Sputnik, a site run by the Russian government.
The National Center for Media Forensics at the University of Colorado Denver pointed to an earlier version of the image, PolitiFact said.
"The two front persons are inserted," the center’s director Catalin Grigoras told PolitiFact. He said the image shows obvious editing.
The post was flagged in Facebook’s effort to identify false news and misinformation on its site, PolitiFact said.
YouTube algorithm failed A "misguided algorithm" on YouTube was blamed for information about the 9/11 attacks in the U.S. to be included alongside live streams of the fire at Notre Dame Cathedral, according to The New York Times.
As news feeds of the Paris fire were streamed on YouTube, some were paired up with a panel that included information from the Encyclopaedia Britannica about the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.
The mistake involved a fact-checking feature recently installed by YouTube, the Times said.
The feature is designed to pull information from the Encyclopaedia Britannica and Wikipedia to include with topics which have often been the subject of misinformation, such as the moon landing or the Oklahoma City bombing.
"These panels are triggered algorithmically and our systems sometimes make the wrong call," YouTube said in a statement.
No lawsuit following Pirro comment Social media posts claiming Democratic U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar filed a $100 million lawsuit against Fox News host Jeanine Pirro are false, according to The Associated Press.
During Pirro’s show "Justice with Judge Jeanine" last month, the TV host asked if the wearing of a hijab by Omar, a Muslim, is "antithetical to the U.S. Constitution," AP said.
No lawsuit has been filed in New York, where Fox News is headquartered, in Omar’s home state of Minnesota or in federal court, AP said.
The report of a lawsuit "is false," Omar spokesman Jeremy Slevin told AP.
Pirro’s show was off the air for two weeks following the comment about Omar, AP said.
Ocasio-Cortez was never on ‘Price is Right’ An image making the rounds on social media this month shows an appearance by U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on "The Price is Right," guessing the price of an item as "free."
The photo is fake and accompanies a satirical article published on the website The Babylon Bee, according to Snopes.com.
The false story claims Ocasio-Cortez attended the show and "introduced herself as a U.S. representative and rising star of the Democratic Party," Snopes said. "Every time it was her turn to estimate the price of an item her answer was ‘free,’" the article said.
The doctored image is made up with a combination of an actual photo from an October episode of the daytime game show and a still photo taken from an appearance by Ocasio-Cortez on "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" in June 2018, Snopes said.
The appearance of the contestants on either side of Ocasio-Cortez were also altered to make it appear "less directly tied to an actual episode that aired," said The Babylon Bee, which says in a disclaimer it is a "trusted source for Christian news satire."

Texto completo: Spring and warmth are finally here. It's time for flowers and good books, and hand-held books are making a comeback. With that, here are a few of interest.
"Finding My Voice, My Journey to the White House," by Valerie Jarrett
Jarrett was born in Iran where her father, a doctor, was able to get a better job than he was in America. However, Jarrett grew up in Chicago in the '60s as gender and racial barriers were being challenged. As a corporate lawyer, Jarrett found her voice in the historic administration of Harold Washington - the first black mayor of Chicago - ultimately becoming one of the most visible African-American women of the 21st century. Her work championed equality for women and girls, advancing civil rights, reforming the criminal justice system and improving the lives of working families. She shows us some of the most stirring moments of her time as senior advisor to President Barrack Obama. Jarrett's optimistic perspective on leadership and citizenship shines throughout the book.
"The Quiet Rise of Introverts," by Brenda Knowles
More than 30 percent of people we encounter are introverts. In her book, Brenda Knowles outlines eight practices for living and loving in a noisy world. This is a guide to help tender-hearted and introverted people grow and nurture peace, purpose and relationships.
Knowles is a speaker and life coach who shares her practices to help introverts learn they are not alone, or flawed in their introversion. As a certified Myers-Briggs practitioner, Knowles has provided training as a family mediator. Her guidance is meant to lead to a calmer sense of self, an understanding mental and physical self-care, bravery in the face of positive conflict and daily healing.
"The Second Mountain," by David Brooks
Brooks, a columnist for the New York Times, describes the necessity of a second half of life that does not include pleasing others. He opens with, "people of the first mountain spend a lot of time on reputation management. They're trying to win the victories the ego enjoys." How does the second mountain evolve? Through extreme adversity. The soul is exposed. Our lives are defined by how we make use of our adversity. Prayer, meditation and writing are three ways we are in contact with our deepest desires. We learn to be more aware of others' plights and the avenues of help.
Brooks describes the discontent in our society. He states it is not just a political problem, but a moral and spiritual problem. We don't treat one another well. The center of our lives and happiness has become "us." When you are on the second mountain, happiness is good, but joy is better.
"My Beloved World," by Sonia Sotomayor
In August 2009, Sotomayor became the first Hispanic and third woman to assume a seat on the Supreme Court. Her autobiography takes us to a Bronx housing project, an alcoholic father who died when she was nine and an overburdened mother. Her grandmother, her mentor, taught her to depend on herself. Sotomayor writes that since she's become a justice, many groups have asked how she overcame her early circumstances to find success, and why adversity spurred her on instead of knocking her down. She says the questions forced her to dig deep for the answer and realize she had sources of deep happiness that gave her an optimism stronger than any adversity. "The goals of success should be in the quality and not the quantity of successes," she wrote.
"Educated," by Tara Westover
This is a memoir about a young girl born into a survivalist family in the mountains of Idaho. She was kept from attending school by her family, isolated from mainstream society. There was no one to ensure the children received an education. There was no one to intervene when one of Westover's brothers became violent. When one of her brothers got into college, Westover decided she'd start a new life. She was 17 when she first stepped into a classroom. From there, her quest for knowledge intensified. Westover went on to attend Harvard University and later earn a doctorate from Cambridge University. Then, Westover wondered if she'd ever find her way home.
"The Cemetery Road," by Glen Iles
Marshall McEwan left his hometown at age 18 vowing never to return. He became one of the most successful journalists in Washington, D.C. Just as the chaos in Washington was lifting him to new heights, he found himself breaking his boyhood vow. His father was dying and his mother was struggling to keep the family newspaper from disappearing.
McEwan's high school sweetheart, Jet, had married into the patriarchal Mathieson family. She is killed in her own bed and her husband, Max, is the only one in the house. While the Matheison family is at the heart of the crime schemes through the power of money and politics, there is an even more compelling scheme at the heart of the family and the town's Poker Club.

Texto completo: Unfettered from White House advisers’ attempts to rein in his more abrasive and reckless tweets, Mar-a-Lago provides President Donald Trump the freedom to tweet to his 59.8 million Twitter followers with abandon.
Dozens of unfiltered tweets have emanated from the gilded, heavily fortified club during the president’s time in office. There was the tweet on Nov. 21, 2017 in which Trump called LaVar Ball, the NBA player imprisoned in China on shoplifting charges, “a poor man’s version of Don King without the hair.”
Two days later he tweeted that Time magazine had called him to say he was “probably” going to be named Man of the Year but turned down an interview
and photo shoot, saying “probably” was not good enough.
Among all the Mar-a-Lago tweets, five were cited among dozens referenced in Mueller’s report on Russian interference in the November 2016 presidential election and whether Trump obstructed the investigation.
Trump posted the first tweet from Mar-a-Lago mentioned in the report on Dec. 30, 2016 — during his Christmas holiday visit to Palm Beach, just three weeks before his inauguration. Mueller cited the tweet on page 7 in a timeline of Russian contact with the Trump campaign and again on page 172 in detailing actions of incoming national security adviser Michael Flynn.
A day before Trump’s tweet, then-President Barack Obama had imposed sanctions on Russia for having interfered in the election.
Flynn called Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak and asked Russia not to escalate the situation in response to the sanctions. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov remarked that Russia would respond in kind to the sanctions.
But the following day, Putin announced that Russia would not take retaliate in response to the sanctions at that time. Hours later, President-elect Trump tweeted, “Great move on delay (by V. Putin) — I always knew he was very smart!.”
Trump posted the next Mar-a-Lago tweets mentioned in the report while en route to his West Palm Beach golf club on the morning of April 21, 2018.
The fiery, three-part tweetstorm followed an article a day earlier co-authored by Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times White House correspondent Maggie Haberman. In the article, published 11 days after the FBI raided the offices of Trump attorney Michael Cohen, Haberman questioned Cohen’s loyalty to Trump after years of what she described as demeaning behavior by Trump.
In the first segment of the tweet, Trump blasted the Times and Haberman, whom he called “third rate reporter,” for “going out of their way to destroy Michael Cohen and his relationship with me in the hope that he will ‘flip.’”
He continued with a follow-up tweet, accusing the reporters of using “non-existent ‘sources’,” and praising Cohen, saying he had “always liked & respected” Cohen. As for Cohen flipping, Trump said in a third tweet that he didn’t see Cohen “doing that despite the horrible Witch Hunt and dishonest media!”
However, Cohen did flip. In August 2018, Cohen pleaded guilty to eight criminal charges in New York, including two in which he implicated Trump in campaign finance violations. In November 2018, he pleaded guilty to misleading congressional investigators. Cohen was sentenced to three-years in prison, ordered to pay a $50,000 fine and is continuing to cooperate with investigators.
Mueller cited the tweets on pages 146 and 147 of the second section of the report, which deals with the obstruction investigation.
Mueller cited another tweet from Mar-a-Lago on April 22, 2018 as part of a cluster of tweets in which the president harshly criticized then Attorney General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself from the investigation.
In that tweet, referenced in a footnote on page 110 of the second section of the report, Trump noted a Fox News report about Republican lawmakers asking Attorney General Jeff Sessions to investigate former FBI Director James Comey and Hillary Clinton, tweeting “Good luck with that request!”
Although Trump’s tweets, including several of the ones from Mar-a-Lago, were part of the evidence in the 448-page report, in a press conference on Thursday Attorney General William Barr dismissed the evidence of potential obstruction by Trump saying the president “was frustrated and angered by a sincere belief that the investigation was undermining his presidency.”

Texto completo: After being woken up by the distant cries of his 14-month-old son, a father wrestled the child away from a dingo that had dragged him from a van in Queensland, Australia, on Friday, according to local officials.
The father's quick action on Fraser Island, a tourist destination where the wild dogs known as dingoes are protected by law, prevented what might have been a more tragic ending.
The child, who was taken by helicopter to a hospital in stable condition, suffered a fractured skull and several puncture wounds, the boy's parents said in a statement. He was to undergo surgery on Friday.
"He's not out of the clear, but it could have been a lot worse than what it was," Michael Porter, a Queensland Ambulance Service flight paramedic, told reporters.
Ben Du Toit, a paramedic who arrived on the scene, told reporters the child had been dragged several yards away from the van after midnight while the family was sleeping. The father fought off several other dingoes besides the one that grabbed his son, Mr. Du Toit said.
Fraser Island gets about 400,000 visitors per year and is well known for its roughly 200 dingoes, which roam free on most of the island. Human-dingo interactions are relatively rare, and attacks on humans are even rarer.
But it was the third dingo attack this year on the island, where officials train visitors on how to stay safe from the dogs. A 6-year-old boy was bitten on the legs in January, and the following month a 9-year-old boy and his mother were both bitten. The latter attack led to the euthanization of two dingoes.
A dingo was also euthanized in July after biting a woman and a child.
When dingoes do attack humans, children are often the targets "because their size does not intimidate a dingo as much as an adult person," according to the Queensland Department of Environment and Science.
It was not known why the dingo attacked the toddler on Friday.
Visitors to Fraser Island are encouraged never to feed the dingoes, which have a diverse range of prey, including fish, small reptiles, rodents, bandicoots, wallabies and kangaroos.
Dingoes live throughout Australia, where they are believed to have been introduced about 4,000 years ago. They are classified as a wild dog not native to Australia, which means they can be legally trapped or killed in many places. Their legal status has long been debated, with some arguing that they need more protections.
The debate resurfaces each time there is a high-profile attack. A 9-year-old boy was killed by a dingo on Fraser Island in 2001, leading to a controversial culling of the dingo population there.
Dingo attacks are most closely associated with the 1980 case of Azaria Chamberlain, whose disappearance attracted media coverage in Australia that rivaled the American fixation on O.J. Simpson. Her mother, Lindy Chamberlain, said the girl was taken by a dingo from a tent in the outback, but the body was never found and she was convicted of murder.
Though Ms. Chamberlain was set free three years later when the verdict was overturned, the mystery captivated Australians for decades until she was finally cleared in 2012, when a coroner ruled that the child had been killed by a dingo.
The animals had been considered a problem well before that. In 1938, The New York Times wrote of the "DINGO MENACE IN AUSTRALIA."
"Public enemy No. 1 in Northeast Australia is the dingo, or wild dog, which is held to do as much damage as all other pests put together," the newspaper wrote.

Half of England Is Owned by Less Than 1% of Its Population, Book Says

Texto completo: LONDON -- Land ownership in England, a source of enormous wealth, is often shielded by a culture of secrecy harking back to the Middle Ages. But a researcher says that after years of digging, he has an answer:
Less than 1 percent of the population -- including aristocrats, royals and wealthy investors -- owns about half of the land, according to "Who Owns England," a book that is to be published in May. And many of them inherited the property as members of families that have held it for generations -- even centuries.
In the book, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times, the author, Guy Shrubsole, an environmental activist and writer, identifies many of the owners and compiles data gathered by peppering public bodies with freedom of information requests and combing through the 25 million title records in the government's Land Registry.
He reached a striking conclusion -- that in England, home to about 56 million people, half the country belongs to just 25,000 landowners, some of them corporations.
The findings go to the heart of a potent political issue -- economic inequality -- that is roiling nations and feeding populist movements on multiple continents. Leaders of the opposition Labour Party seized on Mr. Shrubsole's findings, first published this week in the newspaper The Guardian, as evidence for the case they have made for years against the governing Conservative Party.
"Don't let anyone tell you our country doesn't need radical change," Jeremy Corbyn, the party leader, wrote on Twitter as he shared The Guardian's article on Thursday.
Comparison to other developed countries is difficult, because they do not have national land registries. Records can be viewed only one at a time through hundreds of local registry officers, they are not fully open to the public and, as in the United States, ownership can be obscured through shell corporations.
But Britain has greater wealth inequality than peers like Germany, France, the Low Countries and Scandinavia -- though less than the United States. And Britain has not seen the kinds of wars and revolutions that over centuries wiped away sprawling estates owned by nobility in most of Europe.
Who owns the "green and pleasant land" of the English countryside can be a well-kept secret, in part because a large segment of it does not even figure in public records. Government efforts to make a public accounting of land ownership date to the 19th century, but according to the Land Registry, about 15 percent of the country's area, most of it rural, is still unrecorded.
"Much of the land owned by the Crown, the aristocracy, and the Church has not been registered, because it has never been sold, which is one of the main triggers for compulsory registration," the registry, which covers England and Wales, says on its website.
Mr. Shrubsole began documenting England's estates after the referendum on Britain's withdrawal from the European Union, known as Brexit, in 2016. "If Brexit really meant 'taking back control of our country,' then I'd like at least to know who owns it," he wrote in an op-ed in The Guardian a year after the vote.
Real estate prices in England are among the highest in Europe and have soared over the last generation. Mr. Shrubsole's book documents ownership, maps unregistered land and argues that the concentration of ownership helps keep available land scarce and expensive.
Houses, stores, office buildings, schools and farms are often held under long-term leases, paying a steady stream of rents -- directly or through intermediate leaseholders -- to major landowners.
Mr. Shrubsole said that by publishing his research, he wanted to start a conversation.
"It should prompt a proper debate about the need for land reform in England," Mr. Shrubsole said. The issue of land relates to the country's housing crisis, to economic inequality, to climate change and the intensive use of farmland, he added.
The ancient idea that wealth meant land does not always hold true in modern times. But in Britain, land accounted for half of the country's net worth in 2016, according to data from the Office of National Statistics -- double that of Germany and higher than in countries like France, Canada and Japan.
Britain's net worth more than tripled between 1995 and 2017, driven primarily by the value of land, which rose much faster than other kinds of assets.
"The main economic challenge and the social justice issue is that for the last 30, 40 years, landowners have enjoyed enormous unearned windfall gains at a faster rate than wages or the economy have grown," said Josh Ryan-Collins, head of research at the Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose at University College London.
"There is nothing that the landowners have done to earn those incomes," he said.
Even agricultural land has become the object of speculative demand, pushing prices and gains for landowners up further, he said.
But even if land reform has not been on the agenda of the Conservative government, it has had to address the housing crisis and agricultural subsidies. Recently, Conservatives have focused their criticism on the European Union's farming and forestry subsidy system, which has put aristocrats, the royal family and wealthy investors among the top recipients of taxpayer-funded aid.
Queen Elizabeth II's estate in Sandringham, north of London, received £695,000 in aid in 2017, or more than $900,000, according to a public database of payments.
An agriculture bill, currently in Parliament, promises to change farm subsidies after Brexit. Instead of direct payments based on the total amount of land farmed, payments in the new system would be based on factors like contributions to the environment, animal welfare and public access to the property.
"As we know, many of the beneficiaries are not even U.K. or E.U. citizens, but foreign citizens who happen to have invested in agricultural land," Michael Gove, Britain's environment secretary, said during a debate on the bill in Parliament last year. "It is a simple matter of social justice and economic efficiency that we need to change that system."
Most of the European Union is also grappling with concentrated ownership of farmland, though not to the same degree. A 2017 report by European Parliament lawmakers said that in 2010, 3 percent of farms controlled half the agricultural land with in the bloc.
"Agricultural land is not an ordinary traded good, as soil is nonrenewable and access to it is a human right," the report said. "As with the concentration of financial wealth, too high a concentration of agricultural land splits society, destabilizes rural areas, threatens food safety and thus jeopardizes the environmental and social objectives of Europe."
Scotland, where land ownership is in the hands of even fewer people and organizations, has enacted a set of land reform laws. In 2004, it abolished feudal rules that were still in effect, helping many longtime tenants to become outright owners of their land. Other legislation introduced the right to roam, giving the public access to vast privately held lands.
"The example of successful land reform programs in other countries, like Scotland, should give us hope," Mr. Shrubsole wrote in his book. "Get land reform right, and we can go a long way towards ending the housing crisis, restoring nature and making our society more equal."

Fake news? Mueller isn’t buying it

Texto completo: NEW YORK -- President Donald Trump and his team love to deride unfavorable stories as "fake news," but it's clear from Robert Mueller's report that the special counsel isn't buying it.
While there are a few exceptions, Mueller's investigation repeatedly supports news reporting that was done on the Russia probe over the last two years and details several instances where the president and his team sought to mislead the public.
"The media looks a lot stronger today than it did before the release of this report," Kyle Pope, editor of the Columbia Journalism Review, said Friday.
Trump's supporters believe that Mueller's determination that there was not enough evidence to show that the president or his team worked with the Russians to influence the 2016 election delegitimizes the attention given to the story.
Fox News Channel's Laura Ingraham message to the news media: "You owe us an apology."
But the news stories were, for the great part, accurate.
For instance, Mueller's report shows The New York Times and The Washington Post were correct when they reported in January 2018 that Trump ordered White House counsel Don McGahn to make sure Mueller was fired, and that McGahn decided to resign rather than carry that out. When the Times first reported the story, Trump described it as "fake news, folks, fake news."
The Mueller report also showed that Trump directed a series of aides to ask McGahn to publicly deny the story, and ultimately asked himself, too. McGahn refused, saying the story was accurate, the report found.
In a July 2017 story, the Times reported that the president personally wrote a statement in which he falsely said that an election year meeting between some Russians and his son, Donald Jr., was about the adoption of Russian children, rather than about obtaining potentially damaging information on Hillary Clinton's campaign. Trump's counsel repeatedly responded that the president had no role in writing the statement, yet months later testified under oath to investigators that Trump had dictated it.
Mueller's report also backed up the newspaper's stories, which the administration denied at the time, that Trump demanded loyalty from then-FBI Director James Comey at a private dinner, and that Trump had asked Comey to end an investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn.
"The Mueller report confirmed again and again that stories in The New York Times for the past two years were the opposite of 'fake news,'" said Elisabeth Bumiller, the paper's Washington bureau chief. "They were meticulously reported, carefully sourced and accurate stories that told readers what was really going on at the White House."
Washington Post columnist David Ignatius reported before Trump's inauguration that Flynn had talked to Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak about sanctions placed on Russia by the outgoing Obama administration. Mueller said that Trump put out word that he wanted Flynn to kill the story, and that Flynn ordered aide K.T. McFarland to deny it to the Post, "although she knew she was providing false information."
Others in the administration, including Vice President Mike Pence, also denied it. Flynn resigned when the truth became evident.
Trump repeatedly said during the 2016 campaign that he had no business dealings in Russia when, even as he uttered the words, his company was seeking to build a Trump Towers office building in Moscow. When Trump's lawyer, Michael Cohen, privately pointed out that the denial was untrue, the future president said "why mention it if it is not a deal?" the report said.
Mueller also determined that a statement by White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders that Comey had been unpopular with rank-and-file members of his agency "was not founded on anything." Sanders said on ABC Friday that her statement was "a slip of the tongue."
Mueller, however, did shoot down a BuzzFeed News report that Trump had directed Cohen to lie to Congress about the timing of the Moscow project. Mueller said that while it appeared Trump knew Cohen was lying to Congress, "the evidence available to us does not establish that the president directed or aided Cohen's false testimony."
BuzzFeed News editor-in-chief Ben Smith said the organization's sources, who were federal law enforcement officials, "interpreted the evidence Cohen presented as meaning that the president 'directed' Cohen to lie. We now know that Mueller did not."
Smith said BuzzFeed will continue to pursue the story through Freedom of Information requests and in court.
Mueller also contradicted a McClatchy news service story alleging that Cohen had traveled to Prague, in the Czech Republic, in summer 2016 to meet with Russians involved in the effort to influence the election. Mueller's report said that Cohen had not gone to Prague.
McClatchy attached an editor's note to its story reporting Mueller's conclusion but adding that his report "is silent on whether the investigators received evidence that Mr. Cohen's phone pinged in an area near Prague, as McClatchy reported."
CJR's Pope said so many of the stories surrounding Trump had been made foggy by denials and "fake news" claims over the past two years. He said he was surprised so much of Mueller's report backed up journalists, although it's too soon to tell whether the findings will influence two very divided political camps.
"I think it casts the coverage of him in a much different light," he said.

Texto completo: Imagine that. Playoff thrills locally, after all.
It was supposed to be over by now. The Lakers left us months ago except for their managerial meltdown. The Clippers were supposed to be finished off by Golden State before anyone noticed they were in the postseason.
Instead, in yet another miracle, the Clippers staged the biggest playoff comeback in NBA history, coming from 31 down to win Game 2 in Oakland to make a series of it, after making a season of it when no one expected that.
Or, as Coach Doc Rivers told his players: “We don’t die. We multiply. We’re like roaches.”
Whatever they are, they have a promising future as well as a lot of heart, about to pursue Kevin Durant and Kawhi Leonard with salary cap space, with charismatic figures such as Rivers and Jerry West to lead their recruiting effort and an inspiring story to tell.
Then there are the Lakers … or there would be if they weren’t in hiding.
Since Magic Johnson dropped the big one on them – 12 days ago – no team official has appeared in public. This suggests its own message:
The Lakers’ road ahead involves massive secrecy and an inability to handle hard times?
Suggesting how overwhelmed Jeanie Buss is, she hasn’t told her people to make an appearance, or said anything herself, other than her flowery Twitter paean to Johnson (“Earvin, I loved working side by side with you. You’ve brought us a long way. We will continue the journey. We love you.”)
Did Jeanie miss the one about someone trying to pin the blame for drafting Lonzo Ball on her?
Oh, well, kids fight in the best of families.
There has been no sign of General Manager Rob Pelinka, whom Buss is standing by after Magic reportedly tried to fire him for “back-stabbing” him.
LeBron James, the mainstay of social media, has yet to mention Magic’s departure or his own hopes going forward.
Of course, no one has glimpsed the secretive Kobe Bryant, who declined Jeanie’s offer to take over with Magic in 2017 and doesn’t look interested in doing it now.
If no one knows what’s going on, it’s likely that she has reached out to Bryant.
A source says Kobe’s importance to Jeanie explains why Pelinka, Kobe’s former agent whom Magic gored, remains in place with enhanced powers and no thought of replacing him.
Elsewhere, Pelinka is regarded with open skepticism. The New York Times’ Marc Stein called him “a polarizing figure” with “numerous reports of trust issues – not only in his dealings with other teams and former rivals in the agent world but also former Lakers players (Larry Nance Jr. and Andrew Bogut) who were jettisoned after broken promises.”
Actually, “broken promises,” or reassurances that don’t turn out to be true, are common enough for GMs.
Nevertheless, Pelinka did, indeed, have a controversy-filled career as an agent. Now in the bullseye after Magic’s accusations – if only for joking, “Where’s Earvin?” – the buzzards have come home to roost.
As for any hope that Bryant will ride to the rescue, he’s not one to agonize about decisions. If he had any interest in taking over, we would have heard about it by now.
Kobe isn’t taking questions about it but did in March, telling Slam Magazine’s Tzvi Twersky, “The answer is no, I’m not doing it.
“I’m not interested … not even (for) a couple years. I’m just not interested. I don’t want to be a GM. I don’t want to own a team. I don’t want to coach. I have no interest in any of that. That’s an easy answer for me.”
Of course, Kobe might still be in the loop, even if he has no desire to run anything day by day. As such, he’s like the man behind the curtain in “The Wizard of Oz.”
Whether Kobe’s counsel is helpful remains to be seen. Bold and intelligent as he is, he has no experience running teams and enthusiastically endorsed Magic’s half-baked idea about not needing shooters.
In a perfect irony, there is one former Lakers great who’s still in the game and would have been invaluable. Of course, that’s West, whom the Lakers – presumably, Magic – declined to hire when he was hoping to be invited back.
Jeanie is widely considered good people, but her obsession with Lakers Family … which she treasures as her birthright from the father she worshiped … keeps her from thinking clearly, or at all.
Outside her cocoon, it looks like they’ve gone as far as they can with former Lakers … the approach that backfired so badly with Magic proving temperamentally unsuited to his job … but it’s continuing.
With the Lakers’ marquee stature and the vast resources conferred by a $3 billion TV deal, they should attract top management people like Golden State GM Bob Myers, San Antonio’s R.C. Buford, Oklahoma City’s Sam Presti or Houston’s Daryl Morey.
Reaching out to them would have meant asking their teams for permission. Nothing like that happened.
The well-regarded David Griffin, a LeBron ally as Cleveland GM, was available. With no Lakers interest, he accepted a job with New Orleans days after Magic stepped down.
“Jeanie is great,” a GM said, “but she is too insulated and has made no effort to expand her knowledge base outside the Laker family. They won’t get A.D. (Anthony Davis) because they don’t have the best package.”
Ominously for whoever’s in charge, the Lakers’ scheduled return to greatness is based on acquiring Davis in a trade with New Orleans, which looks ever-more problematic.
For months, I wrote the Lakers were the favorites as A.D.’s preferred destination. Now NBA people say several Western Conference contenders, desperate at being capped by the Warriors, could make attractive offers without assurances he will re-sign in the summer of 2020.
Teams never used to run such risks, but things have changed.
Toronto did it a year ago, trading DeMar DeRozan to San Antonio for Leonard.
Presti did it two years ago, trading Victor Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis to Indiana for Paul George, who was supposedly Lakers-bound but re-signed in OKC. If that wasn’t enough, Presti might be ready to offer Steven Adams for A.D.
Houston, run by Morey, another tightrope walker, could offer Clint Capela.
Meanwhile, in Portland, Trail Blazers players are wooing A.D. openly, as if they were Lakers.
“I’m saying, ‘OK, Anthony Davis, we’ve got a winning culture. We win. We’re not jealous of each other. We have a good time,’ ” Damian Lillard told The Ringer.
“He’ll win. He’ll get to be himself and he’ll get to be on a team that fits. I think he would be perfect for us.”
By week’s end, the Warriors had reasserted themselves, leading the Clippers by 36 in Game 3 at Staples Center and winning by 27, showing what happens when you get them mad.
Still, it was magical for the Clippers, if only for the three days between Games 2 and 3.
As for the Lakers, everyone might have to scale down hopes. At present, their fans just want to make sure they haven’t left town.

Texto completo: Lies, damned lies and presidential aides' misstatements.
The Mueller report on Thursday revealed several instances when aides to President Donald Trump, while under oath, acknowledged that statements they once stood by were based on something other than facts or truth.
Take, for instance, the afternoon of May 10, 2017, when White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters that former FBI Director James Comey had been fired because he’d lost the confidence of President Trump, the Department of Justice and members of both parties in Congress. And, for good measure: “Most importantly, the rank and file of the FBI had lost confidence in Comey. ”
Sanders went on to say that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein had decided “on his own” to examine Comey’s performance and then expressed his concerns to Trump about them on May 8.
Mueller report: Trump took steps to fire Mueller, stop probe after campaign welcomed Russian dirt on Clinton, Mueller report says
The obstruction question: President Trump tried to impede Russia inquiry but aides ignored his orders
Collusion: Trump campaign was an eager beneficiary of Russian election help, Mueller report concludes
A reporter challenged Sanders, saying Comey, in fact, had enjoyed support from the vast majority of FBI agents. “Look,” Sanders chided the reporter, “we’ve heard from countless members of the FBI that say very different things. "
But it was Sanders who said very different things when questioned by Mueller’s investigators about her comment.
“Sanders told this Office that her reference to hearing from ‘countless members of the FBI’ was a ‘slip of the tongue,’” according to the report. “She also recalled that her statement in a separate press interview that rank-and-file FBI agents had lost confidence in Comey was a comment she made 'in the heat of the moment' that was not founded on anything. ”
Hours after the report was released, Sanders appeared on Fox News but did not apologize, explaining that she merely misspoke when she used the word "countless. "
"I acknowledge that I had a slip of the tongue when I used the word 'countless,' but it's not untrue," she said, adding that her point at the time was that "a number of both current and former FBI agents agreed with the president. James Comey was a disgraced leaker who tried to politicize and undermine the very agency he was supposed to run. "
On Friday, Sanders maintained on ABC News' Good Morning America that she hadn't lied to reporters, parsing her statement to say that it hinged on her use of the word, "countless. "
"Actually, if you look at what I said, I said the 'slip of the tongue' was in using the word 'countless,' but there were a number of FBI, both former and current, that agreed with the president's decision, and they've continued to speak out and say that and send notice to the White House of that agreement with the president's decision," Sanders said.
The same incident found former White House spokesman Sean Spicer spreading misinformation about Comey's firing. The report determined that the decision to fire Comey had originated with Trump, who later pressed Rosenstein to own the decision.
VP: What the Mueller report on the Russia investigation says about Mike Pence
'Oh my God. This is terrible':Top quotes from special counsel Robert Mueller's report
'I do not recall':Read Trump's written answers to Mueller on Russian contacts, Trump Tower meeting
"The President then called Rosenstein directly and said he was watching Fox News, that the coverage had been great, and that he wanted Rosenstein to do a press conference," the report says. "Rosenstein responded that this was not a good idea because if the press asked him, he would tell the truth that Corney's firing was not his idea. "
Spicer, at an impromptu news conference, picked up where Rosenstein would not tread, telling reporters: "It was all (Rosenstein). No one from the White House," the report says.
President Trump himself is shown elsewhere in the report urging top aides to issue false statements. But that didn’t always work.
Irate over a report in The New York Times that he had urged White House Counsel Don McGahn to fire Mueller, Trump directed McGahn to issue a statement denying the story. McGahn refused to do so several times, according the report.
“The President nevertheless persisted and asked McGahn to repudiate facts that McGahn had repeatedly said were accurate,” according to the report.
In the end, McGahn held firm.
Mueller's investigators unpacked this trunk full of lies from Trump campaign officials. The "investigation established that several individuals affiliated with the Trump campaign lied to (Mueller's office) and to Congress, about their interactions with Russian-affiliated individuals and related matters. Those lies materially impaired the investigation of Russian election interference," the report stated.
'A damning document': Democrats call Mueller report's details disturbing, vow hearings
Takeaways: Trump thought Mueller would 'end' his presidency and other takeaways from the Mueller report
Some of those who lied, according to the report, violated the federal law:
Former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to lying about his interactions with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the transition.
George Papadopoulos, a foreign policy adviser during the campaign, pleaded guilty to lying about the nature and timing of his interactions with a source who told Papadopoulos that the Russians had dirt on Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Trump's former personal attorney Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about the Trump Moscow project.
Trump's former campaign manager Paul Manafort lied to Mueller's investigators and the grand jury concerning his interactions and communications with Konstantin Kilimnik about Trump Campaign polling data and a peace plan for Ukraine.

Texto completo: State Sen. Randy Feenstra massively outraised incumbent Rep. Steve King in the first reported filings, according to recent Federal Election Commission filings.
Feenstra, one of multiple Republicans running to oust Rep. Steve King for Iowa's 4th District, raised $260,442 since his campaign launched on Jan. 9. King raised $61,666 between Jan. 1 and March 31.
Feenstra, of Hull, had some high-profile donors, including former Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad and conservative commentator Ben Shapiro.
The primary challenge comes after a troubled few months for King. The Kiron Republican was quoted in a New York Times story asking, "White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?"
King, who has later said his words were misinterpreted, faced criticism from politicians and pundits from both parties for the comments. The backlash culminated in House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy removing King from his House committee assignments in January.
Feenstra's campaign capitalized on the controversy — and many national conservative voices pointed to his campaign online as a Republican alternative to King. Shapiro contributed $2,800 to Feenstra's campaign and encouraged others to do the same.
Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, gave $1,000 to King's challenger. As governor, Branstad had campaigned with King. Branstad has not publicly commented on King's recent comments, nor has he officially endorsed Feenstra.
Two other Republicans are also running for the nomination. Woodbury County supervisor Jeremy Taylor raised $57,928 during the time period and Bret Richards of Irwin raised $17,556 and took out $48,000 in loans.
But fundraising disparities haven't taken King down in previous elections. J.D. Scholten, a Democrat who ran for the 4th District seat last year, raised more than $3.2 million. where King raised just $876,229.
King won the race, though by a more narrow margin than his previous elections in the deep-red district.
So far, King's campaign had spent $69,501 — $7,835 more than the campaign raised in the first few months of 2019. In comparison, Feenstra had spent just $20,758 as of March 31.
The representative also held a Pocahontas County town hall in Laurens at the town library Wednesday. He did not talk about his re-election campaign at the stop, but said he's worked with getting FEMA out to flooded areas and working to get funding for flooded areas in Iowa.
"Floods, in my opinion, are the worst kind of disaster," King said. "We're working to get the flood relief appropriations reliefs done. That got voted down in the U.S. Senate over a political tug-of-war over resources for Puerto Rico."
A spokesman for the Federal Emergency Management Agency told the Register last week that funding packages currently under consideration in Congress would not have an impact on "the ongoing assistance being provided to affected individuals and local governments in Iowa as a result of the March flooding."
State Sen. Randy Feenstra, left, is challenging Rep. Steve King in the GOP primary for the 4th District seat.

U.S. Scholar Says Beijing Thwarted Request to Visit

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- An American scholar who has advised President Trump on China said late Wednesday that he was not given a visa he sought to attend a recent conference in Beijing, in what he called apparent retaliation for American restrictions on visas for visiting Chinese scholars.
The scholar, Michael Pillsbury, director for Chinese strategy at the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank in Washington, said he applied for a visa with the Chinese Embassy in Washington on March 22 but failed to get approval to attend the conference last Sunday, which was organized by a research institute in Beijing.
Mr. Pillsbury said that when he raised the issue with a Chinese Communist Party official he knows, the official pointed to a recent New York Times article that said counterintelligence officials at the F.B.I. had been canceling the long-term visas of some Chinese scholars.
Mr. Pillsbury said he took that to imply that his visa application had been stymied in reprisal for the new restrictions.
"They're very, very clever not to say the visa was denied -- just not issuing it in time to get there," he said in an interview on Wednesday night. Axios first reported on Mr. Pillsbury's visa problem on Wednesday.
Mr. Pillsbury said American officials told him earlier on Wednesday that they thought China had begun retaliating against the Trump administration's visa crackdown. He used a Chinese idiom to characterize the move: killing a chicken to scare the monkeys, which means sending a warning by making someone an example.
"In other words, if even Trump's adviser Pillsbury can be subtly delayed and miss a trade conference, what does that mean to other scholars without a personal relationship with the president?" he said.
Mr. Trump has consulted with Mr. Pillsbury about China and spoken effusively about him, publicly calling him "the leading authority on China" several times.
The Times reported on Sunday that the F.B.I. had rescinded or put on review the visas of as many as 30 Chinese scholars who visit the United States, reflecting growing concern about Chinese intelligence-gathering.
The report drew widespread attention in China, including follow-up reports from Global Times, an influential nationalist tabloid and news site. It said this week that 280 or more Chinese scholars in the humanities and social sciences had seen their visas for the United States canceled or blocked, or had been "harassed" by the F.B.I. It did not cite a source for that number.
"The only plausible explanation is that the self-confidence of the United States really is rapidly rupturing and shrinking," Global Times said in a separate editorial. "This is the brazen behavior of a 'police state."'
Hu Xijin, chief editor of Global Times, wrote on Twitter on Thursday that it was logical that Mr. Pillsbury's visa problems were tied to the F.B.I.'s visa campaign. Mr. Hu said he believed that "there will be other American scholars who could be denied Chinese visa."
Such sentiments may seem ironic to American scholars who have been denied permission to visit China in recent decades. They include Perry Link, a professor of Chinese who most recently has taught at the University of California, Riverside, and Andrew Nathan, a professor of political science at Columbia University.
Other researchers and former officials from the United States and other Western countries have said they became wary of visiting China after two Canadians living there -- Michael Kovrig, a former diplomat turned researcher, and Michael Spavor, a businessman -- were detained in December.
Mr. Pillsbury, who was a Pentagon official during the Reagan administration, has written about China's military strategy. He is best known for "The Hundred-Year Marathon," a book about what he says is the Chinese goal of supplanting the United States as the world's dominant power by 2049. Other China experts in the United States have criticized Mr. Pillsbury's use of sources and his conclusions.
Mr. Pillsbury has maintained contact with a range of Chinese officials, including ones in the People's Liberation Army. In 2015, he hosted Col. Liu Mingfu, a hawkish retired officer and author, at a dinner party at his Georgetown home. Mr. Pillsbury has said he believes it is important to have exchanges with Chinese counterparts in order to better understand the Communist Party's ambitions and strategies.
Mr. Pillsbury said that until this incident, he had never had a visa request denied or go unapproved since he began visiting China in the late 1970s. He has been to China more than 50 times, and this would have been his fifth visit since Mr. Trump was elected in 2016, he said.
The host of the conference in Beijing was the Center for China and Globalization. Mr. Pillsbury, citing Chinese associates, said that the conference had also invited Wendy Cutler, a former United States trade official, but that she had also failed to get a visa. Ms. Cutler could not be reached for comment late Wednesday night.
In a Chinese online announcement, the center had listed Mr. Pillsbury and Ms. Cutler among those expected to attend the conference. Mr. Pillsbury said he had also planned to attend an event at the United State Embassy hosted by Ambassador Terry Branstad.
A spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Lu Kang, said at a regular news briefing in Beijing that he did not know the specifics of Mr. Pillsbury's case. But he said China welcomed American visitors who were "willing to actively encourage Chinese-American exchanges and mutual understanding between the two countries."
Mr. Pillsbury said he thought his visa problem could also be linked to trade tensions with China, which escalated sharply last year after Mr. Trump announced additional tariffs on Chinese goods. Negotiators from both countries are struggling to reach an agreement that would cool the tensions.
Mr. Pillsbury said he had hoped to meet with former Chinese officials at the Sunday conference who had connections to the current Chinese trade negotiators.

Texto completo: During the 2016 presidential campaign and transition, Donald J. Trump and at least 18 campaign officials and advisers had contacts with more than two dozen Russian nationals and WikiLeaks, or their intermediaries, a New York Times analysis found. The report of Robert S. Mueller III, released to the public on Thursday, revealed at least 30 more contacts than previously known. Over the past two and a half years, Mr. Trump and many of his associates repeatedly denied having any interactions even though evidence showed otherwise. Knowledge of these interactions is also based on Times reporting, documents submitted to Congress and court records. Among these contacts are more than 100 in-person meetings, phone calls, text messages, emails and private messages on Twitter. Very few of these interactions were publicly known before the inauguration. Despite many offers from Russian-affiliated individuals to aid Mr. Trump's campaign, Mr. Mueller, the special counsel, found no evidence that Mr. Trump or any of his aides coordinated with the Russian government's interference in the election.

Texto completo: For someone who describes himself as a person who makes a living just "trying to make people chuckle," Wyatt Cenac is doing some pretty heavy lifting. Cenac, who is also an actor ("People of Earth," "Medicine for Melancholy"), writer ("The Daily Show With Jon Stewart," "Family Guy"), and standup comedian, is in the second season of his HBO series "Problem Areas," which he both hosts and executive produces. Last Wednesday, April 10, Cenac screened the second episode of tliis season for an audience in Manhattan, followed by a panel discussion with New York Times writer Nikole Hannah-Jones, Brooklyn Research and Service I Iigh School Pr.ncipal Allison Farrington, and advocate Jasmine Gripper, legislative director for Alliance for a Quality Education.
"Problem Areas" is a documentary series that successfully tackles important issues via Cenac's wry comic touch. Cenac devoted his inaugural season to taking a deep dive into law enforcement and its complicated relationship with communities across the nation. This season, "Problem Areas" takes on public education. Issues examined include teacher pay, mental health, school lunch and school safety, which was the main subject of the episode screened, and discussion.
Cenac shoots the series on location in schools and communities in New York City, West Virginia, Minneapolis, among other states giving a real world flavor to the experiences of his subjects. He holds pointed, if playfully sardonic, conversations with students, community activists, teachers, basically anyone who cares about the school system. Cenac poses questions meant to nudge the viewer toward coming up with real solutions even as he or she laughs at the action on screen.
Cenac started the evening off by commenting, "In the wake of school shootings you hear so many people talk about school safety and arming teachers and getting metal detectors with a sort of lack of awareness to the fact tliat fliese type of things have been in Black and Brown schools for a very' long time and the outcome of tliat isn't safety but criminalization."
Briefly running her hands through her iconic flaming red curly coils, HannahJones started her reply by admitting it felt a little strange for her to be talking about these issues in front of an audience at the chic, members-only Soho House in New York's Meatpacking District. "It feels very weird," she began, "to be having this conversation here but then you mentioned 'Call your legislator' and these are the people legislators listen to, so it makes more sense!" She added somewhat conspiratorially, "I had two bourbons before I came up here ? all so I'm gonna keep it real!" Cenac encouraged her, enthusiastically repeating, "Yeah!" as she spoke.
Part of the problem with the idea of school safety, Hannah-Jones observed, "Is that kids shouldn't have to go through metal detectors to go to school but kids shouldn't have to live in conditions where people feel they have to have metal detectors in school. Were placing the burden on schools to adcress our larger neglected society."
They discussed some examples of harsh punitive measures commonly exacted on Black and Brown children in America's public schools in the episode which had just screened. In it, Cenac talked to a cliild who had been suspended for flatulence, and a parent who spoke with incredulity about her four-year old being suspended from school.
Said Farrington, "We have a system where 90 percent of teachers are white women and before they step into a classroom, most of their training is on classroom management as opposed to building relationships with students. They are already putting themselves in the position to police."
The girlfriend of a drug dealer as a teen, Farington shared tliat she decided to go into education after having to flee New York City and attend high school in Vennont when a contract was put out on her life. As a high schooler in Vermont, she saw what education is supposed to be, compared to what she was used to as a student in the New York City public school system. Farrington also revealed her vocation to be not just altruistic but utterly redemptive, soberly stating, "Those two very' different experiences helped me realize I had helped destroy a lot of lives here in New York City and it was extremely important for me to go into tliis work of educating young people in order to restore the community."
Gripper expanded stating, "It's also the biases tliat teachers bring into the classroom. They come into our communities and they judge the kids overly harshly. Ifs not tliat they don't know how to handle the behavior, they choose to respond differently when it's us. Because they bring tliis racism into the classroom, we see a huge disparity in school pushout."
Cenac spoke directly to the phenomenon of school pushout, pointing to one of the subjects appearing in "Problem Areas" named Carlos. Emphasized Cenac, "Once you're pushed out, you're so much more likely to find yourself in front of the law." After being traumatized at the sight of a classmate being "jacked up" by a police officer, Carlos stopped attending school. Two years later Carlos, then 16, was serving 22 years to life.
"Problem Areas" airs on HBO Friday nights at 11 p.m. and on HBO streaming applications.

Texto completo: Red All Over is a weekly newsletter covering University of Utah athletics. Subscribe here .
The reaction to athletes transferring from a school usually fits one of two categories. Fans either believe it’s a sign of a failing program, or they diminish the athlete’s ability.
Armand Shyne seems to have found a sweet spot. The former Utah running back is moving to Texas Tech as a graduate transfer. Shyne is remembered for his contribution to the Utes’ first Pac-12 South championship, yet the program has so much depth at his position that his move is understandable.
Utah wouldn’t have beaten Oregon without Shyne’s 174-yard effort in the first game the Utes played without quarterback Tyler Huntley and running back Zack Moss. But with Moss returning and the Utes having developed considerable talent in the backfield, Shyne sought more of an opportunity to play as a senior. He may find it at Texas Tech, in former Utah State coach Matt Wells’ program.
Stories of the week
This is a big week for Utah’s gymnastics team, competing in the NCAA meet at Fort Worth, Texas. Lya Wodraska has it all covered for us, starting with this look at Ute stars MyKayla Skinner and MaKenna Merrell-Giles (TRIB).
And then there’s Sydney Soloski, doing her thing on the balance beam (TRIB).
Wodraska wonders how starting the meet on the floor may affect the Utes (TRIB).
From a national perspective, a Slate writer looked into why Skinner is so polarizing in the gymnastics world, with a conclusion that basically defends her demeanor (SLATE).
The Utes concluded spring football practice with the Red-White Game last weekend. One of the biggest stories was the Ken Garff family’s $17.5 million donation to the Rice-Eccles Stadium expansion project (TRIB).
The quarterbacks looked good against a depleted defense, but what about the kickers? (TRIB).
Tribune columnist Gordon Monson is impressed with the Utes, going into the 2019 season (TRIB).
Offensive coordinator Andy Ludwig has shown a lot of variety in his scheme, but fans can be assured that he understands Moss’ place in the program (TRIB).
Ute basketball coach Larry Krystkowiak always has a lot to say in his season-ending media interviews. In this year’s case, Ute athletic director Mark Harlan seemed to sense that Krystkowiak needed to hear an expression of support (TRIB).
Krystkowiak will rework his staff in some form, with the departure to UNLV of assistant coach DeMarlo Slocum after eight seasons at Utah. Donny Daniels will be part of the staff in one role or another, and that’s a healthy development for the program (TRIB).
Other voices
Do the Utes have a chance to make the College Football Playoff semifinals? Yes (barely), according to this ESPN analysis (ESPN).
Regardless of whether Ute fans consider Colorado their Pac-12 “rival,” this New York Times look into how the Buffs’ program is viewed in Boulder is interesting (NYT).
Dirk Facer of the Deseret News profiled Ute baseball star Oliver Dunn (DNEWS).
Around campus
• Utah’s baseball team (8-19, 3-12 Pac-12) claimed a series victory over USC last week, thanks to a pair of 5-4 wins. The Utes will host No. 12 Arizona State in a three-game series at Smith’s Ballpark, with 6 p.m. starts Thursday and Friday and a 1 p.m. first pitch Saturday.
• The challenging Pac-12 schedule continues for Utah’s softball team (14-26, 3-9). The Utes earned one win in three games at No. 25 Stanford last week. They will host No. 3 Washington in a series at Dumke Family Softball Stadium with games Thursday (6 p.m.), Friday (6 p.m.) and Saturday (noon).
• The Utah lacrosse team’s schedule is down to two home games remaining in the Utes’ inaugural Division I season. The Utes will meet Cleveland State on Saturday (noon) at Judge Memorial, coming off a 14-12 loss at Hartford. Utah (4-9) has lost six games in a row, with three defeats by two goals or fewer.

Governor Calls for Redo Of Plant Deal With Foxconn

Texto completo: Gov. Tony Evers of Wisconsin is dubious that Foxconn, the Taiwanese electronics giant known for making iPhones, will fulfill its promise of creating 13,000 jobs at a planned plant in the state. So he wants a redo of the contract.
"I think at this point in time that would be an unreal expectation when they're downsizing the footprint of what they're doing," Mr. Evers told reporters at his office in Madison on Wednesday.
The project, once championed by President Trump as evidence of a manufacturing renewal, has been mired in mixed signals. Mr. Evers wants to revisit the arrangement that Foxconn made with the state in 2017 and "figure out how a new set of parameters should be negotiated," according to a transcript of his statements.
The deal initially envisioned the company making display screens for televisions and other electronics at a $10 billion facility, with the state offering $4 billion in tax credits and other inducements over 15 years. The agreement was drafted under Scott Walker, the Republican governor whom Mr. Evers, a Democrat, replaced.
Earlier this year, Foxconn said it was rethinking its plans, citing "new realities" in the market. Even before then, the company had hinted that its Wisconsin project would focus more on research and development, rather than on the intensive factory work that tends to generate blue-collar jobs.
Foxconn said at the time that it would hold to its pledge to create 13,000 jobs, telling The New York Times that 25 percent of its Wisconsin employees would be focused on manufacturing. Soon after, following a conversation between Mr. Trump and Terry Gou, Foxconn's billionaire founder, the company said it still intended to build a plant to produce displays for consumer products.
Mr. Gou announced plans on Wednesday to run for Taiwan's presidency. Mr. Trump has praised his business acumen, calling him "one of the great businessmen of our time." His company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
"The present contract deals with a situation that no longer exists, so it's our goal to make sure that the taxpayers are protected and environmental standards are protected," Mr. Evers said. "And we believe we need to take a look at that contract and see if it needs to be downsized as a result."

Texto completo: Nearly 400 pages long, full of answers to questions the American people have had about President Trump, the long-awaited report of Special Counsel Robert Mueller will be released Thursday morning.
Mueller's extensive probe of whether the Republican president and his campaign colluded with the Russians, who wanted to throw the 2016 election in his favor, involved dozens of lawyers and FBI agents, who interviewed hundreds of witnesses and executed hundreds of search warrants.
After 23 months, the only things we know officially about the report come from Attorney General William Barr, a recent Trump appointee, who wrote a summary of its “principal conclusions" in a letter to Congress in late March.
Barr said the investigation had not “established" that the Trump campaign coordinated with the Russians, and he said that Mueller had not drawn “a conclusion — one way or the other" on the question of whether Trump had committed obstruction of justice.
Now comes the big reveal.
Here are five things to look for when the report is issued:
Does the report really clear up suspicions of collusion?
Mueller, according to Barr's letter, “did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated" with the Russian government in its election meddling.
But legal experts say “did not establish" doesn't mean there's no evidence at all of misdeeds. “Without seeing Mueller's full report, we don't know whether this is a firm conclusion about lack of coordination or a frank admission of insufficient evidence," attorney and former federal prosecutor Ken White wrote in The Atlantic.
“We know from Barr's four-page letter that Mueller did not find sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt a federal crime of conspiracy with Russia. But did he find conduct that, by any common-sense definition, evidences efforts to coordinate with Russia to influence the election?" said Elie Honig, a former federal and state prosecutor and CNN legal analyst.
Decisions not to prosecute “do not necessarily resolve questions of morality, ethics or impeachability — in other words, the judgments of history, journalism, and Congress are not determined by whether Mueller finds the president's conduct indictably criminal," Quinta Jurecic and Benjamin Wittes wrote on the Lawfare blog.
Are there new allegations on collusion and obstruction?
In discussing whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia, Barr noted there were “multiple offers from Russian-affiliated individuals to assist the Trump campaign." It wasn't clear if all those have been publicly reported.
NBC News reports that Mueller team members have told a senior law enforcement official that the report includes detailed accounts of Trump campaign contacts with Russia.
In discussing whether the president might have obstructed justice, Barr wrote that Mueller looked at “a number of actions by the President — most of which have been the subject of public reporting — that the Special Counsel investigated as potentially raising obstruction-of-justice concerns."
That sentence implies some questionable actions by the president have yet to be revealed.
Momentum in Congress for impeachment proceedings appears to have faded for the moment. It's not clear what new factual revelation would have the power to move the needle.
Why didn't Mueller make a decision on obstruction?
One of the biggest mysteries of the Mueller report is why, according to Barr, Mueller did not make his own charging conclusion on whether Trump committed obstruction of justice. Look for the report to shed some light on that question.
Legal experts have suggested that Mueller may have been simply laying out the facts for Congress.
“He appears to have created a substantial record of the president's troubling interactions with law enforcement for adjudication in noncriminal proceedings — which is to say in congressional hearings that are surely the next step," the experts at Lawfare wrote last month.
The decision by Mueller not to make a decision on obstruction left Barr to step into the breach and announce in his letter that he would not charge Trump with the crime.
Did Barr twist the meaning of the report in his letter to Congress?
Since the release on March 24 of Barr's letter, which he said was intended to summarize the “principal conclusions" of the Mueller report, critics have wondered whether Barr “spun" the report to give Trump a public relations victory.
Trump picked up on the conclusions immediately, claiming “complete and total exoneration" by Mueller (though he has since gone back to being critical of the investigation).
Members of Mueller's team were reportedly frustrated with the limited information that Barr had put into his letter.
The Washington Post reported that members complained to close associates that the evidence gathered on obstruction was alarming and significant. The New York Times reported that members told associates Barr had inadequately portrayed their findings.
Barr later issued another letter, saying his earlier letter wasn't meant as an “exhaustive recounting."
How much of the report will be redacted?
The report is expected to be released in redacted form, with sections blacked out for four different reasons. Redactions will be made for secret grand jury information, classified information, information on ongoing cases, and “peripheral third parties," whom Barr described in a congressional hearing as “people in private life."
The categories of redacted material are not crazy, Mary McCord, who led the Justice Department's national security division from 2016 to 2017, told the Times. “But it remains to be seen how broadly or narrowly Barr applies them," she said.

Socialism, like Bernie Sanders, is anti-charity

Texto completo: By now, you’ve surely heard Bernie Sanders rail in his thick Brooklyn accent against “millionayehs and billionayehs.” But as the release of ten years of his tax returns has shown, Sanders is himself one of those very millionaires he frequently reviles for rigging the system, pulling the strings behind the scenes, and needlessly multiplying the number of deodorants available to American consumers.

Sanders, a longtime evangelist for a socialist ideology that has caused more human misery than any other idea in history, has never created a job. He was even kicked off a hippy commune for refusing to work.

Still, give the man credit. He works hard as a politician and there is real demand for him. Unlike many of the politicians who have grown wealthy while in office, Sanders appears to have done it the honest way. His best-selling book, Our Revolution, pushed his income above $1 million in both 2016 and 2017. And assuming he followed Senate ethics rules and took no book advances, every penny of that had to be from actual sales.

That’s just one of the interesting pieces of information available in Sanders’ tax returns. Another is that in 2016, his first million-dollar earning year, he donated less than 1% of his income to charity.

It’s only fair to point out also that Sanders increased his giving to above 3% in 2017 and 2018 — perhaps because by then he had some inkling of a presidential contender.

But it would be wrong to label Bernie a hypocrite for giving so little to charity. Why? Because he is a socialist.

Sanders really meant what he said in 1981 when he told attendees at a local United Way fundraiser in Vermont, “I don't believe in charities.” Sanders, then serving as mayor of Burlington, "went on to question the ‘fundamental concepts on which charities are based’ and contended that government, rather than charity organizations, should take over responsibility for social programs,” according to a contemporaneous report from the New York Times.

So no, Sanders is not a hypocrite. Rather, he is a consistent believer in an ideology that is avowedly anti-charity. Sanders, like other socialists, isn’t opposed to helping people. Rather, he wants the state to do something he's unwilling to do himself on a personal basis: help the needy with his own wealth and the wealth of millionaires.

Americans are historically averse to socialism, and this helps explain their historical culture of giving generously to charity. The U.S. leads the world in private giving, donating twice as much as the runner-up (New Zealand) as a percentage of GDP.

Socialism is the enemy of charity because it outsources all compassion and altruism to the state. In an age when most Americans worry about and mourn the erosion of civil society institutions, socialism wants to supplant them all — to leave people atomized, dependent upon government from cradle to grave for material, intellectual, social, and (although it does not recognize them) spiritual needs.

But government does not and cannot truly love anyone. It is especially bad at lifting the poor out of their poverty. It has such a poor track record in dealing with true hard cases — the homeless, for example — that in the U.S. today, local governments almost universally outsource the job of caring to private charities.

Socialists believe that all meaningful human interactions are political. Theirs is a dehumanizing ideology that separates people from their neighbors. It strips human beings of moral agency. As the experience in Venezuela and in post-communist countries has demonstrated, a successful socialist system ultimately creates a contest of “every man for himself” that makes the most ruthless capitalist blush.

Bernie Sanders may dispute this characterization. He would be wrong, but he is no hypocrite for failing to give away his money. It’s just that he is earnestly trying to create a perfect system where the government will come and take it away from him, for him.

Texto completo: Corea del Norte dijo el jueves que su líder, Kim Jong-un , había supervisado la prueba de disparo de un nuevo tipo de arma guiada táctica, informa New York Times.
La Agencia Central de Noticias Central de Corea del Norte no especificó qué tipo de arma estuvo involucrada en la prueba, por lo que no está claro si fue un misil.
Corea del Norte había declarado una moratoria sobre armas nucleares y pruebas de misiles de largo alcance, después del lanzamiento de un misil balístico intercontinental en noviembre de 2017.
El presidente Trump consideró la moratoria autoimpuesta del Norte como el mayor logro de su administración en sus tratos con Corea del Norte.
Estados Unidos ha intentado negociar con Corea del Norte durante meses para poner fin a sus programas de armas nucleares y misiles cada vez más sofisticados. Pero la última reunión cumbre en febrero entre Trump y Kim terminó abruptamente sin un acuerdo.
Aunque estaba claro de inmediato qué tipo de arma se disparó, la acción marcaría la primera prueba pública de armas desde la cumbre del presidente Trump con Kim en Hanoi en febrero y una señal de desafío por parte de Kim tras un punto muerto en las conversaciones de desnuclearización de alto nivel.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Democrats are in an uproar over Attorney General William Barr's handling of the highly anticipated report by special counsel Robert Mueller, demanding that he cancels a planned news conference on Thursday about Mueller's findings before actually releasing the report to the public.
For weeks, House Democrats have criticized Barr's handling of the report but those critiques intensified significantly on Wednesday, one day before the Justice Department is set to release a redacted version of the 400-page report to the public.
"Once again, Barr wants to shape the public's perception of the report," House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif. , wrote on Twitter. "This is not justice. Just PR. "
In a joint statement, Democratic House chairs called Barr's news conference "unnecessary and inappropriate" and called for release of the full report.
“These new actions by the Attorney General reinforce our concern that he is acting to protect President Trump," the statement says.
“He should let the full report speak for itself. The Attorney General should cancel the press conference and provide the full report to Congress, as we have requested," the statement continues. "With the Special Counsel’s fact-gathering work concluded, it is now Congress’ responsibility to assess the findings and evidence and proceed accordingly. ”
Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein will hold news conference at 9:30 a. m. EDT, Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said. The report is expected to go to Congress between 11 a. m. and noon EDT and likely will be released to the public around the same time.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi railed against the decision and pointed to a New York Times report indicating that Justice officials had briefed the White House on the contents of the report in advance of its public release. White House and Justice officials declined to comment on The Times account.
More: AG William Barr to hold news conference Thursday on before Mueller report goes to Congress
"AG Barr has thrown out his credibility & the DOJ’s independence with his single-minded effort to protect @realDonaldTrump above all else," Pelosi wrote on Twitter. "The American people deserve the truth, not a sanitized version of the Mueller Report approved by the Trump Admin. "
House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler said the idea to release the report after Barr's news conference was ill-advised. "This is wrong," he wrote in a tweet. He continued, saying he was "deeply troubled" by the Times report about contact between the Justice Department and the White House before the report was released.
Nadler, D-N. Y. , along with four House Democrats, held a last-minute news conference in New York to discuss both Barr's delayed release of the report and his handling of the probe as a whole.
"The attorney general appears to be waging a media campaign on behalf of President Trump, the very subject of the investigation at the heart of the Mueller report," Nadler said during the news conference. "Rather than letting the facts of the report speak for themselves, the attorney general has taken unprecedented steps to spin Mueller’s nearly two-year investigation. "
He continued, listing out concerns echoed by fellow Democrats, saying that Barr was attempting to create a narrative about the report before its release to help the White House.
"The central concern here is that the Attorney General Barr is not allowing the facts of the Mueller report speak for themselves, but is trying to bake in a narrative about the report to the benefit of the White House," Nadler said.
Alongside Nadler was Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N. Y. , who tweeted that Barr's handling of the report equated to a "dog and pony show" and urged Barr to "keep your mouth shut. "
"So-called Attorney General is presiding over a dog and pony show. Here is a thought. Release the Mueller report tomorrow morning and keep your mouth shut," Jeffries said. "You have ZERO credibility. "
Rep. David Cicilline, D-R. I. , also questioned Barr's intentions.
"Why is William Barr holding a press conference if not to (once again) try and frame the Special Counsel’s findings," he wrote on Twitter. "Just release the full report and let the American people judge for themselves!"
On Twitter, Rep. Doug Collins, R-Georgia, lashed out at Nadler while defending Barr's handling of the report.
"The only person trying to spin the report is @RepJerryNadler," Collins tweeted. "The AG has done nothing unilaterally. After partnering with DAG Rosenstein to share principal conclusions, Barr is releasing the report voluntarily, working with Mueller’s team step by step. "
Well before Wednesday, Barr had already become a magnet for Democratic criticism.
He was lambasted by Democrats for making the determination that Trump's conduct did not constitute a crime after the special counsel did not make a decision on whether the president's actions during the investigation amounted to obstruction of justice.
Barr was also criticized over his four-page letter to members of Congress that went over aspects of Mueller's conclusions. Members of Mueller's team said that Barr's letter "failed to adequately portray the findings of their inquiry and that they were more troubling for President Trump than Mr. Barr indicated," according to the New York Times, which cited a number of unnamed officials.
Democrats have pushed for Barr to release the full report, without redactions, and said they would subpoena a full copy. Barr, no doubt, will be criticized for any redactions made to the report when it’s released Thursday.
A less-redacted version would be made available to select members of Congress, according to a Wednesday court filing.
He has also been targeted for his past conduct before he was nominated attorney general by the president.
In June last year, Barr authored an unsolicited, 19-page memo outlining his opposition to an obstruction investigation of Trump. He shared that memo with White House lawyers.
That memo, written months before Trump selected him as the next attorney general, called the obstruction theory “fatally misconceived” and said that it was based “on a novel and legally insupportable reading of the law. ” Barr acknowledged that he did not know what type of case Mueller was pursuing, but argued that Trump's firing of former FBI Director James Comey didn't constitute obstruction and that the president shouldn't be forced to testify to Mueller's investigators.

TRISHA YEARWOOD TO HOST TAILGATE BEFORE HUSBAND GARTH BROOKS' MAY CONCERT

Texto completo: Grammy award winner Trisha Yearwood has been popular with country music lovers ever since her self-titled debut album in 1991. Thanks to three best-selling cookbooks that led to a cooking show on the Food Network, she's got legions of food fans, too.
She'll get a chance to marry those two talents when she hosts a giant party at Heinz Field on the North Shore before husband Garth Brooks' sold-out concert on May 18.
Dubbed Trisha's Tailgate, the ticketed afternoon event in the tents near Gate A will feature a spread of the star's favorite tailgate bites, along with drinks including her signature cocktail. Called Summer in a Cup, it pairs a variety of fruit juices with banana liqueur and rum.
"It just seemed like a good idea," Yearwood said of the preconcert party, which will accommodate up to 1,300 guests. "People are there anyway tailgating for the show, so we're giving them a place to play games and get out of the weather with good food and drinks."
The singer held her first tailgate last year ahead of Brooks' Oct. 20 concert at Notre Dame Stadium in Indiana. Everyone involved had such a good time despite the squirrelly weather - the day brought rain, snow, hail and high winds, necessitating space heaters - that she and her staff decided it might be fun to do it in every city on her husband's 2019 stadium tour.
"If you're a Garth fan, you kind of know each other, and so it's a good hang," Yearwood said.
Although she says she was born to be a singer, the Georgia native has always liked to cook. When she moved to Oklahoma after marrying Garth in 2005, she scaled back on touring, because she didn't want to be married only to be apart. Needing a creative outlet to fill the hours besides going to kids' soccer games, she decided to write a cookbook with her mother, Gwen, and her sister, Beth, just for fun. She never imagined anyone would want to read it, let alone it would become a New York Times bestseller.
"It was kind of an accident," she said.
A second cookbook followed in 2010 after which producers at the Food Network came knocking. She initially hesitated, she said, because while she loved to prepare food, she wasn't sure she wanted to be in front of the camera "telling people when to add butter."
She also knew that celebrities tend to get scrutinized when they put their name on a project, and that she would have something to prove. "Trisha's Southern Kitchen" not only proved a hit - she just finished filming season 14 in Nashville - but it's been really fun, too, as well as a springboard for a commercial venture.
After releasing her third cookbook in 2015, Yearwood collaborated with Williams Sonoma to create a line of drink and biscuit mixes, flavored coffees and seasonings. The high-end kitchen store also had exclusive rights during the 2018 Christmas season to her "Let's Be Frank" album paying homage to Frank Sinatra before its general release in February.
"It's the only other thing other than music that I've pursued so hard," she said.
Every tailgate is a little different, with its own footprint and menu. But Yearwood is always sure to include foods that are easy to eat, and filling, so people go to the concert full. Previous tailgates have included offerings such as deconstructed corn salsa, pimento cheese nachos and blueberry pie bars, "and we always have some kind of slider," she said.
With Pittsburgh being something of a ground zero for pierogies, guests probably can expect some form of the potato-stuffed dumplings on the buffet table, along with Heinz ketchup and food topped with fries.
What you won't get to experience is a chance to take selfies with the singer. But you will have the opportunity to ask her questions when she's up on stage doing a demo. You might also catch sight of her sister, who often travels with her.
A portion of the proceeds will go to Habitat for Humanity, which the couple have been involved with for more than 10 years. They volunteered to help build homes on the Gulf Coast post-Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and also have lent their names and support to numerous Habitat events and projects, including the Carter Work Project and National Women Build Week.
"It's a passion project for us," she said.
Cooking, Yearwood said, is a little like singing because there's appreciation and applause for the cook when she or he does a good job. Because many of her recipes have family roots, it also has allowed her to share her parents' legacy in a way she never expected.
"It makes people feel good on both sides," she said.
Tricia's Tailgate runs from 3 to 6 p.m. at Heinz Field on May 18. Tickets cost $65 and include unlimited food and two drink tickets. To purchase, go to heinzfield.com (search "Trisha's Tailgate).
Summer in a Cup
PG tested
Trisha Yearwood concocted this fruity cocktail on a hot summer day in Oklahoma. You can buy the mix at Williams Sonoma, but it's really easy to make from scratch at home. "It's really refreshing," she said.
16 ounces pineapple juice
9 ounces banana liqueur, such as 99 Bananas
9 ounces coconut rum, such as Malibu
8 ounces fruit punch
8 ounces orange juice
Orange slices, for garnish
Pineapple slices, for garnish
Mix together the pineapple juice, banana liqueur, coconut rum, fruit punch and orange juice in a gallon pitcher filled with ice. Pour into martini glasses and garnish with slices of orange and pineapple.
Serves 6.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump recently traveled to the Mexican border and delivered one of the most foolish and fallacious statements of his entire presidency. Speaking to the surge of immigrants seeking asylum here, he said, "We can’t take you anymore. Our country is full."
No, it is not full. It is not close to being full. In fact, the opposite is true. As aging baby boomers leave the workforce and depend more heavily on costly government services, more immigrants are desperately needed to fill jobs, pay taxes, have babies and revitalize areas that are losing population. Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric serves only one purpose: to energize his supporters by inflaming the nativist fears that have periodically engulfed the country throughout our history. He firmly believes those fears helped elect him once, and will again.
From a political standpoint, that calculation is questionable. Trump’s denunciation of brown-skinned rapists and gangsters pouring across the southern border certainly helped his campaign in 2016, but last year, when he tried the same cynical scare tactics, his party lost 40 seats in the House. Clear majorities in national polls have consistently opposed his immigration policies.
From an economic standpoint, however, his war on immigrants is a disaster that would suffocate the sustained growth he loves to brag about. Under great pressure from business interests, Trump’s own Department of Homeland Security doubled the number of visas available for temporary guest workers this summer. Indeed, Trump’s own resorts and golf courses have long employed foreigners — a graphic rebuttal to his own inane comments.
There are short- and long-term implications here. Since June, for the first time since 1970, there have been more jobs available than workers seeking them. Many industries, from agriculture and food service to construction and health care, are frantically seeking immigrants to hire.
Dallas homebuilders tell the New York Times that a lack of workers is adding $6,000 to the cost of every new home and delaying completion by two months. Larry Cox, who farms in California’s Imperial Valley, said the labor shortage is driving "a large transition of growing from California down to Mexico." The problem is aggravated in areas like New England that are losing population. Older cities from Philadelphia to St. Louis are actively recruiting foreigners to restock urban neighborhoods as earlier settlers depart for the suburbs. "One of the key solutions" to urban blight is "to welcome immigrants into these communities," said Brooks Rainwater of the National League of Cities to the Times.
If anything, immigrants are even more important to the nation’s future economic health. U.S. birthrates are plummeting, and last year, population growth sank to its lowest level in 80 years. Newcomers accounted for nearly half of that increase. And by 2030, foreigners will be "the primary contributor to national population growth," estimates demographer William Frey of the Brookings Institution. These demographic trends, says Frey, require "a more serious discussion of U.S. immigration policy because of the future contributions that immigrants will make to growing America’s society and economy."
True, that serious discussion is imperative. But Trump’s tirade about a "full" America is totally wrong, and typical of his damaging determination to believe half-baked fantasies instead of proven facts.

Texto completo: Yet another NHL player has been seriously hurt because Gary Bettman insists on fighting a losing game.
Carolina Hurricanes rookie Andrei Svechnikov is in the concussion protocol and likely to miss Game 4 of the playoffs Thursday night, an outcome just about anybody could have predicted after watching him get decked by Alex Ovechkin. Svechnikov’s head slammed against the ice after the fight in the first period Monday night, and he spent about 30 seconds on all fours before being helped to his feet and wobbling to the locker room.
“(He) looks normal and said he feels great,” Carolina coach Rod Brind’Amour said Tuesday.
Of course Svechnikov did. What else is a 19-year-old supposed to say when Bettman has made it clear he doesn’t give a damn about his players’ health and safety?
Time and again, the NHL commissioner has refused to acknowledge hockey’s culpability in robbing former players of their memories and motor skills, making them unrecognizable to their families and friends in the most severe cases. This despite the ever-growing body of science linking repetitive head trauma to chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and other neurodegenerative diseases.
Bettman’s stock, belligerent answer is to say there’s no way to know for sure that repetitive head trauma – you know, like what hockey players experience – causes CTE because there’s still no living diagnosis. Therefore, the NHL doesn’t need to do anything or make any changes.
Like banning fighting.
There’s no reason for what the NHL still quaintly terms “fisticuffs” and everybody, even Bettman, knows it. It’s a relic of a bygone, brutish era when people didn’t know better, and adds no value to the modern game.
“Not really,” Brind’Amour said Tuesday when asked if fighting was still necessary to the NHL. “Probably not. ”
Fighting doesn’t make the NHL better, slowing the free flow of the game and disrupting the pace. That’s evident during every Olympics and world championships, where fighting is banned under International Ice Hockey Federation rules and no one complains of missing it.
It also doesn’t make the game safer, as Bettman has claimed before. Not when hockey now is so much faster, and the players so much bigger.
Who could have watched Ovechkin continuing to pummel Svechnikov as the younger and smaller player fell, and thought that was a good way to settle an on-ice dispute? Or an effective deterrent against future dust-ups?
It wasn’t, and it won’t be. It’s an MMA-like sideshow, and a poor one at that.
“Let’s forget about the semantics & weight/height differences & who asked who. . . . Do we want to see NHL stars like Ovechkin & Svechnikov bare knuckle boxing?” Daniel Carcillo, whose effectiveness as an enforcer earned him the nickname “CarBomb” but who is now a fierce critic of the NHL’s approach to head trauma, said on Twitter.
“If the #NHL was conceived today, would it include fighting? Doubt it. ”
Contrary to Bettman’s obstinance, hockey has always recognized that hits to the head are dangerous. That’s why there are penalties for high sticking and elbowing.
Banning fighting is simply the logical extension of that, Hall of Famer Ken Dryden told the New York Times last year following the publication of his book, Game Change: The Life and Death of Steve Montador, and the Future of Hockey.
“What we’ve come to understand better, with the force and the frequency of the collisions now, is that the dangerous instrument is not the stick or the elbow, it’s the body as a whole. So you don’t call a penalty for a stick or an elbow and not call one for a shoulder or a fist,” Dryden said.
“It’s not the cause, it’s the effect,” Dryden added. “It’s not whether it’s intentional or accidental. The brain doesn’t distinguish. The brain is affected similarly. ”
It won’t help Svechnikov or Montreal's Paul Byron or any of the countless other players who’ve been injured for no good reason, but fighting’s days in the NHL are numbered.
Last week, researchers at Boston University’s CTE Center announced that brain scans of a small group of living NFL players had shown elevated levels of tau proteins, which cause CTE, in the areas where CTE has typically been found during autopsies. That follows the announcement in 2017 by researchers at UCLA and NorthShore University Health System that an autopsy had confirmed a former NFL player had CTE – just as a brain scan four years earlier had indicated.
Even Bettman won't be able to deny the science for much longer. The NHL's fight will be over, and he will have lost.

In 1889, comedian and movie director Charles Chaplin was born in London.
In 1945, during World War II, a Soviet submarine in the Baltic Sea torpedoed and sank the MV Goya, which Germany was using to transport civilian refugees and wounded soldiers; it's estimated that up to 7,000 people died.
In 1947, the cargo ship Grandcamp, carrying ammonium nitrate, blew up in the harbor in Texas City, Texas; a nearby ship, the High Flyer, which was carrying ammonium nitrate and sulfur, caught fire and exploded the following day; the blasts and fires killed nearly 600 people.
In 1963, Martin Luther King Jr. wrote his "Letter from Birmingham Jail" in which the civil rights activist responded to a group of local clergymen who had criticized him for leading street protests; King defended his tactics, writing, "Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere."
In 1972, Apollo 16 blasted off on a voyage to the moon with astronauts John W. Young, Charles M. Duke Jr. and Ken Mattingly on board.
In 1986, dispelling rumors he was dead, Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi appeared on television to condemn the US raid on his country and to say that Libyans were "ready to die" defending their nation.
In 2007, in one of America's worst school attacks, a college senior killed 32 people on the campus of Virginia Tech before taking his own life.
In 2008, the Supreme Court upheld, 7-2, the most widely used method of lethal injection, allowing states to resume executions after a seven-month halt. Pope Benedict XVI was welcomed by President George W. Bush as only the second pontiff to visit the White House (after John Paul II) and the first in 29 years.
In 2014, more than 300 people, mostly students, died when a South Korean ferry, the Sewol, sank while en route from Incheon to the resort island of Jeju; 172 people survived.
Last year, the New York Times and The New Yorker won the Pulitzer Prize for public service for breaking the Harvey Weinstein scandal with reporting that galvanized the #MeToo movement. Rap star Kendrick Lamar was awarded the Pulitzer for music, becoming the first non-classical or non-jazz artist to win the prize.

Texto completo: Defending Assange
Re "Assange -- the hacker hacked," Opinion, April 14
I couldn't disagree more with Virginia Heffernan's takedown of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.

Assange was arrested and is being extradited not for any of the bad things he did, but for the one good thing: He collaborated with Chelsea Manning to expose U.S. war atrocities in Iraq. Assange's arrest is a warning to every aggressive reporter working to expose the U.S.'s dark side; it's a direct attack on the 1st Amendment.
Sometimes, defending press freedom requires defending creepy people, like Assange or the "anti-Catholic, anti-Semitic, anti-black and anti-labor" scandal sheet editor Jay Near in Minnesota in 1931, who won a U.S. Supreme Court case cited as precedent for the New York Times' and Washington Post's right to publish the Pentagon Papers.
Mark Gabrish Conlan
San Diego
::
Heffernan reaches a new low with her piece on Assange.
She apparently could not care less about what used to be seen as the critical role of the press: shining a light on government misconduct. The single instance of Assange, having worked with Manning, releasing the video of the Baghdad helicopter strike in 2007 did more to advance democracy and truth than anything Heffernan has done.
Assange did not seek asylum because of allegations of rape, but because he correctly discerned that those charges were being pursued to provide a basis to turn him over to the U.S. government for prosecution.
Donald Norris
Oxnard
::
I don't condone everything Assange did, but I go with the perspectives of Edward Snowden, Daniel Ellsberg and Noam Chomsky over Heffernan.
Assange did service to the right of people in democracies to know the dark things their governments do and hide from them, and to the right of journalists to expose such things.

Immigrants don't scare us
Re "Trump suggests he may release immigrants in California," April 13
Oh, the horror -- President Trump said he's considering sending immigrants to so-called sanctuary cities such as Los Angeles. All of those rapists, murderers and drug dealers -- oh my.
We are not buying into your hysteria, Mr. President. Just send them. My impression is that these immigrants know where they want to go in order to join up with relatives and associates who are already here.
If we can be off assistance to them in the relocation process, we are doing a humanitarian service. Feed them and allow them to rest up, then give them tickets to their preferred destination.
Keith Herried
Los Angeles
::
Trump says he may give the self-proclaimed sanctuary cities and states the immigrants they have said they want. Now Gov. Gavin Newsom complains this is a political ploy on the part of the president.
But wasn't it a political ploy on the part of Democratic governors and mayors to make their areas "sanctuaries"? Perhaps the relatives and friends of immigrants will now vote for Democrats.
Isn't this the definition of hypocrisy?
Flo Ginsburg
Santa Monica
::
Trump apparently feels that sanctuary cities and states contribute to our immigration crisis and that these places should be punished by sending them the migrants coming across the border.
If sanctuary cities are to blame for this crisis at the border, so are the employers who've made it a practice to hire undocumented workers. If there were no jobs awaiting them, they would not come.
So, perhaps a better solution would be to send them to the businesses that have hired undocumented workers in the past; namely, Trump hotels, Trump golf courses and Trump resorts.
Marlin Sobbota
Arcadia
::
Democrats' and other liberals' responses to Trump's suggestion reveal their hypocrisy, as exemplified by words from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco), Newsom and L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti.
How can they proclaim their areas sanctuaries for immigrants and then criticize the president for suggesting he might send undocumented residents to those very sanctuaries? To where should they be sent? Shouldn't they be welcomed with open arms?
David McCobb
Rancho Cucamonga
::
Much has been said about Trump threatening to punish sanctuaries. At first glance this seems childish and petty. But I say, bring them on.
Let's welcome these migrants who can join previous immigrants in making America the great country it is. Somewhere among these people might be the next Andrew Carnegie, Elizabeth Arden, Helena Rubinstein, Enrico Fermi, Elon Musk or Sergey Brin.
Or maybe there are people like my wife and me, who have worked hard and cherish our American life as a result of past immigration policies.

'Pro-life' radicals' body count
Re "But what about abortion?" Mailbag, April 13
In your Mailbag column featuring letters that draw tenuous connections between abortion and a number of other seemingly unrelated issues, two readers attacked the pro-choice movement in defense of what they deemed "life."
Between 1993 and 2015, antiabortionists have attacked clinics and killed at least 11 people, including doctors, a clinic escort, receptionists and an off-duty police officer. This is in addition to multiple attempted homicides and dozens of bombings.
In two of the letters you printed, the writers referred to late-term abortions as the "death penalty" for innocent people. These people ignore that the U.S. has the world's highest maternal mortality rate among industrialized countries. They do not express an objection to the alarmingly high rate of death among American women who want to be mothers.

Death and Dignity Health
Re "God before science in UC deal?" column, April 14
UC San Francisco should not partner with Catholic hospital chain Dignity Health.
Columnist Michael Hiltzik mentions that Dignity Health facilities don't offer some crucially important medical services to women and the LGBTQ community.
On March 15, my 83-year-old husband, a retired professor at the University of Redlands, was able to take advantage of the California End of Life Option Act. After a biopsy on Jan. 30 showed a glioblastoma brain tumor, all he ever said to a consulting oncologist was, "I want to die as soon as possible."
As Hiltzik emphasizes, science and some religions' version of God don't mix. Patients at Dignity Health hospitals cannot preserve their autonomy and control at the end of their lives if they choose to do so.
Jane Roberts
Redlands
::
Hiltzik is spot-on.
The University of California Board of Regents works on behalf of a taxpayer-supported institution. Thus, any partnership between UCSF and Dignity Health, a Catholic hospital chain that does not offer abortion or certain treatments that people from the LGBTQ community need, should not be allowed.
Seemingly, this a classic breaching of the doctrine of "separation of church and state," embodied in the 1st Amendment of our U.S. Constitution.
Perhaps it's time that the regents enhance their higher education with a course in Political Science 101.

It's apartheid
Re "The apartheid lie," letters, April 13
First, the apartheid claim rests not on the second-class citizenship of Arab residents within Israel proper, but on a half-century of egregiously discriminatory non-citizenship of Palestinians in the West Bank.
Second, Israel has been flagrantly violating international law since 1967 through its colonizing West Bank settlements.
Third, Palestinians have rejected Israel's long-term peace proposals because they failed to deal equitably with the settlement issue.
Finally, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's ultra-nationalist rhetoric and policies may not have caused the two-state solution to be "moribund," but they may have hammered the final nails into the coffin.

N.R.A. Sues Operator of 'Voice of the N.R.A.'

Texto completo: It's the N.R.A. versus NRATV.
The National Rifle Association sued one of its largest and most enduring contractors late last week and raised concerns about the contractor's relationship to the association's own president, Oliver North, in a stunning breach within the normally buttoned-up organization.
The suit was filed late Friday by the N.R.A. in Virginia, where it is based, against Ackerman McQueen, the Oklahoma ad firm that operates NRATV, the group's incendiary online media arm. The suit asserts that Ackerman has concealed details from the N.R.A. about how the company is spending the roughly $40 million that it and its affiliates receive annually from the association.
The suit creates uncertainty about Mr. North's future at the organization. And it leaves the future of NRATV in doubt, given the new acrimony in the Ackerman relationship.
Since Ackerman created NRATV in 2016, it has often been "perceived by the public as the voice of the N.R.A.," according to the rifle association's complaint. It has also taken on an apocalyptic tone, warning of race wars, calling for a march on the Federal Bureau of Investigation and portraying the talking trains in the children's show "Thomas & Friends" in Ku Klux Klan hoods.
The New York Times reported this year that two prominent N.R.A. board members were among those voicing alarm inside the association that NRATV was often straying beyond gun rights. The Times article also revealed that Ackerman had a previously undisclosed financial relationship with Mr. North.
The association is untangling broader problems as well, including a legal fight in New York with the administration of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo over an insurance program the N.R.A. offers to gun owners. The new state attorney general, Letitia James, has also repeatedly threatened to investigate the tax-exempt status of the organization, which was incorporated in New York.
Facing this regulatory backdrop, the association began a review of its financial relationships with hundreds of vendors in August to ensure that it was in compliance with best practices.
The N.R.A. complaint alleges that Ackerman refused to turn over a number of financial records, including those detailing out-of-pocket expenses "that lacked meaningful documentation of N.R.A. approvals, receipts or other support." The association also wants documents that it says could allay its concern that it was being invoiced for the full salaries of Ackerman employees who also did work for other Ackerman clients. In addition, the complaint alleges that Ackerman has refused to provide data about NRATV's unique visitors and various other performance measures.
"The N.R.A.'s patience has run out," the suit says.
Ackerman, in a statement, sharply disputed the contentions in the lawsuit, whose filing was earlier reported by The Wall Street Journal.
"During a three-week review, an N.R.A. forensic auditing firm received every single piece of information they [the N.R.A.] requested," the statement said. "Further, the N.R.A. has had consistent access to any and all documents regarding NRATV analytics. Despite the representation set forth in their lawsuit, the N.R.A. had the personnel contract they claim AM withheld last week before they filed their lawsuit."
The complaint details a peculiar standoff with Ackerman over Mr. North, who took over as president last year. The N.R.A. claims it was aware that Mr. North had a contract to act as the host of a web series for Ackerman, but that Ackerman has refused to provide a copy of the contract for nearly six months. Additionally, Mr. North's counsel told the N.R.A. that "he could only disclose a copy of the contract" if Ackerman said he could, the suit says.
Subsequently, Ackerman allowed the N.R.A.'s general counsel to view the contract but not keep a copy; the viewing added to N.R.A. concerns that it had not previously received an accurate summary of the document. The association was also concerned that Mr. North's relationship to Ackerman could "supersede his duties to the N.R.A."
A standoff persists over additional details about the relationship, according to the complaint.
The lawsuit is further complicated by family ties. The N.R.A.'s outside lawyer, William A. Brewer III, is the son-in-law of Angus McQueen, a co-chief executive of Ackerman, and the brother-in-law of Revan McQueen, its chief executive. Ackerman called the relationships an "irreconcilable conflict of interest" and said some kind of family dispute "pervades the Brewer firm's dealings with Ackerman McQueen."
Travis Carter, a spokesman for Mr. Brewer's law firm, said "the familial relationship" had "no bearing whatsoever on the N.R.A.'s litigation strategy." He added, "Any suggestion to the contrary is contrived and a red herring."
The suit culminates the fracturing of a more than three-decade relationship between Ackerman and the N.R.A., going back to the shaping of such memorable lines as Charlton Heston's proclaiming that his gun would have to be pried "from my cold, dead hands." Wayne LaPierre, the longtime chief executive of the N.R.A., had previously been a steadfast champion of the Ackerman relationship.
"I think it says something about Wayne's character, even though he's had a long-term working business relationship with a vendor, he's willing to do what is right and necessary for the N.R.A. and its members," said Todd Rathner, a board member of the rifle association.
Joel Friedman, another board member, said he was dismayed that the documents had not been turned over.
"It leaves you questioning, and you can come up with all these potential different scenarios as to why, but none of them are good," he said.
"My mind goes to: Are they overcharging us? That's one," he added. "Two, are there things charged to us that were not part of the contract? Then, No. 3, has there been a misallocation of personnel?"

Texto completo: Affiliated cartoonist also among those receiving journalism's top honors
Washington Post critic Carlos Lozada says he likes to stay close to the news in selecting the nonfiction books he reviews. So, during 2018, he reviewed many of the books published about perhaps the newsiest subject of all: President Trump.
On Monday, the jurors of the Pulitzer Prize offered their own review of Lozada's insights about Trump and the cultural milieu he has fostered. They named Lozada the winner of the Pulitzer for criticism, bestowing journalism's highest honor on him for his perspectives on politics and the presidency. It was one of several Pulitzers awarded Monday for journalism that examined Trump's past and present and his impact on American society.
Lozada, 47, thus joins a long line of Post writers who have won the criticism award. Post critics have previously been recognized for their critiques of art, architecture, dance, television, movies, fashion, classical music and photography. Lozada was the third Post book critic to win the award since the criticism category was created in 1970.
Two other journalists affiliated with The Post were also cited by the Pulitzer judges for their work during 2018. Lorenzo Tugnoli, a freelance photographer, won in the feature photography category for his stark and gripping portfolio of images from war-torn Yemen that were commissioned and published by The Post. Darrin Bell, a cartoonist best known for his comic strip "Candorville," won for editorial cartoons about Trump and other topics. Bell's editorial cartoons were distributed to newspapers through The Washington Post Writers Group, the newspaper's syndication arm, through last August.
Journalists at the New York Times received two awards, as did Reuters journalists.
Times opinion columnist Brent Staples, who wrote powerfully about African American history and connected it to contemporary race relations, was awarded the prize in editorial writing. A team of three reporters - David Barstow, Susanne Craig and Russ Buettner - were cited in the explanatory-reporting category for their extensive and revealing investigation of Trump's inheritance from his father and his "suspect" tax strategies. Barstow, the lead reporter on the project, has now won or shared a Pulitzer four times and been a finalist on three other occasions.
Reuters's awards were in the breaking-news photography category, for documenting the journey of Central American migrants to the United States, and for international reporting, for accounts of a massacre of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar. The latter articles landed their principal reporters, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, in prison, sparking an international outcry. Reuters shared the international-reporting prize with a team from the Associated Press for its coverage of the war in Yemen.
Continuing the Trump-centric theme, a team of Wall Street Journal reporters was awarded the national reporting prize for scoops about Trump attorney Michael Cohen's hush-money payments to adult-film actress Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election to suppress her account of an alleged sexual relationship with Trump.
The South Florida Sun Sentinel, based in Fort Lauderdale, won the public-service medal for its coverage of the February 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland and its follow-up reporting about local officials' actions before and after the killing of 17 students and staff members at the school. The public-service award is considered the most prestigious in the 14 journalism categories.
Two other mass shootings figured in the awards as well. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette won in the breaking-news category for its coverage of the Tree of Life synagogue shooting last year. The Pulitzer board also awarded a special citation to the Capital Gazette in Annapolis, where five staff members were killed by a gunman in June.
The Post's reporting and opinion columns about the killing of one of its own contributing columnists, Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi, were a finalist for the public-service medal, one of three Post entries to earn finalist status. The others were opinion writer and editor Elizabeth Bruenig's account of the aftermath of a sexual assault at her high school in 2006 (in the feature-writing category) and The Post's series on neighborhoods across the country where homicides are clustered but arrests are rare (in explanatory reporting).
In his column, Lozada, a finalist for the criticism Pulitzer last year, often reviews multiple nonfiction books about a common subject, bucking the traditional one-book-per-review format. The approach enabled him to assess broader themes. Many of his reviews last year addressed the flood of newly published Trump books.
Among the reviews submitted in his winning Pulitzer entry were those about books exploring Russian influence on the 2016 election; about Trump's inflaming of cultural forces such as misogyny, bigotry and anti-Semitism; and about the nature of truth in the Trump era. He also reviewed works written by what Lozada called Trump's "sycophants."
An essay by Lozada published the day after the death of former president George H.W. Bush assessed Bush's legacy through his letters and diaries. He lamented the absence of a formal Bush memoir - Bush "had the experiences, insights, revelations and blind spots that could have made for a terrific memoir," he wrote.
In a review of books written by "never Trump" conservatives, Lozada questioned their role in their loss of power. "If conservatism has been hijacked by Trump, as they argue," he wrote, "who left it so vulnerable? . . . The Never Trumpers hold everyone culpable for the appeal of Trumpism except, in any worthwhile way, themselves."
"I try to write about books in a newsy way," Lozada said. "I want to use books and reviews of them to explain the moment, to understand where we are."
The Pulitzer jurors cited him "for trenchant and searching reviews and essays that joined warm emotion and careful analysis in examining a broad range of books addressing government and the American experience."
A native of Peru, Lozada grew up speaking Spanish at home. He learned English after his family moved to the San Francisco Bay area when he was 3. When he returned to Peru, living there from ages 10 to 17, he maintained his English skills by reading mysteries by Agatha Christie and American historical fiction by John Jakes.
He is a graduate of the University of Notre Dame and holds a master's degree in public policy from Princeton University.
Lozada has worked at The Post since 2005, serving as an economics and national security editor and as editor of the Outlook opinion section in which his reviews now appear. He noted wryly that he was turned down for the first job he applied for at The Post in 2004 - editor of nonfiction book reviews.
Tugnoli, a native of Italy who lives in Beirut, said he was "honored, humbled and bewildered" that his photos - 17 in all - from Yemen were recognized with a Pulitzer.
The images in his Yemen series included children injured in the fighting or enfeebled by malnutrition, towns devastated by warfare and shots of bounteous quantities of food that are out of the reach of starving people because of hyperinflation.
Tugnoli's association with The Post began in 2010 when he moved to Kabul and began freelancing for international organizations. He has often teamed with Sudarsan Raghavan, one of The Post's most experienced foreign correspondents, to cover stories in Tunisia, Libya and throughout the Middle East.
Tugnoli, 39, describes the Yemen assignment as particularly difficult, given that journalists must pass among multiple warring factions to enter the country and move within it. He and Raghavan made two trips to Yemen last year, the second one shortly after Khashoggi's murder by government agents from Saudi Arabia, which is leading a coalition fighting rebels in Yemen's civil war. "The local authorities were quite nervous to have a team of journalists from The Washington Post in the country," he said.
Bell, 44, may be best known as the creator of the "Candorville" strip, but his winning entry consisted of a portfolio of single-panel political cartoons published on newspaper editorial and op-ed pages. Bell's cartoons commented on subjects such as police shootings of unarmed African Americans, climate change, the treatment of migrants by immigration officials and, especially, Trump.
Bell, who lives in Los Angeles, is the first African American recipient of the editorial cartooning Pulitzer, which has been awarded since 1922. His editorial cartoons were syndicated by The Post Writers Group until August 2018 and are now distributed by King Features. ("Candorville" is still with the Post syndicate.)
"It's the old saying, 'Comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable,' " Bell said of his editorial approach. "I try to defend people and ideas that I think are being unfairly maligned and burst the bubbles of people and ideas that are unjustly exalted."
Post Executive Editor Martin Baron said the awards "show the breadth of talent that goes into journalism" at the news organization.

Texto completo: Lawmakers subpoenaed Deutsche Bank and other financial institutions on Monday as they chase down President Trump’s finances and personal information.

The Democrat-led House Intelligence and Financial Services committees that the sent subpoenas are examining Trump’s relationship with Deutsche Bank, which has lent Trump more than $2 billion over the years.

Investigators seek documents on business the business the banks conducted with a series of suspected Russian and other Eastern European money launderers, sources told the New York Times.

A spokesperson for the Deutsche Bank, Kerrie McHugh, acknowledged the bank was “engaged in productive dialogue” with the congressional panels.

“We remain committed to providing appropriate information to all authorized investigations in a manner consistent with our legal obligations,” McHugh said.

Among the other lenders to receive subpoenas were Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, and Bank of America.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the New York Times, nor did the Trump Organization.

Julian Assange is a political prisoner for revealing the truth

Texto completo: Last week’s arrest of Wikileaks publisher Julian Assange by the British government on a U.S. extradition order is an attack on all of us. It is an attack on the U.S. Constitution. It is an attack on the free press. It is an attack on free speech. It is an attack on our right to know what our government is doing with our money in our name.
Julian Assange is every bit as much a political prisoner as was Cardinal Mindszenty in Hungary or Nelson Mandela in South Africa.
They, and so many more, were imprisoned because they told the truth about their governments.
Repressive governments do not want their citizens to know that they are up to so they insist on controlling the media. We are taught, at the same time, that we have a free press whose job it is to uncover the corruption in our system so that we can demand our political leaders make some changes or face unemployment. That, we are told, is what makes us different from the totalitarian.
The arrest of Assange is a canary in a coal mine to warn us that something is very wrong with our system.
What’s wrong? The U.S. mainstream media always seems to do the bidding of the U.S. government. That is why they rushed to confirm Washington’s claim that the Assange indictment was not in any way about journalism. It was only about hacking government computers!
As the New York Times said in an editorial, sounding like a mouthpiece of the U.S. government, Julian Assange committed “an indisputable crime.” But was it? As actual journalist Glenn Greenwald wrote last week, what Julian Assange did in 2010, for which he is facing extradition to the U.S., is no different from what New York Times and other journalists do every day! He attempted to help Chelsea Manning shield Manning’s identity as Manning blew the whistle on U.S. government crimes to a publisher. The information in question included a video showing U.S. military personnel participating in and cheering the murder of Iraqi civilians. Why is it criminal for us to know this?
The difference is that what Assange and Manning did embarrassed the U.S. government, which was lying to us that it was “liberating” Iraq and Afghanistan when it was actually doing the opposite. Mainstream journalists publish “leaks” that help bolster the neocon or other vested narratives of the different factions of the US government. That’s why the US media wants to see Assange in prison, or worse: he upset their apple cart.
The lesson is clear: when you bolster the government’s narrative you are a “brave journalist.” When you expose corruption in government you are a criminal. Do we really want to live in a country where it is illegal to learn that our government is engaged in criminal acts? I thought we had an obligation as an engaged citizenry to hold our government accountable!
As long as Julian Assange is in prison, we are all in prison. When the government has the power to tell us what we are allowed to see, hear, and know, we no longer live in a free society. Julian Assange will be extradited to the U.S. and he will have dozens of charges piled on. They want him to disappear so that the next Assange will think twice before informing us of our government’s crimes. Are we going to let them steal our freedom?

Texto completo: ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Get our best stories as soon as they are published.
The Pulitzer Prize Board announced Monday that three articles in ProPublica’s “Trapped in Gangland” series on MS-13 by reporter Hannah Dreier won the 2019 Pulitzer Prize for feature writing. The winning stories were jointly published with New York magazine, Newsday and the New York Times Magazine. The award is the fifth Pulitzer Prize for ProPublica.
The ProPublica series “Zero Tolerance” was a finalist for this year’s Pulitzer Gold Medal for public service. The designation is ProPublica’s 11th Pulitzer finalist in 11 years.
For “Trapped in Gangland,” Dreier followed immigrants on Long Island whose lives were shattered by a botched crackdown on MS-13. After President Donald Trump took office and seized on MS-13’s violence to promote tougher immigration policies, Dreier soon realized that anti-immigrant rhetoric and police bias were undermining efforts to combat a brutal gang that preyed on Latino teenagers. She examined the impact of the gang and law enforcement on the region’s growing Latino community.
Dreier’s first piece, “A Betrayal,” co-published with New York magazine, chronicled the life of Henry, a Long Island high school student and MS-13 member desperate to escape the gang. He worked with law enforcement for about a year to help police and the FBI arrest fellow members, believing authorities would help him start a new life. Instead, they betrayed him by turning him over to immigration authorities.
Marked for deportation to his native El Salvador, and then for almost certain death as an informant, Henry and his lawyer decided that a news story might be a last remaining option to save his life. Henry arranged for Dreier to be given his cellphone, and she combed through years of text and WhatsApp conversations, as well as exchanges he had with his FBI handler. He helped her make a glossary of Spanish gang slang so that she could understand coded messages. He also agreed to let ProPublica use a video and photos of him.
As Dreier started reporting, she began thinking about how to balance Henry’s desire to tell his story with the threat to his life. She consulted with gang and law enforcement experts and adopted some restrictions that Henry did not ask for. She left out details about where he might go if he were released from jail. ProPublica and New York magazine didn’t publish his last name or run photos that might reveal his identity.
Hundreds reached out after the story’s publication, donating to a fundraiser that brought in $35,000 to help him find a safe place to live once he was released or deported. The Department of Homeland Security opened a civil rights investigation. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said it would stop creating detailed gang memos, which jeopardize informants, and offered to move Henry into protective custody.
In the end, “A Betrayal” didn’t stop Henry’s deportation to El Salvador, but, with the money that readers donated and the extra time allowed by a delay in his hearing, he was able to ultimately go into hiding in a safe third country.
A second piece, “The Disappeared,” published in partnership with Newsday and also featured on “This American Life” (whose story is separately a finalist for a Peabody Award), followed a mother, brushed off by police, searching for her missing son in woods called the “killing fields.” The story exposed the indifference of the Suffolk County Police Department when confronted with nearly a dozen Latino teenagers who went missing in 2016 and 2017. Even though parents begged police to investigate the disappearances, the department ignored families’ concerns — failing to provide Spanish-speaking interpreters, not pursuing leads, brushing off witnesses and labeling the teens runaways. It turned out that many of the missing children had been murdered by MS-13 members. Within a week of publication, the Police Department announced that it would investigate the mishandling of the MS-13 murders, and both of the detectives featured in ProPublica’s investigation are now under internal affairs review. The department also hired a civilian liaison to work with Latino residents and bolstered efforts to recruit Spanish-speaking officers.
The series’ final article, co-published with the New York Times Magazine, told the story of Alex, a high school student deported in an ICE roundup of suspected gang members with no criminal histories. In Alex’s case, he was accused of gang membership and deported to Honduras for drawing a devil, his school mascot but also an MS-13 symbol. A school-based police officer reported the doodle, circumventing privacy protections. In response to the story, the Huntington school district, where Alex had attended, removed police from school buildings, and, along with other districts, it sought a formal agreement with the police limiting officers’ roles in schools.
ProPublica senior editors Daniel Golden and Alexandra Zayas, as well as Nadia Sussman, Adriana Gallardo, Anna Vignet, Lucas Waldron and Terry Parris Jr. also contributed to the series. Photos for the series were taken by Natalie Keyssar and Demetrius Freeman, and it was designed and produced by Jillian Kumagai, Agnes Chang and Rob Weychert.
“Hannah interviewed dozens of immigrant families, teachers and FBI and police officials — many of whom initially refused to talk because they were afraid for their jobs, and sometimes even their lives,” Robin Fields, ProPublica’s managing editor, said. “Much of her reporting was conducted in gang-controlled neighborhoods, often late at night after sources returned from work. Despite continual warnings from lawyers, police and gang contacts that she was at risk, Hannah kept on reporting. Through her instinct, tenacity and earned trust, the stories amplified the experiences of Latino immigrants who have seldom been heard from in the debate about border security and MS-13.”
Read the Winning Entries
A Betrayal
The teenager told police all about his gang, MS-13. In return, he was slated for deportation and marked for death.
He Drew His School Mascot — and ICE Labeled Him a Gang Member
How high schools have embraced the Trump administration’s crackdown on MS-13, and destroyed immigrant students’ American dreams.
The Disappeared
Police on Long Island wrote off missing immigrant teens as runaways. One mother knew better — and searched MS-13’s killing fields for answers.
The “Zero Tolerance” series honored as a Pulitzer finalist for public service uncovered conditions at Border Patrol detention centers where thousands of children separated from their parents and unaccompanied minors have been sent. The series began with a source who had an explosive tip: nearly eight minutes of heart-wrenching audio from inside a U.S. Customs and Border Protection facility.
Published in a story by senior reporter Ginger Thompson in June 2018, the recording of children sobbing and begging for their parents set off a political firestorm and spurred an immediate change in the immigration debate. Lawmakers cited ProPublica’s audio as they condemned the administration’s policy. The children’s cries were played on the floors of the House and Senate. Protesters blared the recording at demonstrations around the country.
Faced with this uproar, and despite his previous insistence that he would stand by the policy, Trump within 48 hours of ProPublica’s story signed an executive order to end it and keep migrant families together. A federal judge in California ordered that parents and children be reunited within 30 days. By July, the child heard in the recording pleading to call her aunt, a 6-year-old girl from El Salvador named Jimena, was reunited with her mother.
ProPublica mobilized to look deeper into how children had been affected. Dozens of journalists in our newsrooms in New York and Chicago pitched in and filed public records requests for police reports and call logs concerning more than 100 shelters for immigrant children nationwide. Several stories based on this data brought to light for the first time hundreds of allegations of sexual abuse, fights, missing children, contemplations of suicide (published by ProPublica Illinois in partnership with Mother Jones) and a lack of oversight. One child psychiatrist called the situation a “gold mine” for predators.

Zero Tolerance
Trump’s Immigration Policy at the Border
Listen to Children Who’ve Just Been Separated From Their Parents at the Border
ProPublica has obtained audio from inside a U.S. Customs and Border Protection facility, in which children can be heard wailing as an agent jokes, “We have an orchestra here.”
The stories quickly upended assertions that the shelters were havens akin to summer camps and boarding schools. In Arizona, where reporters Topher Sanders and Michael Grabell tracked down the case of a shelter worker accused of molesting eight children, the governor ordered a statewide inspection. This led to the shutdown of two centers run by Southwest Key after the nonprofit failed to provide proof that its employees had completed background checks. Senators demanded an investigation, and the U.S. Health and Human Services Department’s inspector general is now reviewing employee background checks and the treatment of children in the nation’s shelter system.
Tracy Weber, Alexandra Zayas, Claudia Milne, Louise Kiernan, Steve Mills, Adriana Gallardo, Melissa Sanchez, Duaa Eldeib, Jodi S. Cohen, Kavitha Surana, Robert Faturechi, Alex Mierjeski, Claire Perlman, Ken Schwencke, Decca Muldowney, Derek Kravitz, Jess Ramirez, Rachel Glickhouse, María Sánchez Díez and Lilia Chang also contributed to the series.
“Zero Tolerance was first and foremost a policy aimed at children, and ProPublica focused its reporting on the experiences and voices of children,” Fields said. “Even when we didn’t have direct access to the children, or when they were too young to make sense of what they were going through, our reporters followed them through the system by tracking down their parents, as well as the lawyers, social workers and foster parents who were with them along their journeys. These efforts allowed us to present powerful, in-depth accounts of their time in the United States immigration system.”
ProPublica has now been honored with the Pulitzer Prize in five different categories. The newsroom received Pulitzer Prizes for public service in 2017, explanatory reporting in 2016, national reporting in 2011 and investigative reporting in 2010, in addition to being a finalist for both explanatory reporting and local reporting in 2018, a finalist for explanatory reporting in 2017, a finalist for national reporting in 2016 and a finalist for public service in 2010.

“There are no words sufficient to describe the loss of someone so young and full of promise — and mere weeks from graduation,” university president Rev. Joseph M. McShane said in a statement.
Fordham University's student newspaper, The Observer, reported that climbing the tower is a kind of "rite of passage" before graduation.
Monfries posted video from the top of the tower early Sunday with the caption "Bell tower," The New York Times reports.
McShane said Monfries' bachelor’s degree will be presented to her parents.
Authorities are investigating how Monfries gained access to the tower.

Texto completo: An excerpted editorial from
The New York Times
Scientists have finally confirmed something they had doubted, that Mars does occasionally emit puffs of methane into its atmosphere. That doesn't necessarily mean what you presume it means, that the Red Planet is or once was home to alien cows or other forms of life. But it could.
Most of the methane on Earth is pumped out by microbes and other living creatures - most notoriously cows, which emit vast clouds of the greenhouse gas (though largely by burps, contrary to popular lore). So while sniffing methane may not be so thrilling on Earth, discovering that Mars is burping up the stuff - following confirmation that there is water below its rusty surface - fits a critical piece in a most intriguing puzzle.
Searching for life on Mars, or getting there, has obsessed earthlings ever since telescopes enabled them to spy on the neighboring globe. The passion persists. The methane report last week, from scientists working for the European Space Agency's Mars Express orbiter, was followed by a statement from the NASA administrator, Jim Bridenstine, that the agency hopes to send astronauts to Mars by 2033. One way or another, the rusty dot of twilight is getting awfully lively.
The notion of Martian life gained popularity and respectability when Percival Lowell, a well-regarded scientist who founded the Lowell Observatory in Arizona, spent 15 years gazing at Mars at the close of the 19th century and came up with detailed maps of canals and oases, positing that they had been built by a civilization desperately tapping its last source of water as the planet dried up.
Sadly, science eventually quashed the Lowellian vision of intelligent life-forms digging ditches to delay their end, though it's something earthlings might ponder as they relentlessly accelerate their planet's doom by pumping carbon dioxide and other climate-altering gases (including methane) into the atmosphere. But if there are no canals or oases on Mars, there is liquid water, the sine qua non of life as we know it, and something burping up methane, a signature, though not a proof, of life.
The former was confirmed in July when Italian scientists working for the Mars Express mission reported that they had detected a 12-mile-wide underground liquid pool near the Martian South Pole. And now the same team of scientists has confirmed earlier readings of wafts of methane by measurements from the Mars Express orbiter and from NASA's Curiosity rover.
Neither is proof of life. The lake was probably too salty to freeze, and therefore too salty for life, and methane can be produced by geological processes, or it could have been produced eons ago and trapped under ice. So the search goes on. But at least scientists have pinpointed where the gas is coming from, which is within the Gale Crater, near the Martian Equator, where the Curiosity rover is still actively sniffing and sifting for microbial life.
That might be a good spot for NASA's astronauts to start their explorations, perhaps scoping sites for the canals and oases desperate earthlings will need when they flee their overheated planet.

Texto completo: For New Jersey residents, it all feels very new. After years of emotional debate, lawmakers approved a measure last month to allow terminally ill patients to end their lives with medical help, and last week Gov. Phil Murphy signed it into law.
But so-called aid-in-dying laws have been in effect for over two decades in the United States. Oregon was the first to approve such a measure, in 1994, followed by Washington in 2008 and four other states in the past six years.
Litigation has closely followed just about every successful vote to decriminalize assisted suicide, but courts have generally allowed such laws to be implemented, and polling has shown the policies to be popular among residents with access to them.
Now that New Jersey is the latest state to permit strictly regulated, medically assisted suicide for its residents, here's a look at the events that led to the gradual spread of the policy across the country.
Oregon the pioneer In a victory for groups trying to wrest end-of-life choices away from the state and the medical profession, Oregon voters narrowly approved a measure in 1994 to make it the first place in North America where doctors could legally help patients end their lives.
Oregon's ballot question came in the wake of failed attempts to legalize assisted suicide in Washington and California. But unlike the measures in those states, the Oregon measure did not allow doctors to administer a lethal dose.
Nonetheless, the backlash was fierce. The Vatican, which viewed the measure as a half-step from euthanasia, condemned the Oregon vote as "a day of mourning for all humanity," according to a report in The New York Times.
Such depth of emotion spawned more than a decade of litigation that twice brought Oregon's policy before the U.S. Supreme Court. It would be years before another state followed Oregon's example.
Legal challenges Within weeks of the Oregon referendum, implementation of the law was put on hold after lawyers for the National Right to Life Committee challenged the measure as unconstitutional, arguing that it violated the rights of terminally ill people to equal protection.
Around the same time, other cases challenging bans on medically assisted suicide in New York and Washington made their way to the U.S. Supreme Court. In the summer of 1997, justices ruled that the Constitution does not provide a general right to assisted suicide, but they left the door open to states to experiment with such laws.
Four months later, the high court removed the last legal obstacle to the Oregon law taking effect, and voters there again endorsed the measure when they roundly defeated a ballot measure aimed at repealing the law.
After more threats, laws spread A series of threats from Washington, D.C., over the next decade had a chilling effect on other states considering assisted suicide laws. After unsuccessful attempts by members of Congress to overturn Oregon's law, U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft announced in 2001 that doctors who prescribed lethal medication under state law risked losing their federal licenses to prescribe controlled substances.
That directive, too, was met with a legal challenge, culminating five years later in the U.S. Supreme Court again defending the Oregon law, ruling that Ashcroft had overstepped his authority.
Washington was the next state to approve an assisted suicide law in 2008, followed by Vermont in 2013, California in 2015, Colorado in 2016 and Hawaii in 2018. The District of Columbia also allows medically assisted suicide.
Montana does not have a statute permitting the practice, but a 2009 state Supreme Court ruling said state law protects doctors from prosecution for helping terminally ill patients die. Since the ruling, Montana lawmakers have introduced several bills to ban the practice, but none has passed.
What to expect in New Jersey If New Jersey is like other states that have legalized medically assisted suicide, participation rates will gradually increase over time. In Oregon, the first state to allow the practice, 249 people received prescriptions for lethal medication last year, up from 24 in 1998, according to state data. Cancer has been the most common underlying illness there, followed by neurological and respiratory diseases.
Deaths under so-called aid-in-dying laws have accounted for a tiny fraction of overall deaths in other states. Still, it's possible some people from neighboring states could establish residency in New Jersey to take advantage of its assisted suicide law. Brittany Maynard, a 29-year-old with terminal brain cancer, for example, made international news when she moved from her home state of California to Oregon in 2014 to legally end her life.
Under the New Jersey measure, patients can prove their residency by showing a doctor their driver's license or non-driver ID card, proof they are registered to vote in New Jersey, a resident income tax return or "any other government record" that demonstrates residency.
The new law will take effect Aug. 1.

Texto completo: Champaign's Virginia Theatre wasn't originally on the list of destinations for Jeff Tweedy's 2019 tour in support of his latest solo album. But rest assured, it is now. After all, the former frontman for the Chicago-based alt-rock band Wilco has a pretty rock-solid fan base hereabouts.
As a founding member and leader of Wilco, and before that the co-founder of the alt-country band Uncle Tupelo, Tweedy has already built an impressive reputation as an accomplished songwriter, musician and performer. Since launching Wilco in 1994, the Belleville native and current Chicago resident has written original songs for 10 Wilco albums and collaborated with folk singer Billy Bragg on three albums full of Woody Guthrie-penned lyrics in the Mermaid Avenue series. In 2014, Tweedy released "Sukierae," a musical collaboration with his son, drummer Spencer Tweedy. And he has produced a trio of albums for iconic soul and gospel singer Mavis Staples -- the 2011 Grammy-winning "You Are Not Alone," 2013's "One True Vine" and the 2017 release, which he also co-wrote with Staples, "If All I Was Was Black."
Tweedy added published author to his resume this past November with the release of his memoir, The New York Times' best-seller "Let's Go (So We Can Get Back): A Memoir of Recording and Discording with Wilco, Etc.," via Dutton, along with a new solo album, "WARM," from dBpm Records.
Thursday's show, which features special guest James Elkington, starts at 7:30 p.m. (doors open at 6:30 p.m.) Reserved seating tickets are available, ranging from $39.50 to $59.50.
If you're up for checking out an up-and-coming local rock band -- and once just isn't enough -- you can catch Urbana-based Today's Children at any or all of three shows they have booked this month at The Canopy Club.
The first starts at 9:30 p.m. Saturday when Today's Children opens for Bad Columbus. Tickets are $5 at the door. The band will also host an open jam at 8:30 p.m. Wednesday, April 24, and open for Grant Milliren at 8 p.m. Sunday, April 28.
Today's Children -- Nick Arger, Robert Audino, Cameron Kern and Alex McAfee -- have been playing together since September. Having built up a small local following and graduated to Chicago area bookings, they're now working on original material for their upcoming debut EP, due this summer. Special kudos for their show-closing tribute to "our rock 'n' roll forefathers": Chuck Berry's "Johnny B. Goode."

What does the Choice Hotels TV commercial tagline mean?

Autor: HELDENFELS, RICH.

Texto completo: Q: Please explain the tagline "Bocca-Book Bocca-Boom" (or however it is spelled) for Choice Hotels TV commercials. No one I know has a clue what it means or the origin.
A: According to the hotel chain, the phrase is "Badda Book. Badda Boom." The slogan draws on the expression "bada bing, bada boom," which as the Oxford English Dictionary notes, refers to something happening suddenly or easily. The OED has references to the original phrase going back more than 50 years; the most famous uses of the term are likely those in mob chronicles such as "The Sopranos" (where the topless club was called Bada Bing) and "The Godfather." A Choice Hotels press release said its slogan indicates "there's an easy way to plan and book hotel stays, and find the lowest hotel rates guaranteed ... (by) booking direct at ChoiceHotels.com."
Q: Do you know if "Southern Charm" is coming back on Bravo? Being from Savannah and Charleston I sure liked the "Southern Charm" shows set there. There was a little too much bickering sometimes, but no more than on all those "Real Housewives" shows.
A: Bravo will offer a sixth season of "Southern Charm" and the Charleston, S.C., cast beginning on May 15. According to the network, returning cast members will include Craig Conover, Kathryn Dennis, Cameran Eubanks, Austen Kroll, Chelsea Meissner and Shep Rose. Former star Thomas Ravenel, who is also Kathryn's ex, will not be in this season. He has reportedly said that being on "Southern Charm" was "the worst mistake of my life."
New to the cast are Naomie Olindo and Eliza Limehouse. Storylines include Kathryn hoping to rise in the social hierarchy, Cameran working on a work-life balance, Craig hiring a personal assistant, and Shep getting a new dog.
Q: I am writing about this great show "God Friended Me." I find it very refreshing and it covers many facets of humanity with a diverse cast, all while talking about doing good by helping others. I hope this program goes on for a long time. It is so uplifting.
A: The drama will have its first season finale on April 14, but don't worry. It has been renewed for a second season. "It's one of the top three new series on television, has improved its time period significantly, and continues a long tradition of prestige dramas for CBS on (Sunday) night," said Kelly Kahl, president, CBS Entertainment, in the renewal announcement.
Q: We were in Morocco from 1970 to 1973 when my husband was in the Navy. At that time, the king of Morocco was King Hassan. His wife was Latifa, which would make her Queen Latifa. I wonder if the American actress/singer chose her name, Queen Latifa, from the former Moroccan queen?
A: A New York Times profile of the multitalented Queen Latifah (with an h, unlike the common spelling of the Moroccan royal) says the former Dana Owens "named herself Latifah as a child, after learning it was Arabic for 'delicate, sensitive and kind.' "

Texto completo: Poignant stories of violence and loss, perseverance and hope are depicted in photographer James A. Bowey’s exhibit "When Home Won’t Let You Stay," on display until Sunday, May 26, at the Schaumburg Township Library, 130 S. Roselle Road, Schaumburg. The exhibit is on the library’s second floor.
As Bowey, a documentary artist, traveled throughout Minnesota in an exploration of America’s evolving attitudes toward refugees, he listened to refugees’ stories and photographed them in their everyday surroundings.
Each was forced to leave their country in order to survive. The experiences shared by the refugees featured in "When Home Won’t Let You Stay" produce a compelling human portrait of refugees in Minnesota.
"One of the most difficult things a person ever does is to truly see another," Bowey said in his artist statement. "But if we really look at someone and consider their story, we discover the shared humanity that links us all. That is the hope for this work: to find ourselves in each other, one photograph at a time."
Bowey uses his documentary and photography skills to explore issues of human rights and social connection. He has spent his career covering a wide range of global and national stories, from the war in Bosnia to Hurricane Katrina. His photography and writing has been featured in The New York Times, Time magazine, The Associated Press, and in numerous exhibitions.
For a full listing of upcoming programs, see the library’s Guide or visit www.SchaumburgLibrary.org.

Texto completo: You can still "tell 'em that Moose sent you," as James "Moose" Werner's well-known slogan goes, but Werner is about to sell The Club Tavern in Middleton, which he's owned for 39 years.
Werner, 64, is selling the business to Dale Beck, who owns the restaurant and bar North of the Bayou, on Madison's Far East Side, and two other bars. The sale is expected to be official Monday, Werner said.
Beck will be doing some remodeling and repairs, and will be keeping The Club Tavern's bar manager and kitchen manager to continue running it the same way, Werner said.
Werner originally put The Club Tavern, 1915 Branch St., in Middleton, on the market for $1.75 million in 2008 and it's been on the market on and off since. Most recently, it's been for sale the past three years.
"Unfortunately, I didn't receive that kind of money," said Werner, who would not disclose the sale price.
Beck didn't respond to phone calls or text messages last week.
Werner initially opened the business with a partner and has had another partner over the years.
The Club Tavern is known for live music, Cajun food, volleyball, supporting local charities, and the fact that Werner wears shorts almost year-round. He's also known for providing customers with free rides on New Year's Eve.
The late UW-Madison professor E.E. LeMasters hung out there for his 1976 book "Blue Collar Aristocrats." He disguised the bar as "The Oasis" in his book.
"After five years of collecting notes on overheard or engaged conversation and observed behavior, he was capable of documenting opinions, attitudes and conduct in a way no structured interview schedule could have captured," The New York Times reported.
"He subsequently organized the material in the areas of work, marriage, divorce, sex, children, recreation, drinking patterns, politics, race and religion."
One of Dane County's oldest drinking establishments, the building was built between 1860 and 1880 as a boardinghouse and stables for the Stamm House Stage Line.
It opened in the 1880s as Ye Olde Tavern, and became The Club Tavern in 1921. Werner bought it in 1981.
"It's one of the oldest non-closing taverns in the state because it never closed for Prohibition," Werner said.
Because "Middleton's just a little 'burb, a little speck on the map and they didn't cause any problems," the tavern was able to keep a low profile during the 1920s and early 1930s, Werner said.
Music fades out
The club has live music two nights a week and karaoke two nights. In the club's "heyday" in the 1990s and early 2000s, it had live music five or six nights a week.
"People don't want it. People stopped paying for it," Werner said. "It's always been a problem on this side of town to get people to pay a cover."
For that reason, he couldn't bring in touring acts, and there weren't enough good local acts to have live music all week, he said. "We tried all sorts of different combinations. Some of them worked for a while, some didn't."
Harmonica player "Westside Andy" Linderman had a "phenomenal" nine-year run at the club, Werner said. In the restaurant side of the building, Werner serves jambalaya and other Cajun offerings, a Friday fish fry, prime rib, and all-you-caneat buffets for certain occasions, most recently on St. Patrick's Day, when he said he went through a couple of hundred pounds of corned beef.
Werner plans to semi-retire, but intends to still do catering out of The Club Tavern, for Beck and for himself.
Badgers lore
His favorite memory from the club came during the UW football team's 1993 season, when the Badgers won their final regular-season game, over Michigan State, in Tokyo, and clinched their first Rose Bowl berth in 31 years.
"I wanted to be the first person to have T-shirts after the Badgers won because I knew they were going to win," Werner said.
He had almost 10,000 Rose Bowl T-shirts printed the second the game was over, and started selling them. All the proceeds went to various charities.
Werner, who grew up in "the shadow of Camp Randall," on Chamberlain Avenue in "the now fashionable" University Heights neighborhood, got the name "Moose" playing Wiffle ball in fifth grade.
Every time his teammates did a moose call when he was batting, he'd hit a home run "and it just stuck," he said.
Werner said he's grateful to his loyal customers, his staff, and the musicians who have played the club. He'd also like thank his family, and noted that a lot of his employees are his "family" also.
"I want people to remember The Club Tavern as a nice, friendly place that reached out and did as much good as we possibly could." CREDIT: SAMARA KALK DERBY skalk@madison.com

The Julian Assange problem

Información de publicación: Spokesman Review ; Spokane, Wash. [Spokane, Wash]. 14 Apr 2019: E.2.

Texto completo: They say that guests are like fish; after three days they become a bit whiffy. By this measure, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange smelled like an overladen fishing vessel adrift in the searing sun.
Upon his arrest Thursday by British authorities, ending his nearly seven-year asylum in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, revelations emerged that he was less than an ideal guest. He reportedly was rude and aggressive toward his hosts and demonstrated little interest in hygiene. In his grossest display of disaffection, he apishly smeared his feces on the embassy walls, according to Ecuador's interior minister.
Assange's behavior makes one wonder about his mental health. Maybe he lost his mind while being confined for so long. On the other hand, he seemed quite cognizant as he left the embassy, offering peace signs and a thumbs-up to bystanders.
If Assange is, indeed, of right mind, then we can only conclude that he's a solid jerk. Certainly, his non-fans - including many in the U.S. media - long have viewed him as a sociopathic interloper operating under the protection of free speech. More on that anon.
No stranger to legal problems, Assange has been indicted by the U.S. on one count of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion. This sounds more like a stay-after-school offense than what one might expect given the potentially disastrous ramifications of Assange's publishing activities. Then again, Al Capone was brought down on tax evasion.
While the government seems to want to avoid a battle over the First Amendment, focusing mostly on conspiracy, it can later charge Assange with something more. Meanwhile, media talk has turned to whether Assange is really a journalist and if free-speech protections ought to apply to someone who is (allegedly) a criminal first? Despite the recent surge in "citizen journalists," saying you're a journalist doesn't make you one. (Granted, some are better than the "real" ones.)
The difference between someone like Assange publishing whatever leaks land in his lap and, say, the Washington Post, which published the leaked documents known as the Pentagon Papers, is mostly a lot of worry and process. Most responsible reporters and editors routinely ask themselves questions such as: Should we publish this? Does the public interest override other concerns? Is it justifiable to expose someone's personal emails and under what circumstances?
One supposes that Assange never bothered himself with such pesky queries. But then, why should he? He is not, after all, a journalist, despite his claiming to be, because he isn't accountable to anyone. No filters, no standards.
In the case of the Pentagon Papers, former Rand Corp. military analyst Daniel Ellsberg stole thousands of pages of a top-secret report detailing the U.S. government's decades-long campaign of deceit, mayhem and murder related to the war in Vietnam. Ellsberg first gave the documents to the New York Times, which published three articles about them before the White House obtained a court injunction. Ellsberg then provided copies to the Post, which, after due consideration, began publishing its own stories.
In deliberating whether to run them, Post publisher Katharine Graham deployed lawyers and editors to weigh the potential legal and commercial consequences against allowing the government to continue lying and sacrificing lives. Graham's bravery in standing up to the U.S. government and the courts - all while risking great personal and financial loss - was epic.
Assange's process, on the other hand, is largely to dump secrets in the town square and let the scavengers sort it out. No filter. No conscience.
It isn't hyperbolic to say we're at a hinge point regarding how we gather and disseminate information. Does anyone have the right to publish stolen/classified materials? Should the manner of obtaining information inform the right to publish? For now, at least, the Assange case provides little help, but precedent may offer clues.
On the surface, Ellsberg and Assange seem similar. Ellsberg stole - and newspapers published. Assange allegedly conspired to steal - and he published. The difference may be mostly political.
The Vietnam War was unpopular, and the government demonstrably lied to the American people for decades, unconscionably committing tens of thousands of young Americans to their early graves. Ellsberg's charges on theft, conspiracy and espionage were eventually dismissed.
Wikileaks leaked hundreds of thousands of secret documents that potentially endangered Americans and allies around the world and, possibly, helped get Donald Trump elected.
One was a historic act of bravery; the other seems more like feces-smearing by a fishy-smelling "cypherpunk."

11:30 a.m. April 14. Free. 502 Brushy St. facebook.com/events/310193816300064
Let’s be honest: This is probably going to be the most important thing that happens to all of us this week. The final season of “Game of Thrones” isn’t just coming anymore; it’s finally here, and we’re probably going to need a special place to watch it at while we’re trying not to freak out.

Tacos from Pueblo Viejo and themed drink specials at the bar will be on hand while you enjoy the show on a 25-foot high-definition screen.

8 p.m. April 15. $35. 305 E. Fifth St. antonesnightclub.com
One thing we can always count on from Austin’s “home of the blues” is the continuation of founder Clifford Antone’s penchant for bringing legendary performers to play the club in their later years. Bell, who’ll turn 80 in July, certainly qualifies: With 1960s hits such as “You Don’t Miss Your Water,” he became one of storied Memphis label Stax Records’ most successful artists. His 2016 release “This Is Where I Live” won a Grammy Award for Best Americana Album. — Peter Blackstock

4. CineNoche: “Embrace of the Serpent”

The internationally co-produced adventure film centers on Karamakate, an Amazonian shaman and the last survivor of his people, and the two scientists who build a friendship with him over the course of 40 years. The film was inspired by the real-life journals of two explorers who traveled through the Colombian Amazon during the last century in search of the sacred and difficult-to-find psychedelic Yakruna plant.
5. “Proof” with the Wimberley Players
7:30 p.m. Friday and Saturday, 2:30 p.m. Sunday through May 5. $18-$22. 450 Old Kyle Road, Wimberley. 512-847-0575, wimberleyplayers.org
Simple, elegant and riveting, “Proof” is the story of a mathematics professor named Robert, his worried daughter and a groundbreaking proof. A genius at solving complex problems, Robert’s brilliance and mental decline are legend. After his death, his daughter begins to fear that his mental issues are affecting her. When a former student discovers a groundbreaking proof in Robert’s office, a family secret is unearthed. The Wimberley Players takes on this Pulitzer Prize-winning production.
6. Aaron Franklin at BookPeople
7 p.m. April 19. Free. 603 N. Lamar Blvd. 512-472-5050, bookpeople.com
The owner of Franklin Barbecue may be regarded as the bona fide brisket expert in Texas, but the meat he really loves to eat and cook at home is steak. In “Franklin Steak,” his follow-up to the New York Times best-selling book “Franklin Barbecue,” the pitmaster demonstrates how to make his favorite food to complete perfection. Listen to Franklin talk at BookPeople about his latest cooking guide; afterward, he’ll sign your copy of the book.
7. Willie Nelson Brunch at Trace at the W
10:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. April 20. Free. 200 Lavaca St. traceaustin.com/calendar
With 4/20 on a Saturday this year, you can bet there are a whole bunch of events this weekend tied to cannabis culture, including this one. It might well be the most Austin of all 4/20-related good times, as a Willie-inspired brunch. Throughout the late morning and early afternoon, sit back and enjoy specialty cocktails and bites while listening to some of Willie’s biggest hits. There’s no word on the menu yet, but it probably will be pretty carb-heavy.

Texto completo: While cursive has been relegated to nearly extinct tasks like writing thank-you cards and signing checks, rumors of its death may be exaggerated.
The Common Core standards seemed to spell the end of the writing style in 2010 when they dropped requirements that the skill be taught in public elementary schools, but about two dozen states have reintroduced the practice since then.
Last year, elementary schools in Illinois were required to offer at least one class on cursive.
Last month, a law went into effect in Ohio providing funding for materials to help students learn cursive by fifth grade.
And beginning this fall, second graders in Texas will learn cursive, and will be required to know how to write it legibly by third grade.
Even as keyboards and screens have supplanted pencil and paper in schools, lawmakers and defenders of cursive have lobbied to re-establish this old-school writing pedagogy across the country, igniting a debate about American values and identity and exposing intergenerational fault lines.
When Anne Trubek, the author of "The History and Uncertain Future of Handwriting," started studying the resurgence of cursive about a decade ago, reasons for teaching it focused on developing a civilized, well-mannered population.
"People were upset about the idea that you might not seem educated if you didn't know cursive," she said.
But in recent years, the reasoning for cursive became associated with "convention, tradition, conservatism," she said, and tied to discussions about school uniforms and the Pledge of Allegiance.
Indeed, several Republican lawmakers have spearheaded campaigns to revive the writing style.
In 2016, lawmakers in Washington introduced a bill backing cursive after Pam Roach, then a Republican state senator, noted that a constituent had said her grandchild could not read a handwritten letter. The measure did not pass.
"Part of being an American is being able to read cursive writing," Ms. Roach told King 5 News.
Lawmakers have also invoked the Declaration of Independence, which was marked by John Hancock's flamboyant signature, as a reason for a script revival.
Andrew Brenner told the local news media in Ohio in December, when he was a state representative, that he had co-sponsored a bill requiring cursive instruction because studies show benefits for brain development and hand dexterity. He said it also taught students to read prominent historical texts.
"You can learn the founding documents from reading them directly," Mr. Brenner, a Republican who now serves in the Ohio Senate, told The Fulton County Expositor.
Others have emphasized the importance of a signature.
"I think your cursive writing identifies you as much as your physical features do," Dickie Drake, a Republican state representative in Alabama who introduced a bill requiring schools to provide cursive instruction by the end of third grade, told The New York Times in 2016.
Lawmakers in Louisiana supported an even broader measure, in part, because Magna Carta and the United States Constitution were written in cursive. State senators shouted "America!" when they unanimously approved it in 2016.
The history of society is intertwined with the history of script.
"When we want to embrace the past, when we get nostalgic for the past, when we think it was better, then we get all warm and fuzzy about handwriting," Tamara Plakins Thornton, the author of "Handwriting in America," said in an interview with NPR.
Cursive was also politicized during the Cold War, becoming a display of patriotism.
"Unbelievably, there were arguments that the fact that American kids couldn't do cursive made us vulnerable to the Russian menace," Dr. Thornton said.
Psychologists and neuroscientists say that handwriting positively affects brain development, motor skills, comprehension and memory. Cursive may be particularly helpful for those with developmental dysgraphia -- motor-control difficulties in forming letters -- and it may help prevent the reversal and inversion of letters, according to a 2012 report.
But some research has been taken out of context, or misrepresented, to further a pro-cursive agenda, said Kate Gladstone, who calls herself the Handwriting Repairwoman and runs an organization by the same name.
"The world of handwriting is very much the world of fake news and crooked elections," she said.
In 2018, State Senator Jean Leising of Indiana was called out for citing a study that she claimed showed cursive writing "prepares students' brains for reading and enhances their writing fluency and composition." The researcher said the study made claims only about writing by hand.
There are also corporate interests at play. In 2013, Ms. Gladstone traced research that was used in bills in North and South Carolina to require cursive instruction in schools to a for-profit company that creates instructional materials to teach handwriting, Zaner-Bloser Publishing.
Kathleen Wright, a spokeswoman for the company's handwriting division, said that it does not lobby for legislation, but that it does provide lawmakers with research "because we're recognized as the gold standard of handwriting instruction," she said.
But Ms. Wright acknowledged that some legislators "may have erroneously conflated studies showing the cognitive benefits of writing by hand to focus specifically on the benefits of writing in cursive."
Sheila Lowe, the president of the American Handwriting Analysis Foundation, said that about 21 states had adopted some form of cursive requirement in schools since the Common Core standards were introduced.
"We're not trying to replace electronics," Ms. Lowe said. "Cursive is an important part of brain training."
The foundation formed Campaign for Cursive, which works with legislators to craft measures supporting the practice and offers training courses for cursive coaches as well as an annual "Cursive Is Cool" competition.
Gayna Scott, a leader of the campaign, said cursive was a surprisingly charged topic, both emotionally and politically.
"You can get people worked up about it," she said.
But the organization has been able to "change over quite a few states" by providing research to decision makers about the benefits, she added.
"There are a lot of people who think we're as old as dinosaurs," she said, but "it's a lifelong skill that is part of a well-rounded education. Why leave it out?"
Some teachers say policymakers are out of touch with the realities of the modern classroom.
"I am here to build 21st-century learners," said Heather Sox, a fifth-grade teacher in Greenville, S.C. "We should expose them, but I think you can do it in other ways that don't involve 'skill and drill."'
A few years ago, after a new mandate was imposed, she had to "find time during the week" to teach cursive, she said. Although the students barely touched the new workbooks, she said, she still had to give them a handwriting grade.
Noelle Mapes, a third-grade teacher at a public school on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, said the agenda to include cursive classes "feels like a big nostalgia move."
"I'm a millennial teacher, so it almost feels like a boomer effort," she said.
The practice was helpful when teaching children with occupational therapy needs or fine motor skill needs. But requiring cursive is not a good use of time, she said, especially because schools and teachers face more urgent demands.
"Add typing skills, anti-racist pedagogy, add activism skills, add digital literacy," she said. "There are so many other things."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Trump's season for 'treason'

Texto completo: This must be the season for treason.
In the Oval Office on Thursday afternoon, President Trump gave a lesson on American justice to the visiting South Korean president. Speaking about the Mueller investigation and its origins, Trump said: "This is actually treason."
This wasn't offhand. On Wednesday, Trump tweeted that the probe was a "Treasonous Hoax" and that "what the Democrats are doing with the Border is TREASONOUS." That same day, boarding Marine One, he reaffirmed that what Democrats and Justice Department officials did in the Mueller probe "was treason."
On April 6, he declared it's "about time the perpetrators ... start defending their dishonest and treasonous acts." He added an injunction associated with the Holocaust: "Never Forget!"
This has become routine. Trump told Fox News's Sean Hannity: "It was really treason. ... You are talking about major, major treason."
Minor treason is a thing?
Trump has publicly invoked "treason" or "treasonous" on 26 occasions, according to the Factba.se compilation of Trump utterances. That's in addition to various and sundry "traitor" references. He began by accusing the likes of Bowe Bergdahl, Edward Snowden and Chelsea Manning, then moved on to include the executives of Univision and Macy's, Republicans who didn't support him, Democratic lawmakers who didn't applaud him, the "failing" New York Times, the media generally, people in his administration who leak, and Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, John Podesta, Eric Holder, Loretta Lynch, Huma Abedin, James Comey, James Clapper, Rod J. Rosenstein, Robert Mueller, Andrew McCabe, Lisa Page and Peter Strzok.
The Constitution specifically says treason "shall consist only in levying war against" the United States "or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort," and it requires two witnesses. The U.S. Criminal Code requires that those guilty of treason "shall suffer death, or shall be imprisoned not less than five years."
The strict definition and grave punishment make treason cases rare: only about 30 in U.S. history. Trump must know this, because he has vowed to protect all 12 articles of the Constitution - even though it has only seven. He appeared to recognize the gravity of the treason accusation when it was leveled against him. "When they say 'treason', you know what treason is? That's Julius and Ethel Rosenberg for giving the atomic bomb," he said in 2017. (Actually, the charge was conspiracy to commit espionage.)
Because Trump knows the seriousness of the charge, he therefore must be interpreting treason the way King Henry VIII did, in the lèse-majesté sense: Treason is anything that offends the dignity of the sovereign. Disagreement with Trump is an offense against the state, just as Henry executed unfaithful wives for treason.
This means the following people have committed capital crimes: All journalists and late-night hosts. Anyone who leaks. All Democratic members of Congress and people who worked in Democratic administrations. Anyone who ran against Trump. Anyone who criticizes Trump on social media. Anyone who voted against Trump.
This means 65,853,514 Hillary Clinton voters will have to be imprisoned or executed. The U.S. criminal-justice system can't handle much more than the 2.3 million people it already holds.
This unfortunately argues for mass execution - unless exile is a possibility? Imagine the size of that caravan heading south toward Mexico.
Early on, Trump was relatively restrained in his treason talk. He even criticized Kim Jong Un's liberal use of the treason charge. (Trump now calls Kim his "friend.") He began applying the label more to the Mueller probe, and FBI officials, in 2018. He determined that "leakers are traitors" and said critical news coverage of his talks with Kim was "almost treasonous." He said an anonymous op-ed writer and the New York Times both committed treason. He said Democrats who did not applaud at his State of the Union address were "Un-American. Somebody said, 'treasonous.'"
Democrats continue to commit treason by disagreeing with Trump on immigration, though most treason these days is committed by Justice. An image Trump retweeted in November, showing various current and former senior law enforcement officials (including Trump's own appointee Rosenstein) behind bars, asked: "When do the trials for treason begin?"
Trump's new attorney general, William Barr, has been fueling Trump's paranoia. His declaration this last week that law enforcement officials were "spying" on the Trump campaign prompted a new cry of treason.
During his confirmation hearings, Barr said that "the Barrs and Muellers were good friends and would be good friends when this is all over." Maybe they can reminisce about their friendship while Mueller awaits his turn on the gallows.

Omar al-Bashir, the 'Spider' at the heart of Sudan's web

Texto completo: Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir loved to tell the story about his broken tooth.
As a schoolboy working on a construction site, he told supporters in January, he fell and broke the tooth while carrying a heavy load. Instead of seeking treatment he rinsed his mouth with saltwater and kept working.
Later, after he joined the army, he refused a silver tooth implant because he wanted to remember his hardships. "This one," he said, pointing to a gap in his mouth, as supporters erupted into laughter.
The story was a way for al-Bashir, who was ousted Thursday after 30 years of iron-fisted rule over Sudan, to play up his humble origins - to show that he remained a man of the people who, like him, hailed from dusty farming villages on the Nile.
The folksy image was a jarring contrast with al-Bashir's image in the West, where he was often seen as a heartless warmonger, as a coddler of terrorists like Osama bin Laden and as the accused architect of a genocidal purge in Darfur that killed hundreds of thousands of people. Since 2009, the International Criminal Court has sought to arrest him on war crimes charges that include murder, rape and extermination.
But global notoriety was never much of a problem for al-Bashir, 75, at home in Sudan, a vast African country with a long history of war and suffering. He outwitted rivals who underestimated him, steered a decade-long oil boom that swelled Sudan's middle classes, and forged a network of security forces and armed militias to fight his wars that some likened to a spider's web with al-Bashir at its center.
That carefully constructed edifice of power crumbled this week as thousands of protesters massed outside his Khartoum residence, chanting slogans and braving gunfire as rival gangs of soldiers exchanged fire. The oil money was running low, the economy was in tatters and young Sudanese, in particular, had had enough. The spider had to go.
"Just fall, that is all!" they chanted.
On Thursday morning, the military ousted him, ending his 30-year rule in the face of the sweeping demonstrations. It said it had taken al-Bashir into custody, dissolved the government and suspended the Constitution.
Born into a farming family in a dusty village 100 miles north of Khartoum, the capital, al-Bashir served as a paratroop commander in the army. In 1989, he headed an Islamist junta that ousted Prime Minister Sadiq al-Mahdi in a bloodless coup, Sudan's fourth military takeover since independence in 1956.
For the first decade of his rule, though, al-Bashir, was seen as a frontman for a more powerful force - the cleric Hassan al-Turabi, a smooth-talking, Sorbonne-educated ideologue with sweeping ideas about embedding Shariah law deep in Sudan's diverse society and institutions.
International jihadis flocked to Sudan in that period, among them Osama bin Laden, who bought a house in an upmarket Khartoum district and invested in agriculture and construction. In 1993, the United States blacklisted al-Bashir's government as an international sponsor of terrorism and imposed sanctions four years later.
In 1999, after a falling-out, al-Bashir outmaneuvered al-Turabi and cast him into prison. He turned back to the army to underwrite his authority, forging relationships that spanned the military, the security forces and the country's tribal leadership.
Al-Bashir assiduously attended the funerals and weddings of military officers, often sending presents of sugar, tea or dried goods to their families. He held an open house once a week where commissioned officers could drop in and meet with him, said Alex de Waal, a professor at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, and an expert on Sudan.

Texto completo: His upcoming performance was to be a huge one, but in the days leading up to the Krannert Center's grand opening in 1969, Shozo Sato stopped his Kabuki theater rehearsal in its tracks on the Colwell Playhouse floor when a few special visitors entered the room.
After all, without a $16 million gift from Herman and Ellnora Krannert, who walked in with what Sato called their "entourage," the stage he was standing on wouldn't have existed.
"I stopped the rehearsal and thanked them for the great gift, and they were very, very happy that not a typical American, but a Japanese -- and in those days totally unique -- performance would take place at the grand opening," Sato said. "Within that short period of time, I have a wonderful memory of actually seeing them, actually thanking them, and they were very, very gracious."
At Saturday's 50th anniversary gala for Krannert Center, Sato thinks he'll be the only person in attendance who actually met the Krannerts. He's one of the few who will remember the coin laundries, small restaurants and stores that lined the area where the behemoth of Krannert Center for the Performing Arts now lies.
He's not the only one still around who was at the opening festival and enjoyed the revelation that was Krannert Center in the early years, though. Al Huang was also there.
Huang, who is performing several times as part of Krannert's multiyear 50th anniversary celebration but has to miss Saturday's gala because of a scheduling conflict, showed up to the long ago formal event in his Nehru jacket and platform shoes.
"It was quite spectacular," Huang said. "The whole town turned out in their gowns and pearls and diamonds in the lobby.
"At that time, it was the Lincoln Center in the middle of the country."
While it was a spectacle in its time, Krannert's opening wasn't without its hiccups. Those planning the allocation of space, Sato said, didn't consider the amount of storage they needed, so steadily, storage space took over rooms meant for other functions. Some of the concrete in the building didn't set because of a rush to finish it, he said, so the parking garage struggled for years with issues.
But in most ways, it was a forward-thinking masterpiece.
"It's remarkable having one of the three major performing arts centers in the middle of a cornfield," Sato said. "That's remarkable. And the remarkable foresight of Mr. and Mrs. Krannert, knowing that the University of Illinois in the '60s, we didn't have any stage, or any theater to speak of, and therefore the dean said, if you're going to do donations, we would love to have a performing arts center. They agreed, and then they gave that much money."
Krannert was immediately renowned across the country. Donal Henahan of The New York Times called it "one of the most ingeniously worked out art complexes anywhere" shortly after it opened, and Thomas Willis off the Chicago Tribune said it was "equaled by few such facilities in the country."
Fifty years later, Sato and Huang know it's easy for Krannert to fade into the background and for some residents to take it for granted. But they remember a time when there wasn't a suitable stage for professional artists like them and for symphonies and operas to stand on.
And after five decades, it still holds up.
"It should be the pride of University of Illinois on the Champaign-Urbana campus," Huang said. "I certainly feel very proud to live in this town, not only to occasionally contribute, but also to partake as an audience member, to go to great, great events."
Go figure

Texto completo: La hermana mayor del presidente Donald Trump, Maryanne Trump Barry, se retiró como jueza federal de apelaciones, poniendo fin a una investigación sobre si ella violó las reglas de conducta judicial al participar en planes de impuestos fraudulentos con sus hermanos.
Una investigación realizada por The New York Times descubrió el pasado octubre que los Trump se habían comprometido en dudosos planes fiscales durante la década de 1990, incluyendo casos de fraude, que aumentaron considerablemente la riqueza heredada por Trump y su hermanos.
La juez Barry no solo se habría beneficiado financieramente de la mayoría de esos esquemas de impuestos, según este diario, sino que ella también estaba en posición de influir en las acciones que tomaba su familia.
Según el periódico, Barry presentó sus documentos de retiro diez días después de que los funcionarios judiciales notificaron a los reclamantes que el asunto estaba “recibiendo toda la atención” de un consejo de conducta judicial. Como juez inactiva, Barry ya no enfrentará ahora la acusación de mala conducta judicial, ya que el estatuto solo se aplica a los jueces activos, según el Times.
La información aún no se ha anunciado públicamente, pero los reclamantes, al menos dos de ellos vinculados a la profesión legal, se dieron cuenta la semana pasada de que el caso se había retirado sin conclusiones sobre las denuncias.
Si bien antes se arriesgó a ser reprendida, castigada o incluso acusada por la investigación de la revisión del consejo judicial, ahora tiene derecho a un salario de jubilación que podría oscilar entre los 184.500 y 217.600 dólares anuales. Barry no respondió a las solicitudes de comentarios del Times.
El presidente Ronald Reagan seleccionó a Barry, una exfiscal, para servir en el Tribunal del Distrito Federal en Nueva Jersey en 1983. El presidente Bill Clinton la nominó para el Tribunal de Apelaciones del Tercer Circuito de los Estados Unidos en 1999.

Kathleen Parker: The Julian Assange problem

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — They say that guests are like fish; after three days they become a bit whiffy. By this measure, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange smelled like an overladen fishing vessel adrift in the searing sun.
Upon his arrest Thursday by British authorities, ending his nearly seven-year asylum in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, revelations emerged that he was less than an ideal guest. He reportedly was rude and aggressive toward his hosts and demonstrated little interest in hygiene. In his grossest display of disaffection, he apishly smeared his feces on the embassy walls, according to Ecuador's interior minister.
Assange's behavior makes one wonder about his mental health. Maybe he lost his mind while being confined for so long. On the other hand, he seemed quite cognizant as he left the embassy, offering peace signs and a thumbs-up to bystanders.
If Assange is, indeed, of right mind, then we can only conclude that he's a solid jerk. Certainly, his non-fans — including many in the U.S. media — long have viewed him as a sociopathic interloper operating under the protection of free speech. More on that anon.
No stranger to legal problems, Assange has been indicted by the U.S. on one count of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion. This sounds more like a stay-after-school offense than what one might expect given the potentially disastrous ramifications of Assange's publishing activities.
Then again, Al Capone was brought down on tax evasion.
While the government seems to want to avoid a battle over the First Amendment, focusing mostly on conspiracy, it can later charge Assange with something more. Meanwhile, media talk has turned to whether Assange is really a journalist and if free-speech protections ought to apply to someone who is (allegedly) a criminal first? Despite the recent surge in "citizen journalists," saying you're a journalist doesn't make you one. (Granted, some are better than the "real" ones.)
The difference between someone like Assange publishing whatever leaks land in his lap and, say, The Washington Post, which published the leaked documents known as the Pentagon Papers, is mostly a lot of worry and process. Most responsible reporters and editors routinely ask themselves questions such as: Should we publish this? Does the public interest override other concerns? Is it justifiable to expose someone's personal emails and under what circumstances?
One supposes that Assange never bothered himself with such pesky queries. But then, why should he? He is not, after all, a journalist, despite his claiming to be, because he isn't accountable to anyone. No filters, no standards.
In the case of the Pentagon Papers, former Rand Corp. military analyst Daniel Ellsberg stole thousands of pages of a top-secret report detailing the U.S. government's decadeslong campaign of deceit, mayhem and murder related to the war in Vietnam. Ellsberg first gave the documents to The New York Times, which published three articles about them before the White House obtained a court injunction. Ellsberg then provided copies to the Post, which, after due consideration, began publishing its own stories.
In deliberating whether to run them, Post publisher Katharine Graham deployed lawyers and editors to weigh the potential legal and commercial consequences against allowing the government to continue lying and sacrificing lives. Graham's bravery in standing up to the U.S. government and the courts — all while risking great personal and financial loss — was epic.
Assange's process, on the other hand, is largely to dump secrets in the town square and let the scavengers sort it out. No filter. No conscience.
It isn't hyperbolic to say we're at a hinge point regarding how we gather and disseminate information. Does anyone have the right to publish stolen/classified materials? Should the manner of obtaining information inform the right to publish? For now, at least, the Assange case provides little help, but precedent may offer clues.
On the surface, Ellsberg and Assange seem similar. Ellsberg stole — and newspapers published. Assange allegedly conspired to steal — and he published. The difference may be mostly political.
The Vietnam War was unpopular, and the government demonstrably lied to the American people for decades, unconscionably committing tens of thousands of young Americans to their early graves. Ellsberg's charges on theft, conspiracy and espionage were eventually dismissed.
Wikileaks leaked hundreds of thousands of secret documents that potentially endangered Americans and allies around the world and, possibly, helped get Donald Trump elected.
One was a historic act of bravery; the other seems more like feces-smearing by a fishy-smelling "cypherpunk." Then again, maybe that's just me.

Students at LeBron James' I Promise School generating 'extraordinary' results

Texto completo: The most meaningful result for LeBron James this season wasn’t on the court.
It came in the classrooms of his I Promise School, the public school he founded for at-risk students in conjunction with Akron Public Schools and the LeBron James Family Foundation.
The I Promise School opened in August for 240 third- and fourth-graders, and it has seen tangible results.
MAP (measures of academic progress) testing from the fall to the winter period at the school showed improvement, according to the Akron Public Schools Office of School Improvement:
90% of students – who started the school year at least one year behind grade level – met or exceeded their expected growth in math and reading.
Test scores increased at a rate higher than 99 out of 100 schools, per Northwest Evaluation (NWEA) school norms.
Third-graders went from the first percentile to the 18th percentile in math, moving from intensive tier of support to targeted levels of support.
Fourth-graders went from the second percentile to the 30th percentile in math, going from intensive tier of support to low universal tier of support.
All IPS students were below grade level in reading, and in the latest testing scores, 23% of students scored at or above the 25th percentile in reading, putting them at or near grade level.
What do the testing scores mean? IPS students are closing the achievement gap.
“We are going to be that groundbreaking school that will be a nationally recognized model for urban and public school excellence,” I Promise School principal and Akron native Brandi Davis said in August. “We are letting people know it is about true wrap-around support, true family integration and true compassion. ”
The school, which is a year-round operation providing daily breakfast, lunch and snacks for students, also provides education, career and emotional support for parents. The bulk of the school year is August through May, but all students participate in a seven-week summer-school program.
“It’s encouraging to see growth, but by no means are we out of the woods,” Keith Liechty, a coordinator in Akron public school system’s Office of School Improvement, told The New York Times. “The goal is for these students to be at grade level, and we’re not there yet. This just tells us we’re going in the right direction. ”
Liechty also said: “For the average student, your percentile doesn’t move that much unless something extraordinary is happening. ”
The school will add fifth grade next year and continue adding grades until it is grades 1-8 by 2022.

Glen Ellyn library first in Illinois to install short story

Texto completo: Glen Ellyn library first in Illinois to install short story kiosks Mim Eichmann approaches the kiosk in the lobby of the Glen Ellyn Public Library, presses a button and waits for the machine to spit out the surprise.
The anticipation is brief, but delightful: From the slit of the dispenser, Eichmann grabs a scroll of paper, pulling and pulling until she unfurls a strip as wide as a receipt and nearly as long as Mary Poppins’ practically perfect tape measure.
Then Eichmann, with a mysterious voice, begins to read aloud a story she’s never heard before.
"The moment he entered the bar, I knew that Mister J. wasn’t your usual guest," she says.
Eichmann recites the first passage of "The Hidden Letter," a story written by Patrick Ferrer and printed on her strip of paper, a souvenir of her trip to the library.
As intuitive as a vending machine or an ATM, the kiosk has become an object of fascination, a depository for a free literary keepsake that can be tucked away in a pocket or purse and shared with someone else. Since its arrival about two weeks ago, more than 780 stories or poems have been printed.
The dispensers are relatively new, introduced by French publishing house Short Ã‰dition in 2016. The kiosks have popped up in the unlikeliest of places.
The Washington Post featured a dispenser at a Maryland DMV. The New York Times noted "The Godfather" director Francis Ford Coppola is such a fan he placed one in his San Francisco cafe.
But the Glen Ellyn library is the first in Illinois to house a Short Ã‰dition dispenser. The library also has programmed the machine so every 10th story printed is one written by Eichmann.
"There it is in the flesh," Eichmann said of the kiosk she had only seen in pictures. "How cool!"
The Wheaton folk musician and novelist won a first-place award in a Public Library Association Short Fiction Contest with her story "Slomp," a tale about a 9-year-old boy and his act of courage. Her winning entry is now published through Short Ã‰dition’s dispensers.
Library Director Dawn Bussey first encountered the machine at a convention in San Diego. She brought back one of the stories she printed, a suspense tale called "A View of the Terrace," to keep on her desk.
"And I share it with almost everyone who comes in my office," Bussey said. "It’s a suspense story, and its probably three minutes long and you have no idea what the end is until you get to it. It’s amazing."
Typically, the dispensers have a choice of three buttons corresponding to the length of time it takes to read the stories: 1-minute, 3-minute or 5-minute.
But Bussey wanted the device to include a "Spanish" button for Spanish readers and Glen Ellyn students who take foreign language classes in schools. Readers also can press either a "Children" button or "General Public" (the adult selection) to access Short Ã‰dition’s vast catalog.
"Because it’s connecting to the Short Ã‰dition’s cloud, it’s really unlimited," Bussey said. "It’s a matter of how many stories they have in their database, and they continue to run contests and judge the stories that come in and then add content to their cloud database."
The element of surprise? You can’t choose the story, the genre, author or era.
"There’s sort of this little surprise feeling like, ‘Oh my goodness. This is a story that I’m getting out of this machine,’" said Library Foundation President Kelley Kalinich.
The library foundation paid for the portable device. The kiosk itself, including the back panel with the library logo and the shipping, costs just more than $10,000.
"The library will pay going forward a subscription to have access to the stories that are in the Short Ã‰dition database, much like we pay subscriptions for the other online databases that we have," Bussey said.
She hopes to take the machine — it only needs an outlet — on the road to schools, the train station, the YMCA and Reserve 22, the restaurant at the Village Links golf course. She also wants the library to host its own short story contest for children to add winning content to the dispenser’s selection of literature.
"One of the ideas of having it in other locations, of course, is that so many of us take those few minutes we might have in between meetings or while we’re waiting, and we scroll through our phone, especially social media," she said. "Well, if they can just print out quickly a short story or a poem and spend their couple minutes that way instead, then we’re encouraging reading."

Texto completo: It's common enough for a piece of music to get programmed by multiple orchestras. It's rarer to see one orchestra return to the same piece within a few short years.
And yet, the upcoming production of "Porgy and Bess" by the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra and the Morgan State University Choir marks just three years since their last rendition of the iconic American opera.
You could say it's back by popular demand. "Our 2016 production enjoyed enormous success, and we wanted to reprise this semi-staged version ... in anticipation of the 85th anniversary of the opera," said BSO Vice President and General Manager Tonya McBride Robles.
"Porgy and Bess" premiered in 1935 as a nearly four-hour-long grand opera. A collaboration between the novelist DuBose Heyward, lyricist Ira Gershwin and composer George Gershwin, it made waves with its all-black cast, a remarkable staging in 1930s America. (The Gershwin Estate continues to stipulate that "Porgy and Bess" be performed by an all-black cast, which companies in different parts of the world have not always honored.)
This year's production offers four days of performances - with the first on April 11 taking place at Strathmore - and features artists that can boast both expertise within their roles and strong Baltimore ties. Soprano Laquita Mitchell and tenor Larry Hylton will reprise their 2016 roles as Bess and Sportin' Life, respectively. Bass-baritone Robert Cantrell, playing Porgy, is not just an internationally active soloist, but also an instructor at Morgan State.
Of the returning artists, it is the Morgan State University Choir that may have the longest history with Baltimore performances of this work, according to the choir's director, Dr. Eric Conway. Under his predecessor, Nathan Carter, the choir was the go-to chorus for productions at the Baltimore Opera Company before the organization shuttered in 2009 due to bankruptcy. If not for the abrupt closure, "Porgy and Bess" would have seen another production in May of that year.
Even when the choir is not preparing for a major production, selections from "Porgy and Bess" appear in their regular programming. "Because this choir has sung this piece so much, there is a core group of the ensemble that knows the piece," said Dr. Conway. "It's beloved. Gershwin's music is the epitome of Americana."
Audiences, too, are likely to recognize music from "Porgy and Bess" even if they don't know its origin. "Summertime," the aria which appears within the first minutes of the opera, quickly became a jazz standard and has been recorded and reimagined tens of thousands of times. A 2012 report from The New York Times logged the number of covers at 25,000, making it one of (if not the) most recorded songs in music history.
The entire opera has not always been so roundly adored. It is, after all, a story of African-American life written by three white men, and it received criticism from the outset for its stereotypical characterizations; the storyline is heavy on violence, sex and drug use.
At the same time, it has acted as the rare canonical work that featured black artists performing at their full range. Hana S. Sharif, who is directing the staged component of the performance, credits a childhood viewing of "Porgy and Bess" at Houston's Outdoor Theatre with sparking her love of theater. "What I remember is seeing so many beautiful people on stage - people who looked like me," said Sharif. "My family was very passionate about the arts. We were encouraged to have a cultural life." But "Porgy and Bess" stood out because "I was hearing this opera where I understood what they were saying."
Over its lifetime, "Porgy and Bess" has been shortened and adapted for musical theater many times. A 1976 revival by the Houston Grand Opera sparked interest in honoring original staging intentions for the work. This week's performances by the BSO and MSUC are semi-staged, allowing audiences to enjoy both the music and the flow of the dramatic action.
"The entire apron of the stage is playing space," said Sharif. In addition to presenting the full orchestra and a 100-plus-person choir, "we'll have the ability for the vocalists and the storytelling to have active engagement with each other. It will feel like stepping into the world of the play instead of just the concert version."
It will also feel like stepping into the heart of Baltimore's larger arts community. The production draws on talent not just from the BSO and Morgan State, but from Baltimore Center Stage (where Sharif works as an artistic consultant) and the Baltimore School of the Arts.
"We have local opera heavyweights," said Sharif. "We have a handful of high school actors who are going to be in some of our other roles. It's quite wonderful for this production to embrace ... multiple generations of artists. It's a real testament to our city and to the great cultural life that we have here."

Democratic donor said to be in talks to buy National Enquirer [Corrected 04/13/2019]

Texto completo: Billionaire investor Ron Burkle is in talks to acquire the National Enquirer, The New York Times reported, potentially putting a high-profile Democratic Party donor in charge of a tabloid with ties to President Donald Trump.
The two sides are deep in discussions, though the talks aren't final, the Times said, citing unidentified people familiar with the negotiations. When reached by Bloomberg, a spokesman for Burkle denied the billionaire was buying the Enquirer.
Embattled publisher American Media LLC announced that the 93-year-old tabloid was for sale Wednesday, following accusations of extortion by billionaire Jeff Bezos this year and an earlier flap over killing embarrassing stories about Trump. A heavy debt load has put an additional burden on the company. And despite being a staple of supermarket checkout aisles for decades, the Enquirer has suffered a decline in circulation.
Leon Cooperman, an investor in American Media, said he believes an unspecified buyer is interested in making the deal. If Burkle does agree to the purchase, it would put the publication in the hands of a Democratic donor famous for his friendship with Bill Clinton.
Burkle, who controls Yucaipa Cos., made his fortune in the grocery-store industry.
A sale would help ease the pressure on American Media, CEO David Pecker and the company's hedge fund backers. Chatham Asset Management is the principal owner of the publisher, and two of the firm's executives serve on its board. Cooperman, a billionaire hedge fund manager, has said that his stake is small.
Chatham, run by Anthony Melchiorre, has grown increasingly disgusted with the reporting tactics at the Enquirer and pushed for the sale, according to The Washington Post.
American Media's board conducted a review of its tabloid business, including the Globe and National Examiner brands, and decided to explore strategic options. That will "likely result in their sale in the near future," the company said.
"We feel the future opportunities with the tabloids can be best exploited by a different ownership," Pecker, who also serves as chairman, said in a statement.
The Enquirer and its owner have come under intense scrutiny since Bezos made his allegations in a blog post in February. Bezos accused American Media of trying to blackmail him with photos of him with a woman who wasn't his wife. He also published emails sent to his lawyer, Marty Singer, by American Media executives.
The scrutiny extended to Chatham, which was questioned by New Jersey officials over the matter. The firm also has come under review by securities regulators.
The Bezos situation followed a separate controversy over the publisher's ties to Trump. The company admitted that it worked with the Trump campaign to withhold stories about the candidate's relationships with women.
Unloading the Enquirer would shift American Media's focus toward fitness and lifestyle brands. In recent years, it acquired Us Weekly and Men's Journal, as well as Bauer Media's celebrity and teen brands.
Bezos, head of Amazon.com Inc., also has knocked American Media for its ties to Saudi Arabia. Around the time of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's visit to the U.S. a year ago, American Media produced a nearly 100-page glossy magazine celebrating the country as "The New Kingdom."
Bezos questioned whether critical coverage of Saudi Arabia by his newspaper, The Washington Post, might have spurred the publisher to retaliate against him. American Media said in February that it "does not have, nor have we ever had, any editorial or financial ties to Saudi Arabia."
Bezos is set to meet federal prosecutors in Southern District of New York as soon as this week, CNN reported Wednesday. They're looking to get access to Bezos's electronic devices, letting them examine his private investigator's allegation that Saudi Arabia obtained private information from his phone.

Answering Questions of Socrates

Texto completo: Almost 2,500 years after his death, Socrates continues to fascinate. The Greek thinker is seen, by some, as the father of philosophy, a martyr for the cause of freedom of speech and even as a kind of secular saint.
But Socrates also repels. We know of him only from the work of others, and even Plato, who seemed to have held him in high regard, paints him as a pugnacious and ironic figure -- someone who insistently dispelled comforting notions and sought to overcome the tendency to mythologize.
This complicated man, and how he was received by later generations, is the subject of Tim Blake Nelson's new play, "Socrates," now in previews at the Public Theater as a part of the Onassis Festival. Running through April 28 at the Public Theater and La MaMa, the festival offers theater (including "Antigone" staged as a comedy), music (like a concert exploring the songs of refugees) and talks that focus on this year's theme: democracy.
After attending an early performance of "Socrates," Kwame Anthony Appiah, a philosophy professor and the author of The New York Times Magazine's column "The Ethicist," spoke with me about the philosopher, the sometimes strained relationship between philosophers and society, and how to deal with critics of democracy.
These are edited excerpts from the conversation. PETER LIBBEY
PETER LIBBEY Were you surprised to learn that there is a new play about Socrates? Our society doesn't tend to celebrate philosophers.
KWAME ANTHONY APPIAH I can't say I was super surprised, because people write plays about all kinds of things. The challenge in writing a play about Socrates is that Plato already wrote more than a dozen episodes of Socrates talking to people. In a way, you're in competition with Plato.
If somebody was going to write a play about a philosopher, Socrates would be an obvious one to pick, because he had this interesting life in which his philosophy and his philosophizing came into the public life of his society and led to his being condemned to death.
LIBBEY But wasn't Socrates an enemy of the arts? In Plato's "Republic," Socrates banishes poets, including dramatists, from the perfectly just city. Do you think that philosophy and theater are in some kind of tension with each other?
APPIAH I think they can be. It's brought out in the dialogue with the poet in Nelson's play. One way of thinking about this philosophical skepticism about the arts is as a conflict between logic and rhetoric. The skepticism about the arts is that they will lead us away from the truth. This is true, of course. Poetry isn't just about saying what is so. It's about saying it in a particular way.
I don't share this Platonic skepticism about the arts, but you can see how you get there. One worry is just that Socrates is preoccupied with truth, and fiction doesn't even aim at truth directly. The other worry is -- and this is why Socrates, in this new play, argues with the Athenian politician -- is a worry about fiction as being something that can be used to confuse us, to get us to go along with things or believe things that aren't so. The problem isn't that it's not aimed at truth, it's that it can be used to assist in the propagation of falsehoods.
LIBBEY We tend to credit ancient Athens with the invention of democracy and also with the birth of philosophy. But are these two things even linked? After all, Socrates was condemned to death by democratic Athens.
APPIAH I don't think it's terribly helpful to try to say when philosophy begins. But I think that this play brings out the fact that there can be a conflict between the philosopher and the polity. Socrates thinks that the search for truth is the search for how to live, because he thinks that if you know the truth, it will tell you how to live. For him, the search for truth is an ethical thing, it's about guiding the conduct of your life. But, as you can see in the play, he's interested in understanding for its own sake.
Now, if you're trying to get on with things -- and politics is a practical art -- having someone stop you and say, "I know that works in practice but I want to understand the theory of it," is not very helpful. So philosophers can be an irritant in any political system but especially in a democracy, because they're likely to seem, as Socrates does, to be looking down on the ordinary citizen who doesn't have what the philosopher considers a decent understanding.
LIBBEY Socrates was viewed as dangerous because he questioned his city's most fundamental norms and values. Can a democratic society accommodate those whose questioning goes so deep?
APPIAH You have to have the confidence that democracy is sturdy enough that even the critics of democracy cannot undermine it simply by raising questions. If you don't have it, then you'll want to silence people who, by their questioning, seem to undermine democratic institutions. My own tendency is to think that our democracy is robust enough that we don't have to worry about that, that we can allow people to make arguments against our fundamental assumptions and institutions and the institutions will survive.
Athens is just starting out on this. They're emerging from a period of nondemocracy, and you can see why you might be worried that someone who questions democracy could end up undermining respect for the institutions. That might lead back to tyranny or oligarchy. They don't have full confidence that the system can be given a rational defense. And I think its true that a lot of politics does depend a little bit on magic and mystery.
LIBBEY It is easy to admire Socrates from afar. But is it fair for us to assume that we're so different from and better than the Athenian citizens who put him to death?
APPIAH Some very thoughtful and decent people loved him, so he must have had something endearing about him. Plato, while certainly disagreeing with him about certain matters, admired him enormously. But Socrates must have been intensely annoying, in ways Nelson's play brings out.
Execution isn't our response to people who try to unsettle our cherished beliefs, but we don't have a huge amount of patience. If Athens had had our technology, I'm sure Socrates would have been widely blocked on social media.
LIBBEY On April 15, you'll be discussing the relationship between theater and democracy, with the playwright Suzan-Lori Parks and the Public's artistic director Oskar Eustis. What, for you, is the connection between the two?
APPIAH For us at the Public -- and I'm on the board of the Public, so I sort of have a strong sense of how we all think about this -- one of the main things we're doing is trying to be a theater for this democratic society.
The thought is that great drama, great art, helps in the discourse of a society to think about what we should be doing. The Socrates play does this, as do all of Suzan-Lori Parks's plays. They help us reflect on what's going on in our society, about the displacement of workers or the complexity of race relations and so on. Democracy is, among other things, about a kind of shared public deliberation.
LIBBEY How do you think Socrates would conduct himself at a panel discussion in Manhattan in 2019?
APPIAH You wouldn't be able to get him to make an opening statement, because he would say, "I don't know anything." But as soon as anybody started saying anything, he'd be asking you to make your arguments clearer -- he'd be challenging your assumptions. He'd want us see that the standard stories we tell ourselves aren't good enough.

Texto completo: Cuando este miércoles los medios de comunicación desplazados a Texas le preguntaron al presidente Donald Trump sobre quién ocuparía la secretaría del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional (DHS) -después de la dimisión de Kirstjen Nielsen – su respuesta fue contundente: “Francamente, solo hay una persona llevando la política migratoria (…) ¿Saben quién es? Yo” .
Antes de salir hacia Texas, el presidente había asegurado que Stephen Miller -su asesor y una de las personas que provocó la salida de Nielsen- un chico excelente, una hermosa persona, un hombre brillante”.
Sin embargo, también según las palabras de Trump, “podría pasar” que Kevin McAleenan , actual secretario interino de DHS, continúe en el cargo de forma permanente. En todo caso, aseguró que “en este momento él (por McAleenan) es el indicado”. McAleenan es también comisionado del servicio de Aduanas y Protección Fronteriza (CBP).
Este miércoles Donald Trump estuvo en San Antonio, Texas para recaudar fondos para su campaña. El discurso ante sus seguidores volvió a estar relacionado con las cuestiones fronterizas y la inmigración indocumentada. El presidente amenazó a los inmigrantes con enviar a más militares a la frontera porque, según él, las personas que cruzan “están muriendo en los campos”, incluso -añadió- “mujeres embarazadas”.
A pesar de que Trump dijo este martes que no está pensando en retomar la política de separación de familias , algunos medios (como NBC y The New York Times ) informaron de Trump ha estado eses solicitando que vuelva dicha medida bajo la denominada “ opción binaria “, pese a estar prohibido por órdenes judiciales. Esta petición podría ser una de las causas que desembocaran en la renuncia de Nielsen.
Otro de los hechos que apuntan al empeño del presidente por controlar la política migratoria es la retirada de la candidatura de Ronald Vitiello para dirigir al Servicio de Inmigración y Aduanas (ICE). Una fuente anónima dijo este martes a la agencia AP que Trump estaba haciendo ajustes en DHS para poder implementar más rápido las políticas migratorias .

Texto completo: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is warning of a potentially deadly drug-resistant fungus called Candida auris.
More than one in three patients diagnosed with an invasive Candida auris infection die, according to the CDC, which considers the fungus a "serious global health threat."
As of March 28, the state Department of Health has recorded 309 confirmed cases of Candida auris. The cases are "primarily from the New York City area," per the CDC.
More than 580 cases have been recorded nationally and an additional 1,056 people have been colonized by Candida auris, which means they tested positive for carrying the fungus but were not showing signs of infection, according to the CDC.
Here's what else you need to know about the new superbug.
What is Candida auris?
Candida auris, commonly called C. auris, is a type of fungal yeast that causes serious and potentially deadly infections in the body. In some cases, the yeast can get into the bloodstream, creating an invasive infection that can affect the heart, brain, eyes, bones and other areas of the body. Other common illnesses caused by C. auris include ear infections and wound infections.
Is Candida auris contagious?
C. auris can be spread from person-to-person contact as well as person-to-surface contact, per the CDC. However, most healthy people have a low chance of contracting the fungus. 
Why is the CDC so concerned about this germ?
First identified in 2009, C. auris can be difficult to diagnose using standard lab methods and has proven to be multidrug resistant. Additionally, because C. auris can remain in a patient or on surfaces for a long time, it has the potential to cause outbreaks in places like hospitals and long-term health care facilities.
In a case from May 2018 recently detailed by The New York Times, staff at Mount Sinai Brooklyn had to bring in special cleaning equipment and remove several ceiling and floor tiles to get rid of the stubborn germ.
Is C. auris treatable?
Candida auris can be treated but it does not respond to an array of commonly used antifungal drugs. The most effective way to treat the infection, according to the CDC, is with antifungal medications called echinocandins. The CDC advises that high doses of multiple antifungal drugs may be needed to eradicate the infection.
What are the symptoms?
Candida auris is typically found in patients who are already seriously ill or have a weakened immune system, which makes diagnosing the fungus even more difficult because symptoms may not be noticeable. The symptoms can also vary depending on the part of the body that is infected, according to the CDC. A C. auris bloodstream infection, for example, would have different symptoms than a cut that was infected by the fungus.
Who is most susceptible to contracting Candida auris?
People who already suffer from other medical problems are at the highest risk of infection, including:
long-term hospital or health care facility patients;
people who have tubes entering their body, such as a catheter or feeding tube;
people who have been previously treated with antifungal medications;
people who receive a lot of antibiotics;
people with weakened immune systems, particularly those with blood cancers and diabetes.
What should someone who may have a C. auris infection do?
The CDC recommends contacting a health care provider immediately. Family and friends of someone diagnosed with C. auris should employ go

Singer/Songwriter Joe Jackson plays the Southern May 4 COLUMBUS – Best-known for his hits "Is She Really Going Out with Him?," "Steppin' Out," and "You Can't Get What You Want (Till You Know What You Want)," singer/songwriter Joe Jackson celebrates a 40-year-long career with a tour that draws from five of his albums – Look Sharp (1979,) Night and Day (1982), Laughter and Lust (1991), Rain (2008), and Fool (2019) – and throws in a few other songs from other albums and new covers.
CAPA presents Joe Jackson at the Southern Theatre (21 E. Main St.) at 8 p.m. Saturday, May 4. Tickets are $45-$60 and can be purchased in-person at the CAPA Ticket Center (39 E. State St.), online at www.capa.com, or by phone at (614) 469-0939 or (800) 745-3000.
Born in England, Jackson joined a school violin class at age 11 to escape the humiliation of playing sports. Much to his own surprise, he found himself fascinated by music and eagerly studying music theory and history.
At age 16, Jackson played his first paying gig, as pianist in a pub next door to a glue factory just outside of Portsmouth. This was followed by other pub gigs and accompanying a bouzouki player in a Greek restaurant. At 18, he won a scholarship to study composition, piano, and percussion at London's Royal Academy of Music. By the time he left the Academy, he was the co-leader and songwriter of Arms and Legs, a proto-punk outfit which released two singles before burning out.
By 1978, Jackson was living in London and hawking an album-length demo, Look Sharp, found its way to American producer David Kershenbaum and he was signed to A&M Records. He re-recorded Look Sharp, began to play regular gigs, and released the album in 1979.
Look Sharp (containing the hit "Is She Really Going Out with Him") was followed within a year by the very similar I'm The Man (containing the hit "It's Different for Girls") and in 1980 by the darker, more reggae-influenced Beat Crazy.
In 2006, Jackson did a short trio tour with Graham Maby and Dave Houghton. He moved to Berlin, where he recorded Rain (2007). The trio toured for the next three years, and played more shows than any other Jackson lineup. A live album, Live Music, was released in 2011.
The second decade of the century saw the release of The Duke, a cover album of Duke Ellington compositions, but radically different from the originals. Fast Forward (2015) features four sets of four songs recorded in four different cities – New York, New Orleans, Berlin and Amsterdam – each with a different set of guest musicians.
Fool was released in January 2019 – exactly 40 years after the release of Look Sharp. A much shorter and more focused album than Fast Forward, with a much more 'live' feel, it was recorded at the end of a tour in a week and a half with the band Jackson has been working with for the last three years—Graham Maby (bass), Teddy Kumpel (guitar), and Doug Yowell (drums).

Trump's Tax Filings Likely to Leave Much in the Dark

Texto completo: Democrats are hoping that President Trump's federal tax returns will serve as a Rosetta stone to unlock the secrets of his murky finances.
Mr. Trump, on the other hand, has spent the past three years refusing to divulge the returns and even dismissing them as boring.
Now, the fight over whether members of Congress have the right to see the president's tax returns is intensifying. The House tax-writing committee has demanded them, and late Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said his department would not comply with the request by the date set by the committee. Earlier in the day, Mr. Trump repeated that he would not disclose his returns, falsely claiming that there is no law that gives Congress the authority to obtain them.
Mr. Trump is the first president in four decades to not publicly release his tax returns. The refusal -- coupled with his continued ownership of a far-flung network of closely held businesses -- has fanned suspicions that he has something to hide.
So, what might lawmakers find if they obtain Mr. Trump's tax filings?
For starters, his recent returns could illuminate the sources of his income and any tax-avoidance strategies he may have used, but it would not fully decode the family's personal and business finances.
Leaked pages of the president's old tax returns and other financial documents already have shed light on his finances. They indicate that Mr. Trump most likely avoided paying income taxes for a number of years and that in other periods The New York Times found he participated in fraudulent tax schemes to minimize his tax bill. His federal ethics filings show hundreds of millions of dollars in outstanding loans and a business network owned through a web of corporate entities.
The House Ways and Means Committee last week requested six years of Mr. Trump's personal tax returns, along with the returns filed by one of his trusts and seven subsidiaries he controls. They also asked for records of any audits.
The returns would partly reveal the sources of the president's income, and whether his businesses are profitable. They would show how much, if anything, Mr. Trump has been paying in taxes and might show whether he has been aggressive in reducing his tax bills. They will show whether Mr. Trump has personally donated to charity.
The returns requested by the committee, however, would not fully answer longstanding questions about the identities of Mr. Trump's business partners, the ultimate sources of his income or whether he is entangled with entities that have interests before his administration.
Even if Representative Richard E. Neal, Democrat of Massachusetts, who leads the committee, is successful, it does not mean the tax returns will become public. By law, they are supposed to remain solely in the hands of the committee; an unauthorized release would be a felony.
How much is Mr. Trump worth?
Ever since he declared his candidacy, Mr. Trump -- a self-proclaimed billionaire -- has faced questions about whether he is exaggerating his wealth.
Mr. Trump has never substantiated his assertion that he is a billionaire, though he has repeatedly made the claim to banks and other institutions. The disclosure of his tax returns probably would not settle the debate over Mr. Trump's net worth.
Tax returns do not provide lists of assets or liabilities, unless they generate income or deductions. Even then, the returns most likely would not provide values of those assets or liabilities.
Still, Mr. Trump's full tax returns -- his personal returns and the ones for all of the components of the Trump Organization -- would give a sense of the profitability of his businesses.
The returns would also reveal whether his companies have taken a hit since he entered the White House. (Mr. Trump has said he has lost vast amounts of money since he became president.)
Whom is Mr. Trump in business with?
Mr. Trump for years ran the Trump Organization, a privately held company that manages real estate, golf resorts, brand and licensing deals and other interests. Much about the businesses' finances remains unknown.
The federal ethics disclosures Mr. Trump has made about his holdings so far have been limited. For example, there is no requirement that he report the identities of investors who have put money into his businesses.
Mr. Trump acquired many properties, in particular golf courses, with cash, but where did that cash come from? Mr. Trump's son Eric once told a journalist that the Trump Organization's golf properties were paid for with Russian money. Eric Trump has denied making that statement.
While Mr. Trump's federal filings have reported some outstanding loans, investments and income from each business, they do not include debts where he has a partial interest or older loans that have been paid off. In theory, the existence of those older loans -- and the lenders behind them -- could be disclosed on his historical tax returns because certain types of interest on debts can be tax-deductible.
In reality, much of that information is unlikely to be contained in the limited number of returns requested by Congress. The panel is seeking the returns for only a small number of Mr. Trump's companies. But he controls hundreds of separate L.L.C.s that contain individual businesses, as varied as a particular building or the rights to license his name overseas. Each one of those businesses may file its own tax return, separate from the ones requested by the committee.
How exactly does Mr. Trump make his money?
Mr. Trump owns and operates businesses in the United States and overseas. He earns revenue from golf club memberships, from leasing space in his buildings and from licensing deals to put the "Trump" name on other developers' properties.
Mr. Trump's government disclosure reports show ranges of how much revenue his various subsidiaries collect, as provided by Mr. Trump, but they do not indicate the companies' overall profitability.
For example, his most recent government ethics report states that his Irish golf business reported revenue of $14 million in 2017. However, Irish regulators require that the golf subsidiary make its filings public. Those disclosures show the business actually lost about $2 million that year. Mr. Trump's returns could provide further detail about the profitability of his other businesses. More broadly, his tax returns can be compared with the ethics disclosures to check the accuracy of the filings.
Mr. Trump's personal tax returns will also itemize his stock- and bond-market transactions and people and institutions he is receiving income from, domestic and foreign. This would include income he has received from banks.
Is Mr. Trump cheating on his taxes?
If Democrats get Mr. Trump's taxes, they will be looking for any aggressive or illegal maneuvers -- such as the fraudulent tactics he has used in the past.
Sophisticated tax filers use their returns to paint the picture of their finances they want the government to see. It usually takes a lot of digging to find out what is going on behind the numbers.
For example, as The New York Times reported last year, Mr. Trump and his siblings set up a sham corporation in the early 1990s to disguise millions of dollars in gifts from their parents.
In that case, The Times had access to far more than just tax returns: It also relied on confidential business filings, public records and information from sources to document the fraud.
At the time the article was published, a lawyer for the president, Charles J. Harder, said the allegations of fraud and tax evasion were 100 percent false, and highly defamatory.
What will be more immediately apparent in Mr. Trump's tax returns is what sort of deductions he has used to reduce his tax bill, and how aggressively he has used them.
In 1995, for example, Mr. Trump paid no income tax, and records show he has not paid income tax in several other years.
The president has said he has avoided taxes because of the generous deductions given to real estate owners like himself. One deduction is depreciation, which permits real estate investors to deduct a portion of the cost of their buildings from their taxable income.
"I have a write-off. A lot of it is depreciation, which is a wonderful charge," he said during a presidential debate in 2016. "I love depreciation."

Texto completo: Michael Pietropola was 11 when his sister Janice was killed while vacationing in Virginia Beach.
Her death hit the family hard, Pietropola, now 57, told the Tribune-Review in a telephone interview Wednesday from his home in the Atlanta suburb of Johns Creek, Ga.
"It was beyond words to describe the pain, the sorrow and grief a family experiences, especially my parents," Pietropola said.
His father, Michael J. Pietropola Sr., died in 2002, eight years after his wife Lucille passed away. The parents went to their graves without knowing exactly what happened to their daughter, who was 19 when she was killed in June 1973.
Janice Pietropola and her friend Lynn Seethaler, also 19, were found "brutally murdered" in a motel cottage, according to Virginia Beach police.
On Monday, authorities issued an arrest warrant in the case and Ernest Broadnax, 80, of the St. Albans section of Queens, New York, was arrested on charges of second-degree murder and rape in connection with the killings.
"It's bittersweet," Pietropola's brother said of Broadnax's arrest.
The family is anticipating the judicial process and hopes to gain an explanation of what happened in Virginia Beach, where the young women were enjoying a vacation a year after graduating from Penn Hills High School.
"There really hasn't been any time that Janice hasn't been on all of our minds," Michael Pietropola said. "My sisters and I are appreciative of the Virginia Beach Cold Case unit."
Surviving members of Lynn Seethaler's family couldn't be reached for comment Wednesday. Her father Paul died in 2016, and her mother Phyllis died in 2011, according to obituaries.
In the decades since the killings, Michael Pietropola kept in touch with authorities, who had pursued leads over the years to no avail.
In recent years, there was renewed hope because of advances in forensic technology, Pietropola said.
The family was told Tuesday that Broadnax was arrested, he said.
"We all accepted many years ago we would go to our graves without knowing who did it," Pietropola said.
He declined to describe what happened after the family was informed of Janice's death.
Penn Hills police Chief Howard Burton was a patrolman with about four years on the force in 1973, he told the Tribune-Review.
"It really hit the community hard," Burton said.
Reading news about the arrest brought the case back into his mind, he said.
"At the time, it was unique something like that happened," Burton said.
Janice Pietropola and Seethaler were both 1972 graduates of Penn Hills High School. According to the school yearbook, both were studying "commercial" subjects.
Pietropola was a student secretary, on the booster club and was junior homeroom secretary. Seethaler was nicknamed "Skinny," was also in the booster club and a member of the Rhythmettes. She was on student council and was a student secretary, the yearbook said.
"She was a wonderful human being, very positive, looking forward to the next chapter of her life," Michael Pietropola said of his sister.
She was well-liked at school and was beautiful "both in spirit and physically," he said.
"We miss her dearly," he said.
After high school, both women took jobs as filing clerks and office assistants at the Dun and Bradstreet business credit firm located near a hospital in Pittsburgh's Shadyside neighborhood.
Harvey Jones, 71, of Duquesne, joined the firm as a business analyst while Seethaler was working there in 1972. Soon after, Janice Pietropola joined the office.
At the time, Jones was 25 and the only black man on the payroll, and he believes he may have been the first or among the first black workers hired there. Both women stood out for being among the first to socialize with him and form friendships that extended beyond the workplace, he said. They were outgoing -- Seethaler perhaps more so than "Jan," who kept more to herself, Jones said. They enjoyed small talk at the office and hung out together at parties.
He recalled how excited both women were the week before they left for Virginia Beach, that they had been raving about their plans to coworkers and saying the trip would be their first time there.
"We come back into work and word gets around that they wound up dead ... We just couldn't believe it," he said. "I was very, very sad and shocked. Everybody was in shock."
Broadnax was 35 at the time of the killings and has lived in New York City for nearly 30 years, according to a story in The New York Times.
In his time in the city he's had a lengthy arrest record -- mostly charges of assault and burglary and he's been incarcerated three times.

Neighbors told The Times he was "cordial, but distant" and had struggled with alcohol and drug addiction.
A retired detective who handled the initial investigation told The Times that Seethaler's throat was slashed and she was shot twice in the head. Pietropola was strangled, raped and shot three times, the detective, William Haden, told The Times.
It is the oldest cold case to be considered solved by the Virginia Beach Police Department's Cold Case Unit, police Chief James A. Cervera said in a news conference that was streamed on Facebook.

The department doesn't comment on pending cases, so Cervera was unable to detail what led to Broadnax's arrest, aside from to cite "advances in technology."
He started with the department in 1978, and said it was "personally satisfying" to be able to inform the detectives who worked the case in the 1970s and had been his superiors that it was solved.
Resolving cold cases also brings some closure to the families of the victims, Cervera said.
As far as any other details about what made the case, "we'll hold that for court," he said.
"We want this system to play out as it should," Cervera said.

Texto completo: Former FBI General Counsel James Baker divulged details about behind-the-scenes discussions among top leaders at the Justice Department and FBI, including chatter about appointing a special counsel before former FBI Director James Comey was fired by President Trump in May 2017.

Baker additionally testified FBI officials were entertaining the idea that Trump had fired Comey at the behest of Russia.

The new insight was revealed in the second Baker transcript released by Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., on Wednesday, following the release of the first transcript on Tuesday -- the latest in a series of such disclosures by the ranking member on the House Judiciary Committee. The transcript is from a closed-door interview that Baker gave on Oct. 18, 2018 in front of a joint session of the House Judiciary and Oversight committees. It was Baker’s second day in front of those committees — his first was on October 3, 2018.

Baker served as the FBI's top lawyer from 2014 to 2018, and he held that key role in the midst of two high-profile investigations — the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s email practices and mishandling of classified information as well as the investigation into any alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government in 2016.

Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., told Baker, “we now have evidence that would suggest that a special prosecutor was being discussed prior to the firing of Director Comey” and said information came from “[DOJ official] Bruce Ohr's notes where he was having conversations about a special prosecutor in March of 2017.”

Meadows asked Baker: “Did you have conversations prior to the firing of James Comey about a special prosecutor?”

Baker said. “to the best of my recollection, that topic came up, but I don't remember a specific conversation sitting here today about it, but I remember it coming up.” He said he couldn’t remember why it was mentioned as a possibility.

“What would be the conflict of you all continuing your investigation?” Meadows asked.

Baker said, “I think it was as the Russia investigation was moving forward and the interactions that the President was having with the Director, Director Comey, and it was sort of on the margins of some type of conversation.”

“I don't even remember who said it, quite honestly, but I'm telling you that the topic did come up before the firing,” Baker said.

Under questioning from Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, Baker revealed he was unable to recall specifically who he had conversations about the appointment of a special counsel with prior to Comey’s firing. “I think it was a passing conversation that could have been with the Director [Comey], with the Deputy Director [McCabe], and some of the other senior leaders," he said.

When pressed by Jordan on why Baker was discussing obstruction of justice and a special counsel prior to Comey’s firing, Baker’s attorney intervened, saying, “We’ll have to instruct the witness not to respond to a question that specific that pertains to special counsel ongoing investigative efforts.”

Trump fired Comey on May 9, 2017, and one of the memos leaked by Comey to a friend was described in the New York Times on May 16, 2017. Comey claims his memos are contemporaneous notes on his interactions with Trump, and the contents are hotly disputed. Comey later told Congress that he leaked the memo to prompt a special counsel investigation. The day after the New York Times report, Mueller was appointed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to investigate possible coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russian government in 2016.

Newly unsealed court records from 2017 reveal that Mueller considered Comey to be a “witness” in his investigation and considered the Comey memos to be “evidence.”

Rep. John Ratcliffe, R-Texas, asked Baker whether “there was a discussion … about whether or not President Trump had been ordered to fire Jim Comey by the Russian government.”

Baker replied, “I wouldn't say ordered. I guess I would say the words I sort of used earlier, acting at the behest of and somehow following directions, somehow executing their will. So literally an order or not, I don't know.”

Baker said they considered “the other extreme … that the President is completely innocent” too.

Mueller finished his investigation more two weeks ago and, according to a summary by Attorney General William Barr, did not find any criminal collusion between Trump or any Trump associates and the Russians.

In the days immediately following Comey’s firing, Baker said he spoke with former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, the executive assistant director of the FBI’s National Security Branch Carl Ghattas, “probably” former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, and former assistant director of the FBI's counterintelligence division Bill Priestap.

During a meeting in this timeframe, Baker said Page and McCabe told him they took Rosenstein’s suggestion that he “wear a wire” to record conversations with President Trump seriously.

“My recollection is that the reason for the taping was to obtain evidence with respect to the President's state of mind with respect to why he fired Director Comey,” Baker said.

Baker’s attorney did not let him answer whether this was “all about the obstruction of justice issue.”

Barr has stated that Mueller did not reach a conclusion on obstruction of justice one way or the other, and wrote in his summary that he and Rosenstein determined there was insufficient evidence to determine that such a crime has taken place.

Baker recalled McCabe said he was “stunned” and “surprised” that Rosenstein would offer to wear a wire, but that he didn’t think Rosenstein was joking. Baker said he took the suggestion seriously too, though he believed it was a “crazy idea.”

Rosenstein has denied that this was a serious suggestion.

Baker also referred to the "25th Amendment conversation” at the meeting on whether to invoke the amendment to remove Trump from office. He recalled Page and McCabe informed him that Rosenstein said “there were two members of the Cabinet who were willing to go down this road already." He did not know who the two Cabinet members were.

Baker testified that “everyone” was upset about the firing of Comey. He also said Rosenstein in particular, who authored a memo used by Trump to justify Comey’s firing, “believed that either he made a mistake or was fooled or drawn into it in some way that he didn't anticipate how it was going to turn out, and that he had extreme regrets about what had happened.”

Rosenstein would be the one to appoint Mueller just days later.

In the new transcripts, Baker also testified that if Nellie Ohr — a Fusion GPS contractor and the wife of DOJ official Bruce Ohr — was involved with creating evidence that was used in FISA applications to target Trump associates, “then it seems as though the institution of the Department of Justice should provide that to the FISA Court.”

The Baker transcripts also revealed that the former top FBI lawyer initially believed that Clinton should’ve been prosecuted, but that he was eventually “persuaded” otherwise.

The transcripts released Tuesday showed that Baker believed Clinton’s behavior was “alarming” and “appalling”, that he found the texts between former FBI special agent Peter Strzok and Page “quite alarming" and thought the Trump-Russia investigation was “highly unusual.”

Tuesday’s revelations also included Baker testifying that he’d received Trump-Russia related information from Perkins Coie lawyer Michael Sussman and a portion of Christopher Steele’s anti-Trump dossier from Mother Jones journalist and “long-time friend” David Corn — all of which Baker had then passed along to the FBI.

Baker also stated that he had reviewed at least a portion of the FISA application to surveil former Trump campaign associate Carter Page.

In recent weeks, Collins has released transcripts from the congressional interviews of Strzok, Page, Bruce Ohr, his wife Nellie Ohr, former Trump campaign associate George Papadopoulos, and former assistant director of the FBI's counterintelligence division Bill Priestap.

Leonard Pitts: The high cost of anti-vax baloney

Texto completo: Baloney is not free.
That's important to keep in mind in an era that finds America wading hip deep in a cascading tide of bovine effluvium. This nonsense is not harmless, not trivial, not abstract. And it always exacts a cost.
If some of us ever knew that, they have apparently forgotten. As a result, we have become a nation awash in public lies — conspiracy theories without basis, crackpot pronouncements from figures of authority, misleading, mendacious misstatements false as a four-dollar bill, delivered every minute of every day to our television, computer and smartphone screens.
Baloney is not free. Still, the price thus far has been borne by a relative few.
It has cost "only" the parent who paid in heartache when some wild-eyed conspiracist claimed that a beloved child killed in a mass shooting never existed and the shooting itself did not happen.
"Only" the African Americans who paid in deepening estrangement as the first black president was pressured into producing his birth certificate to answer baseless claims that he was not born in this country.
"Only" the pizza restaurant patrons who paid in terror as a man with a military-style assault rifle opened fire in hopes of rescuing child sex slaves he had been led to believe were imprisoned there.
But if only a few of us have paid for such baloney thus far, it looks as if the whole country might soon have to ante up.
It seems the United States is grappling with an outbreak of the measles, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reporting last week that there have been 465 cases so far this year. That means this is already the second worst year since the disease was reported eradicated in 2000. Measles has shown up in 19 states, including Michigan, Missouri, California, Texas, Georgia, New York and Florida. At the present rate, we will eclipse the previous record of 667 cases, set in 2014.
Officials say the resurgence of the highly contagious, sometimes-fatal disease is driven by the so-called "anti-vax" movement — parents who refuse to allow their children to be vaccinated because they believe the vaccine causes autism. Which it doesn't. The supposed link between vaccinations and autism stems from a 1998 study by a British doctor. The study was debunked, its findings retracted, the doctor defrocked.
But the baseless fear he raised lives on.
Now we — actually, our young children — stand to pay for the baloney he sold. The currency will be fevers, runny noses, coughs, watery eyes and rashes. It could be death.
Is that what it will take to finally bring some of us to their senses? There is, after all, something stark and undeniable about the link between cause and effect here, between anti-vaccination and outbreak.
Maybe that will show some of us how foolish it is to believe absurd untruths without the slightest evidence. Maybe it will remind them how dangerous it is to abandon the obligation of thinking critically. Maybe it will teach them how dumb it is to consider Facebook more authoritative than the CDC or The New York Times.
And maybe it will remind them that the truth doesn't care what you believe, doesn't care what you want or whom you voted for. The truth just is.
To reject that is to reject the connective tissue that makes nationhood possible, to reject any chance of greater good and common cause, to reject the very possibility of us. So this outbreak, troubling as it is, offers a timely chance for some of us to reconsider the choice to live in nonsense.
Because the cost of baloney is high. And it's getting higher all the time.

The lost world of 20 years ago

Texto completo: There's a theory of human psychology that holds that the time you enter maturity becomes fixed in your mind as a civilizational peak - with everything since a falling-off that conveniently matches your own stagger toward the grave. Thus it doesn't matter if you came of age in the Great Depression or some other nadir; because you were 18 then, it must have been a golden age.
Some of us are lucky, though: Our solipsism actually matches the wave function of history, and the moment we entered adulthood really was a peak. That's the case for my cohort, for Americans born around 1980. Whether you choose to call us "Xennials" or "Generation Catalano" (after the heartthrob on "My So-Called Life," our first teen show), the important thing is that we became legal adults at the end of the 1990s, and bliss it was in that time to be alive.
Not that we knew it then, of course, because no punk 18-year-old knows anything. But I've been thinking about how good we had it lately because we're 20 years out from 1999, and the cultural press is thick with reminders that it was a pop-culture annus mirabilis - from the premiere of "The Sopranos" that defined a golden age of television, to the yearlong cascade of brilliant movies (The Ringer recently wrote up a top 50 films list for '99; in 2019 it was a struggle to write up a top 10) from a Hollywood not yet captive to the superhero era.
Widen the aperture a little, so that the "Xennial" cultural era covers 1995 to 2005, and you get everything from the perfection of the sitcom (late "Seinfeld," season one of "Friends," the silver age of "The Simpsons," "Arrested Development") to the peak of HBO (when "The Wire" and "The Sopranos" and "Deadwood" and "Sex and the City" were all airing). Oh, and those were also the days when George R.R. Martin could publish three "Game of Thrones" novels in five years, inventing all the good parts of the TV show's plot in an end-of-millennium rush.
De gustibus non est disputandum, and if you prefer a zillion algorithmically-generated Netflix shows and endless Marvel sequels to "The Matrix" and "The Sopranos," then God bless you. But cold hard economic data also suggest that ours was a uniquely blessed coming-of-age: a time of low unemployment, surging productivity, strong working-class wage growth - and all without a huge overhang of public and private debt.
In March, a Time magazine writer, Charlotte Alter, attracted some conservative sneers on Twitter for explaining the youthful vogue for socialism by arguing that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's generation had a coming-of-age "defined by financial crisis, debt & climate change ...No wonder she and her peers are moving left."
The sneerers argued that the Ocasio-Cortezans exaggerate the burdens borne by twentysomethings, which is fair - this is still a rich country whose young people are relatively privileged.
But as a statement about generational experiences, Alter was basically right. If you were born around 1980, you grew up in a space happily between - between eras of existential threat (Cold War/War on Terror, or Cold War/climate change), between foreign policy debacles (Vietnam/Iraq), between epidemics (crack and AIDS/opioids and suicide), and between two different periods of economic stagnation (the '70s and early Aughts). If you were born later, you experienced slow growth followed by financial crisis followed by a recovery that's only lately returned us to the median-income and unemployment stats of ... 1999.
And even with under-4 percent unemployment, the differences between our economy and 1999's are notable: Our current expansion features lower workforce participation rates and weaker productivity growth, a fertility collapse instead of the modest 1990s baby boom ... plus it's all floated by deficits that seem necessary but aren't a sign of deep economic health.
But perhaps the best way to understand the lost world of 20 years ago is that it was the just-enough-internet era. There was just enough internet to boost economic productivity (the Facebook-Amazon era has not had a similar effect), just enough to encourage subcultural ferment, just enough to challenge cultural gatekeepers and give lonely teenagers succor. It was the early blogosphere instead of Twitter mobs, serendipity instead of ruthless curation, geek culture as an insurgency rather than a corporate establishment, online as an escape for eccentrics rather than an addictive dystopia for everyone.
Still, we should have seen the bad days coming. The filmmakers of 1999 did, as Reason magazine's Jesse Walker noted when The Ringer's top-100 list came out. "Election," "The Matrix," "Fight Club," "The Blair Witch Project," "Office Space," "The Talented Mr. Ripley," even (God help us) "The Phantom Menace" ... it's all there, everything that followed, class anxiety and workplace alienation, end-of-history discontents and internet-fueled hoaxes, disputed elections and virtual-reality prisons, plus a tottering republic waiting for its Palpatine.
We should have listened. Instead, we took that stupid red pill from "The Matrix," and now we'll never find our way back up.

Texto completo: Sen. Bernie Sanders told The New York Times on Tuesday that he will release 10 years worth of tax returns while also spilling that he too is a member of the millionaire class he so often derided in his speeches.
"I wrote a best-selling book," the Vermont independent and self-described democratic socialist said. "If you write a best-selling book, you can be a millionaire, too. "
Sanders currently leads in polls among declared candidates for the 2020 Democratic nomination. Last week, his campaign said he raised more than $18 million in the first quarter, by far the most of any candidate who has reported fundraising results so far.
"We wanted to release 10 years of tax returns. April 15, 2019, will be the 10th year, so I think you will see them," Sanders told the Times.
Sanders' pay day: Book deals, salary make Sanders a millionaire
Sanders has been a vocal critic of President Donald Trump's failure to release his tax returns. The senator's delay in releasing his own return has left him vulnerable to accusations of being a hypocrite.
"I hope that Donald Trump will do exactly the same. We are going to release 10 years of our tax returns, and we hope that on that day Donald Trump will do the same," Sanders told the Times.
The left-wing lawmaker did not feel his tax returns would be as of much interest to the voters, however.
"Not being a billionaire, not having investments in Saudi Arabia, wherever he has investments, all over the world, mine will be a little bit more boring," he said in the interview with the Times.
Sanders was pressed on when he would release his tax returns during a February appearance on a CNN town hall, as he was by Trevor Noah during a recent appearance on Comedy Central's The Daily Show.
He never released his returns during his 2016 Democratic primary and Hillary Clinton criticized his lack of transparency. Sanders said there was no need to release the returns because he failed to win the nomination.
A financial disclosure statement he put out in 2017 revealed Sanders earned a $795,000 advance for the book about his 2016 campaign, "Our Revolution: A Future to Believe In. "
Sander's self-imposed deadline on Monday for the release of his tax returns coincides with a scheduled appearance at a town hall hosted by Fox News, a network the senator has called mostly "right-wing propaganda. "
Sanders explained his reason for agreeing to the Fox appearance to Huffpost: "You’ve got to go into areas where people are. Working people need to know the truth, and that is that Donald Trump betrayed them, lied to them. And I intend to do that. "
The Democratic National Committee last month barred Fox from hosting any of the party's primary debates.
Recent reporting in the New Yorker on the inappropriate relationship between President Trump, his administration and Fox News has led me to conclude that the network is not in a position to host a fair and neutral debate for our candidates," said a statement from DNC Chairman Tom Perez.

DEFEATING POVERTY THE CANADIANS ARE DOING IT BECAUSE THEY DECIDED TO, AND THEN THEY FIGURED IT OUT

Texto completo: Jesus said the poor will always be among us, but there are a lot of people in Canada testing that proposition.
According to recently released data, between 2015 and 2017, Canada reduced its official poverty rate by at least 20 percent. Roughly 825,000 Canadians were lifted out of poverty, producing the country's lowest poverty rate in history. How?
The economy has been decent but not robust enough to explain these striking outcomes. Instead, one major factor is that Canadians have organized communities differently.
Before I describe their methodology, let's consider American poor areas. Everything is fragmented. There is usually a bevy of public and private programs doing their own thing. In a town, there may be four food pantries, each of which does its own thing.
A common model is one donor funding one program. Different programs compete for funds. They justify their existence using randomized, controlled experiments, in which researchers try to pinpoint one input that led to one positive output. In other words, the Americans who talk about community don't have a community of their own. Every day, they give away the power they could have if they did mutually reinforcing work together to change whole systems.
In Canada, it's not like that. About 15 years ago, a disparate group of Canadians realized that a problem as complex as poverty can be addressed only through a multisector comprehensive approach. They realized that poverty was not going to be reduced by some cool, new program nobody thought of before. It was going to be addressed through better, mutually supporting systems able to enact change on a population level.
So they began building citywide and communitywide structures. They started 15 years ago with six cities but now have 72 regional networks covering 344 towns.
They begin by gathering, say, 100 people from a single community. A quarter have lived with poverty; the rest are from business, nonprofits and government.They spend a year learning about poverty in their area, talking with the community. They don't want better poor; they want fewer poor. Their focus is not on how to give poor people food so they don't starve. It is, how do we move people out of poverty? Second, they up their ambitions. How do we eradicate poverty? Third, they broaden their vision. What does a vibrant community look like in which everybody's basic needs are met?
After a year, they come up with a town plan. Each town's poverty is different. Each town's assets are different. So each town's plan is different.
The town plans feature a lot of collaborative activity. A food pantry might turn itself into a job training center by allowing the people being fed to do the work. The pantry might connect with local businesses that change their hiring practices so that high school degrees are not required. Businesses might pledge to raise their minimum wage. The plans involve a lot of policy changes on the town and provincial levels - improved day care, redesigned transit systems, better work-force development systems.
By the time Canada's national government swung into action, the whole country had a base of knowledge and experience. The people in the field had a wealth of connections and a sense of what needed to be done. The two biggest changes were efforts in city after city to raise the minimum wage and the expansion of a national child benefit, which can net a family up to nearly $6,500 a year per child. Canada essentially has guaranteed income for young and old.
The process of learning and planning and adapting never ends. The Tamarack Institute serves as a learning community hub for all the different regional networks. Paul Born, the head of the institute, emphasizes that the crucial thing these communitywide structures do is change attitudes. In the beginning, people are sluggish, fearful, isolated, looking out only for themselves. But when people start working together across sectors around a common agenda, communities realize they can do more for the poor. The poor realize they can do more for themselves. New power has been created, a new sense of agency.
Mr. Born says social change requires communitywide structures. But in many American communities, we're scattershot. That's the problem with our distrust and polarization. We often don't build structures across difference. Transformational change rarely gets done.

Texto completo: ALBANY – Actress Allison Mack pleaded guilty Monday to federal charges connected to her longtime involvement in NXIVM, a cult-like self-help group in the Albany area whose leader is accused of treating women as sex slaves.
Mack, 36, best known for her role as Chloe Sullivan in the CW's "Smallville, signed a plea agreement late Monday morning in Brooklyn federal court, admitting to two racketeering felonies that could put her behind bars for years when she is sentenced in September.
Mack had been facing seven federal felonies in connection with her role as a high-ranking leader in DOS, a group secretly led by NXIVM co-founder and spiritual leader Keith Raniere that purported to be a women's empowerment sorority.
Federal prosecutors said the DOS group was essentially a sex ring to benefit Raniere, with women known as "slaves" who reported to "masters" who ultimately reported directly to him and were wholly devoted to his teachings.
Mack's plea came the same day jury selection began for the NXIVM trial. Now, three defendants remain, including Raniere and Segram's liquor heiress Clare Bronfman, the group's major funder.
"I believed Keith Raniere's intentions were to help people and I was wrong," Mack said in court, according to The Associated Press.
She added: "I know I can and will be a better person."
Mack accused of recruiting women Prosecutors say Mack was a co-conspirator, recruiting women to join the master-slave group. She reported directly to Raniere.
The women, some of whom were branded with a logo containing Raniere's initials, were presented to him for sex and forced to follow restrictive diets to adhere to his preferred body type, according to prosecutors.
They were also forced to give up collateral — nude photos, family secrets — in order to join the group. DOS leaders threatened to release the information if the women publicly revealed the group's existence, prosecutors claim.
Mack's plea deal Monday had her admit to using the threat of extortion to force lower-level DOS members to give up their personal collateral and forcing a woman (identified only as a Jane Doe) to perform manual labor under threat.
Under the agreement, five charges were dismissed, including three related to sex trafficking.
She faces up to 40 years in prison when she is sentenced Sept. 11, though sentencing guidelines will likely call for less than the maximum.
Trial set to begin for remaining defendants In recent weeks, federal prosecutors have acknowledged in court that Mack and some of her co-defendants had been engaged in plea negotiations.
Nancy Salzman, NXIVM co-founder and president, pleaded guilty last month to one count of racketeering conspiracy, confessing to stealing email addresses and passwords of NXIVM critics and altering a tape used in a lawsuit against one.
Her daughter, Lauren Salzman, also pleaded guilty to racketeering and racketeering conspiracy last month.
With Mack's expected plea, three defendants remain: Raniere, Bronfman and Kathy Russell, a NXIVM bookkeeper.
Raniere, 58, attended high school in Suffern, Rockland County, before moving to the Albany area to attend the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.
He gained a devoted following through NXIVM, which taught expensive self-help classes that were based on Raniere's teachings.
But Raniere's critics — including former girlfriend Toni Natalie of the Rochester area, who has spoken out publicly against him for years — have long accused NXIVM of operating like a cult, aggressively suing former members who went on to criticize the group.
Federal prosecutors got involved after Sarah Edmondson, an actress from Vancouver, went public in an account in The New York Times with news that women in DOS, the secret sorority, had been branded on their pubic region with Raniere's initials.
The account also detailed "Dynasty" star Catherine Oxenberg's fight to rescue her daughter from the group.

Citing Trade Laws, Trump Cancels Deal Between M.L.B. and Cuban Federation

Texto completo: President Trump, reversing an agreement negotiated by the Obama administration, abruptly ended a deal between Major League Baseball and the Cuban Baseball Federation that had eased the path for players to compete in the United States without defecting from their country.
The Trump administration said that the deal constituted a violation of trade laws because the Cuban federation was part of the government in Havana -- a departure from the previous administration's stance.
In a letter to M.L.B.'s outside counsel, which was obtained by The New York Times, Nikole Thomas, the acting assistant director for licensing at the Office of Foreign Assets Control, outlined the U.S. government's opposition to the deal, which stipulated that the Cuban federation would receive 25 percent of a player's signing bonus for a minor league player and between 15 and 25 percent for a major league player.
The letter said that the O.F.A.C. had "determined that M.L.B.'s payments to the Cuban Baseball Federation are not authorized" because "a payment to the Cuban Baseball Federation is a payment to the Cuban government."
News of the administration's rejection of M.L.B.'s plan was first reported by The Wall Street Journal and ESPN.
Cuban sports entities, including its baseball federation and Olympic committee, have argued they are independent of the central government, but the Trump administration rejected that assessment.
"The U.S. does not support actions that would institutionalize a system by which a Cuban government entity garnishes the wages of hard-working athletes who simply seek to live and compete in a free society," said Garrett Marquis, a spokesman for the National Security Council. "The administration looks forward to working with M.L.B. to identify ways for Cuban players to have the individual freedom to benefit from their talents, and not as property of the Cuban state."
In a statement, M.L.B. said: "We stand by the goal of the agreement, which is to end the human trafficking of baseball players from Cuba."
One M.L.B. official, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter, said the league had requested a face-to-face meeting with U.S. government agencies but were not granted one. M.L.B. was prepared to base its argument on the fact that the Obama administration had given it a license in 2016 to do business with the Cuban baseball federation, and that a Trump-era national security presidential memorandum published on June 16, 2017 promised the agreement would be grandfathered in. The memorandum stated that any new regulations "will not affect existing contracts and licenses."
Several U.S. business entities, including travel and telecommunications companies, do business in Cuba. But M.L.B. officials worried that, as a high-profile organization, its deal would be challenged by hard-liners in the government.
John Bolton, the national security adviser, seemed to foreshadow the move on Sunday when he tweeted: "Cuba wants to use baseball players as economic pawns -- selling their rights to Major League Baseball. America's national pastime should not enable the Cuban regime's support for Maduro in Venezuela."
Cuba has produced some of the best players currently in the major leagues, including Aroldis Chapman of the Yankees, Yoenis Cespedes of the Mets and Jose Abreu of the Chicago White Sox. They and most other Cuban players in M.L.B. left their country illegally, in some cases smuggled out by disreputable agents and human traffickers on speedboats and rafts over dangerous waters.
"It's bad in the sense that they can't come anymore in the formal, legal way that was planned," Chapman said on Monday.
For some players, the dangers continued after they arrived because they were at the mercy of the smugglers.
"To this date, I am still harassed," Abreu, who has played for the Chicago White Sox since 2014, said in a statement issued at the time the deal was announced in December.
M.L.B. and its players union sought to eliminate that dangerous process by creating a posting system similar to the one used with players from Japan and South Korea. Under the plan, a major league team seeking to sign a Cuban player would pay a posting fee to the Cuban federation, which would in turn allow the player to leave the country and return home at will. Just days ago, the Cuban federation released the names of 34 players it said were eligible to sign with M.L.B.
"The objective of the agreement, which is the product of years of negotiations with the F.C.B., is to end the dangerous trafficking of Cuban baseball players who desire to play professional baseball in the United States," M.L.B.'s lawyers said in their petition to the Treasury Department in January.
M.L.B. and the Cuban baseball federation commenced talks after the United States and Cuba began a thaw in relations under the Obama administration in 2014. Soon after that, baseball's commissioner's office secured a license from the Treasury Department to legally begin negotiations with the Cubans.
After announcing its agreement in December, M.L.B. quietly sought to convince administration officials -- who immediately criticized the plan publicly -- that it fit within the guidelines for an exemption to the trade laws. At the same time, M.L.B. officials were also resigned to the political opposition to the deal and the possibility of returning to the old method of signing Cuban players.

Texto completo: When a whistleblower revealed the Trump administration's decision to overturn 25 security clearance denials, it was the latest in a long and storied history of insiders exposing significant abuses of public trust. Whistles were blown on U.S. involvement in Vietnam, the Watergate coverup, Enron's financial fraud, the National Security Agency's mass surveillance of domestic electronic communications and, during the Trump administration, the corruption of former Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt , Cambridge Analytica's theft of Facebook users' data to develop targeted political ads, and harm to children posed by the "zero tolerance" immigration policy. Despite the essential role whistleblowers play in illuminating the truth and protecting the public interest, several myths persist about them, some pernicious.
Myth No. 1 Whistleblowers are employees who report problems externally. Often a distinction is made between employees who raise concerns inside their organizations and those who turn to outside entities, such as Congress, enforcement agencies or the press, to disclose concerns about wrongdoing. People in the corporate ethics and compliance sector try to steer workers away from whistleblowing by creating "speak up" cultures within agencies or companies. Many employees who report problems internally don't think of themselves as whistleblowers, noting that they are just doing their jobs or helping the company . And the notion that whistleblowers are employees who report externally is implicitly reinforced at times by the press, probably because the whistleblower sources with whom reporters work have, obviously, decided to take their concerns outside the walls of their employers.
But under most whistleblower protection laws, employees have rights to report wrongdoing both internally and externally, free from reprisal. So failing to consider workers who disclose serious misconduct to be whistleblowers because they haven't reported the problems externally could make them liable to retaliation by their employers.
The overwhelming majority of employees who see problems want to blow the whistle internally first. Understanding this can - and should - encourage employers to respond appropriately when workers report problems, protecting them from reprisal and investigating and addressing their disclosures thoroughly. Similarly, employees who understand that they are in fact whistleblowers when they raise concerns inside the workplace will be better prepared to navigate their rights, risks and options.
Myth No. 2 Whistleblowers are either disloyal or heroes. A Forbes article, "Whistleblower: Warrior, Saboteur Or Snitch?," is illustrated with a picture of a street sign with divergent directions for "loyalty" and "whistleblowing." This is just one of many articles noting the widely held public perception of whistleblowers as disloyal, with terms such as "disgruntled," "self-serving," "narcissistic" or even "traitor." These negative perceptions direct focus onto the whistleblower's motive while calling into doubt the legitimacy and importance of the reports of misconduct.
The image of whistleblowers as disloyal is often held in tension with a belief that they are heroes, as the articles also note. But this perception is not accurate, either.
In reality, most whistleblowers are motivated by a deep sense of loyalty to their employers and are exercising both a high degree of professional ethics and a belief that their employers will address the problem. While many employees who witness wrongdoing in the workplace stay silent, fearing reprisal or futility, those who do raise concerns - and again, most do so internally first - demonstrate faith that their employers are committed to compliance and that they can make a difference. Whistleblowers who report externally typically do so because the problem is significant and their employers have failed to address it or engaged in reprisal (or both). At this point, government whistleblowers may decide that their loyalty is to the Constitution they swore to uphold; others may feel impelled by loyalty to professional ethics codes or to their own moral compass.
Myth No. 3 'Leaker' is another term for 'whistleblower.' "Leaking" has been used by both the Obama and Trump administrations to describe, and typically disparage, legitimate national security whistleblowers. A 2013 New York Times article switches between "leaking" and "whistleblowing" indiscriminately while parsing whether Edward Snowden and Chelsea Manning are heroes or traitors.
Leaking, however, is not the same as whistleblowing.
Whistleblowing is defined under the Whistleblower Protection Act , the primary law that covers nonintelligence federal workers, as disclosure of information that an employee "reasonably believes" demonstrates "a violation of a law, rule or regulation; gross mismanagement; a gross waste of funds; an abuse of authority; or a substantial and specific threat to public health and safety." This describes misconduct that is of serious concern to the public interest.
Leaks typically don't reveal this level of misconduct, instead sharing information that may be salacious, embarrassing or otherwise interesting, even if sometimes quite important.
Even though protections for intelligence community whistleblowers are weak and dictate how those employees must report concerns, Snowden's revelations about the NSA's unconstitutional mass collection of telephone metadata, and Reality Winner's disclosures about Russian efforts to hack state elections as the Trump campaign was denying Russian involvement, clearly meet this standard of significance.
While reporters may use the term "leak" to describe information received from anonymous insiders, the failure to distinguish between leaking and anonymous whistleblowing risks undermining the legitimacy and importance of disclosures that clearly advance the public's interest in accountability and a functional democracy.
Myth No. 4 Remaining anonymous is the best strategy for whistleblowing. Journalists and public-interest organizations have taken to urging government and private-sector workers to disclose information to them, promising anonymity. News outlets actively promote their mechanisms for secure communication; some nongovernmental organizations have launched anonymous hotlines for reporting corruption or assaults on science. These messages perpetuate a myth that anonymous disclosures are both possible and in the best interests of potential whistleblowers.
Efforts like these are needed, but reporting serious wrongdoing is risky business, and employees who believe this myth may be inadvertently hurt in the course of disclosing what they have witnessed.
Because most workers raise concerns internally first, and because their information is often tied to their responsibilities and expertise, their fingerprints are metaphorically on their disclosures. Under the law, an employee who suffers reprisal for whistleblowing needs to show that the employer had knowledge that they raised an issue. A sophisticated employer may be able to suss out the identity of a whistleblower and retaliate, but an employee's attempts to remain anonymous may make it more difficult to prove the employer had that knowledge.
Anonymity can weaken a whistleblower's ability to gain support from public-interest organizations, professional associations, sympathetic members of Congress, enforcement agents and even other co-workers who might want to come forward. And finally, the reporter's privilege for protecting communications is not as strong as the attorney-client privilege, and even employees who reach out to public-interest organizations staffed with lawyers fielding hotlines may not have the benefit of that privilege because they are not seeking or receiving legal advice - they are disclosing information.
Myth No. 5 Julian Assange is a whistleblower. Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, is widely described as a whistleblower. A 2010 interview in the Guardian titled "Julian Assange: the whistleblower" promotes this myth directly, and as recently as last year, ABC News called him "the world's most famous whistleblower." This myth muddies already difficult waters for whistleblowers.
WikiLeaks is a self-described "media organization" that "specializes in the analysis and publication of large datasets of censored or otherwise restricted official materials involving war, spying and corruption." Before being implicated in the acquisition and release of the Hillary Clinton campaign's emails in 2016, Assange and WikiLeaks published diplomatic cables and video footage of an Iraqi airstrike that killed two Reuters photographers, provided by whistleblower Chelsea Manning.
But unlike Manning, Assange did not discover or disclose wrongdoing as an insider. Rather, he received information from a whistleblower and published it. His methods differ from those of most journalists, but the publication of documents that reveal wrongdoing does not make Assange a whistleblower, any more than are the New York Times and Washington Post journalists who published the Pentagon Papers - or, for that matter, than I am when I advocate on behalf of my whistleblower clients, which sometimes involves helping expose the misconduct they have discovered and disclosed. They're the true whistleblowers.

Texto completo: Pete Buttigieg has some kind of magic right now. His campaign bio, "Shortest Way Home," was the 25th-best-selling book on Amazon when I checked Monday. That put him just a few dozen places behind Michelle Obama, and thousands or tens of thousands of places ahead of Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders and the other candidates who have campaign books out now.
In a recent Iowa poll he surged to third place. His campaign just announced that it's raised an impressive $7 million since January. And I can't tell you how many Democrats in places as diverse as Nebraska, Indiana, New York and Washington have come up to me over the past few weeks, raving about the guy. I met a superfan in Frederick, Md., who says that every few hours she calls the campaign to give another $10.
This is the biggest star-is-born moment since Lady Gaga started singing "Shallow."
Why are people so in love with the mayor of South Bend, Ind., who almost nobody had heard of until he did a CNN town hall March 10?
It's important to remember that when Democrats vote next year, they'll not only be choosing a policy alternative to Donald Trump, they'll also be making a statement about what kind of country they want America to be.
The Trump era has been all about dissolving moral norms and waging vicious attacks. This has been an era of culture war, class warfare and identity politics. It's been an era in which call-out culture, reality TV melodrama and tribal grandstanding have overshadowed policymaking and the challenges of actually governing.
The Buttigieg surge suggests that there are a lot of Democrats who want to say goodbye to all that. They don't want to fight fire and divisiveness with more fire and divisiveness. They don't want to fight white identity politics with another kind of identity politics.
They are sick of the moral melodrama altogether. They just want a person who is more about governing than virtue-signaling, more about friendliness and basic decency than media circus and rhetorical war.
Buttigieg's secret is that he transcends many of the tensions that run through our society in a way that makes people on all sides feel comfortable.
First, he is young and represents the rising generation, but he is also an older person's idea of what a young person should be. He'd be the first millennial president, but Buttigieg doesn't fit any of the stereotypes that have been affixed to America's young people.
Young people are supposed to be woke social justice warriors who are disgusted by their elders. Buttigieg is the model young man who made his way impressing his elders - Harvard, Rhodes scholar, McKinsey, the Navy.
Young hipsters are supposed to flock to coastal places like Brooklyn, N.Y., and Portland, Ore., after college, Buttigieg returned to Indiana.
Young people are supposed to be anti-institutional, but Buttigieg is very institutional - his life has been defined by his service to organizations, not his rebellion against them.
Second, he is gay and personifies the progress made by the LGBTQ movement, but he doesn't do so in a way that feels threatening or transgressive to social conservatives. He has conservative family values; it's just that his spouse is a husband, not a wife. He speaks comfortably about his faith and says that when he goes to church he prefers a conservative liturgy to anything experimental.
Third, he is a localist and a Washington outsider, but he carries no populist resentment and can easily speak the language of the coastal elite.
Buttigieg has spent his political career in Indiana, where pols are expected to go to county fairs and eat the catfish filet and cheesecake on a stick. He wasn't alive when the Studebaker plant shut down in South Bend, but he has the trauma of Midwestern deindustrialization in his bones. He lives in a house near his mother where the mortgage comes to about $450 a month. On the other hand, he was friends with Mark Zuckerberg at Harvard, earned a first at Oxford and thrived as a corporate consultant.
Finally, he's a progressive on policy issues, but he doesn't sound like an angry revolutionary. Buttigieg's policy positions are not all that different from the more identifiable leftist candidates. But he eschews grand ideological conflict.
"The whole point of politics is everyday life," he said in his CNN town hall. His book is mostly about how as mayor he faced problems like snow removal and fixing potholes. His big achievements were renaming city streets, repairing the sewer system and tearing down derelict buildings. He says he'll do whatever works.
I've only met Buttigieg once, when we were seated at the same table at a dinner in Detroit a few months ago. He was smart, modest and self-effacing, and I can't square that impression with his assumption that at 37 he's qualified to be president of the United States.
But maybe that's Buttigieg - he squares a lot of circles. He deftly detaches progressive policy positions from the culture war. He offers change without Sturm und Drang.

The opium of California

Texto completo: The current frenzy of new IPOs — Uber, Lyft, Slack, Postmates, Pinterest and Airbnb — seems destined to reinforce progressive notions that California represents the future not just for the state, but the nation. It will certainly reinforce California’s fiscal dependency on tech-dominated elites — half of the state’s income taxes come from people making over $500,000 a year — and provide a huge potential multi-billion dollar windfall for the state treasury.
To be sure, the insiders — founders, with nearly half the voting shares in companies such as Lyft, a small “tech mafia” of venture firms, foreign investors such as Japan’s Softbank and Wall Street investors — will have reason to celebrate. But the lavish paydays will do little to relieve, and may even serve to worsen, the state’s gaping inequality and nation-leading poverty rates .
Most damaging of all, the IPO high will encourage supporters of the state’s policy agenda. If new companies crop up, and the handful of politically savvy investors thrive, California’s illuminati can fend off criticism of policies that undermine the middle and working class in everything from energy to housing.
The changing nature of California’s tech economy
“Science,” observed Daniel Coit Gilman, the second president of the University of California, ”is the mother of California.” With few navigable rivers, a persistent shortage of water, far from the then-dominant Eastern seaboard, California’s growth depended on engineering prowess. Not tied to the traditional industries, the state seized on emerging fields such as aviation, space and eventually semiconductors, laying the basis for an expanding middle class
In contrast, little of today’s tech growth produces tangible products, and those that remain, such as Space X , the semiconductor industry and Apple, are placing their production either abroad or in less expensive and less highly regulated states. This allows them to escape California’s high electrical rates, poor roads, collapsing bridges and lagging public education system. The digital future may remain in California but the action in chip-manufacturing, biomedical products or space exploration seems headed elsewhere.
The firms in the new “information peddling economy,” notes the University of Washington at Tacoma’s Ali Modarres, have a very different relationship with their employees than “first wave” companies such as Hewlett Packard and Intel. In the first wave a broad range of employees enjoyed rewards from corporate success and stock gains; drivers for Uber, as one analyst suggests, will get nothing but the privilege of seeing vast flows of cash used to replace them with automated vehicles.
The neo-feudal city
The new wave of IPOs will expand the ranks of what The New York Times aptly describes as “the elite caste who can afford to live comfortably in the Bay Area.” Tech senior managers will enjoy huge capital gains, greatly reducing their federal tax liability. In contrast, less well-placed working schmucks will pay upward of half their income in taxes while those who clean their offices will face potential new fees on everything from tires and soda to water.
Even in the Bay Area, home to four of California’s wealthiest ZIP codes, middle-wage jobs are disappearing and most new growth is tilted toward low-wage service work. Nearly half of all millennials are planning to leave and analysts suggest the area may face a severe shortage of skilled workers. Overall, notes a new Joint Venture Silicon Valley report, homelessness and inequality has expanded in the region, while the quality of life is perceived by most to be deteriorating.
One can appreciate the economic benefits that Uber, Lyft, Salesforce and others have brought to San Francisco, but there’s also a neo-Dickensian reality: sky-high housing prices, widespread homelessness, displaced minorities, few children and a rapidly shrinking middle class. There are now more drug addicts in the city of San Francisco than high school students and so much feces on the street that one website has created a “poop map.” More than half of the Bay Area’s lower-income communities, notes a recent UC Berkeley study, are in danger of mass displacement.
As for the rest of California
In previous tech-led economic booms — as recently as the last decade — growth extended to the rest of the state, particularly the more affordable interior. Tech firms expanded eastward, to Sacramento, south toward Salinas and throughout Southern California. The new tech economy, in contrast, has no real need for a periphery. It expands almost anywhere, whether to media-centric New York, less expensive places including suburban Austin, Nashville or Dallas or to China, India or the Philippines.
This has left much of Southern and interior California an economic dependency, hosting largely on low-wage jobs and increasingly dependent on an expansive welfare state. Worse yet, the tech boom serves as a narcotic, anesthetizing our political leaders from confronting the economic realities outside the venture capital-funded Bay Area bubble.
What is needed now is a focus on the middle- and working-class Californians, the vast majority of whom live far from the Bay Area. California’s policy makers need to start by rolling back many of the regulations on energy and housing that are reducing opportunity by driving up costs and driving middle-class jobs out of the state. We also need to focus more on developing employment centers outside the ultra-expensive coastal areas, something that would allow people to live closer to where they work. This suggests a policy that focus on such things as good roads, decent schools and a variety of upwardly mobile jobs — things that may not matter much to oligarchs or the youthful staffs, but make all the difference to middle- and working-class families.
To be truly a sustainable society, California needs opportunities for carpenters, machinists, middle managers, not just for the current structure that relies on superstar coders and produces large numbers of low-paid service workers. We need a California boom that lifts most of our citizens and does not drive them toward a permanent semi-feudal state, servants and supplicants of a small, fantastically wealthy and preening technological elite.

Texto completo: It is no secret that Utah’s 2018-19 ski season will be remembered for great snow, but mostly for mind-boggling traffic jams, no parking and no seating at any of the resort restaurants. This problem is caused by the Epic and Ikon passes that have given people all over the nation special deals at multiple Utah resorts.
I’d like to offer a solution that doesn’t require massive new road construction. For the Cottonwood Canyon resorts (Alta, Snowbird, Brighton and Solitude) I ask that you follow the lead of Arapahoe Basin Ski Resort in Colorado.
For next season, Arapahoe will stop accepting the Ikon and Epic pass. Their management determined that the resort simply doesn’t have the infrastructure to support the huge crowds these passes bring. Neither does Alta and Snowbird.
Our canyons, particularly the Cottonwoods, are not conducive to massive crowds. Even The New York Times commented that their outdoor reporter was caught in a two-hour traffic jam in Little Cottonwood and decided to go to Colorado instead.
So, Alta and Snowbird, are you more interested in counting bills at the end of the day, or providing a great ski experience for your loyal customers who have spent lifetimes at your resort?
If you quit the Epic and Ikon passes, your parking lots will still be full, but we won’t see the lunacy we have seen this season.
Give your loyal customers a break. Drop the Ikon and Epic passes. The solution is simple. They have ruined Park City and they threaten to ruin your resorts.

The opium of California

Texto completo: The current frenzy of new IPOs — Uber, Lyft, Slack, Postmates, Pinterest and Airbnb — seems destined to reinforce progressive notions that California represents the future not just for the state, but the nation. It will certainly reinforce California’s fiscal dependency on tech-dominated elites — half of the state’s income taxes come from people making over $500,000 a year — and provide a huge potential multi-billion dollar windfall for the state treasury.
To be sure, the insiders — founders, with nearly half the voting shares in companies such as Lyft, a small “tech mafia” of venture firms, foreign investors such as Japan’s Softbank and Wall Street investors — will have reason to celebrate. But the lavish paydays will do little to relieve, and may even serve to worsen, the state’s gaping inequality and nation-leading poverty rates .
Most damaging of all, the IPO high will encourage supporters of the state’s policy agenda. If new companies crop up, and the handful of politically savvy investors thrive, California’s illuminati can fend off criticism of policies that undermine the middle and working class in everything from energy to housing.
The changing nature of California’s tech economy
“Science,” observed Daniel Coit Gilman, the second president of the University of California, ”is the mother of California.” With few navigable rivers, a persistent shortage of water, far from the then-dominant Eastern seaboard, California’s growth depended on engineering prowess. Not tied to the traditional industries, the state seized on emerging fields such as aviation, space and eventually semiconductors, laying the basis for an expanding middle class
In contrast, little of today’s tech growth produces tangible products, and those that remain, such as Space X , the semiconductor industry and Apple, are placing their production either abroad or in less expensive and less highly regulated states. This allows them to escape California’s high electrical rates, poor roads, collapsing bridges and lagging public education system. The digital future may remain in California but the action in chip-manufacturing, biomedical products or space exploration seems headed elsewhere.
The firms in the new “information peddling economy,” notes the University of Washington at Tacoma’s Ali Modarres, have a very different relationship with their employees than “first wave” companies such as Hewlett Packard and Intel. In the first wave a broad range of employees enjoyed rewards from corporate success and stock gains; drivers for Uber, as one analyst suggests, will get nothing but the privilege of seeing vast flows of cash used to replace them with automated vehicles.
The neo-feudal city
The new wave of IPOs will expand the ranks of what The New York Times aptly describes as “the elite caste who can afford to live comfortably in the Bay Area.” Tech senior managers will enjoy huge capital gains, greatly reducing their federal tax liability. In contrast, less well-placed working schmucks will pay upward of half their income in taxes while those who clean their offices will face potential new fees on everything from tires and soda to water.
Even in the Bay Area, home to four of California’s wealthiest ZIP codes, middle-wage jobs are disappearing and most new growth is tilted toward low-wage service work. Nearly half of all millennials are planning to leave and analysts suggest the area may face a severe shortage of skilled workers. Overall, notes a new Joint Venture Silicon Valley report, homelessness and inequality has expanded in the region, while the quality of life is perceived by most to be deteriorating.
One can appreciate the economic benefits that Uber, Lyft, Salesforce and others have brought to San Francisco, but there’s also a neo-Dickensian reality: sky-high housing prices, widespread homelessness, displaced minorities, few children and a rapidly shrinking middle class. There are now more drug addicts in the city of San Francisco than high school students and so much feces on the street that one website has created a “poop map.” More than half of the Bay Area’s lower-income communities, notes a recent UC Berkeley study, are in danger of mass displacement.
As for the rest of California
In previous tech-led economic booms — as recently as the last decade — growth extended to the rest of the state, particularly the more affordable interior. Tech firms expanded eastward, to Sacramento, south toward Salinas and throughout Southern California. The new tech economy, in contrast, has no real need for a periphery. It expands almost anywhere, whether to media-centric New York, less expensive places including suburban Austin, Nashville or Dallas or to China, India or the Philippines.
This has left much of Southern and interior California an economic dependency, hosting largely on low-wage jobs and increasingly dependent on an expansive welfare state. Worse yet, the tech boom serves as a narcotic, anesthetizing our political leaders from confronting the economic realities outside the venture capital-funded Bay Area bubble.
What is needed now is a focus on the middle- and working-class Californians, the vast majority of whom live far from the Bay Area. California’s policy makers need to start by rolling back many of the regulations on energy and housing that are reducing opportunity by driving up costs and driving middle-class jobs out of the state. We also need to focus more on developing employment centers outside the ultra-expensive coastal areas, something that would allow people to live closer to where they work. This suggests a policy that focus on such things as good roads, decent schools and a variety of upwardly mobile jobs — things that may not matter much to oligarchs or the youthful staffs, but make all the difference to middle- and working-class families.
To be truly a sustainable society, California needs opportunities for carpenters, machinists, middle managers, not just for the current structure that relies on superstar coders and produces large numbers of low-paid service workers. We need a California boom that lifts most of our citizens and does not drive them toward a permanent semi-feudal state, servants and supplicants of a small, fantastically wealthy and preening technological elite.

Texto completo: ALL THE NEWS - Made it, Ma, top of the world: The New York Times is singing our praises.
In a travel piece published Thursday, numerous attractions in our mighty metro get positive mentions, with downtown being lauded for "filling up with new residences, hotel projects and cultural venues."
The story is titled "36 Hours in St. Louis."
This excursion begins at 2 p.m. on a Friday at as good of a place as possible, the Gateway Arch. The national park garners praises for its recent $380 million renovation.
While in the neighborhood, a trip to the Old Courthouse is suggested and its connection to the Dred Scott decision is explained.
Next, time for refreshments. The article mentions Anheuser-Busch, but then moves on to talk about craft brewers like Side Project, Narrow Gauge, Urban Chestnut and Saint Louis Brewery (aka Schlafly).
From there, it's food time and chef Michael Gallina gets mentioned for vegetable-forward restaurant Vicia.
Saturday morning kicks off with a jaunt designed by Amanda Clark and her Renegade STL tours.
Lunch comes courtesy of Balkan Treat Box in Webster Groves, followed by boutique shopping near Missouri Botanical Garden.
By Saturday afternoon, museums called. The Pulitzer Arts Foundation in Grand Center, the National Blues Museum and the Scott Joplin House State Historic Site are noted.
Dinner on Saturday came courtesy of Gerard Craft, which the article credits with being the "chef most closely associated with St. Louis's culinary emergence ..."
After dining at Craft's downtown Cinder House, the trip skirts west to the Grand Center Arts District and mentions the St. Louis Black Rep and the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra. It even alerts summer visitors to the Muny's upcoming season. Then it's off to the Repertory Theatre of St. Louis in Webster Groves.
On Sunday morning, breakfast is at Half & Half in Clayton to fuel up for a trip to Forest Park and its attractions: the art museum, history museum, science center and zoo. The trip ends at noon with a visit to City Museum.
Some trip. But a question remains:
Isn't 2 p.m. Friday until noon Sunday a tad more than 36 hours?
HAIL, HAIL ... - Like watching a child perform on stage, Joe Edwards was a proud parent.
In this case, the King of the Blueberry Hill's baby was a gold 1957 Gibson ES-350T -- one that Chuck Berry gave to Edwards years ago.
The ax is a key element to the "Play it Loud" rock 'n' roll history exhibit that opens Monday at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.
"And to see that on display, actually the first thing you see when you walk in, was just incredible," said Edwards, who attended a special premiÃ¨re Monday.
The display will be in NYC through Oct. 1, when it moves on to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland.
Edwards noted that the guitar -- which Berry used to record "Johnny B. Goode" in late 1957 -- will eventually return to its display space at Blueberry Hill.
SEMI-STRESSED - Feel like you live in a constant state of stress? Well, things could be better; but they could be worse.
Missouri finishes smack dab in the middle, No. 25, on a list of the "Most & Least Stressed States" from personal finance website WalletHub.
The list took into account four areas of stress: work, family, financial and health/safety. (Note: No. 1 is the most stressed, No. 50 is the least.)
Missouri was a most relaxed No. 35 out of 50, when it came to family-related issues: separation and divorce rate; share of single parents; and child care.
We also were solid in the areas of finances, No. 24, and work, No. 28.
The worst showing was in the area of health/safety, in which we placed No. 11. That category looked at crime rate, suicide rate, cases of depression, health services and physical activity.
And it's generally the same state of stress heading east, as Illinois clocked in at No. 24.
The most uptight state was Louisiana; the most relaxed was Minnesota.

Revealing portrait of Trump ally Bannon

Texto completo: 'The Brink' ***1/2
"Know thine enemy." It's an aphorism that may come to mind for a viewer of a certain political tendency while watching "The Brink," Alison Klayman's engrossing documentary about conservative operative and former Trump Svengali Steve Bannon. It's at least a justification for watching this portrait, which is as troubling as it is revealing about the man, who seems hellbent on disrupting the establishment by mobilizing white working-class voters through dog-whistle identity politics. But one has to question Bannon's motivation. Is it wealth? Power? Anarchy? Frustratingly, it seems to be just because he can.
Klayman's film is subtle and nuanced, not something one would associate with Bannon, a proud propagandist who learned the art of war at Goldman Sachs and honed his media skills in narrative filmmaking in Hollywood. At first, Klayman's film humanizes him, which can be unsettling, pitted against the image of him as a hate-spewing monster. But Klayman doesn't hesitate to introduce us to Bannon as a man who is vulnerable, self-aware and even funny. He speaks to the horrors of the Holocaust and is concerned with his appearance, sipping green smoothies and kombucha.
Klayman shows us his charm because charm is what makes Bannon so, so dangerous. Deep into "The Brink," he wins over a hostile Toronto crowd at a debate with wry, self-deprecating jokes, and you realize just how likable this guy is. It's a chilling thought, after we've watched him amass power and money to fuel his "populist movement" across Europe.
Klayman follows Bannon's breakneck schedule from 2017 to 2018, after his resignation from the White House in the wake of violent protests in Charlottesville, Va., to the most recent midterm elections. He's busy networking with a coalition of far-right European leaders, setting his sights on influencing elections while attempting to coalesce the populist movement. It's meetings, phone calls and private jet flights as Klayman pulls back the curtain on how the sausage gets made -- the wheeling and dealing with international leaders, the careful back and forth with the media, and the constant bickering within the organization.
Many will want to highlight the juicier moments of "The Brink," such as Bannon texting New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman a link to the trailer for his self-labeled propaganda film "Trump @ War," or Sam Nunberg claiming the border wall was his idea. But the most fascinating moments in "The Brink" are when the filmmaking apparatus is most apparent. Klayman often queries Bannon from offscreen, pushing back on his oft-repeated rhetoric.
Bannon even guffaws that the film is going to ruin him. This may come as a surprise, but "Sloppy Steve" always knows how he looks. The truly enlightening element of "The Brink" is these small moments of cynicism. Bannon may think he's constantly manipulating the media, but in this film, Klayman uses the tools of documentary filmmaking to reveal his inherent emptiness.

In These Elections, Accusations Are Common, but Challengers Are Not

Texto completo: Soccer officials from one of FIFA's largest confederations have gathered this week in Malaysia's capital, Kuala Lumpur, to elect a president. The balloting will take place at the end of a long day of speeches, motions and reports, but at least the setting -- the luxurious Shangri-La Hotel -- promises to be comfortable.
Before the vote is held, the incumbent, Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim al-Khalifa of Bahrain, will have the opportunity to make a speech outlining his qualifications. His opponent will not.
That is because, as usual, there is no opponent.
For the third time in less than a year -- the fourth will come in June -- one of soccer's largest and most powerful governing bodies will rubber-stamp the election of its leader in a one-candidate election. South America's governing body, Conmebol, went first last May, when it granted President Alejandro Domínguez an unopposed second term, and Europe's governing body, UEFA, followed suit in February by re-electing Aleksandr Ceferin. In June, FIFA's president, Gianni Infantino, will retain his post in yet another walkover.
"There has always seemed to be a great deal of fear around challenging the incumbent and because of the potential for retribution built into the system," said Alexandra Wrage, president of the corporate governance adviser Trace International. For that reason, she said, regular uncontested elections are "not all that surprising."
Wrage previously advised FIFA on corporate governance reforms before quitting in 2013. She has since become one of the organization's most vocal critics.
In Asia, Sheikh Salman had been challenged -- briefly -- by opponents from the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, two countries at the center of a broad political dispute that has spilled into soccer in a variety of ways, but both dropped out of the race late last month after a series of behind-the-scenes meetings in the Gulf.
Sheikh Salman's presidency has been marred by controversy since he was elected in 2013 to replace Mohamed Bin Hammam, a wealthy Qatari businessman who was banned for life in the wake of a corruption investigation. His connections to Bahrain's royal family, for example, have led to Sheikh Salman's recusing himself from a role in some of the Asian Football Confederation's most sensitive decisions, such as in the highly publicized case of Hakeem al-Araibi, a soccer player who fled to Australia after claiming he had been tortured by the Bahraini government during pro-democracy demonstrations there in 2011.
Salman also did not take part in discussions over how to deal with the pirating of the A.F.C.'s Qatari broadcast partner's programing by an illegal operation based in Saudi Arabia. Bahrain is among the countries backing the Saudi-led blockade of Qatar.
The re-election of incumbents, routinely without opposition, is common in soccer, where the power structures remain closely held despite a sprawling investigation in 2015 by the United States Department of Justice that exposed corruption schemes at the highest levels of the sport dating back decades.
The American case largely avoided implicating officials in Asia, but by then regional soccer leaders had already faced a reckoning after a series of internal investigations into the conduct of Sheikh Salman's predecessor, Bin Hammam, and his leadership team. Those reports, including one by the former F.B.I. chief Louis Freeh, exposed a series of unexplained payments made to soccer officials throughout Asia and Africa.
The reports, three in total, which have been reviewed by The New York Times, exposed a series of payments made on behalf of Bin Hammam by the A.F.C.'s longtime media partner, World Sports Group, and specifically its regional head, the Lebanese businessman Pierre Kakhia. The payments included legal fees for an official from Tahiti who was facing an ethics ban, and money to a consulting firm hired to promote Bin Hammam's bid for the FIFA presidency.
Despite his links to Bin Hammam, Kakhia remains a trusted consultant to the A.F.C., currently responsible for handling millions of dollars worth of sponsorship contracts, even though he last worked for W.S.G.'s parent company in 2016.
The A.F.C. declined to say why it had retained the services of Kakhia.
As well as Sheikh Salman's re-election, delegates at the meeting in Kuala Lumpur will pick candidates for coveted places on global soccer's ruling body, the FIFA Council. That contest, featuring eight candidates vying for six places, has proved to be contentious.
South Korean officials have complained to the A.F.C. over perceived double standards in ethics rules after their country was barred from inviting soccer officials to Seoul to attend an exhibition game last month, a prohibition that was not extended to Qatar, which wrote to officials inviting them on an all-expenses paid trip to attend two matches there. Both South Korea and Qatar have candidates in the election, as does the Philippines, whose candidate, the South Koreans contend, has been using a private jet owned by a Qatari official to travel across the region during his campaign.
"We urgently request you to review this matter in relation to any violation against the relevant regulations in force," the Korean soccer federation president, Chong Mong-gyu, wrote in a letter to the A.F.C. The A.F.C., which confirmed it had received the South Koreans' complaint, declined to say why it had not issued the same warning to Qatar.
Sheikh Salman's challengers dropped out of the presidential race after a series of decisions by the A.F.C., including the surprising move to break an exclusive television contract with the A.F.C.'s broadcast partner, the Qatari broadcaster BeIN Sports, in order to allow games to be broadcast in Saudi Arabia, where games have been broadcast illegally for almost two years. BeIN said it planned to sue the A.F.C. over the decision.
Until that decision, Saudi Arabia had been supporting an Emirati candidate, Mohammad Khalfan al-Rumaithi. Rumaithi withdrew his candidacy shortly after the television agreement was struck. The third candidate, Saoud al-Mohannadi of Qatar, soon followed suit.

Texto completo: Mobile, Ala. — In a rare public appearance since his resignation last November, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions Thursday night gave a ringing defense of his tenure as head of the Justice Department. It was and is a defense well worth making.

Sessions was speaking in his hometown of Mobile, Ala., at a dinner celebrating the 30th anniversary of the Alabama Policy Institute, one of the first and most successful of the nation’s growing number of conservative state think tanks. API’s co-founder and longtime president, Gary Palmer, is now in Congress, heading the House Republican Policy Committee.

About ten or 12 minutes into his 35-minute address, Sessions discussed his two-year stint as AG. Referring only by inference to President Trump’s criticisms of his recusal from the Russia-related investigation that roiled politics for two years, Sessions’ tone was wry and a bit self-deprecating.

“I expected from the start that my job would entail lots of controversies,” he said. “Well I can say that in that regard it even exceeded my expectations. [Pause] But I did my best … ”

Interrupted by a standing ovation from his hometown crowd, he finally was able to be heard again with a simple, declaratory statement that presaged the rest of his speech: “We did a lot of good in the Department of Justice.” He cited an August 2017 New York Times news article saying that “Mr. Sessions is carrying out the president’s conservative agenda with head-turning speed, roiling critics on the left and leaving some career staff members within the department disoriented by the sea change.”

Sessions began his list with an overall philosophical point he said he insisted the department honor in all its action – namely, that the text of the Constitution and statutes should be read closely, not expansively.

“Words do have meaning,” he said. “The Left manipulates the meanings of words to advance their agenda. We put a stop to that.”

On specific policy changes or advancements, Sessions’ list was long. He said he changed policy to put an end to the abuse of “third-party settlements,” by which the Justice Department used its power to force financial judgments that then were paid to (inevitably left-wing) nongovernmental advocacy organizations. He claimed progress in fighting “nationwide injunctions,” noting that after the department under his guidance began making legal arguments against them, Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch had taken up the cause, and he expects more justices to follow when new cases arise.

Sessions said his department took the lead in protecting and restoring religious liberty after assaults on our “first freedom” by the Obama administration, and noted several court victories on that front. He said they made advances on protecting free speech on college campuses, on protecting the rights of women’s health centers not to be forced to make abortion referrals, on supporting “the men and women in blue” in police forces around the country, and on reversing what had been an uptick in violent crime nationwide.

In a speech last month honoring Sessions, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein provided specific examples of how the department under Sessions made progress on these fronts, especially on reversing the hike in violent crime.

Also, Rosenstein credited Sessions with having “restored the rule of law to the immigration system, by adding prosecutors and judges to the southwestern border, hiring scores of new immigration judges, and expediting the immigration adjudication process. The department protected national security by defending elections from foreign interference, created a cyber-digital task force, launched an initiative to combat Chinese economic espionage, pursued terrorist financing schemes, [and] devoted additional resources to investigate leaks of classified information.”

Conservative trench warriors know what Sessions accomplished. J. Christian Adams, a former Justice Department whistleblower and frequent Fox News guest who now heads the Public Interest Legal Foundation, put it plainly in an interview Friday morning: “He was the best Attorney General you could have confirmed in 2017. He was more aligned with the president's core agenda than anyone who could replace him."

Texto completo: BY ELIAS MESERET
The Associated Press
ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia - A doomed Ethiopian Airlines jet suffered from faulty readings by a key sensor, and pilots followed Boeing's recommended procedures when the plane started to nose dive but could not avoid crashing, according to a preliminary report released Thursday by the Ethiopian government.
The findings, including the faulty sensor data, drew the strongest link yet between the March 10 crash in Ethiopia and an October crash off the coast of Indonesia, which both involved Boeing 737 Max 8 jetliners. All 346 people on the two planes were killed.
Both planes had an automated system that pushed the nose down when sensor readings detected the danger of an aerodynamic stall, but it now appears that sensors malfunctioned on both planes.
Thursday's report, based on flight data and cockpit voice recorders on the Ethiopian Airlines jetliner, showed that a faulty sensor on the plane touched off a series of events that caused the pilots to lose control of the plane. The report from Ethiopia's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau said the sensor problems began about a minute after the plane was cleared for takeoff.
It said air speed and altitude values on the left side of the 737 Max conflicted with data from the right sensor, causing flight control problems. Eventually the Ethiopian Airlines pilots couldn't keep the plane from crashing into the ground, killing all
157 people onboard.
The problems are similar to those reported on the Indonesian Lion Air flight that crashed last October. Investigators found that software on that plane took readings from the sensor and pointed the nose down. Thursday's revelations raise questions about repeated assertions by Boeing and U.S. regulators that pilots could regain control in some emergencies by following steps that include turning off an anti-stall system designed specifically for the Max, known by its acronym, MCAS.
Investigators are looking into the role of MCAS, which under some circumstances can automatically lower the plane's nose to prevent an aerodynamic stall. The Max has been grounded worldwide pending a software fix that Boeing is rolling out, which still needs to be approved by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and other regulators.
In a statement, Boeing acknowledged the faulty data from the sensor activated the MCAS system, which was similar to circumstances in the Lion Air crash.
The company said that to make sure unintended activation of the system doesn't happen again, Boeing is developing software and "associated comprehensive pilot training" for the Max.
The software update, Boeing said in the statement, adds layers of protection and will stop erroneous data from activating the system.
Ethiopian investigators did not specifically mention the MCAS, but recommended that Boeing review "the aircraft flight control system related to the flight controllability." They also recommended that aviation officials verify that issues have been adequately addressed before allowing the planes to fly again.
At a news conference, Minister of Transport Dagmawit Moges said the Ethiopian Airlines crew "performed all the procedures repeatedly provided by the manufacturer but was not able to control the aircraft."
However, it wasn't clear whether the Ethiopian pilots followed Boeing's recommendations to the letter in dealing with the system repeatedly pointing the nose down.
The pilots initially followed Boeing's emergency steps by disconnecting the MCAS system, but for an unknown reason, they turned the system back on, an official familiar with the crash investigation told The Associated Press on Wednesday. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because at the time, Ethiopian investigators had not released their preliminary report. Boeing's procedures instruct pilots to leave the MCAS system disconnected and continue flying manually for the rest of the flight.
Ethiopian investigators did not address that issue at the news conference, saying only that the pilots had done what they were supposed to.
However, Moges told The New York Times after the press conference that the pilots turned MCAS on and off, but she couldn't say how many times. That will be addressed in the final report, she said.
Boeing is the focus of investigations by the U.S. Justice Department, the Transportation Department's inspector general, and congressional committees. Investigations are also looking at the role of the Federal Aviation Administration in the U.S., which certified the Max in 2017, declined to ground it after the first deadly crash in October. The agency was also reluctant to ground the planes after the Ethiopian Airlines crash and was among the last agencies to do so.

Broadway hit 'Be More Chill' quickly lands in Mpls.

Texto completo: The title is easygoing, and so is the licensing for "Be More Chill."
A production of Joe Iconis' 2015 sci-fi musical comedy opens Friday at the Illusion Theater in Minneapolis, just shy of one month after it bowed on Broadway.
That timing is highly unusual. Rights to most Broadway shows only become available after a Broadway run, with rights-holders often forcing theaters to delay or scotch productions entirely.
In fact, over the past few months, many productions of "To Kill a Mockingbird" have been canceled across the U.S. and Britain after legal threats from the backers of a brand-new Broadway production adapted by Aaron Sorkin and headlined by Jeff Daniels. For decades, community and high school theaters relied on a 1970s adaptation by playwright Christopher Sergel.
But the Rodgers and Hammerstein Organization, which controls the licensing for "Chill," has given rights not only to the Minneapolis Musical Theatre (MMT), which is producing the show in the Twin Cities, but to more than a dozen other companies nationally -- some professional, some amateur.
It surprised, in a happy way, even the folks at tiny MMT.
"I kept waiting for them to call and say no, but the call never came," said artistic director Joe Hendren. "It's an exciting time and this is an exciting show."
Based on Ned Vizzini's 2004 young adult novel, "Chill" tells the story of a social outcast named Jeremy who's bullied at school. Seeking to boost his popularity, he swallows a pill that's really an amazing supercomputer life coach.
After its unremarkable New Jersey premiere in 2015, "Be More Chill" slowly gained momentum in the world of social media. According to the New York Times, the 2015 cast album racked up 170 million digital streams, even before the March 10 Broadway debut. And the musical inspired a spate of fan-driven YouTube tributes, usually starring exuberant teens.
The show has become very popular with young people, partly because it pokes fun of tropes associated with high school musicals, said director Sara Pillatzki-Warzeha.
"The trajectory of getting it from off-Broadway to Broadway was totally audience-driven," Pillatzki-Warzeha said. "That's an exciting possibility for an audience favorite to have this unexpected rise, especially since it was largely driven by a young audience, regardless of the reviews."
About those reviews. Well, they have been mixed. There was a dismissive New York Times review in 2015 when "Be More Chill" premiered in New Jersey. The newspaper gave last month's Broadway premiere even worse marks. But that's not the point, Pillatzki-Warzeha said.
The bigger deal is that in a field where audience demographics skew older -- owing to the high price of theater tickets and the fact that the canon stretches back 2,500 years -- the audience is being renewed with "Be More Chill."
In the past, regional productions like MMT's were seen as competition. Or at least distractions from the standard-bearer on Broadway. But that view is changing, with some observers seeing the Broadway show as the sun and other productions as satellites.
"I don't want to speak for the Rodgers and Hammerstein Organization but I'm curious to see how this is actually going to play out," Hendren said. "The people who're going to shows in New York -- on or off Broadway -- are going to keep going to those shows regardless of what we're doing here in the Twin Cities.
"The only thing that this is going to do, if producers and publishers continue to embrace this approach, is drive music downloads and sales," Hendren continued.
MMT landed the right to "Be More Chill" last fall, well before it opened on Broadway. Just how did a small theater in Minneapolis pull it off?
"It was a pretty mundane process," Hendren said. "We saw that rights were available, and we, as a company, like to do new musicals, so we got in line."
Now they are hoping that audiences in Minneapolis will do the same.

What a week! For interior-design pros or fans, Boston was the place to be

Texto completo: Every spring and fall, there's a buzz happening around Boston -- a buzz that draws designers, artists, architects and industry professionals to the city to participate in interesting events, presentations and seminars.

This 12-day, citywide festival, Boston Design Week, was held March 27-April 7 and was jam-packed with all kinds of events open to the public as well as professionals.

The Autodesk Technology Center hosted Design Night Boston at the BUILD Space where the focus was on learning how technology and design are transforming the world in new and unexpected ways.

A presentation by Morehouse MacDonald & Associates, called Behind the Scenes of Waterfront Design, was held at The Boston Symphony Orchestra and moderated by Bill Springer, editor of Ocean Home Magazine, and Nancy E. Berry, editor of Northshore Magazine. If you've been down to Boston's Seaport area lately, you likely noticed the waterfront transformations that are happening daily.

A few favorites that I attended were presentations at the Boston Design Center hosted by designSkim, with a few leading ladies and internet-design entrepreneurs, including LuAnn Nigara, Michele Williams, Heather Gillette and Esther Dunbar-Cullum. This Beyond Social Media and Harnessing the Internet Growth seminar was very informative for the designer in business and for learning how to bridge technology and design.

Women in Design, hosted by Modern Luxury Interiors Boston, one of the newest shelter magazines, and moderated by Editor-in-Chief Jaci Conry, was a big draw. Panelists included lighting designer Lindsey Adelman, Boston interior designers Paula Daher and Stephanie Rossi, and celebrated designer and television personalities Taniya and Annie Selke. Before sharing their career success stories and strategies facing women in design, a surprise mini-fashion show got the party started, with animal-print fashion being the rage.

The highlight of the evening was a special event with New York Times best-selling author Erin Gates, who discussed her new book, "Elements of Family Style." Erin shared advice on how to cultivate a stylish and tasteful home among the wonderful chaos of family life.

Boston Design Week is always a fun and informative event, not just for interior designers but anyone who enjoys some element of design.

Question: I don't work at Mission Hospital and never have. But I have numerous friends who do. Several of them have independently shared with me that the culture there has changed just in the few weeks since Hospital Corporation of America purchased and started running it. From what I am told, HCA's emphasis on "productivity efficiency goals" has not been done in a prudent way and has created great stress on employees and supervisors. Apparently, there's an emphasis on staffing efficiency that leads to people being sent home hours before their shift is over. One friend suffered a 10% pay-loss for that week. I am told that employees can use their "accumulated personal time" to offset the hours lost. But, that "personal time" is vacation and sick leave etc., so not a very appealing way to cover one's shortage of hours, especially when you earned that personal time. Doubly so when one has immediate bills to pay and food to put on the table. I realize HCA wants to make the hospital more efficient. That's good. But it seems to me they are hurting the very asset that makes Mission a great hospital: its people. Moreover, I was told HCA may be negatively affecting patient safety as some departments end up having fewer people working than needed at times. By hurting morale and effectiveness through shortsighted and poorly implemented "efficiency," is HCA cutting off its corporate nose to spite its face? And Western North Carolina's citizens' health may be the victim. Is this culture change really happening, and can HCA/Mission change course?
My answer: On a positive note, Mission is right there to help with nose replacement cosmetic surgery after spite removals.
Real answer: "Mission has in the past and continues to flex staff to volumes, much like many other health care organizations," said Mission Hospital spokeswoman Nancy Lindell. "At the heart of everything we do is applying the same compassion and commitment we have for our patients to our co-workers and colleagues."
Nashville-based HCA and Mission, formerly a not-for-profit health care system, consummated their $1.5 billion deal in February. HCA now owns the Mission Health system, while the money HCA paid allowed for the creation of the Dogwood Health Trust, a private nonprofit dedicated to health improvement in the region.
As a corporation, HCA has had issues with staffing levels, particularly with nurses. The New York Times carried an article March 30 titled, "Nurses Strike in New York: Threat Increases Over 'Safe Staffing' Levels."
"Last year, staffing disputes were a central topic when nurses in five states picketed and threatened to strike hospitals operated by HCA, one of the country's largest health care providers," the article states.
You can find the entire article here: www.nytimes.com/2019/03/30/nyregion/nyc-nurses-strike.html
Last September, the Tampa Bay Times published an article titled, "Nurses at many HCA hospitals say they are willing to strike over pay, staffing, security." You can find that article here: https://bit.ly/2LZlwAT
So clearly, staffing and efficiency is big concern at HCA hospitals.
I'm not taking a deep dive into the issue in Answer Man, but I'm sure it's something the paper will keep tabs on as the HCA ownership of Mission progresses, and we're glad to talk to employees about their experiences.
For now, Mission kept its remarks pretty short and sweet. Lindell stressed that Mission wants to be a good place to work, and a top-notch health care system.
"We work hard to create a place where employees feel empowered to provide the best care possible while experiencing a rewarding career and balanced life," Lindell said. "We care like family and take seriously our responsibility for the health and well-being of our patients and our colleagues."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - The Justice Department on Thursday defended Attorney General William Barr's decision to issue a summary of special counsel Robert Mueller's report and to take time to redact the lengthy document, citing the need to protect grand jury material.
The Justice Department issued the statement after The New York Times and The Washington Post reported some former Mueller team members told associates that Barr  had not adequately portrayed the investigation's findings, or their severity.
The statement also came as President Donald Trump criticized the reports.
"The New York Times had no legitimate sources, which would be totally illegal, concerning the Mueller Report. In fact, they probably had no sources at all! They are a Fake News paper who have already been forced to apologize for their incorrect and very bad reporting on me!" Trump tweeted.
The Times and The Post reported in stories posted late Wednesday that Mueller's team members told associates that their report contained "acute" evidence that Trump obstructed the Russia investigation, though Mueller did not render a final judgment on that charge.
The reports said some members expressed disappointment that the summaries prepared by Mueller's team had not been made public. Rather, Barr chose to issue his own four-page analysis that the president has described as "total exoneration."
Democrats and some Republicans have put pressure on Barr to make the full report public. "Just show us the Mueller report, that's all," said Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Thursday.
But the Justice Department statement sought to defend Barr's actions.
"Given the extraordinary public interest in the matter, the Attorney General decided to release the report's bottom-line findings and his conclusions immediately - without attempting to summarize the report - with the understanding that the report itself would be released after the redaction process," said department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec in a statement.
She said Barr determined he must redact the report, noting that "every page of the 'confidential report'" was stamped with the warning that it may contain confidential federal grand jury material protected under Rule 6e of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.
"The Department continues to work with the Special Counsel on appropriate redactions to the report so that it can be released to Congress and the public," she said.
Barr told Congress on last Friday that he would send it the redacted report by mid-April.
Democrats' distrust of Barr has grown steadily since he issued his summary.
After Mueller submitted his final report on March 22, Barr summarized its "principal conclusions" in that letter that cleared Trump and his campaign of criminally conspiring with Russia, but said Mueller neither charged nor exonerated Trump on obstructing the investigation.
Barr said that after consulting with others in the Justice Department, he determined that the evidence Mueller gathered was insufficient to prove obstruction charges against Trump.
Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, complained on CNN that Barr "arrogated onto himself to write his own summary, rather than using the ones that the Mueller team may very well have expected to be made public."
He added that "it looks like he is trying to hide information, rather than be forthcoming, as he promised," and questioned Barr's determination on the obstruction of justice charge.
Meanwhile, House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-Manhattan) has threatened to execute a subpoena his panel authorized Wednesday to force the release of the full unredacted Mueller report and its underlying materials to Congress if Barr refuses to do so.
Trump also tweeted about that demand on Thursday.
"There is nothing we can ever give to the Democrats that will make them happy. This is the highest level of Presidential Harassment in the history of our Country!" he complained.
Trump's allies also took aim at the reports.
White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters Thursday the administration had "full confidence" in Barr's summary and cast doubt on the motives of those investigators who have raised concerns.
"The people who've been involved in this process have wasted two years of their life and they need to find a way to validate it," Sanders said.
Rudy Giuliani, Trump's personal attorney, in a tweet Wednesday night, also dismissed the reports and called Mueller's staff "unethical

Ardor for Mayor Pete is over the top at times

Texto completo: To paraphrase Alicia Keys, we keep on fallin' . . . in and out of love . . .
And at the moment, the presidential candidate who many media types - and quite a few citizens - are tumbling for is 37-year-old Pete Buttigieg, also known as Mayor Pete of South Bend, Ind.
His fundraising is spiking.
His numbers on the prediction markets come with a green arrow pointed straight up.
And media figures are fallin' - all over themselves - to give him the kind of attention that hasn't been seen since . . . well, since a couple of weeks ago when the flavor of the month was Beto O'Rourke. (Remember that Vanity Fair cover story and the wall-to-wall coverage of his launch?)
It's a little over the top.
Here, for example, was CNN's Chris Cillizza, commenting on Twitter about some comparative fundraising - specifically numbers announced by Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.) and Buttigieg.
"The $12 million for Harris makes Buttigieg's $7 million look that much better," Cillizza wrote about their first-quarter numbers.
Well, infatuation has never been good for clear vision. And Cillizza is far from alone in what sounds a bit like adulation.
New York Times columnist David Brooks explained Americans to themselves this week with his column, "Why You Love Mayor Pete." (It's because, Brooks posits, Buttigieg "detaches progressive policy from the culture war.")
And the columnist hyperbolically called Buttigieg's new prominence "the biggest star-is-born moment since Lady Gaga started singing 'Shallow.' "
Even "Daily Show" host Trevor Noah joined in, reciting Buttigieg's gold-plated background: "He's a veteran, a Harvard graduate and a Rhodes Scholar who's openly gay and also so young that if he served two terms as president, when he came out he would still only be 46. Plus, he's a concert pianist and speaks seven languages, including Norwegian, which he learned just so that he could read Norwegian books."
Noah admitted that this was all very glowing. But, he explained, there's nothing else to report: "There's no dirt on this guy. Like, nothing."
And the politics news site Axios offered a rave headline: "Interest in Pete Buttigieg is exploding." The piece itself, a bit underwhelmingly, was based on the comparative number of Facebook and Twitter interactions on articles about the candidates.
Buttigieg wasn't completely without notice before the CNN town hall in Austin last month that brought him to the attention of a big audience.
A 2014 story in The Washington Post, for example, was headlined "The most interesting mayor you've never heard of" and detailed how the then-32-year-old mayor was temporarily leaving his post while he deployed to Afghanistan with the Navy Reserve.
But it was two more recent media appearances that made all the difference - the CNN town hall at South by Southwest in Austin and, soon afterward, a much-praised hit on MSNBC's "Morning Joe."
Host Joe Scarborough said afterward that he was "overwhelmed" by the response: "The only other time in 12 years that we heard from as many people about a guest" was after an appearance by the pre-presidential Barack Obama.
To some extent, opinionators are just following the legitimate curiosity and response of citizens to an upstart candidate.
And, reality check: Although Mayor Pete's name seems to be everywhere, he's actually getting relatively little cable news coverage - fewer mentions last week than O'Rourke or Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.).
But there was a bright note even there. In a week dominated by speculation about the completed report by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, Buttigieg's cable mentions were the only ones that didn't nosedive, according to FiveThirtyEight.com.
What Buttigieg has is momentum and a certain kind of high-level media attention - columns and think pieces aplenty. There are plenty of Google searches of his name and enough donations to clear the bar for inclusion in Democratic Party debates.
But, as my colleague Philip Bump noted in a cool-headed analysis this week:
"Where Buttigieg hasn't exactly soared is in polling. It's certainly the case that for him to be outpacing U.S. senators in primary polling is no small feat. But in RealClearPolitics's average of primary polls, Buttigieg is at 2.3 percent support - good enough for seventh place."
And when it comes to substantial policy positions, he's not quite there yet. "Buttigieg's bare-bones website has no issues page (despite his emerging reputation as a big-thinking candidate)," noted Zack Beauchamp in Vox.
A young, promising politician having his media moment can be captivating. It's part of what makes politics a great spectator sport. And it might even turn out to mean something.
But, remember, we've been here before. Howard Dean had his moment in 2003. So did Herman Cain in 2011.
Somehow, life went on. Pulse rates returned to their normal levels.
So before we breathlessly agree that Mayor Pete is the next Obama - and sure to be the first millennial president - it might be wise to recall that he hasn't even officially declared his candidacy.
Deep breaths, everyone.

Texto completo: Hazelton Paper Apologizes for Publishing Letter on Holocaust Myth
The Standard-Speaker in Hazelton published an apologetic editorial on March 20, two days after printing a letter to the editor that described the Holocaust as a myth.
Among other things, the March 18 letter from Martin Husovich of White Haven claims that Red Cross records show that less than 300,000 people died in German work camps - with Jews making up slightly less than half of them. He also claims that Jews who spent time in those camps have longer lifespans than those that didn't, in part because of "soccer fields, swimming pools, libraries, brothels, theater and orchestra, and religious facilities, and first-rate medical care."
The paper's editorial noted that it published the letter "knowing that allowing the free flow of thoughts and opinions is a vital part of what we do.
"But we also understand our responsibility to draw a line where opinion crosses into ridiculous and dangerous falsehoods and the promotion of conspiracy theories, and pure hate," the editorial continues. "With that, we want our readers to know that we regret allowing this letter to reach publication."
The paper has since published several letters refuting Husovich.
Measles Outbreak in Orthodox Community Prompts State of Emergency
A measles outbreak centered in an Orthodox Jewish community in Rockland County, New York, prompted county health officials to prohibit unvaccinated children under 18 from venturing into public spaces for 30 days, according to CBS New York.
"We will not sit idly by while children in our community are at risk," County Executive Ed Day said March 26. "This is a public health crisis, and it's time we sound the alarm."
The county has counted 153 confirmed cases in the county 40 miles north of New York City since October, mostly of children who haven't been vaccinated. The newest cases are in eastern Ramapo, which has a high percentage of haredi Orthodox Jews. There have been 48 cases reported in 2019.
Guggenheim Museum Rejects Gifts from Jewish Pharma Family
The Guggenheim Museum in New York City will no longer accept gifts from the Jewish Sackler family, citing the ties its Purdue Pharma company has to the opioid crisis, The New York Times reported on March 25.
Purdue Pharma and the state of Oklahoma settled a lawsuit the following day related to the company's role in misleading both patients and physicians about the dangers of its opioid painkiller OxyContin. The settlement includes a $270 million payment.
The Tate museums in London and the National Portrait Galleryin London also have stopped accepted donations from the Säcklers.
St. Louis Cemetery Vandal Gets Three Years of Probation, to Pay $5,000
A man who admitted he toppled more than 100 headstones at Chesed Shel Emeth Cemetery in suburban St. Louis in February 2017, was sentenced to three years of probation on March 21, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported.
Alzado Harris, 35, also will pay $5,000 in restitution, maintain full-time work, take an anger management course and not contact a friend he was angry with, which led to the vandalism. He hadn't been charged with a bias or hate crime. *

Texto completo: [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox .]
When a middle-school teacher was called to her principal's office in January over a seminude photo that a student had obtained, she was confident the picture was not of her.
The teacher, Lauren Miranda, 25, said she had never sent a picture like that to a student, and a teachers union representative who saw the photograph said it was unclear if it was her.
What happened next speaks to the debate over workplace rights and gender equality, as well as growing concerns about digital privacy in the era of sexting.
In a meeting with mostly men, including colleagues from Bellport Middle School on Long Island, a school administrator turned a computer monitor around to show a topless selfie of Ms. Miranda that she said she had sent only to a fellow teacher whom she had dated.
Ms. Miranda recalled feeling humiliated.
"That was probably the worst day that I endured," she said.
Ms. Miranda, a math teacher, was put on paid administrative leave before ultimately being fired by the South Country Central School District last week, her lawyer said.
On Monday, Ms. Miranda said she planned to sue the school district, its superintendent and members of its Board of Education over her termination.
In papers filed in preparation for a federal lawsuit, she accused the school district of gender discrimination when it fired her for taking a topless photo that a teenage student obtained without her consent.
On Wednesday, Ms. Miranda and her lawyer, John Ray, said the school district would not have fired her had she been a male teacher and taken an identical topless photo.
"The superintendent and the school board -- they didn't get the memo that men and women are equal," Mr. Ray said.
The school district's superintendent, Joseph Giani, and the school board's president and vice president declined to comment.
All three said the district would not speak about a pending lawsuit, and referred questions to a public relations firm that also declined to comment.
Ms. Miranda said in an interview on Wednesday that she did not share the photo with any students and did not know how a student had gotten it without her consent.
She had sent the picture to a male teacher in the school district with whom she had had a relationship, she said.
The court filing focused on comments made by the superintendent. In a meeting before Ms. Miranda was suspended, the claim said, Mr. Giani told the teacher that he would recommend that she be dismissed because she was no longer a proper "role model" for students.
He also told Ms. Miranda that he had planned to recommend her for a promotion before he saw the selfie, Ms. Miranda said.
Mr. Ray's office provided The New York Times with a copy of Ms. Miranda's performance evaluation from the previous school year, in which she received the highest possible rating in nearly every category.
"Ms. Miranda, once again, it was a true pleasure to visit your classroom," one comment on the evaluation said.
In a letter provided to The Times, the superintendent said that among the reasons he was recommending Ms. Miranda's termination was that she "caused, allowed, or otherwise made it possible" for an inappropriate photo to be distributed to students.
He also wrote that she had "failed to take adequate precautionary measures" to prevent the photo from getting into students' hands.
It was unclear what measures those might have been. But Ms. Miranda said she had seen numerous male teachers post shirtless photos of themselves on social media, where they were easily accessible. To her knowledge, none of those teachers had been rebuked.
That disparity, Mr. Ray said, is at the heart of the gender discrimination claim.
"This is a woman who just takes a photo -- a selfie of herself and nothing else," Mr. Ray said. "And then from that, they manage to say that she's done something dirty. Something sexually filthy. That's just not what we're about anymore in the millennial age."
The debate over the unequal treatment of nipples has received a considerable amount of attention in recent years. Social networks in particular have been criticized for policies on nudity that restrict photos of female nipples but not male ones.
As early as 2012, a movement to "Free the Nipple" started, pushing for women's rights to go topless in their social media photos and in public. Propelled by a hashtag, the campaign drew public support from several celebrities, including the singer Miley Cyrus, the supermodel Naomi Campbell and the actress Cara Delevingne.
As part of her legal complaint, Ms. Miranda is seeking up to $3 million and her job back.
"This has been the lowest point of my life," Ms. Miranda said, adding, "I've never felt so small, so defeated, and it wasn't my fault."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, using a little-known provision in the federal tax code, formally requested on Wednesday that the I.R.S. hand over six years of President Trump's personal and business tax returns, starting what is likely to be a momentous fight with his administration.
Representative Richard E. Neal, Democrat of Massachusetts, hand-delivered a two-page letter laying out the request to Charles P. Rettig, the Internal Revenue Service commissioner, ending months of speculation about when he would do so and almost certainly prompting a legal challenge from the Trump administration.
Responding to questions from reporters in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump suggested that he would fight the request because, he said, he was being audited.
"I guess when you have a name, you are audited, but until such time as I'm not under audit I would not be inclined to do that," he said.
[Read Mr. Neal's letter to the I.R.S. commissioner.]
The move by Mr. Neal came as other panels controlled by House Democrats were flexing their muscles. The House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday morning authorized its chairman to use a subpoena to try to force the Justice Department to give Congress a full copy of the special counsel's report and all of the underlying evidence used to reach his conclusions on Russian interference in the 2016 election.
And the chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee said that he would soon ask for a vote on a subpoena of his own to compel Mazars USA, an accounting firm tied to the president, to produce a decade's worth of Mr. Trump's financial records.
"They have told us that they will provide the information pretty much when they have a subpoena," the chairman, Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, told reporters. "And we'll get them a subpoena."
Unlike the chairmen of other committees, Mr. Neal is not relying on a subpoena or standard congressional processes. Instead, he is invoking an authority enshrined in the tax code granted only to the tax-writing committees in Congress that gives the chairmen of the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee the power to request tax information on any filer.
Mr. Neal gave the agency until April 10 to comply with the request, and if he receives the information, he will then confidentially review it with his committee staff.
The provision, which dates in some form to the Teapot Dome scandal of Warren G. Harding's administration, at least on its face gives the Trump administration little room to decline a request like Mr. Neal's. It only says that the Treasury secretary "shall" furnish the information.
"President Trump is the first president in nearly a half century to break precedent and refuse to voluntarily release his tax returns," said Representative Dan Kildee, Democrat of Michigan and a member of the Ways and Means Committee. "The president is the only person who can sign bills into law, and the public deserves to know whether the president's personal financial interests affect his public decision making."
The Treasury Department and the I.R.S. did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
But Democrats anticipate that the Trump administration will object to the request and force the matter into the courts, where its adjudication could take months or longer. Though the provision -- No. 6103 in the tax code -- is invoked frequently by the committee, there is little precedent for using it to view the returns of a president who has not invited the scrutiny.
Republicans have vigorously argued against the request, saying that whatever justification Democrats produce will belie their true intent: to fish for information that could embarrass the president politically.
Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the top Republican on the Ways and Means Committee, called the request "an abuse of the tax-writing committees' statutory authority."
"Weaponizing our nation's tax code by targeting political foes sets a dangerous precedent and weakens Americans' privacy rights," Mr. Brady said in a letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. "As you know, by law all Americans have a fundamental right to the privacy of the personal information found in their tax returns."
Defying modern presidential norms, Mr. Trump has refused since he became a candidate for president to release any of his tax returns. Democrats suspect the tax information could provide clues to wrongdoing by Mr. Trump, and they made getting the documents one of their top oversight priorities when they reclaimed control of the House in January.
[A New York Times investigation showed that the president engaged in suspect tax schemes as he reaped riches from his father.]
Mr. Neal said he was making the request as part of his committee's oversight of "the extent to which the I.R.S. audits and enforces the federal tax laws against a president." Under I.R.S. policy, the personal tax returns of presidents and vice presidents are supposed to be automatically audited each year. Mr. Neal said the committee was considering legislation related to the issue.
"I take the authority to make this request very seriously, and I approach it with the utmost care and respect," Mr. Neal said in a statement. "This request is about policy, not politics; my preparations were made on my own track and timeline, entirely independent of other activities in Congress and the administration."
He added, "I trust that in this spirit, the I.R.S. will comply with federal law and furnish me with the requested documents in a timely manner."
In addition to Mr. Trump's personal returns for 2013 to 2018, Mr. Neal requested returns for Mr. Trump's trust and seven other core Trump business entities that control scores of other Trump operations, including his golf club in Bedminster, N.J. He also asked the I.R.S. to share any information it had related to the entities, including whether they had been audited.
Liberal Democrats have complained for weeks that Mr. Neal, 70 and a roll-up-your-sleeves legislator, was dragging his feet on making the request. They have organized events in his district, taken out advertisements and produced legal briefs meant to make a case that he should act and act quickly.
Mr. Neal said throughout that he was chiefly concerned with crafting a request, alongside the House general counsel and the Ways and Means Committee staff, that could withstand legal challenge.
"I am certain we are within our legitimate legislative, legal and oversight rights," he said on Wednesday.
In the Judiciary Committee, the chairman, Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, said he would not immediately issue the subpoena for the Mueller report. But the party-line vote won by Democrats who control the committee ratchets up pressure on Attorney General William P. Barr as he decides how much of the nearly 400-page report to share with lawmakers.
"I will give him time to change his mind," Mr. Nadler said in his opening statement. "But if we cannot reach an accommodation, then we will have no choice but to issue subpoenas for these materials."
The committee also approved subpoenas for five former White House aides who Democrats said were relevant to an investigation into possible obstruction of justice, abuse of power and corruption within the Trump administration.
They included Donald F. McGahn II, a former White House counsel; Stephen K. Bannon, the president's former chief strategist; Hope Hicks, a former White House communications director; Reince Priebus, the president's first chief of staff; and Annie Donaldson, a deputy of Mr. McGahn.

That Joe Biden's touching is only becoming an issue now confirms liberal media bias

Texto completo: As the press gives more attention to the mounting accusations against former Vice President Joe Biden for inappropriate touching, it is only doing more to confirm all of the suspicions that conservatives have about liberal media bias.

The New York Times quoted two more women as saying they felt uncomfortable by the way Biden touched them, which follows two other accusations of a similar nature.

However, there is nothing particularly new about the idea that Biden is handsy. The fact was well known for years and demonstrated in many photos and videos. A number of conservatives tried to argue that his creepy behavior shouldn't simply be dismissed as just a cuddly Biden being Biden. At the time, though, the matter was largely ignored by the media, treated as a joke, or waved off as "faux outrage."

It's hard to argue that the issue was irrelevant at the time, and that it's only emerging now because Biden is considering a run for president. It's not as if he were an obscure figure at the time these incidents occurred. He was the vice president of the United States.

The only thing that's changed is Biden's opponents. Had the media scrutinized Biden's behavior back then, it would have benefited Republicans and caused headaches for the Obama administration. Now, however, Biden's opponents are a dozen or more Democrats. Given that he's been consistently on top of polls for the 2020 Democratic nomination, all of the rival camps are gunning for him, and hoping to destroy his candidacy before it even gets off the launch pad.

So, it's entirely predictable that the media are suddenly focusing on Biden's touching problem now, even while acknowledging that it was an open secret for years.

Should Biden go on to win the Democratic nomination, expect the media to go back to suddenly not caring about this issue. And any attempt by conservatives to raise it will just be shut down by pointing to President Trump's record of boasting about grabbing women.

Businesses! Book deals! 2020 Democrats to deliver socialism on their own silver platters

Texto completo: The 2020 Democratic field is running hard to the left as the Democratic Party celebrates socialism. But several of the candidates can well afford taking down capitalism at this point, because they're already multimillionaires and have incomes in the top 1 percent.

Former Reps. Beto O’Rourke and John Delaney, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, and former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper are among the wealthiest Democratic presidential candidates. Other hopefuls have earned hundreds of thousands of dollars in book royalties and speaking fees.

OpenSecrets.org estimates that O’Rourke was worth around $9 million in 2015. His 2017 House financial disclosure form shows assets ranging from $3.6 million to $16.6 million and liabilities ranging from $1.3 million to $5.8 million.

The former Texas representative co-founded an El Paso web and software company in the late '90s, but much of his wealth comes from his wife Amy O'Rourke. She is the daughter of real estate tycoon Bill Sanders, who Forbes estimated is worth around $500 million.

Warren, who proposed a wealth tax on households worth more than $50 million, reported in a Federal Election Commission financial disclosure filing that she and her husband have investment accounts and other financial assets worth between $4 million and $11 million. That doesn’t include her three-story Victorian home in Cambridge, Mass., valued at nearly $2 million in 2015.

Warren reported no debts, and in 2017 also received nearly $400,000 in royalties for her book, This Fight Is Our Fight, her Senate financial disclosure showed.

Congressional rules prohibit members from accepting speaking honorariums and other types of outside income, but those with star power can supplement their $174,000 annual Congressional salary with hundreds of thousands of dollars from book royalties.

Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., a self-described socialist, made more than $880,000 in book royalties and advances in 2017, his Senate financial disclosure revealed. He also owns three homes: a house in Burlington, Vt., a Washington, D.C., townhouse, and a $575,000 vacation lake home in Vermont that his family bought with cash in 2016.

Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., in 2017 got a $325,000 advance for his book, United: Thoughts on Finding Common Ground and Advancing the Common Good . He also reported between $600,000 and $1.3 million in assets and no liabilities in his 2017 financial disclosure.

Booker’s, Warren’s, and Sanders’ book advances combined with their congressional salaries likely put them in the top 1 percent of income earners: A 2018 analysis of wages by the Economic Policy Institute found that a family needed an annual income of $421,926 in 2015 to be in the top 1 percent. The average income of the top 1 percent was $1.3 million.

Delaney and Hickenlooper, two long-shot candidates, are both self-made millionaires.

A February 2018 analysis of Delaney’s financial disclosure form put his net worth at $92.6 million, making him the 6th richest member of the 115th Congress. OpenSecrets.org estimated that his net worth was $233 million in 2015.

The former Maryland representative co-founded two financial companies, Health Care Financial Partners and CapitalSource, that provided loans to other businesses. Both were publicly traded, and Delaney was at one time the youngest CEO of a company traded on the New York Stock Exchange. He embraced capitalism and scorned socialism in a recent Fox News interview.

Hickenlooper became a millionaire by opening restaurants and breweries. While running for governor in 2010, Hickenlooper released 23 years of his tax returns, which that showed he had earned more than $16 million since 1985.

Despite being a successful entrepreneur, Hickenlooper hesitated to call himself a capitalist in a recent CBS interview.

“I think it’s kind of a silly question,” Hickenlooper said when asked if he is a capitalist or a socialist.

Former Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced a 2020 presidential bid but leads in early Democratic primary polls, wrote in his book Promise Me, Dad that President Barack Obama joked in 2008 about Biden's financial situation.

“That was one of the easiest vets in the world. You own nothing,” Biden reported Obama as saying. OpenSecrets.org estimated Biden’s net worth to be minus $947,987 in 2014.

Since leaving office, however, Biden has made a killing in speaking fees. For example, he got $200,000 last year from the Economic Club of Southwestern Michigan, the New York Times reported, and $150,000 for a January appearance at the Broward Center in Florida.

Biden and his wife in 2017 bought a $2.7 million vacation home in Rehoboth Beach, Del., shortly after they signed a multibook deal reportedly worth $8 million. He owns another home in Wilmington, Del., now worth about $1.9 million.

Campaigns and representatives for O’Rourke, Delaney, Harris, Booker, Sanders, Hickenlooper, and Biden did not respond to requests for comment.

Texto completo: We Americans are suckers for scaremongering. It seems that whenever there's a proposal to better the lives of those who don't benefit from things the way they are, but might upset the status quo for those who are currently comfortable, a huge campaign explodes complete with lies and half-truths to stop it in its tracks.
Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman pointed out recently how the Trump administration has briefly turned from demonizing brown people at the country's southern border to claiming that evil socialists are at the door to take over the country. The target is the progressive movement called the Green New Deal intended to combat, among other goals, the all-too-real dangers of climate change before it's too late.
Suddenly, these socialists are hankering to destroy American freedom while taking over government. The propaganda comes from all quarters. Farm organizations claim the Green New Deal is a "war" on cows. There will be no more meat, no hamburger joints, more farmers will go bankrupt all because the cows leak too much methane into the atmosphere.
Most recently we witnessed the campaign against the Affordable Care Act. The scaremongering was so unrelenting that Americans hated it before it was implemented but now that they've learned what the law really does, a majority wants it continued.
The scaremongerers know how to pull the right strings. They were able to defeat for decades the medical establishment when it warned that smoking causes cancer and other life-threatening disease, convincing a majority of Americans to be afraid of a government that wants to take your enjoyment away. Today they've been successful in convincing people, especially the Donald Trump crowd, to be afraid of regulators who alter your life with "unnecessary" regulations. Nothing wrong with a few chemicals in your water supply or pollutants in your air or coal waste in the stream that eventually empties into a lake that is a city's water supply. And climate change? Just like smoking, what's the harm?
Krugman, in his New York Times column, recalled that the proposal in 1961 to create a national health insurance program for senior citizens brought on a furious fearmongering campaign to seek to destroy it.
The American Medical Association launched what it called Operation Coffee Cup, in which doctors' wives (no doctors' husbands then, apparently) were asked to invite their friends over and play them a recording in which Ronald Reagan explained that socialized medicine would destroy American freedom. The wives were asked to write letters to congressmen. Insurance companies beat the drums and big-business interests predicted the end of America as we knew it.
A couple of years later the AMA's scheme fortunately failed and we wound up with socialized medicine at least for folks over 65 called Medicare. Try convincing the nation's elderly today that Medicare destroyed America. Social Security faced the same hurdles. Try telling its recipients that it's socialism run amok. Today the fearmongers are fighting crucial attempts to curb climate change, free tuition for college students and universal health care, claiming that it's socialism that will lead America to total economic chaos just like socialist Venezuela.
Krugman wonders why people like Trump, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, and other prominent Republicans lump American socialists, who are proud to wear that label and are now favored by a majority of young voters, with a country like Venezuela.
No one advocates seizing the means of production like the Venezuela government did. Why not focus instead on places like Denmark and Norway?
Today's young voters, explains Krugman, believe that if it's socialist to want to advocate controls on the excesses and unfairness of a market economy, then they're socialist.
"They want to us to look like Denmark or Norway, not Venezuela," Krugman points out. "And in case you haven't been there, the Nordic countries are not, in fact, hellholes."
OK, what about the slippery slope from liberalism to totalitarianism? the economist asks.
"There's absolutely no evidence that it exists. Medicare didn't destroy freedom. Stalinist Russia and Maoist China didn't evolve out of social democracies. Venezuela was a corrupt petrostate long before Hugo Chavez came along. If there's a road to serfdom, I can't think of any nation that took it," he added.
Bottom line? Scaremongering over socialism is silly and dishonest. Those who dwell in that dishonesty are on the wrong side of history. CREDIT: By Dave Zweifel ; Dave Zweifel is editor emeritus of The Capital Times. dzweifel@madison.com, 608-252-6410 and on Twitter @DaveZweifel.

Hal Boyd: On being a Latter-day Saint, born-again skeptic

Texto completo: Editor's note: A version of the following article was originally published by the Wheatley Institution at Brigham Young University.
On the contemporary college campus, believers exhibit their own brand of skepticism.
The academics I know tend to be thoughtful, well-meaning types who, on the whole, expand knowledge and aspire to foster a pluralistic vision of society. But, as New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof has observed, “the one kind of diversity that universities disregard is ideological and religious.”
He continues: “We’re fine with people who don’t look like us, as long as they think like us.”
Kristof points to University of North Texas sociologist George Yancey: “Outside of academia I faced more problems as a black. But inside academia I face more problems as a Christian, and it is not even close.” Yancey’s own research suggests that about half of “academics would be less willing to hire someone they find out was a conservative Protestant.”
Within the academy, religion is often viewed as an outdated relic. Sure, it may have once served as a helpful mythos. But, like Plato’s “noble lie,” it’s an illusion — or, in Karl Marx’s parlance, an opiate to sedate the suffering masses.
More generous critics say religion provides humans with Darwinian advantages. Evolutionary biologist Bret Weinstein, for example, contends that even though religion can be metaphorically true (that is, it can produce positive outcomes), it will still be “literally” false.
And yet, not everyone within the Ivory Tower imbibes these or other emerging secular dogmas. There’s skepticism, it seems, regarding the skeptics.
Take Elaine Pagels, a Princeton professor and the author of the new book “Why Religion?”
“My father gave up the kind of ferocious Calvinism of his family for Darwin,” she says in a recent interview discussing her book. “He basically said, well, religion is just a bunch of old folk tales, and we don’t need that. Educated people don’t need that. Only people who aren’t (educated) would ever bother with the Bible and all that stuff.”
Then something happened.
As a 15-year-old, Pagels attended a sermon by Billy Graham at Candlestick Park in San Francisco with a group of friends. While there, she felt something. She experienced something. Her “conversion” to evangelical Christianity lasted only a year. But her encounter with the numinous lingered.
It expanded her worldview beyond the strident Darwinism of her father. She began to doubt his doubts and discover the wisdom in Hamlet’s remark to Horatio: “There are more things in heaven and earth … than are dreamt of in your philosophy.”
Within today’s prevailing academic posture toward religion there’s an inherent assumption: bona fide believers are woefully wrong. And, by extension, bona fide believers must be ill-informed, ignorant or simply unintelligent.
This, perhaps, helps explain why some scholars express a bias regarding hiring conservative Christians. After all, aspiring academics must demonstrate intellectual acuity, a commitment to data and facts, critical thinking abilities, curiosity and an unrelenting scholarly skepticism.
But what if, as in the case of Pagels and others, the skepticism cuts the other way.
Pagels describes a conversation she had with noted poet Marie Howe. While discussing Howe’s poem “Annunciation” — in which Jesus’ mother, Mary, suddenly “senses a divine presence of overpowering love approaching her” — Pagels asked how she came to write it.
“Well you know, it happened to me. But, of course, I couldn’t say that,” Howe responded.
Such experiences, Pagels implies, may be more common than we imagine.
A predecessor of the French philosophes of the 18th century, Blaise Pascal was a child prodigy. By age 16 he had written his first influential work on geometry, and by 21 he had invented the Pascaline — what many consider to be the world’s first mechanical calculator.
And yet, perhaps more important to him were the events that took place in his life on the night of Nov. 23, 1654.
Sometime between 10:30 p.m. and midnight, Pascal had an ineffable experience, a personal theophany — a revelation. Though the specifics of his mystical moment remain unknown, Pascal recorded the following words: “Fire. God of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob not the God of the philosophers and of the learned ... Certitude. Certitude. Joy. Peace.”
Pascal closed his lines by quoting the biblical psalmist, “‘I will not forget thy words.’ Amen.”
He placed the parchment containing these words in his jacket lining, as if to put it closer to his heart.
In academia, skeptics are revered as shrewd truth-seekers. They stand in the grand tradition of scientists like Galileo, who was condemned to home confinement during an inquisition for his reasoned-based worldview. The orthodoxy of Galileo’s day refused to entertain the evidence.
What of the orthodoxy of our day? To paraphrase Pascal, there are many truths — the only real heresy is excluding some of them.

Red Sox are never too busy to keep track of Yankees, and other notes

Texto completo: OAKLAND, Calif. — Picked-up pieces from 10 days out west with the Red Sox . . .
■ While the Sox struggle out of the gate (2-5, in last in the AL East after Wednesday's 6-3 comeback victory), several key Yankees are returning from injuries or have gone down since the season started: Giancarlo Stanton, Miguel Andujar, Didi Gregorius, Aaron Hicks, Jacoby Ellsbury, Dellin Betances, CC Sabathia, Luis Severino, and Troy Tulowitzki. This has not gone unnoticed in the Boston clubhouse. The West Coast time zone allows the Sox to monitor their rivals back east. Almost daily, while the Sox are playing cards, listening to music, and getting ready to take batting practice, their clubhouse TVs are tuned into Yankee games vs. Baltimore or Detroit. Playing against the tanking Orioles and Tigers, the Yankees lost four of their first six.
■ New York's injury bug makes it a good year for the Sox to start slow, but that doesn't diminish the overreaction back home. A Globe reader e-mailed me and asked if the 2019 Red Sox might be the first team eliminated from contention before they have a chance to raise their championship banner. This is why we love the Boston baseball market.
■ The Red Sox can spin it any way they want, but there's got to be something wrong with Chris Sale. Two starts, 49 fastballs, zero swings and misses.
■ Just wondering, but did the 1950s and '60s Yankees shut down Whitey Ford every spring training back in the days when Ford pitched in the World Series every year? Or are the Red Sox the first to invent the reduced spring workload plan that's worked so well in the first week of the 2019 season?
■ The Kremlinesque erasure of Larry Lucchino from Red Sox history continues. Accompanied by a photo of John Henry and Tom Werner, the Red Sox press guide officially cites the duo's “18th season as stewards of the Red Sox franchise," even though Lucchino was running the team for the first three championships of Henry's ownership. Theo Epstein, who got his start in baseball with tremendous help from Lucchino, became the latest “Larry Who?" revisionist when he told the Globe's Peter Abraham, “It's fun to see the organization have success and what John, Tom, and Sam [Kennedy] have accomplished."
■ QUIZ: Name the two active big league pitchers who have won both the Cy Young and Rookie of the Year awards? (answer below)
■ Love the Oakland Coliseum, but it is indeed a dump. It's now the fifth-oldest ballpark in baseball (trailing Fenway, Wrigley, Dodger Stadium, and Angel Stadium, though the last was significantly renovated). Revisiting the place this week reminded me of an Earl Weaver dustup with umpire Rich Garcia in 1979. Weaver was tossed early in the game but never left the dugout, opting to manage from the dugout bathroom. Garcia went looking for Weaver and pounded on the bathroom door, only to hear Earl say, “There's no one in here." When Garcia said, “I know you're in there, Earl," Weaver hollered, “Yeah, your umpiring was so bad it made me throw up, so I came in here."
■ More Coliseum: The joint opened for baseball on April 17, 1968, when the Orioles defeated the A's, 4-1, on a Dave McNally two-hitter. Oakland's second hit was a ninth-inning pinch single by little-known middle infielder Tony La Russa. It was LaRussa's only big league hit that season. He retired with 35. “Shows you what a horse [expletive] player I was," says La Russa. “My claim to fame is that I got the first pinch hit in the history of this stadium." La Russa went on to Cooperstown as the third-winningest manager in baseball history.
■ I was saddened to hear that the Red Sox manager's office at Fenway has been relocated to a space safely distanced from the prying eyes of the media. Through the decades, it's been informing to see who was going in and out of the manager's office. That is all gone now as the space has been allocated to team video coordinator Billy Broadbent. When I texted Terry Francona with news of the death of his old office, the Tribe manager fired back with, “Lots of good [expletive] buried in there."
■ One of the problems with baseball's pace of play is the fact that most players do not think there is a problem. Here's Bryce Harper in ESPN The Magazine: “Pitch clocks and all that? If you don't want to come to a baseball game, don't come. We're not a timed sport." Swell. But who's going to pay your salary if bored fans heed your advice?
■ Book list: Make sure you pick up “K: A History of Baseball in Ten Pitches" by Tyler Kepner of the New York Times. Kepner, a former Globe intern, is the best baseball read in American newspapers today. While you're at it, find “One Base at a Time: How I Survived PTSD and Found My Field of Dreams," by Red Sox groundskeeping czar David Mellor.
■ Remember when “Who's going to be the closer?" was the big question around the Red Sox?
■ The Sox would like to have Dustin Pedroia at second base for the home opener on Tuesday.
■ How did I go this long without knowing that Alex Cora's dad was a sportswriter? Jose Manuel Cora covered Criollos de Caguas in winter ball for the San Juan Star.
■ My Opening Day in Seattle started with an e-mail from 80-year-old southpaw Jim Kaat, a guy who won 283 big league games in 25 seasons and still works as a baseball television analyst. Kaat's playing career put him up against Ted Williams (who was a rookie in 1939) and Julio Franco (who played until 2007). It's the baseball life's equal of Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, who met both Abraham Lincoln and Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
“Baseball's opening day is so much more significant than the opening days of other sports," wrote Kaat. “This is my 60th MLB opener. I remember my first like it was yesterday. Ike threw out the ceremonial first pitch. Teddy Ballgame drove a Camilo Pascual fastball through the winds over the center-field wall, 421 feet. Camilo struck out 15. Still an opening day record. Game was played in 2:20."
Naturally, everything checked out when I went to Baseball Reference's website. On April 18, 1960, the Washington Senators defeated the Red Sox, 10-1, in front of 28,327 at Griffith Stadium. Cuban curveballer Pascual fanned 15 in his complete-game win. President Dwight Eisenhower threw out the first pitch and Ted Williams hit a long homer to center in the second inning for the Sox' only run.
■ QUIZ ANSWER: Justin Verlander and Jacob deGrom.

Texto completo: Ruth Reichl helmed Gourmet during the last golden age of print magazines. As editor-in-chief from 1999 until 2009, she presided over the country's epicurean publication of note, wrapped in the gilded gauze of Condé Nast: There were drivers, lavish parties, clothing allowances, offices the size of penthouse apartments and decorating budgets to match. It was all a bit foreign to Reichl, who came of age cooking at a collective in Berkeley, Calif., and was later the most famous anonymous woman in New York as food critic of The New York Times. Make no mistake: Ruth Reichl is not Anna Wintour.
But when she left the Times for the Condé cocoon, she was able to push the envelope of food journalism, transforming Gourmet from safe and stuffy to daring and bold, challenging readers with provocative covers and envelope-pushing essays by the likes of the late David Foster Wallace (who memorably wrote about whether boiling lobsters feel pain). She was also able to eke out more time with her son, Nick, than she ever was while reviewing restaurants every night.
Then it all came tumbling down. The magazine folded with little notice; Reichl and her more than 60 employees were suddenly left without jobs. Reichl should have been used to transition, and surely she would rise again: In her long career, she was editor and food critic for the Los Angeles Times, food critic for The New York Times, and wrote several acclaimed books chronicling those adventures. But this stung: She revered the magazine — had since she was a little girl, growing up in Greenwich Village with an eccentric mother who fancied herself a gourmand but was often undercut by bipolar disorder, swinging from grand cooking and shopping sprees to a bedroom retreat.
“Save Me the Plums" is Reichl's account of those halcyon times at Condé Nast before the ax fell. Readers are introduced to characters fit for fiction, from the garlic-loathing publishing mogul Si Newhouse (“small, wizened, and dressed in an olive-drab sweatshirt") to Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter (“a superbly self-satisfied lion"). But this book isn't about the vipers and sages who decorated Condé Nast's rarified orbit; it's a study in magazine-making, earnest ambition, disappointment, and reinvention. It's also supremely readable: All of Reichl's books exude the sense that she's gathering up the reader in her pocket and taking them along for the ride. There is no arm's-length distance here.
Q. How did you envision your time at Gourmet ending? Had it not ended as it did, do you think you could've stayed there for life?
A. I knew I would get fired at some point. I always thought, “I'm just a visitor in this strange and wonderful land, and eventually I will get fired." So, I never envisioned that I would be there for the rest of my life. I did not envision it ending the way it did.
Q. You wrote about your son, Nick, who at that point had grown older. You're looking back, and you wrote something like, “If I had to do it all over again, I might have managed my time differently." What would you have done differently, and how did you balance spending time with him? What did that look like for you?
A. I would have spent more time with him. I just would. Nick is 30 now, and when you first have kids, you think it's the rest of your life. It's so all-encompassing. It doesn't occur to you that in the span of your life it's a blink of an eye . . . There's only about 15 years when they really want to spend a lot of time with you.
Q. I think you wrote, “Children need you around to be able to ignore you."
A. Well, they do. They do. And I just wish that I traveled less, that I had said “no" to more business dinners. Not that I wouldn't have spent every day in the magazine. I would have. But there are women who just leave at five o'clock, and everybody knows that that's what they're going to do, or six o'clock, or whatever. And I would be that person if I had to do it over again.
Q. Your mother plays a role in this book as well. Was there guilt, because in many ways you were living the life that she probably would have longed for?
A. Yes. Yes, I was living the life she would have loved. I don't feel guilty about that. First of all, she was mentally ill. So, she is not me. But I just feel enormously sorry for not only for her, but for the women of her generation who had so few choices. They really did. . . . I think your generation, having been brought up by women who had choices, have a better sense of how to balance it. I think for my generation, having looked at our mothers, I think we went so eagerly to the work side. And I think that for the generation after ours, having seen what it's like to be able to have a career and have motherhood, I think you probably have a better sense of balance.
Q. In that vein, how do you know that a transition is right? Managing a staff of that many people is a lot to carry on one's shoulders.
A. You never know. As a friend of mine said . . . When I was contemplating the Gourmet job and I said, “The time's not right. Maybe a year from now," and [she] said to me, “Ruth, it's never right. You have to take it when it comes."
Q. You had such reverence for Gourmet, especially the old Gourmet — not the one that you were stepping into, maybe, but the one of your childhood. Are there any current publications now that excite you the way Gourmet once did?
A. There are, and they're not all food publications. But among the food publications, I love Cherry Bombe, and I loved what Peter Meehan was doing with Lucky Peach . . . and I'm thrilled with the way mainstream publications are embracing food in new ways. The New Yorker, which did almost nothing on food now, regularly does food. And The Atlantic is doing regular food stuff. And I'm thrilled with the evolution of Eater. Who would have imagined that they would be doing interesting long-form essays and taking moral stands and getting really good writers? And online, Taste does a really good job. And you can go on and on and on. There's an awful lot of great stuff going on out there.
Q. There are people who cannot afford to be journalists in this day and age, but perhaps love to write about food but can't afford to take an unpaid internship or to get their foot in the door in some of the more traditional ways. What would you say to them?
A. OK. I actually don't weigh in about this very often, but I was living in a commune in Berkeley. We had no money . . . and we never went out to eat. We couldn't afford to go out to eat. But there was a throwaway paper called the East Bay Review of the Performing Arts, and I went to them and said, “Let me write restaurant reviews." And I wrote about little dives that I could afford to go to. I didn't write about any place that was fancy. But I wrote them for free, and I paid for the food myself. I would go once, and they weren't reviews exactly. They were just “I went here, and I like this."
I have an assistant who has very little money, works in a restaurant, and works part-time for me. But he writes about very cheap places in San Francisco. You can do it if you want to get clips. You can do it. You have to figure out ways to make your voice heard.
Q. Could you talk a bit about personal branding? When you were working at Gourmet, perhaps it got to be too much — the brand began to overtake Ruth the person. Do you think that in the world of chefs and in the world of food journalists, it's too easy to get caught up in branding? Do you see that as becoming more of a problem?
A. I have to say, the first time someone said, “You've got to become personal brand," I didn't know. I never heard of it before. It was so foreign to me. People aren't brands, and I do think people spend . . . I spend too much time doing Instagram and Twitter.
Q. You're a natural at Twitter.
A. And Twitter is fun. I didn't start that as a branding thing, but I just got on to Instagram and am doing it because you're supposed to. And I think that it's partly because we're still in the infancy of this media revolution. I think it will probably go away, and the truth is when push comes to shove, nothing can compete with the moving image and television, movies. People will start to do videos of themselves on Instagram. But ultimately that is the most compelling medium.
Q. For readers who might be going through a transition from a job in any industry: When suddenly the rug is pulled out from under you, how do you cope with that loss of professional identity? . . . Did you just go home and stare at the walls and think, “Who am I now?"
A. It wasn't a crisis of identity. It was a crisis of guilt. I felt really guilty that 65 people I really cared about lost their jobs. And I spent a long time thinking, “What could I have done to prevent this? Why didn't I see it coming?" I think you have to be as kind as you can to yourself in those moments and understand that you really have to go through a grieving process, and it is a grieving process. Those are the moments when you're incredibly grateful for your friends and your family. The idea that my four best friends from LA came out to be with me, it was huge for me that that happened. That they just showed up and said, “I'm helping you pack your office. You shouldn't do this by yourself," and then just gathered around me. And I think you need to do that. I think you need to let your friends and your family remind you that you're fine. You know that they still love you, and you will get through it.
Q. Some of the characters in the book almost read like fiction, even though they're not.
A. That was the great thing about Condé Nast. They were not bean counters. The company was helmed by Si Newhouse and James Truman and Steve Florio. You will never find three more colorful characters.
Q. Graydon Carter really does look like a lion.
A. It's really funny, because I didn't even realize that I did this, but my agent said, “You do realize that you characterize everyone as an animal?" And then I went through it and I realized, “Oh, my God. I really do that."

Texto completo: The series finale of "You're the Worst" is on FXX. And "Brockmire" is back for a third season on IFC.
What's on TV
YOU'RE THE WORST 10 p.m. on FXX. As do many comedies, this bawdy sitcom ends its final season with a marriage. Probably. In the previous season, Gretchen (Aya Cash), a publicist with clinical depression, ditched a riskless relationship and proposed to her more exciting (if uncongenial) writer love interest, Jimmy (Chris Geere). The lead-up to the wedding this season has been peppered with flash-forwards suggesting the two may not ultimately be bound in holy matrimony -- but as of now, the wedding is still on. In his review of the season for The New York Times, Mike Hale called the show "one of the most twisted, acidulous and sex-drenched" romantic comedies on TV, writing that Wednesday's finale "answers the questions and satisfies the emotions without short-selling the serious issues."
GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY (2014) 7:30 p.m. on FX. The '80s nostalgia pours out like stuffing from a ripped Cabbage Patch Kids doll in this witty Marvel space comedy. Chris Pratt stars as a charming galactic cowboy, alongside Zoe Saldana as an elite assassin and Vin Diesel and Bradley Cooper -- who do the voices of an animated tree-man and racoonish bounty hunter. The movie plainly shares some D.N.A. with the sci-fi parody GALAXY QUEST (1999), which is coincidentally showing at 8:30 p.m. and 10:45 p.m. on BBC America. That film stars Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver and Alan Rickman as members of a crew of actors from a canceled cult sci-fi series who are thrust into an actual space war. Lawrence Van Gelder wrote in The Times in 1999 that "Galaxy Quest" spoofs franchises like "Star Trek" while also managing to "replicate the very elements that have made them so durable." That applies to "Guardians of the Galaxy," too.
BROCKMIRE 10 p.m. on IFC. Spring training season is upon Jim Brockmire, the disgraced sports announcer played by Hank Azaria in this comedy series. The start of Season 3 has Brockmire gearing up for a big opportunity: taking over as an anchor for the Oakland Athletics. Anyone who saw where "Brockmire" began knows how big a jump that is. The first season started with Azaria's character having a career-breaking meltdown during a live broadcast, then cut forward years later, with Brockmire deciding to get back in the game. This season Brockmire is working alongside a new co-host, Gabby (Tawny Newsome), and delivering lines like "It is a beautiful spring afternoon for baseball here at King Venom Vape Cartridge Stadium."
What's Streaming
THE SHINING (1980) Stream on Hulu; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. In her review of Jordan Peele's "Us" for The Times, Manohla Dargis wrote that "The Shining" serves as Peele's "most obvious guiding star, narratively and visually." Peele's homages are of course just the latest flashes of this Stanley Kubrick horror film's enduring influence. It's the kind of movie where even the opening credits -- projected over snaking aerial shots of a yellow Volkswagen -- are distinctive.

Texto completo: OCONOMOWOC – Even though Jack Hamilton lived through the horrendous Chosin Reservoir battle of the Korean War, or maybe because he survived it, he still wants to read about it.
So when his daughter gave him a copy of "On Desperate Ground: The Marines at The Reservoir, the Korean War's Greatest Battle" for Christmas, he was eager to dive into it.
The 87-year-old Oconomowoc man was still reading the book when he got a call from Stars and Stripes Honor Flight. Hamilton is flying on the April 6 Honor Flight to Washington, D.C., from Milwaukee's airport, but he did not have a guardian.
That's when he learned his companion would be Hampton Sides, the New York Times bestselling writer whose book he was reading.
"I'm delighted. It's an honor for me — he's a well-known author," Hamilton said in a recent interview at his book-filled apartment.
Hamilton joined the Marine Reserves in 1949 for "free clothes and beer money" and was working at a lodge in the Grand Canyon when his mom phoned to tell him he was being called to active duty just days after the North Korean Army invaded South Korea. Within days, the 19-year-old Chicago native was on a train to Camp Pendleton for six weeks of training, then a ship to Japan, then a ship to Korea, arriving in September 1950 shortly after the Inchon landing.
Hamilton was assigned to the 1st Marine Regiment, "which turned out to be the luckiest thing of my life because they were a regular Marine unit, not reservists, and I was with well-trained guys," he said.
Had he been placed in the 7th Marine Regiment with many other reservists, Hamilton's chances of surviving would have dropped precipitously; the 7th Marines were involved in some of the fiercest fighting at the man-made lake known as the Chosin Reservoir. During the 17-day battle, United Nations troops of around 30,000 fought a Chinese army of 120,000. The second enemy for American soldiers and Marines was brutally cold weather.
Hamilton remembers being served Thanksgiving dinner in subzero conditions, noting that service members knew when they were heading into battle by the chow they were given.
"If they gave you steak and eggs for breakfast you know the afternoon wasn't going to be good," he joked.
Sides, author of the 2002 bestseller "Ghost Soldiers: The Epic Account of World War II's Greatest Rescue Mission" about the Bataan Death March, said the Chosin Reservoir battle was the turning point of the Korean War, the moment when China first entered the conflict and tried to spring a trap on the Marines on the steep shores of the frozen lake.
"The reason the Chosin Reservoir battle is so widely celebrated, studied and embraced by the Marine Corps is because it was a fighting withdrawal," said Sides. "It's one thing when you're dug in and defending yourself, but fighting while you're marching down a very narrow road is a complicated endeavor to pull off, and they did."
Hamilton's unit, B Company, 1st Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment, was ordered to hold mountains next to the reservoir. Despite the frigid temperatures, Hamilton was told not to zip up his sleeping bag because Marines in his battalion had been killed when they were ambushed at night in their bags.
Eventually, the Americans were given the order to fall back. Hamilton's unit was one of the last to leave, marching along one road, waiting for a bridge to be rebuilt, and ultimately walking 75 miles while eating frozen World War II C rations. Hamilton recalls chipping out beans to eat one by one, holding them on his tongue to warm them up before swallowing.
"Our mind-set? 'Keep moving.' I just wanted to get out of there," said Hamilton.
The Americans who survived the battle call themselves the Chosin Few and the Frozen Chosin.
"They're special," said Sides, who interviewed many Chosin veterans for his book, which was published last October. "They're mystified about why the war isn't better known, but they're resigned to it."
When Karyn Roelke of Stars and Stripes Honor Flight learned that Hamilton was a Chosin veteran who needed a guardian — many Honor Flight veterans travel with a family member or friend — she asked Adam Makos, author of the Korean War book "Devotion" who had appeared by Skype last month at a Stars and Stripes Honor Flight book club.
Makos was busy with appearances for a book tour and recommended his friend Sides, who is traveling to Milwaukee this week from his home in New Mexico.
"Because of our knowledge of the Chosin Reservoir, we thought it was important that somebody who understood it was with Jack" Hamilton, said Roelke.
Sides, who is now working on a book about Captain Cook, got the idea to write about the Chosin Reservoir battle when he met a Korean War veteran years ago at a book signing for "Ghost Soldiers."
"To be able to spend the whole day with one of these guys, it's going to be a great joy to see a smile on his face and share some laughs. And for him to realize in a visceral way that he is not forgotten and that his comrades who fought and died are not forgotten," said Sides.
When he returned home from Korea, Hamilton attended Drake College and became a human resources administrator. He was vice president of human resources for the Harley-Davidson Co. from 1979 to 1984, worked 10 years for Allis-Chalmers in Illinois and started a temporary services company before retiring in 1996. He has three children, four grandchildren, one great-grandchild and one on the way.
"I'm almost finished with the book. I already know the ending," Hamilton said, smiling.
Jack Hamilton, 87, fought in the Chosin Reservoir battle during the Korean War. The Oconomowoc man is traveling on a Stars and Stripes Honor Flight on April 6.

The rural economy requires new keys

Texto completo: Of all the places youd expect to see a fight between the cold, hard face of ag economics and the warm, tender heart of rural America, that place would not be the corner of West 41st Street and Eighth Avenue in New York City, the home of The New York Times.
And yet there it was in late March, two of the nations column-writing heavyweights slugging it out  as much as verb-slingers slug at all  on the worlds most prestigious opinion page.
Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman threw the first punch with a March 18 column titled Getting Real About Rural America. In it, he noted that rural Americas deepening economic woe is, in some cases, the result of powerful forces  that nobody knows how to reverse 
Krugman is being kind. He knows these powerful forces  like trade-centered farm bills, corporately integrated meat production, the unchallenged growth of the Farm Credit System  drive todays rural economy.
Without change, however, he sees continuing rural woe because, We cant help rural America without understanding that the role it used to play in our nation is being undermined by powerful economic forces that nobody knows how to stop.
In fact, most ag leaders have little interest in stopping any of these forces even if they could. The reason is as old as they are: When commodity prices are good, Big Ag wins big; when commodity prices are poor, Big Ag still wins, just not as big.
Twitter exploded in rage over Krugmans analysis; he was called every barnyard name there is and was urged, impolitely, not to fret (or write) about the future of rural America again.
Three days later, another Times columnist, David Brooks, wrote a rebuttal to Krugmans dark portrait. Its premise was in its warm title, What Rural America Has to Teach Us.
Everybody says rural America is collapsing, began Brooks. But I keep going to places with more moral coherence and social commitment than we have in booming urban areas. Theses visits prompt the same question: How can we spread the civic mind-set they have in abundance?
Brooks cited several examples of this mind-set he encountered during a recent visit to McCook and Grand Island, Neb., where nearly everyone is working at something, people leave their homes and cars unlocked, and crime is low.
The rosy portrait fueled Twitter acclaim for Brooks and, unlike Krugman, hes welcome to come back and write about rural America anytime.
Overall, however, Times readers reactions were just the opposite. Of the 1,867 written comments the newspaper received on Krugmans column, most offered personal facts to confirm his view that rural America is now a tough place to find jobs, health care, education, and, in the end, any kind of a prosperous future.
Surprisingly, many of Brooks 1,473 commenters cited the same hard facts in their responses. Hundreds of city-dwelling rural refugees noted that Brooks was right about rural neighborliness and civic engagement. But, they added, he never mentioned that rural America is pockmarked with dissolving or merging school districts, shrinking medical choices and closing hospitals, few high-paying jobs, and an opioid epidemic.
More fascinating to me, both a rural dweller and New York Times subscriber, is that while rural America was debating the two New York Times opinion pieces, the Trump administration was pushing deep budget cuts to almost every federal program that rural America has grown increasingly dependent upon  like food aid, Medicare, Medicaid, and crop insurance.
Indeed, on March 11, the White House proposed to slash the U.S. Department of Agricultures 2020 budget by 15 percent. Various farm policy leaders allied to the White House immediately dismissed the proposal. Dont worry, they explained, the White House isnt serious.
Not serious? Why then waste taxpayer money writing, printing, and distributing what is, essentially, a joke?
The most logical answer is that its not a joke; the budget proposal is clear indication what the White House would do to rural programs if it had the constitutional authority to do so.
That overreach should worry rural Americans a great deal more than whether or not we leave our homes and cars unlocked.

Texto completo: Attorneys general from California and other liberal states - many of which already ban payday loans - sent a nasty letter to Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Director Kathleen Kraninger last week opposing her proposal to relax the Obama-era rules that would severely restrict the availability of payday, vehicle title, and other small-dollar loans.
The liberal AGs promised to sue the CFPB over the issue, and they might even find a sympathetic judge who will find that Obama administration executive actions cannot be reversed by Trump appointees. But that would be an unfortunate outcome for millions of Americans who rely on small-dollar loans as a necessary last resort - and who would end up suffering serious consequences if the Obama rules came into effect.
Obama-appointed CFPB Director Richard Cordray, a protege of Elizabeth Warren, was still on the job in 2017 when the agency issued rules requiring mandatory underwriting for small dollar loans. Underwriting is the process of looking at a borrower's overall financial obligations and ability to repay a loan. Mandatory underwriting for typical payday and other short-term loans would present an enormous administrative burden, add lengthy delays to products that are often used in urgent, emergency circumstances, and create a significant barrier for many borrowers when they lack any other options.
Small dollar lenders are heavily regulated in the states and there are also a dozen federal laws in place and ongoing CFPB oversight. The Cordray rule is a solution in search of a problem that would have serious negative consequences for the millions of Americans who find their last resort for credit eliminated.
The Democratic AGs are backed by the usual constellation of liberal community organizers and advocacy groups - led by the so-called Center for Responsible Lending, which was founded by Martin Eakes, the inventor of subprime mortgages - and funded by Herb Sandler, whose negative amortization "Pick-a-Pay" home loans were called the "Typhoid Mary of the housing crisis" by the New York Times. Sandler sold his bank to Wachovia for billions before the loans collapsed and blew up Wachovia. Only in the upside-down world of consumer finance advocacy could these people portray themselves as the good guys.
U.S. Bank announced with much fanfare an alternative to payday loans, but its product ended up being priced similarly to the payday industry standard $15 per $100 borrowed - in fact, exactly that amount for manual payments and $12 for automated withdrawals.
If somebody could meet the needs of high-risk, low-dollar borrowers inexpensively, they would. But it's a tough business and making regulatory burdens even more draconian could cause it to collapse. Over 50,000 jobs could be lost as up to 90 percent of storefront financial service centers would become unprofitable if the Obama/Cordray rule takes effect. And that means desperate consumers who currently turn to low dollar loans as a last resort would face even worse circumstances - potentially turning to criminal lending syndicates or facing evictions and utility shutoffs.
The bottom line: Director Kraninger is doing her job - protecting consumers - and should stay the course no matter how viciously liberal activists and politicians attack her.

Texto completo: Canadians, known for their niceness, lived up to their reputation in the wake of 9/11.
"Come From Away," the next Broadway musical to land in Appleton, takes its inspiration from the real-life situation that unfolded in a small Newfoundland town.
In the hours after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, thousands of airline passengers were forced to land, sometimes far away from their destination. In one such instance, a group of nearly 7,000 people were taken in by the town of Gander, creating a situation where cultures clashed and initial uneasiness eventually turned into friendship and understanding.
That's the story of "Come From Away." The musical begins a six-day, eight-show run at the Fox Cities Performing Arts Center in downtown Appleton Tuesday.
It opened on Broadway in March 2017 and was nominated for seven Tony Awards and won Outstanding Musical at the Drama Desk Awards. It's the creation of the Canadian husband-and-wife duo of Irene Sankoff and David Hein. Sankoff and Hein visited Gander for the 10th anniversary of 9/11 and interviewed hundreds of people before crafting the story.
"Even the most stalwart cynics may have trouble staying dry-eyed during this portrait of heroic hospitality under extraordinary pressure," wrote New York Times critic Ben Brantley after its Broadway debut. He also called it a "big bearhug of a musical."
Although set in days after 9/11, it's a story that has strong connections to current events. You don't have to be a news junkie to pick up on themes of helping out neighbors in need and learning to find common ground with people of different backgrounds.
"I think ("Come From Away") is a really heart-lifting story," Fox Cities PAC president Maria Van Laanen said when the engagement was announced, "and I think a really important story of this time, of how we all connect and how important it is to connect with our similarities, despite all our differences."
"Come From Away" is making its Wisconsin premiere and is the final musical of the Fox Cities PAC's 2018-19 Broadway season. It's directed by Christopher Ashley, who won a Tony Award for his work and who also is at the helm of the Jimmy Buffett jukebox musical "Escape to Margaritaville," which visits the PAC next year. Ashley was in New York City during 9/11 and was drawn to "Come From Away" after reading an early draft of the script.
"'Come From Away' has an enduring power and poignancy," he has said of the show, "not only wonderful storytelling with a fabulous score, it dramatizes our capacity for generosity to strangers even at moments of great adversity — a great message for any time, but especially in our current political climate."

The Violence of Prison: A Rare, and Troubling, Look Behind the Walls

Texto completo: The contraband is scary enough: Homemade knives with grips whittled to fit particular hands. Homemade machetes. And homemade armor, with books and magazines for padding.
Then there is the blood: In puddles. In toilets. Scrawled on the wall in desperate messages. Bloody scalps, bloody footprints, blood streaming down a cheek like tears.
And the dead: a man kneeling like a supplicant, hands bound behind his back with white fabric strips and black laces. Another, hanging from a twisted sheet in the dark, virtually naked, illuminated by a flashlight beam.
These were ugly scenes from inside an American prison, apparently taken as official documentation of violence and rule violations.
Prisons are the black boxes of our society. With their vast complexes and razor wire barriers, everyone knows where they are, but few know what goes on inside. Prisoner communication is sharply curtailed -- it is monitored, censored and costly. Visitation rules are strict. Office inspections are often announced in advance.
So when prisoners go on hunger strikes or work strikes, or engage in deadly riots, the public rarely understands exactly why. How could they? Many people harbor a vague belief that whatever treatment prisoners get, they surely must deserve. It is a view perpetuated by a lack of detail.
But some weeks ago, The New York Times received more than 2,000 photographs that evidence suggests were taken inside the St. Clair Correctional Facility in Alabama. Some show inmates as they are being treated in a cramped, cluttered examination room. Others are clinical: frontal portraits, close-ups of wounds.
It is hard to imagine a cache of images less suitable for publication -- they are full of nudity, indignity and gore. It is also hard to imagine photographs that cry out more insistently to be seen.
As I scrolled through them, shock rose from my gut to my sternum. Was I looking at a prison, or a 19th-century battlefield? Those pictured betrayed little emotion and certainly none of the bravado broadcast by their tattoos: South Side Hot Boy, Something Serious, $ elfmade.
After considering the inmates' privacy, audience sensibilities and our inability to provide more context for the specific incidents depicted, The Times determined that few of these photos could be published. But they could be described.
St. Clair is known to be a deeply troubled institution in a state with an overcrowded, understaffed, antiquated prison system. Alabama has one of the country's highest incarceration rates and, as measured by the most recent counts of homicides available, its deadliest prisons, according to a report by the Equal Justice Initiative, a nonprofit civil rights organization in Birmingham. Suicide is epidemic as well -- there have been 15 in the past 15 months.
For years there have been complaints that St. Clair inmates are heavily armed -- some for self-protection -- and allowed to move freely about the compound. In fact, St. Clair is more deadly now than it was in 2014, when the Equal Justice Initiative brought suit against it for failing to protect prisoners. There have been four stabbing deaths there in seven months.
Last June, the group said the prison was failing to comply with a settlement agreement.
Prison officials dispute that, saying the Alabama Department of Corrections is committed to improving safety and security. The department has requested money to raise salaries and increase the number of officers. Multiple law enforcement agencies recently teamed up to conduct a contraband search at St. Clair that recovered 167 makeshift weapons, said Bob Horton, a department spokesman.
But as of October, the prison was still severely short staffed, with more vacancies than actual officers.
A second lawsuit, brought by the Southern Poverty Law Center, a legal advocacy group in Montgomery, says the prisons have failed to provide adequate mental health care. (The photos show a message painted on the wall in blood, with letters about the height of a cinder block. "I ask everyone for help," it read in part. "Mental Health won't help.")
The photos were given to The Times by the S.P.L.C., which said it had received them on a thumb drive.
Bob Horton, a spokesman for the corrections department, said the department could not authenticate the photos.
But Maria Morris, a staff lawyer at the S.P.L.C., said the environment shown looked like St. Clair, and some photos had identifying information that corresponded to known inmates or showed men that the S.P.L.C. recognized as its clients (S.P.L.C. removed the identifying information before giving the images to The Times).
The man who painted the blood on the wall, referred to in the lawsuit as M.P., had schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and repeatedly tried to kill himself. He testified that he had been held in solitary confinement for six years, allowed to exercise one hour a day in ankle shackles.
Ms. Morris has specialized in prisoner's rights litigation for more than a decade. She hears accounts of rape, beating or stabbing on a daily basis. I asked what it was like for her to see the photographs.
They made it impossible, she explained, to retreat into that small, self-protective corner of her mind -- the place where it was possible to imagine that her clients' stories might not be as bad as they sounded.
"Seeing what had been done to those people's bodies -- it just stripped away all of the numbing," she said. "It was very painful to see that all of the suffering that I've been hearing about and trying to relate to the court -- how deep it goes."
The thumb drive included a document titled "READ ME FIRST" and claiming to be from a corrections officer. It said the photos represented only a "small portion of the injuries from inmate-on-inmate violence in the past three years."
The writer said that the current legal agreements governing the prison stood no chance of working: "The day-to-day treatment of these men does nothing but foster anger and despair. Until major fundamental changes take place in our sentencing and housing of these men it will only continue to get worse. I can't help but wonder if the public knows just how bad these men are treated day after day and year after year."
The photos show dozens of wounded men. One had been stabbed at least 10 times. Another had a hole in his lip you could stick a pencil through. A pair of handcuffed wrists displayed 15 precise slashes. There was a recurring palette of pale red and sickly, Mercurochrome yellow. One man's back had a shiv at least an inch wide still buried in it, right between the shoulder blades.
There were three individuals pictured in a folder called "Dead men" and seven in a folder called "Murders," all of whom could be identified through news reports, press releases and booking photographs.
But most disturbing were the images that seemed to echo the most painful aspects of African-American history.
Many convincing arguments have been made that our penal system was at least partly designed to extend control of black people and their labor, particularly in the South, where after slavery ended black men were conscripted into chain gangs for offenses like vagrancy and "selling cotton after sunset."
Amid the St. Clair pictures were 19 taken of a black man who was completely naked but for a pair of handcuffs, photographed from the front, back, left and right. In one frame two white officers, standing guard inches away from him, avert their eyes.
Another image brought to mind the photos of the monstrously disfigured face of Emmett Till, the teenage victim of a 1955 lynching in Mississippi, which galvanized the civil rights movement when they were published by Jet magazine.
Though separated by more than half a century and by a wide gulf in circumstances, the St. Clair photos showed another mutilated, African-American face, this time belonging to Emory Cook, a 54-year-old prisoner killed in a cell three years ago. Under Alabama's harsh version of a three-strikes law, Mr. Cook had been serving a life sentence for third-degree burglary.
As a prisoner, he was entitled to be protected from harm. He looked like he had been hit with a plank.
Photograph Some 2,000 photographs given to The Times are said to be from the St. Clair Correctional Facility in Alabama. Some show homemade weapons; others show their destruction. An inmate who wrote on the walls in blood was said to be mentally ill and had testified that he had been held in solitary confinement for six years.

Texto completo: SACRAMENTO – In his interminably long, but moving Atlantic essay documenting our nation’s undeniable history of discrimination against African-Americans, author Ta-Nehisi Coates got to the heart of his pro-reparations argument on page 51: “What I’m talking about is more than recompense for past injustices – more than handout, a payoff, hush money, or a reluctant bribe.” Instead, he called for a “national reckoning” about this stain on America’s history.
I’ve got nothing against having such a conversation, especially at a time when white nationalists are rearing their ugly heads once again. Americans do need to understand that such discrimination didn’t just vanish in the distant past – and that everything wasn’t made right by the Civil War and the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Vast inequalities, injustices and prejudices remain, which are easily documented through a variety of economic and other measures.
But approving tens of billions of dollars or more in payouts will indeed be viewed as bribes and far worse, which will only make the national reckoning Coates seeks that much harder to achieve. In fact, his argument reminds me of that old quip: When someone says that something’s not about the money, you can be sure it really is about the money. Nothing shuts down a dialogue more than a fight about who gets their share of a large stack of other people’s cash.
Coates is wrong for another big reason, too. Reparations are not supposed to be about redemption, reckonings or reconciliation. We can try those things – and address glaring problems, such as inequities in our nation’s criminal-justice system – without running up another year’s worth of public debt. The only possible rationale for paying reparations is to help African-Americans close the financial gap they have with other Americans. Yet the idea fails on those terms, as well.
Advocates for this proposal are far less persuasive at explaining how reparations would permanently level the playing field than they are at detailing some of the ugliest parts of our nation’s history. These folks rarely even tout a specific policy (What type of payment? Who is eligible? How much?). For instance, the New York Times’ conservative-leaning columnist David Brooks this month announced that he now embraces Coates’ position. Brooks’ column is eloquent, but his arguments are ephemeral.
“We’re a nation coming apart at the seams,” Brooks wrote. “The African-American experience is somehow at the core of this fragmentation – the original sin that hardens the heart, separates Americans from one another and serves as model and fuel for other injustices.” He agrees that “reparations are a drastic policy and hard to execute” but argues that “the very act of talking about and designing them heals a wound and opens a new story.”
That’s as close as Brooks gets to substance. Even his premise – that talking about payouts will help heal this long-festering wound – is way off base. How often do drastic public policies lead to amelioration rather than another round of vicious cultural battles? How naïve can a columnist be to champion such a controversial idea without exploring how it might play out?
Most reparations proposals range from creating new social programs to giving out bonds to newborn African-Americans to providing direct cash handouts to each adult African-American. It’s not hard to predict the political battles and ugly social-media flurry that would follow. The first idea would not satisfy those who demand redress – and the other two ideas will tear the nation asunder.
Officials will engage in bean-counting to determine who is eligible for payments. How many drops of blood prove a person’s compensable lineage? Suddenly, everyone will unearth some African heritage. Do recent immigrants from Africa qualify? Imagine the lawsuits over DNA, the bitter feelings, the anger that racists will exploit. How likely will this solve anything rather than become a starting point for escalating demands? We know how things work in America.
Other hyphenated Americans will lobby for their share of public money, too, given the demonstrable discrimination against members of their group. White Americans whose families arrived after the segregation era will wonder why they must pay for the sins of other people’s ancestors. Instead of solving problems, everyone will fight over money. It will end up only being about the money. This is not how to help a nation reckon with its past.
As National Review’s Kevin Williamson noted, reparations are embraced by Democratic presidential campaigns, which means it will instantly become a partisan issue. Forbes columnist Kyle Smith adds that people who receive windfalls (e.g., winning the lottery) have no better long-term financial prospects than those who never hit the jackpot. If the goal is to close a financial gap, then this won’t do it.
Sure, let’s have a debate, a reckoning or whatever that sparks change in some public policies. But it’s hard to believe that smart people such as Coates and Brooks don’t understand the tinderbox that their idea would ignite.

A rough journey led Jenny Lewis to new album, Chicago-bound tour -BYLN- By David Bauder Associated Press

Texto completo: A rough journey led Jenny Lewis to new album, Chicago-bound tour Life hasn’t been easy for singer Jenny Lewis since the sunnier days when she performed in support of a 2014 album while wearing a rainbow-hued pantsuit and carrying a guitar with similar bright colors.
Her mother died, and a 12-year relationship ended, sending Lewis on a cross-country journey in search of herself. Finally, with a new album finished and released, she’s had to deal with the uncomfortable story of occasional collaborator Ryan Adams’ alleged mistreatment of women.
Spending much of the upcoming year on tour — including a Saturday, March 30, show at Chicago’s Riviera Theatre — may seem like a relief.
The up-tempo songs "Red Bull & Hennessy" and "Heads Gonna Roll" from her "On the Line" album, with Lewis’ unerring sense of tunefulness, will get the initial attention. But the work’s emotional core emerges in quieter, more introspective material like "Dogwood," "Rabbit Hole" and "Taffy." Those are the songs that will stick.
Much of the material was written in stolen moments on borrowed pianos, in friends’ apartments and hotel lobbies, where she had to keep quiet to avoid making a disturbance.
"I don’t think of this record as being a breakup record," she said. "It’s more of a rebound record. It’s kind of the space in between."
The southern California native relied on a network of friends during her post-breakup travels, staying in musician St. Vincent’s New York apartment, for example. She and two friends formed a band and wrote songs in a Manhattan storefront, where pedestrians mistook them for an art installation. She spent time in Nashville and Minnesota.
Even when she returned to California, Lewis used Airbnb to explore different parts of Los Angeles.
"I ran away," the 43-year-old said. "I really just got back here a couple of months ago. It was a three-year adventure."
How much of an adventure? It’s hard not to notice all the references to alcohol and other substances sprinkled throughout the album’s lyrics. There’s Hennessy, of course. Grenadine. Bourbon. Beaujolais. Red wine (unspecific). Amphetamines. Paxil. A bong. Part of it is a good writer’s attention to detail, but still ...
"It’s relevant," she said.
A former child actress who turned to music and was a member of the group Rilo Kiley before going solo, Lewis has a wide circle of friends and admirers in the business.
None of that could have prepared her for the surreal experience she had at Los Angeles’ Capitol studio while making "On the Line," however.
Lewis played on the piano that Carole King used to make "Tapestry," which is intimidating enough. Her band included former Tom Petty keyboard player Benmont Tench, record executive and bassist Don Was and the drum duo of Ringo Starr and Jim Keltner.
"That’s one of my favorite moments in my whole life," she said. "Standing in the control room and watching Ringo and Jim play together, I was mesmerized. Of course I am thrilled, honored. Shocked, really. I kept thinking, ‘Is someone doing somebody a favor here?’" She believes it was Was who called in Starr. "I don’t know exactly," she said. "He was just there with his drums."
Beck and Adams were two other big names who helped out. Adams, who produced Lewis’ 2014 album "Voyager," produced some of the new music, too.
The association with Adams became noteworthy when The New York Times reported that he allegedly pursued younger female artists for sex and sometimes became verbally and emotionally abusive when turned down. Adams has denied the accusations.
Lewis was not included in the Times’ story, and her interview with The Associated Press took place before the story was published. She declined a follow-up request to talk about it, and tweeted a statement: "I am deeply troubled by Ryan Adams’ alleged behavior. Although he and I had a working professional relationship, I stand in solidarity with the women who have come forward."
Lewis subsequently held an online album-release party that doubled as a benefit for the Los Angeles Women’s Center, and it raised more than $10,000.
For Adams, the fallout has been swift: a canceled concert tour, an album release put on hold. Could the controversy hurt Lewis by association?
Jason Lipshutz, senior director of music for Billboard magazine, said it might have been an issue if Lewis had publicly defended him or been part of the Times’ story. The women’s center benefit was a smart strategic move, he said.
"I do think that it is something that people are going to be able to separate from her music," Lipshutz said.

Resumen: The "10 Things I Hate About You" cast and producers recall Heath Ledger's audition and charisma, 20 years after the movie's premiere.

Texto completo: The 1999 movie "10 Things I Hate About You" was a lot of things: a Shakespearean story, a quotable romance and, most importantly, a star-making showcase for heartthrob Heath Ledger.
Twenty years since the beloved rom-com was in theaters (it debuted on March 31, 1999), it's impossible to think of "10 Things" without picturing the late Ledger's devilish smirk, his serenade from the bleachers, his carelessness with a Bunsen burner and his suaveness in a suit.
More than 11 years since Ledger's untimely death, "10 Things" producers and castmates remembered the star in an interview with The New York Times.
They recalled how he nailed his audition, despite the fact that he thought he bombed it.
Script co-writer Kirsten Smith said that he wore a rumpled white suit and black button-down shirt and rocked it. "He was really dressed up, very John Travolta 'Saturday Night Fever. ' (He was) way more dressed up than anyone else," she said.
Director Gil Junger said, "There was an energy to him, a sexuality that was palpable. When Heath was done, literally, with the first page, I said, 'OK, you can put down the script. You’re doing great. I want to do a little improv with you. ”
After a quick audition with some improv, "I turned to the women in the room and said, 'Ladies, I have never wanted to sleep with a man, but if I had to sleep with a man, that would be the man. Please cast him immediately. ' "
They remembered it was Ledger who picked the song for an iconic scene.
According to script co-writer Karen McCullah, it was Ledger who decided that his character should pick Frankie Valli's "Can't Take My Eyes Off of You" during Kat's soccer practice.
In the scene, with Ledger running away from guards, "the nurse on (duty) was fearful (that a guard) might have pushed himself almost to a heart attack," he said. "Heath was running with such joy that it physically exhausted the guards. "
Other actors talked about Ledger's loveliness as a human being.
Gabrielle Union, who played popular girl Bianca's buddy, Chastity, said, "Heath had the ability to look at you and (make) you feel like Princess Diana. In a very crowded Hollywood landscape, he could make you feel special and seen. That’s a pretty special gift, and I don’t think it’s talked about enough. "

Without Mueller-report smoking gun, Democrats may have ensured Trump’s re-election

Texto completo: When, on May 17, 2017, the Justice Department named former FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III as special counsel to oversee the investigation into the Trump campaign and possible collusion with the Russians, The New York Times virtually hailed it as a triumph of democracy. Mueller was described in the most glowing of terms with words like “unblemished,” “credible,” “exacting,” and as a man “who is credited with building the modern FBI. ”
To listen to Democrats, Mueller’s appointment was the beginning of the end of the Trump presidential nightmare. MSNBC’s Joy Reid even envisioned a scenario where Trump would be led from the White House by federal marshals. This set the tone for how Mueller’s investigation would be characterized until it ended on Friday. Indeed, as recently as last week CBS News labeled Mueller a “folk hero. ”
For more than 675 days, we have been subjected to a steady drip of leaks, endless Russia collusion coverage and the suggestion that Trump was the Manchurian — ur, I mean, the Russian — candidate who was sent to assassinate American democracy as we know it. Whenever there was no news on the Mueller front, we could always expect Stormy Daniels to be given extensive coverage. Mueller’s investigation into Trump’s alleged wrongdoing would be the long-awaited answer to Hillary Clinton’s book, "What Happened. "
Read more commentary:
No more indictments from Robert Mueller, but Russia is a habit Trump won't break in 2020
Take Trump impeachment off the table. Voters can decide in 2020.
Skimpy Barr letter sets up constitutional battle royal to force full Mueller report release
Only it wasn’t.
Or, more precisely, it was; it just wasn’t the answer Democrats wanted — or should I say, it wasn’t the answer Democrats needed? On the same day that Mueller was appointed special counsel, Trump issued this: “As I have stated many times, a thorough investigation will confirm what we already know — there was no collusion between my campaign and any foreign entity. ”
Attorney General William Barr’s summary of the Mueller report indicates this is precisely what happened, which is highly problematic for Democrats. Having put their proverbial eggs in the Russia collusion basket, the Mueller report is an anticlimactic ending to an epic buildup. Indeed, I feel like I have been binge-watching "Lost" only to discover that the island isn’t real, and that the numbers don’t mean a thing.
Mueller's integrity comes back to bite
Of course, Democrats did themselves in by making the a priori assumption that Trump was guilty of collusion and/or obstruction of justice, and that Mueller would ferret it out. Whatever his personal feelings for Mueller, it is to Trump’s good fortune that Mueller was the man conducting the investigation. Had it been a man deemed friendly to the Trump campaign, we would now be hearing howls of protest that the whole thing was an inside job.
And this is where it gets uncomfortable for Democrats. Because they have continually endorsed Mueller as the font of integrity ruthlessly searching for the truth, it now becomes more than a little awkward to condemn the results of his investigation. What do they do now?
For the moment, Democrats appear to have a two-pronged strategy:
First, launch yet another Trump investigation. “The Mueller report is one document,” declared Rep. Gerald Connolly of Virginia. “It is not, however, the final word on ongoing investigations, criminal or otherwise. ” Reps. Maxine Waters of California and Eliot Engel of New York remain equally defiant.
Second, they are attacking Attorney General Barr for not releasing the full report. This enables them to continue doing what they have done throughout the Mueller investigation: Hint that the Trump campaign did indeed do something sinister, but it just hasn’t been revealed to the public. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler is, for instance, already suggesting a “cover-up. ”
Both strategies are inherently risky.
Defense strategies could crack wide open
In the first instance, Democrats run the risk of giving Trump victim status by appearing to be on a witch hunt. If Mueller found nothing on this president after more than $25 million, two years of investigation and 34 indictments, the public may deem that enough.
In the second instance, the strategy can work only so long as the attorney general does not release the report or, if he does, it is found to contain the hoped-for smoking gun. If, however, Barr releases the report — a prospect Trump says “wouldn’t bother me at all” — and his summary proves to be accurate enough, this strategy fails, too.
What then? Would Democrats turn on Mueller and his investigation? Cracks in that dam are already appearing.
Writing for New York magazine, Eric Levitz is calling the Mueller report a “dud. ” Continuing, he says with palpable disappointment that Mueller “took a narrow interpretation of his mandate,” “failed to prove” the allegations against Trump, “and refused to draw any conclusion about the most mundane and plausible (allegations). ”
Democrats must have been getting indications that the Mueller report was not going to provide them proof of Trump offenses meeting the “high crimes and misdemeanors” standard for impeachment. As if to appear magnanimous, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi began backing away from the idea weeks ago.
With the nuclear option off the table for now at least, Democrats are suddenly on the defensive and their strategy appears to be as cracked as the Liberty Bell. For them, the order of the day is damage control. Just how deep the damage runs remains to be seen.
They might have unwittingly ensured Trump’s re-election.

Texto completo: Boeing faced an unthinkable defection in the spring of 2011. American Airlines, an exclusive Boeing customer for more than a decade, was ready to place an order for hundreds of new, fuel-efficient jets from the world's other major aircraft manufacturer, Airbus.
The chief executive of American called Boeing's leader, W. James McNerney, to say a deal was close. If Boeing wanted the business, it would need to move aggressively, the airline executive, Gerard Arpey, told McNerney.
To win over American, Boeing ditched the idea of developing a new passenger plane, which would take a decade. Instead, it decided to update its workhorse 737, promising the plane would be done in six years.
The 737 Max was born roughly three months later.
The competitive pressure to build the jet - which permeated the entire design and development - now threatens the reputation and profits of Boeing, after two deadly crashes of the 737 Max in less than five months. Prosecutors and regulators are investigating whether the effort to design, produce and certify the Max was rushed, leading Boeing to miss crucial safety risks and to underplay the need for pilot training.
While investigators are still trying to determine the cause of the crash in Ethiopia this month and one in Indonesia in October, they are focused on a newly installed piece of software designed to avoid stalls. The software was meant to compensate for bigger, more fuel-efficient engines and ensure the plane flew the same way as an earlier version.
Months behind Airbus, Boeing had to play catch-up. The pace of the work on the 737 Max was frenetic, according to current and former employees who spoke with The New York Times. Some spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.
Engineers were pushed to submit technical drawings and designs at roughly double the normal pace, former employees said. Facing tight deadlines and strict budgets, managers quickly pulled workers from other departments when someone left the Max project. Although the project had been hectic, current and former employees said they had finished it feeling confident in the safety of the plane.
The specter of Boeing's chief rival was constant. Airbus had been delivering more jets than Boeing for several years. And losing the American account would have been gutting, costing the manufacturer billions in lost sales and potentially thousands of jobs.
"They weren't going to stand by and let Airbus steal market share," said Mike Renzelmann, an engineer who retired in 2016 from Boeing's flight control team on the 737 Max.
Dismissing a rival
Boeing didn't seem bothered at first by the A320neo, the fuel-efficient plane that Airbus announced in 2010.
At a meeting in January 2011, James F. Albaugh, the chief executive of Boeing's commercial airplanes division, told employees that Airbus would probably go over budget creating a plane that carriers didn't really want, according to a recording of the meeting reviewed by The Times.
Albaugh boasted that carriers were already paying more for Boeing's single-aisle jet than the Airbus version. He didn't see the need to strike now - Boeing could wait until the end of the decade to produce a new plane from scratch, the executive said.
For decades, Airbus was barely on Boeing's radar. A consortium started in 1970 by several European countries, it was slow to compete globally. Boeing, founded in 1916, dominated the passenger-jet market with its 737 midsize jet and the 747 jumbo jet.
Then came John Leahy, an American who rose through the ranks to become the chief Airbus salesman in 1994. Leahy was relentless. Once, the chief executive of an airline got sick just as a deal was about to close. Leahy traveled to the man's house, and the executive signed the papers while wearing his bathrobe.
"Boeing thought we were a flash in the pan," Leahy said. "But I thought there was no reason we couldn't have 50 percent of the market."
Leahy scored a major coup in 1999 when JetBlue decided to launch with a fleet composed entirely of Airbus A320s. In the years that followed, more low-cost carriers around the world, like easyjet, placed big orders, too.
Airbus had pulled ahead of Boeing by 2005. "Boeing has struggled with the development work needed to take the company into the 21st century," Tim Clark, president of Emirates, the Dubai airline, said that year. Airbus, he said, "has been braver, more brazen."
In 2008, Airbus delivered 483 airplanes, while Boeing delivered just 375. Three years later at the Paris Air Show, Airbus took orders for 730 aircraft, worth some $72.2 billion, with its new fuel-efficient version dominating.
"Boeing was just completely arrogant in dismissing the viability of the A320," said Scott Hamilton, managing director of the Leeham Co., an aviation consulting firm.
As American considered placing its largest-ever aircraft order exclusively with Airbus in the spring of 2011, executives at the carrier initially didn't believe Boeing thought that the threat was real, according to a person involved with the discussions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Boeing made a business decision. A former senior Boeing official said the company opted to build the Max because it would be far quicker, easier and cheaper than starting from scratch, and would provide almost as much fuel savings for airlines.
Eventually, American decided to make deals with both Boeing and Airbus, buying hundreds of jets from each. Arpey called McNerney again, this time reading from a script to carefully calibrate his words. First, he congratulated the Boeing chief on the deal, according to the person with knowledge of the discussions. Then he broke the news that American would also place an order with Airbus.
'Pressure cooker'
Inside Boeing, the race was on. Roughly six months after the project's launch, engineers were already documenting the differences between the Max and its predecessor, meaning they already had preliminary designs for the Max - a fast turnaround, according to an engineer who worked on the project.
"The timeline was extremely compressed," the engineer said. "It was go, go, go."
One former designer on the team working on flight controls for the Max said the group had at times produced 16 technical drawings a week, double the normal rate. "They basically said, 'We need something now,'" the designer said.
A technician who assembles wiring on the Max said that in the first months of development, rushed designers were delivering sloppy blueprints to him. He was told that the instructions for the wiring would be cleaned up later in the process, he said.
His internal assembly designs for the Max, he said, still include omissions today, such as not specifying which tools to use to install a certain wire, a situation that could lead to a faulty connection. Normally such blueprints include intricate instructions.
Despite the intense atmosphere, current and former employees said, they felt during the project that Boeing's internal quality checks ensured the aircraft was safe.
In a statement, Boeing said: "The Max program launched in 2011. It was offered to customers in September 2012. Firm configuration of the airplane was achieved in July 2013. The first completed 737 Max 8 rolled out of the Renton factory in November 2015."
The company added, "A multiyear process could hardly be considered rushed."
At the heart of Boeing's push was a focus on creating a plane that was essentially the same as earlier 737 models, important for getting the jet certified quickly. It would also help limit the training that pilots would need, cutting down costs for airlines.
Rick Ludtke, an engineer who helped design the 737 Max cockpit and spent 19 years at Boeing, said the company had set a ground rule for engineers: Limit changes to hopefully avert a requirement that pilots spend time training in a flight simulator before flying the Max.
"Any designs we created could not drive any new training that required a simulator," Ludtke said. "That was a first."
A cascade of changes
Months before Boeing's announcement of the Max, the commercial airplanes executive, Albaugh, critiqued the decision by Airbus to refit the A320 with bigger engines, which could alter the aerodynamics and require big changes to the plane.
"It's going to be a design change that will ripple through the airplane," Albaugh said in the meeting with employees.
"I think they'll find it more challenging than they think it will be," he told them. "When they get done, they'll have an airplane that might be as good as the Next Generation 737," a plane that Boeing had launched in 1997.
But a main selling point of the new A320 was its fuel-efficient engines. To match Airbus, Boeing needed to mount the Max with its own larger and powerful new engines.
Just as Albaugh had predicted for Airbus, the decision created a cascade of changes. The bigger engines altered the aerodynamics of the plane, making it more likely to pitch up in some circumstances.
To offset that possibility, Boeing added the new software in the Max, known as MCAS, which would automatically push the nose down if it sensed the plane pointing up at a dangerous angle. The goal was to avoid a stall. Because the system was supposed to work in the background, Boeing believed it didn't need to brief pilots on it, and regulators agreed. Pilots weren't required to train in simulaturs.
The push for automation was a philosophical shift for Boeing, which for decades wanted to keep pilots in control of the planes as much as possible. Airbus, by comparison, tended to embrace technology, putting computers in control. Pilots who preferred the American manufacturer even had a saying: "If it's not Boeing, I'm not going."
The new software system is now a focus of investigators who are trying to determine what went wrong in the Ethiopian Airlines crash and the Lion Air tragedy in Indonesia. A leading theory in the Lion Air crash is that the system was receiving bad data from a faulty sensor, triggering an unrecoverable nose dive. All 737 Max jets around the world are grounded, and Boeing has given no estimate of when they might return to flight.
In Renton, Washington, where the 737 Max is produced in a 1.1-million-square-foot plant, the mere possibility that Boeing engineering contributed to the crashes has cast a pall over the factory. After the Lion Air crash, Boeing offered trauma counseling to engineers who had worked on the plane.
"People in my group are devastated by this," said Renzelmann, the former Boeing technical engineer. "It's a heavy burden."
In a statement, Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said he had spent time in Renton recently and "saw firsthand the pride our people feel in their work and the pain we're all experiencing in light of these tragedies."
Boeing is working on an update to MCAS software. The company met with carriers over the weekend to discuss the update, which is expected to roll out by April. It also intends to make a previously optional safety indicator in its cockpit standard in new Max jets.
The business is increasingly under pressure as airlines reconsider their orders and ask for compensation. But work in Renton is continuing apace.
Boeing now makes a record 52 Maxes a month, and aims to reach 57 by April. As fuselages and plane skeletons continued to chug into the factory by train this past week, crews worked around the clock to make thousands more.

Texto completo: Rudy Giuliani is insisting CNN apologize for its extensive coverage of the Russian investigation which President Trump's lawyer said amounted to an "overreaction" that "tortured" his client.

“You guys — you guys on this network have tortured this man for two years with collusion and nobody has apologized for it,” Giuliani told CNN’s Chris Cuomo in an interview Monday evening. “Before we talk about obstruction, apologize! Apologize for the overreaction on collusion!”

“Not a chance,” Cuomo said, prompting Giuliani to claim he wouldn’t apologize “because you’re not fair.”

Giuliani's offensive against CNN came one day after Attorney General William Barr provided Congress with a summary of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Kremlin. Barr stated that the investigation “did not find that the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with Russia in its efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election."

Mueller did not determine whether Trump obstructed justice, which prompted Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to decide that the evidence “is not sufficient to establish that the president committed an obstruction-of-justice offense."

Despite the obstruction question being an open one, fueling Democratic calls for Mueller's full report to be released, Trump declared Barr's four-page summary showed Mueller had dealt him “complete and total exoneration."

During the fiery interview, Giuliani repeatedly pushed Cuomo to apologize for CNN’s coverage. Cuomo ultimately said he would “never” issue an apology, saying he did nothing wrong. He also said there are still questions that he and his colleagues must ask.

Giuliani also said the Washington Post, the New York Times, and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., should apologize for pedaling accusations of collusion.

Heartbroken pundits, reporters cling to hope, struggle amid life after collusion

Texto completo: On Sunday, after Attorney General William Barr announced special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation had found no evidence that the Trump campaign conspired with Russia to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential election, grief-stricken reporters and news commentator struggled to convince themselves that this isn't a major victory for an administration once accused of coordinating directly with a hostile foreign government.

Some looked for ways to characterize Barr’s announcement as further legal trouble for the White House. Some even denied that the two-year Mueller investigation had landed with a thud. Others argued that the president must be guilty of something, even if Mueller's investigation came back empty handed.

Denial, anger, bargaining, depression. It’s all as sad as it sounds.

“The Mueller report and Barr's letter do not change this core element of the Russia scandal: Trump and his crew engaged in a profound act of betrayal,” Mother Jones’ David Corn, who has claimed repeatedly to have found evidence of “collusion,” declared in his latest promise to crack wide the Russia scandal.

“The scandal may not be a crime. It’s a betrayal,” states his article, which is titled, “Trump Aided and Abetted Russia’s Attack. That Was Treachery. Full Stop.”

Over at CNN, national security analyst Sam Vinograd explained to her 60,000-plus Twitter followers that the Justice Department’s judgment that the president “and his campaign didn’t conspire with Russia is not the same as saying that they were not Russian intelligence assets.”

For reference, the Mueller investigation, which included 40 agents, 2,800 subpoenas, some 500 search warrants, and 500 witness interviews, concluded it could not “establish that the members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.” Barr also there is also no evidence “to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense.”

But surely, there must be something here to hang around the Trump administration's neck, despondent members of the news media shouted this weekend.

“Key to no prosecution on obstruction may be no evidence of an underlying crime of conspiracy with Russia,” NBC News Chief Foreign Affairs correspondent Andrea Mitchell theorized. “But did #Mueller not find evidence of conspiracy with Russia because so many people lied? Catch-22.”

The Atlantic’s David Frum said elsewhere, “What is being called ‘vindication’ today is the acceptance not only by Trump but by the conservative world - and slices of the hard left too – of the most successful clandestine foreign perversion of a US election in US history.”

He added, “No exoneration. The president remains a security risk.”

The Washington Post’s Jennifer Rubin, a former conservative, raged on social media, “Mueller should testify under oath to make clear everyone hears he did NOT exonerate Trump. He should go through the evidence he found of obstruction.”

“Mueller’s team investigated for 22 months but in the end the special counsel reached no conclusion – instead producing a report that merely marshaled evidence on both sides – and then Trump’s two top political appointees at DOJ made the call,” the New York Times’ Michael S. Schmidt, an actual hard-news reporter, said in a note that he laughably must have thought accurately described Sunday’s news.

New York magazine’s Jonathan Chait, who rode the bogus collusion story very hard , complained elsewhere in an article titled, “If Trump Obstructed Justice, He Can’t Be Exonerated”:

"People who want to demonstrate their innocence make displays of cooperation with investigators. They promise to tell them everything they know, and encourage their subordinates to do the same. Trump did the opposite. He refused to give the special counsel an interview. He used his pardon power to encourage his subordinates to withhold cooperation.
[…]
The point is that his flamboyant refusal to cooperate deprives Trump of any claim to having been cleared. As Trump stated repeatedly, he considers “obstruction of justice” just a term to describe fighting back.
However, as National Review’s Charles C. W. Cooke helpfully notes, the fifth amendment protects Americans from this exact sort of "you have nothing to fear if you're innocent" persecution.

It's a good effort by Chait and company to spin the Barr news into something negative for the Trump administration. It's utterly ridiculous, but it's a good effort anyway. Don’t stop believing. Hold on to that feeling.

Texto completo: La profesora, armada con tizas de colores, suma fracciones en el gran encerado, enmarcado en madera rústica, que cubre la pared frontal de la clase. Los niños de cuarto grado, de 9 y 10 años, hacen sus cuentas en los pupitres con lápiz y cuartillas. El aula está forrada de papeles: mensajes, horarios, trabajos de los alumnos. Ninguno ha salido de una impresora. Nada, ni siquiera los libros de texto, que elaboran los propios niños a mano, ha sido realizado por ordenador. No hay detalle alguno en esta clase que pudiera desentonar en los recuerdos escolares de un adulto que asistió al colegio el siglo pasado. Pero estamos en Palo Alto. El corazón de Silicon Valley. Epicentro de la economía digital. Hábitat de quienes piensan, producen y venden la tecnología que transforma la sociedad del siglo XXI.
Escuelas de medio mundo se esfuerzan por introducir ordenadores, tabletas, pizarras interactivas y otros prodigios tecnológicos . Pero aquí, en el Waldorf of Peninsula, colegio privado donde se educan los hijos de directivos de Apple, Google y otros gigantes tecnológicos que rodean a esta antigua granja en la bahía de San Francisco, no entra una pantalla hasta que llegan a secundaria .
“No creemos en la caja negra, esa idea de que metes algo en una máquina y sale un resultado sin que se comprenda lo que pasa dentro. Si haces un círculo perfecto con un ordenador, pierdes al ser humano tratando de lograr esa perfección. Lo que detona el aprendizaje es la emoción, y son los humanos los que producen esa emoción, no las máquinas. La creatividad es algo esencialmente humano. Si le pones una pantalla a un niño pequeño limitas sus habilidades motoras, su tendencia a expandirse, su capacidad de concentración. No hay muchas certezas en todo esto. Tendremos las respuestas en 15 años, cuando estos niños sean adultos. ¿Pero queremos asumir el riesgo?”, se pregunta Pierre Laurent, padre de tres hijos, ingeniero informático que trabajó en Microsoft, Intel y diversas startups, y ahora preside el patronato del colegio.
Sus palabras ilustran lo que empieza a ser un consenso entre las élites de Silicon Valley. Los adultos que mejor comprenden la tecnología de los móviles y las aplicaciones quieren a sus hijos lejos de ella. Los beneficios de las pantallas en la educación temprana son limitados, sostienen, mientras que el riesgo de adicción es alto.
Los pioneros lo tuvieron claro desde muy pronto. Bill Gates, creador de Microsoft, limitó el tiempo de pantalla de sus hijos. “No tenemos los teléfonos en la mesa cuando estamos comiendo y no les dimos móviles hasta que cumplieron los 14 años”, dijo en 2017. “En casa limitamos el uso de tecnología a nuestros hijos”, explicó Steve Jobs, creador de Apple, en una entrevista en The New York Times en 2010, en la que aseguró que prohibía a sus vástagos utilizar su recién creado iPad. “En la escala entre los caramelos y el crack, esto está más cerca del crack”, apuntaba también en The New York Times Chris Anderson, exdirector de la revista Wired, biblia de la cultura digital.
Laurent, que no le dio un móvil a su hijo pequeño hasta noveno grado (14 o 15 años), alerta de un peligroso cambio en el modelo de negocio del que ha sido testigo en su vida profesional. “Cualquiera que hace una aplicación quiere que sea fácil de usar”, explica. “Eso es así desde el principio. Pero antes queríamos que el usuario estuviera contento para que comprase el producto. Ahora, con los smartphones y las tabletas, el modelo de negocio es otro: el producto es gratis, pero se recogen datos y se ponen anuncios. Por eso, el objetivo hoy es que el usuario pase más tiempo en la aplicación, para poder recoger más datos o poner más anuncios. Es decir, la razón de ser de la aplicación es que el usuario pase el mayor tiempo posible ante la pantalla. Están diseñadas para eso”.
El problema de la relación de los niños y la tecnología es que el ritmo vertiginoso al que se transforma dificulta la reflexión y el estudio. Una investigación de Common Sense Media, organización sin ánimo de lucro “dedicada a ayudar a los niños a desarrollarse en un mundo de medios y tecnología”, da una idea de la velocidad de los cambios: los niños estadounidenses de cero a ocho años pasaban en 2017 una media de 48 minutos al día ante el móvil, tres veces más que en 2013 y 10 veces más que en 2011. “¿Cuándo empezó todo este furor por los teléfonos inteligentes?”, se pregunta María Álvarez, vicepresidenta de la organización. “No tiene más que 12 o 13 años. Y las primeras tabletas aún menos. Hace falta que mucha investigación aún para determinar cuál es realmente el impacto que esta exposición a las pantallas puede tener en los niños pequeños. Pero hay algunos estudios que empiezan a ver una relación entre esta tecnología y ciertos hitos en la educación. Ofrecen indicaciones que los padres deben tener en cuenta”.
Una investigación publicada en enero de este año en la revista médica JAMA pediatrics reveló que un tiempo mayor ante la pantalla a los dos y tres años está asociado con retrasos de los niños en alcanzar hitos de desarrollo dos años después. Otros estudios relacionan el uso excesivo de móviles en adolescentes con la falta de sueño, el riesgo de depresión y hasta de suicidios. La Academia de Pediatras de Estados Unidos publicó unas recomendaciones en 2016: evitar el uso de pantallas para los menores de 18 meses; solo contenidos de calidad y visionados en compañía de los padres, para niños entre 18 y 24 meses; una hora al día de contenidos de calidad para niños de entre dos y cinco años; y, a partir de los seis años, límites coherentes en el tiempo de uso y el contenido.
Sucede que poner límites no es fácil para los padres trabajadores. Y eso lleva a una redefinición de lo que significa la brecha digital. Hasta hace no mucho, la preocupación era que los niños más ricos contasen con una ventaja por acceder antes a Internet. Hoy, según Common Sense Media, el 98% de los hogares con hijos en EE UU tienen teléfonos móviles, frente a un 52% en 2011. Cuando la tecnología se ha generalizado, el problema es el contrario: que las familias con un elevado poder adquisitivo tienen más fácil impedir que sus niños se pasen el día ante el móvil. Mientras los hijos de las élites de Silicon Valley se crían entre pizarras y juguetes de madera, los de las clases bajas y medias crecen pegados a pantallas.
Los adolescentes de hogares con menos ingresos, según un estudio de Common Sense Media, pasan dos horas y 45 minutos al día más ante las pantallas que aquellos de hogares de ingresos altos. Otros estudios indican que los niños blancos están significativamente menos expuestos a las pantallas que los negros o hispanos.
La brecha se ve incluso dentro de Silicon Valley. Conduciendo 15 minutos hacia el norte desde el Waldorf of Peninsula, centro cuya matrícula ronda los 30.000 dólares anuales, se llega al colegio público Hillview. El primero no introduce las pantallas hasta la secundaria. El segundo publicita un programa por el que cada alumno cuenta con un iPad. En el primero, recibe al visitante un rústico espantapájaros situado en una huerta que cultivan los alumnos. En el segundo, una pantalla de leds que expone los anuncios del día.
“¿Cuántas familias trabajadoras se pueden permitir el lujo de alejar a sus hijos completamente de las pantallas?”, se pregunta Álvarez, de Common Sense Media. “No creo que sea algo realista para la mayoría de los hogares. Yo tengo un hijo de 12 y otro de 6. Ni sé las veces que se han tirado al suelo gritando como locos si yo les quito la tableta. He estado en esa posición como madre y sé que no es fácil”.
Trabajadores de las grandes tecnológicas se reunieron el año pasado en una iniciativa bautizada como La Verdad Sobre la Tecnología . Su objetivo es convencer a las empresas de la necesidad de introducir parámetros éticos en el diseño de herramientas que utilizan a diario miles de millones de personas, incluidos niños. “La ingeniería informática durante mucho tiempo era algo muy técnico, no había una idea clara del impacto que iba a tener en la gente, y menos aún en los niños”, explica Pierre Laurent. “No existía una conciencia de que había que lidiar con la ética. Algo que sí pasa, por ejemplo, si trabajas en la industria médica. En la tecnología nunca ha habido un código ético claro”.
Es una lucha desigual. Padres multitarea contra equipos de ingenieros y psicólogos que diseñan tecnología para mantener a sus hijos enganchados. Pero algo está empezando a cambiar. Los gigantes tecnológicos, cada vez más cuestionados en sus políticas comerciales y de privacidad, empiezan a introducir cambios en sus productos, tímidas excepciones al sacrosanto principio de captar más atención.
El año pasado, dos grandes inversores de Apple, Jana Partners y CalSTRS (el fondo de jubilación de profesores de California), poseedores conjuntamente de cerca de 2.000 millones de dólares en acciones, enviaron una carta abierta a los jefes de la empresa de Cupertino, pidiendo que tomasen más medidas contra la adicción de los niños a los móviles. “Hemos revisado la evidencia y creemos que hay una clara necesidad de que Apple ofrezca a los padres más opciones y herramientas para ayudarles a asegurarse de que los consumidores jóvenes utilizan vuestros productos de manera óptima”, escribieron.
Apple respondió introduciendo Screen Time, una nueva herramienta que ayuda a controlar y limitar el uso del móvil. Google ha incorporado una herramienta similar, Digital Wellbeing. Para los críticos, son solo parches que no atacan el problema de fondo: la naturaleza adictiva de los productos. Hasta que eso se aborde, serán los padres los responsables de guiar a sus hijos en este mundo de potencial incierto.
“Nosotros animamos a los padres a que sean más proactivos a la hora de buscar el contenido”, concluye Álvarez. “La clave es cómo aprendemos a equilibrar, a sacarle provecho, a limitar el uso y a saber que, por su salud física y mental, tiene que haber momentos en la familia en los que no se use nada. Tenemos una campaña que invita a comer y cenar sin móviles, sin que haya un aparato constantemente interrumpiendo con notificaciones. Recomendamos también el uso compartido de los dispositivos, y hablar con los niños sobre lo que ven. Y es importante el modelo que somos para nuestros hijos. Si estamos compulsivamente viendo el móvil, justificando que es por trabajo, ¿qué mensaje les estamos trasladando?”.
La obsesión en Silicon Valley por alejar a los niños de la tecnología trasciende las paredes de las aulas. Cuando los chavales salen del colegio, se intenta que sigan sin tocar ni ver pantallas. En las familias de los altos ejecutivos de las empresas tecnológicas del valle se está generalizando la práctica de exigir a las niñeras que firmen “contratos sin móvil” .
“Yo he trabajado en casas en las que tenía que dejar el móvil en la garita de seguridad cada vez que entraba”, explica Janie Martinez , que lleva 15 años como niñera en la zona. “No podía mirar el teléfono en toda mi jornada de trabajo, y los niños no podían ver pantallas durante el tiempo que estaban conmigo. Es una locura”.
Martinez ha trabajado en familias de “perfil muy alto” del mundo de la tecnología, incluida la de Mark Zuckerberg , fundador de Facebook, asegura. Trabajos que, en los casos más extremos, pueden estar remunerados con hasta 100.000 dólares anuales. “Cuanto más alto ha sido el perfil de las familias, más preocupadas estaban por este tema”, cuenta . “No querían que sus hijos mirasen una pantalla y, por contrato, me impedían usar el teléfono. Eso me parece frustrante. Como cuidadoras, necesitamos el móvil para una emergencia. No solo para que nos localicen los padres de los niños, también para nuestras propias familias”.
Syma Latif, directora de la agencia de niñeras Bay Area Sitters, que coloca a dos centenares de cuidadoras en la zona de Silicon Valley, confirma esta tendencia. “Cada vez vemos más familias que incluyen estas estipulaciones en los contratos, es sin duda algo muy común”, asegura. “Cuando hablamos de tiempo de pantalla y niñeras, hay dos aspectos a tratar: su propio tiempo de pantalla y el del niño. Los contratos típicamente incluyen algo relacionado con los dos. Pero una cosa es que te digan: ‘Este es mi hijo y solo se le permite tiempo de pantalla a determinadas horas’. Eso está bien, porque trabajas para esa persona. La zona gris empieza cuando tu propio tiempo de pantalla es el que es dictado. ¿Tiene el empleador derecho a decirte que no puedes estar al teléfono? ¿Qué pasa si tienes un hijo en el colegio y necesitas acceso al teléfono por si te tienen que localizar, o un padre o una madre en casa que necesitan ayuda?”.
Algunos padres van aún más allá. Se dedican a pasearse por los parques en busca de niñeras que están pendientes de sus móviles mientras cuidan de los niños de otros. Cuando creen encontrarlas, las fotografían y las denuncian en grupos de madres en Internet. Son los “espías de niñeras”. Existen páginas web como Yo Vi a Tu Niñera en las que se comparten esas fotos.
“Pasa mucho en los parques”, explica Anita Castro , con 10 años de experiencia como cuidadora en la zona. “Ni siquiera nos conocen, sacan una foto, la ponen en redes sociales y preguntan: ‘¿Es esta tu niñera?’. Pero no saben que podemos estar comunicándonos con los padres. Y tampoco si soy la niñera o una familiar. Es una invasión de la privacidad. En algunos trabajos me sentía observada. Me daba cuenta de que tenían cámaras en la casa. Y hasta los niños me vigilaban: miraba la hora y me preguntaban si estaba enviando mensajes y a quién. Así que podía saber que habían tenido esa conversación con sus padres, que les habían pedido que les dijeran si yo estaba al teléfono”.

Texto completo: Inspiring women take center stage in "Women, War & Peace II." And an intruder upends a couple's life in "The Salesman."
What's on TV
WOMEN, WAR & PEACE II 9 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). Who runs the world? This limited series returns with four films about women who have led nonviolent movements for peace and human rights. The program begins with "Wave Goodbye to Dinosaurs," about the Northern Ireland Women's Coalition, a political party established in 1996 to secure representation of women in peace negotiations. (The party disbanded in 2006.) "The Trials of Spring," which centers on three Egyptian women fighting for "bread, freedom and social justice" during the Arab Spring in 2011, follows at 10. The second half of the series airs Tuesday at 9.
JESUS: HIS LIFE 8 p.m. on History. The biblical drama "Mary Magdalene" will hit theaters next month with Rooney Mara in the title role alongside Joaquin Phoenix as Jesus. The story of Mary -- a Jewish woman who traveled with Jesus and witnessed his crucifixion and resurrection -- is also told in this new series that is part drama, part documentary, along with the tales of seven other figures who played important roles in Jesus's life. The first episode reimagines Jesus's birth with a focus on Joseph.
ONE NATION UNDER STRESS (2019) 9 p.m. on HBO; Stream on HBO platforms. The neurosurgeon and medical reporter Sanjay Gupta crisscrosses the United States to understand why the country's life expectancy rate has been steadily dropping in this sobering documentary by Marc Levin ("Class Divide"). Gupta emphasizes the rise of "deaths of despair" caused by cirrhosis, drug overdose and suicide, while researchers point to obesity and chronic stress. What's important, the film conveys, is to discover the cause of the cause -- which seems to be mainly greater depression and social isolation. We see the human side of the issue when Gupta visits a town in Pennsylvania where a plant closure has left hundreds of residents jobless and stressed out.
What's Streaming
[Video: The Salesman - Official US Trailer | Amazon Studios Watch on YouTube.]
THE SALESMAN (2017) Stream on Amazon; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu or YouTube. The Iranian filmmaker Asghar Farhadi won his second Oscar for this suspenseful drama about a married couple in Tehran. At the outset, Emad (Shahab Hosseini) and Rana (Taraneh Alidoosti), theater actors working on a production of Arthur Miller's "Death of a Salesman," move out of their rundown apartment before it crumbles over their heads. A fellow actor helps them settle in a new place, but the previous tenant left behind many belongings and doesn't seem to be returning for them. Emad and Rana soon understand why the apartment is filled with clutter, but only after a troubling incident causes a rift between them and pushes Emad down a vengeful spiral. A. O. Scott named the film a Critic's Pick in his New York Times review. "With exquisite patience and attention to detail," he wrote, Farhadi "builds a solid and suspenseful plot out of ordinary incidents, and packs it with rich and resonant ideas."

What a president should say after a hate-driven massacre

Texto completo: President Donald Trump has rightly come under intense criticism for his initial response to the horrific acts of terrorism that occurred at two mosques in New Zealand.
After sending out a normal presidential message that offered his "warmest sympathy and best wishes" to the New Zealanders in the wake of the "horrible massacre," he then started tweeting about "Jexodus" (the alleged shift of Jewish voters to the GOP) and the Russia investigation. "THIS SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN TO A PRESIDENT AGAIN!" Trump wrote, conveying where his heart and soul were on that sad day. And when asked by a reporter on Friday if he sees an increase in white nationalism, Trump said: "I don't really, I think it's a small group of people that have very, very serious problems."
At this point, nobody should be surprised. In numerous times of tragedy, the president has been unable to offer the right words of sympathy. The usual sorrow and anger that we hear from the Oval Office are too many times absent from his lexicon.
Back in April 1995, another president offered a controversial response to a terrorist attack by white nationalists, but the debates about his words were less about a lack of empathy than his willingness to give a tough appraisal of the climate that fueled extremism.
President Bill Clinton's remarks came a few days after the tragic bombing on April 19, 1995, when Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols blew up a federal government building in Oklahoma City, killing 168 people. Initially, after the tragedy, Clinton offered the familiar kinds of messages Americans expect from their leader: condolences to those affected and assurance that the nation would get through the heartbreaking moment.
But then, days later, Clinton struck a very different tone. During an appearance before the American Association of Community Colleges in Minneapolis, Clinton pointed to the angry conservative airwaves and without naming names warned that, "We hear so many loud and angry voices in America today whose sole goal seems to be to try to keep some people as paranoid as possible and the rest of us all torn up and upset with each other. They spread hate. They leave the impression that, by their very words, that violence is acceptable." He continued: "When they talk of violence, we must stand against them. When they say things that are irresponsible, that may have egregious consequences, we must call them on it."
With this speech, Clinton was ostensibly connecting the world of conservative talk radio, which had vastly expanded since the elimination of the Fairness Doctrine in 1987 that required radio and TV stations to present both sides of a political issue, to the rapid growth of white militia groups in the 1990s and conservative politics. Although still in its infancy, the internet had also given rise to sites that served as gathering places for white extremists.
Clinton's point was seemingly not to blame talk show hosts or right-wing Republicans for the bombing, but to offer a necessary warning that rhetoric can be dangerous. When hateful ideas are thrown out into the public square, they can inspire unstable individuals to do horrendous things or make organizations of hate feel empowered.
Predictably, conservatives responded angrily. Rush Limbaugh called the speech "irresponsible and vacuous" in suggesting there was any connection. Republican Sen. Don Nickles reprimanded the then-president by saying: "This incident wasn't caused by Rush Limbaugh; this incident wasn't caused by people who think government is too big." Some conservative hosts did become defensive, like G. Gordon Liddy, who said he didn't believe he was fueling the "lunatic fringe" when he told listeners he used drawings of Bill and Hillary Clinton as target practice.
Clinton refused to back down. "Words have consequences," he said after claims that he had used the Oklahoma City bombing to win political points, "To pretend that they do not is idle." He did, however, clarify that his warning was relevant to the left and right, wherever the "reckless speech" was coming from that had the capacity to "push fragile people over the edge beyond the bounds of civilized conduct and take this country into a dark place." In his memoirs, Clinton recalled that after the bombing he decided to do all he could "to change the atmosphere of bitterness and bigotry out of which this madness had come."
It turned out Clinton was on to something important, a situation that has only become worse over the decades. We have seen the toxic environment of our current times, where white nationalism is too close to the surface, manifesting itself in previously unthinkable ways. Trump has been willing to traffic in dog whistles, suggestive retweets, conspiracy theories and loaded rhetoric that has convinced figures like David Duke, the former Grand Wizard of the KKK, to support him.
Even worse, Trump is not alone. There is a universe of right-wing conservatism, from Iowa Congressman Steven King defending the term white nationalism, telling the New York Times, "White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization - how did that language become offensive?"
We have also witnessed the creation and legitimization of a media environment that has few editorial filters and a huge reach as a result of social media and that offers endless fuel to white extremist organizations and lone wolf terrorists.
White nationalist organizations within the United States often seem to draw on the same pool of rhetoric that we hear from mainstream politicians and pundits, as do the lone wolves. According to CNN, the man who sent pipe bombs to multiple targets last October had a van covered in paraphernalia, including a sticker reading "CNN Sucks," a chant that has been heard at Trump rallies. The manifesto of the New Zealand shooter offered words of praise for the president.
To be clear, the president, legislators like King and right-wing media pundits are not responsible for these horrific acts.
But we need to be equally clear that the incendiary rhetoric we constantly hear on our television screens and see on the updates of our computers and Twitter feeds creates an incredibly dangerous environment.
The danger of white internationalism, as we should be calling it, is growing. This is a major threat that all nations now face which has gained organizational clout and which has been impacting political parties. It is time for our leaders to not only show sympathy toward victims, but to launch an international coalition against this rising force of hate. - (CNN)

First day comes for legal March Madness betting

Texto completo: The dirt track is empty and gray, like the sky. Rain blows in on the wind, stops, then starts again. The paddocks are empty, the horses gone.
None of it matters. At the Meadowlands Racetrack a crowd is gathering, the grandstand filling up. The building's southern wall is all windows, but no one looks outside. Today everyone is inside, in this bar, which looks like no other bar in the world, its curved black walls soaring four stories tall and hung with huge television screens. The largest one measures 20 feet across.
Nevermind the big TVs. Those are for fans and amateurs. Here the action happens on small screens, like the automated gambling kiosks that circle the room, their bright LED screens reading "BET HERE."
It's happening on Anthony Mea's smartphone and on his Macbook Air laptop, which sits open beside his bucket of Bud Lite cans. Above Mea, a big TV screen shows Darius Perry, a sophomore guard for the Louisville University Cardinals, jumping on a basketball court in Des Moines, Iowa, 1,100 miles away.
It's the first quarter of the first game on the first day of the NCAA basketball tournament in 2019, the first time anyone outside Las Vegas may bet legally on college sports.
Perry shoots. He sinks a three-pointer.
Mea peers into his screens. They contain blurs of numbers, spreadsheets of tallies and percentages refreshed every millisecond by seven different online gambling data companies. As Perry turns to play defense on that court in Des Moines, here in the Meadowlands a box on Mea's spreadsheet blinks from white to yellow. This indicates one of the data companies Mea tracks, called Pinnacle, believes Perry's basket nudged the odds of victory just a smidge in Louisville's favor. The other six companies disagree. On Mea's computer, their columns remain clear white.
To a fan watching on the big screen it was just another three-pointer, a lovely parabola in a game of lovely parabolas.
To Mea, watching on his little screen, it was actionable intelligence.
"If I were betting online right now, I could bet that spread" between Pinnacle and all the other data companies, said Mea, 24, from Hoboken. "You look for discrepancies between the houses."
Who needs horses galloping in the rain? Who needs Darius Perry's perfect wrist-flick follow-through? What good is the beauty of sport, all those wide-open views of people striving against the outermost edge of human ability?
Beauty cannot be monetized. Discrepancies between the houses of gambling can be.
This is what makes people like Anthony Mea money. This, now, is what sport is all about.
"There are so many intricacies. It's very analytical," Mea said. "I try to keep emotions to a minimum."
Down with love. Up with data. There's been a lot of keeping emotions to a minimum lately in the worlds of college and professional sport. Last May the United States Supreme Court struck down a law that effectively barred sports gambling in every state but Nevada. The big sports leagues fought the change for years, arguing legalized gambling could tarnish their sports by giving coaches, players and fans strong incentives to cheat.
In the end, the opposition seemed mostly symbolic. By 2014, Adam Silver, commissioner of the NBA, signed an op-ed in The New York Times supporting sport gambling legalization, so long as his association earned a cut.
"I believe that sports betting should be brought out of the underground and into the sunlight where it can be appropriately monitored and regulated," Silver wrote.
Thursday, the first day anyone over 21 could legally bet on March Madness games in New Jersey, fans at Meadowlands Racetrack were in agreement.
"It should be legalized because it's going to happen anyway," said Alexander Cohen, 27, a White Plains resident who took the day off as a commercial real estate broker. "This is the land of the free. Why not bring it out of the back alley so it can be regulated and monetized?"

Texto completo: While we're clucking over the college admissions bribery scandal, those of us with children too young to worry about higher education gaze up from our smartphones and remind our tweens and teens that schoolwork's due Friday and to pack their uniform for practice.
What's wrong with that?
Only that most of us still will be doing it when our children are in college.
Bribing SAT proctors, paying off college officials and lying about kids' athletic credentials is illegal, but it's also part of a pattern of today's parents taking control so their children succeed and avoid disappointment and failure.
A new poll conducted by The New York Times and Morning Consult showed that parents don't stop handling things for their children when they become an adults.
We don't stop removing obstacles to child frustration or defeat, thus earning ourselves the moniker of snowplow or lawnmower parents.
The poll looked at a nationally representative group of parents of children ages 18 to 28.
By the time kids are old enough for college and way beyond the point they should have graduated, parents — whether wealthy or not rich — are still doing things children can do for themselves. Such as:
76 percent reminded their adult children of deadlines they need to meet, including for schoolwork
74 percent made appointments for them, including doctor's appointments
15 percent of parents with children in college had texted or called them to wake them up so they didn't sleep through a class or test.
One of the most egregious findings of the poll is that 11 percent of parents with adult children will call their child's employer if he or she had an issue at work.
I guess it shouldn't be that surprising in that 8 percent of parents said they had contacted a college professor or administrator about their child's grades or a problem they were having.
The poll also found among parents of adult children that:
22 percent helped them study for a college test
16 percent helped write all or part of a job or internship application
14 percent told them which career to pursue
14 percent helped them get jobs or internships through professional network
12 percent gave more than $500 per month for rent or daily expenses
11 percent helped write an essay or school assignment
4 percent wrote all or part of an essay or other school assignment
The problem with this, according to Julie Lythcott-Haims, the former dean of freshmen at Stanford University and the author of "How to Raise an Adult: Break Free of the Overparenting Trap and Prepare Your Kid for Success," is that parents never let their children grow up. Growing up means making your own decisions, and sometimes, mistakes, she told The Times.
"The point is to prepare the kid for the road, instead of preparing the road for the kid," Lythcott-Haims said.
Lythcott-Haims said it's a difficult habit for snowplow parents to break the habit of being a child's fixer, always plowing away all the difficulties.
"If you're doing it in high school, you can't stop at college," she said. "If you're doing it in college, you can't stop when it comes to the workplace. You have manufactured a role for yourself of always being there to handle things for your child, so it gets worse because your young adult is ill-equipped to manage the basic tasks of life."
Lythcott-Haims said parents have to take a back seat and let their kids drive their own life lives.
The poll looked at 1,508 people ages 18 to 28 and 1,136 parents of people that age.

Texto completo: Why's everybody always pickin' on me?
Those immortal words are from "Charlie Brown," the 1959 hit song by the Coasters, who are pretty darn immortal themselves.
In 2019, it isn't high school rebels who get picked on. According to Anna Goldfarb in her New York Times article, "The Right Way to Ask, 'Can I Pick Your Brain?'" it's "experienced people in every industry" who have the brains everybody wants to pick.
(In the unlikely possibility that someone wants to pick your brain, refuse immediately. If strangers want to pick at your kidneys or your liver, that's fine. As for your brain, you simply don't have enough to go around.)
"Can I buy you coffee and pick your brain?" is the standard invitation to a career mind-meld. The experts advise against this approach. According to Professor Dorie Clark of Duke University, the coffee brain-suck combo, while well-intentioned, sends the wrong message.
"These requests," she says, "can seem as if you're following a generic script."
I agree. If you want buy-in, throw away that generic script and get personal. Make it clear that your inquiry is not a boilerplate request, but a matter of life and death, as in: "I'm about to be fired; I can't afford the medical treatment I desperately need; and my pet parakeet is listless and out of sorts. I really need your advice."
Another way to get a positive response is to "immediately highlight any commonalities and unique bonds you have." Perhaps you both attended the same college, or, even better, you both were kicked out of the same college. If there's nothing specific you can cite, pick a commonality shared by all the elite.
"I'm sure spending time with me will be well worth it," you might say."After all, we both like champagne, caviar and off-shore bank accounts."
You are also advised to "be vulnerable, and get to the heart of why you're reaching out."
A good way to play the vulnerability card is to say: "I'm a loser. But if a loser like you can become a success, maybe I can do it, too."
Professor Adam Grant receives dozens of brain-picking requests every week. He advises advice-seekers that "instead of expressing some sense of entitlement to my time face-to-face, say, 'Hey, would you be open to either a phone call or an email dialog?' Give me the option to choose how I want to communicate."
This does sound respectful, but asking for options could backfire.
"How do I want to communicate?" is an answer you could receive. "How about you drop dead and we use a Ouija Board?"
When strangers request coffee dates, Clark makes them "jump through a few hoops."
Clark's hoops could be as simple as "clarifying what the seeker is actually looking for." Not me. When some truly desperate person asks to pick my brain I give them a few simple tasks to make sure that they're serious.
"I'm really busy," I say. "I could have more time if you'd pick up my dry cleaning and a pint of Chubby Hubby. And while you're out, buy yourself a plane ticket to Tibet. It's been a while since I've seen Lhasa, and I'd love to know how it's changed."
Once you have set up a meeting, it's "crucial to be aware of how long the it runs." If you asked for 30 minutes, don't let the meeting run longer. That's the rule. Of course, the rule only applies to normal people. You're so fascinating that it would be almost immoral to limit the time spent in your presence.
Besides, an extra hour or five would give you time to fully interrogate your coffee companion. (Top tip: Binge-watching a few seasons of "Law & Order" is a great way to polish your interview skills.)
A longer meeting will also give you time to have a second cup of coffee, a cruller and maybe lunch and dinner, too. Though you've already offered to pay for coffee, this is patently ridiculous. Your invitee is successful and probably in much better financial shape than you. Make them pay for the coffee and cruller. And be sure to put a few items to-go on their bill. This will demonstrate that you are thrifty.
The advice you receive may bring you success long term, but right now you can't throw away money buying coffee. It's not that you're stingy. But let's face it -- sending your parakeet to the Mayo Clinic is not going to be cheap.

Texto completo: Should you pick your nose?
Don’t laugh. Scientifically, it’s an interesting question.
Should your children pick their noses? Should your children eat dirt? Maybe: Your body needs to know what immune challenges lurk in the immediate environment.
Should you use antibacterial soap or hand sanitizers? No. Are we taking too many antibiotics? Yes.
“I tell people, when they drop food on the floor, please pick it up and eat it,” said Dr. Meg Lemon, a dermatologist in Denver who treats people with allergies and autoimmune disorders. “Get rid of the antibacterial soap. Immunize! If a new vaccine comes out, run and get it. I immunized the living hell out of my children. And it’s OK if they eat dirt.”
Lemon’s prescription for a better immune system doesn’t end there.
“You should not only pick your nose, you should eat it,” she said.
She’s referring, with a facetious touch, to the fact our immune system can become disrupted if it doesn’t have regular interactions with the natural world.
“Our immune system needs a job,” Lemon said. “We evolved over millions of years to have our im-mune systems under constant as-sault. Now they don’t have anything to do.”
She isn’t alone. Leading physicians and immunologists are reconsidering the antiseptic, at times hysterical, ways in which we interact with our environment.
Sibling factor in allergies
The British Journal of Homeopathy, Volume 29, published in 1872, included a startlingly prescient observation: “Hay fever is said to be an aristocratic disease, and there can be no doubt that, if it is not almost wholly confined to the upper classes of society, it is rarely, if ever, met with but among the educated.”
Hay fever is a catchall term for seasonal allergies to pollen and other airborne irritants. With this idea that hay fever was an aristocratic disease, British scientists were on to something.
In November 1989, another highly influential paper was published on hay fever. The paper was short, fewer than two pages, in BMJ, titled “Hay Fever, Hygiene, and Household Size.”
The author looked at the prevalence of hay fever among 17,414 children born in March 1958. Of 16 variables the scientist explored, he described as “most striking” an association between the likelihood that a child would get hay fever allergy and the number of his siblings. It was an inverse relationship, meaning the more siblings, the less likely it was that he would get the allergy. Not just that, but the children least likely to get allergies were ones who had older siblings.
The paper hypothesized that “allergic diseases were prevented by infection in early childhood, transmitted by unhygienic contact with older siblings, or acquired prenatally from a mother infected by contact with her older children.
“Over the past century, declining family size, improvements in household amenities, and higher stand-ards of personal cleanliness have reduced the opportunity for cross infection in young families,” the pa-per continued. “This may have re-sulted in more widespread clinical expression of atopic disease, emerging in wealthier people, as seems to have occurred for hay fever.”
This is the birth of the hygiene hypothesis. The ideas behind it have since evolved and expanded, but it provides profound insight into a challenge that human beings face in their relationship with the modern world.
Our ancestors evolved over millions of years to survive in their environments. For most of human existence, that environment was characterized by extreme challenges, like scarcity of food, or food that could carry disease, as well as unsanitary conditions and unclean water, withering weather and so on.
At the center of our defenses was our immune system, the product of centuries of evolution.
Humans learned to take steps to bolster our defenses, developing all manner of customs and habits to support our survival. In this way, think of the brain as another facet of the immune system.
We used our collective brains to figure out effective behaviors. We started washing our hands and took care to avoid certain foods that experience showed could be dangerous or deadly. In some cultures, people came to avoid pork, which we now know is susceptible to trichinosis; in others, people banned meats, which we later learned may carry loads of E. coli and other bacteria.
Our ideas evolved, but for the most part, the immune system did not. This is not to say that it didn’t change. It responds to our environment. When we encounter various threats, our defenses learn and then are much more able to deal with that threat in the future.
We survived over tens of thousands of years. Eventually, we wash-ed our hands, swept our floors, cook-ed our food and avoided certain foods altogether. We improved the hygiene of animals we raised and slaughtered for food.
Particularly in the wealthier areas of the world, we purified our water and developed plumbing and waste treatment plants; we isolated and killed bacteria and other germs.
The immune system’s enemies list was attenuated, largely for the good. Now, though, our bodies are proving that they cannot keep up with this change. We have created a mismatch between the immune system and our environment.
Thanks to all the powerful learning we’ve done as a species, we have minimized the regular interaction not just with germs but even with friendly bacteria and parasites that helped to teach and hone the immune system - that “trained” it. It doesn’t encounter as many bugs when we are babies. This is not just because our homes are cleaner, but also because our families are smaller (fewer older kids are bringing home the germs), our foods and water cleaner, our milk sterilized. Some refer to the lack of interaction with all kinds of microbes we used to meet in nature as the “old friends mechanism.”
What does the immune system do when it’s not properly trained?
It can overreact. It becomes aggrieved by things like dust mites or pollen. It develops what we called allergies, chronic immune system attacks - inflammation - in a way that is counterproductive, irritating, even dangerous.
The percentage of children in the United States with a food allergy rose 50 percent between 1997-99 and 2009-11, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The jump in skin allergies was 69 percent during that period, leaving 12.5 percent of American children with eczema and other irritations.
Food and respiratory allergies rose in tandem with income level. More money, which typically correlates with higher education, has meant more allergy risk. This may reflect differences in who reports such allergies, but it also springs from differences in environment.
These trends are seen internationally, too. Skin allergies “doubled or tripled in industrialized countries during the past three decades, affecting 15-30 percent of children and 2-10 percent of adults,” according to a paper citing research from the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Asthma, the paper reads, “is becoming an ‘epidemic’ phenomenon.”
Hygiene hypothesis
There are related trends in in-flammatory bowel disease, lupus, rheumatic conditions and, in particular, celiac disease. The latter results from the immune’s system overreacting to gluten, a protein in wheat, rye and barley. This attack, damages the small intestine walls.
This is not to say that all of these increases are due to better hygiene, a drop in childhood infection and its association with wealth and education. There have been many changes to our environment, including new pollutants. There are also genetic factors.
But the hygiene hypothesis - and when it comes to allergy, the inverse relationship between industrialized processes and health - has held up remarkably well.

Texto completo: When Trisha Yearwood came off a three-year world tour with Garth Brooks just in time for Christmas in 2017, the last thing she expected was to hear her husband say he'd like to get back on the road and do it all again – but in stadiums.
After all, that last tour was his first in 13 years.
"I thought he would maybe be like 'OK, I'm gonna take a break. I don't know if we're gonna do this ever like this again,'" Yearwood says with a laugh. "And then, because he's Garth, he's like 'We never really have done stadiums. What do you think?'"
It's been fun, she says, to watch as her husband approaches this stadium tour as though he's never toured before.
He's come up with "a brand new stage, a brand new look, some different elements to make every show in every city different," Yearwood says. "So as his wife and as a fellow artist, it's been really cool to see him take this on as 'I want people that see this show to say, 'Oh my gosh, I've never seen that.'"
Another thing that's different about this tour is that Yearwood isn't on the bill, although she will be hosting Trisha's Tailgate in the parking lot before the shows.
Back to 'Trisha business' "This is a Garth show," Yearwood says. "This past year I spent working on two new albums. I haven't made new music in a while. So I said, 'I would like to not be on the ticket.' That doesn't mean I won't make an appearance at a show now and then. But I also have other Trisha business I need to do. So I'd like the freedom to do that."
Yearwood laughs and says, "I didn't know at the time that I would end up in the parking lot, doing tailgates. I jokingly say, 'Garth's in the stadium and I'm in the parking lot.'"
It's not that she didn't love sharing the spotlight with her husband on that last tour.
"It really was a good experience," she says. "I've been making records since '91, so I've done a lot of touring. And I thought my favorite place was these small intimate theaters. But the Garth tour is its own thing. I've never been to a more energetic show in my life. So I got the opportunity of coming out in the middle of his set into all that energy and my job was just to kind of hold my own out there and not bring the energy down for when he came back out. I learned a lot. I learned how to perform in an arena."
There was no question, she says, as to whether or not she'd be joining Brooks on tour, even after opting out of a spot on the ticket.
"When we got married, we said we don't want to be together to be apart. So we really have tried for these 14 years to make sure we make our plans where we don't have to spend very much time apart."
Hosting a tailgate party is a natural for Yearwood.
"I'm a sports girl," she says. "So I know about tailgating for, you know, Georgia Bulldogs games. But when we did the world tour, we'd pull up for soundcheck and I'd notice that people were tailgating for the show. I guess I was late to the party on that. I didn't realize that everybody was doing that."
She did her first Trisha's Tailgate before last year's one-off show at Notre Dame.
"And it went really well," she says. "So we decided to do this in every city. We have a tent set up and there's gonna be seven or eight Trisha foods. There's gonna be games and drinks. I'm gonna do a food demo. It's just kind of a hangout for several hours before you can go in to see the stadium show."
At the Notre Dame tailgate, she says, "We did some macaroni and cheese, mini hot dogs, sliders, drinks. It's not like a little appetizer thing where you'll go into the stadium hungry. You'll definitely have a chance to eat some real food before you go in."
Why she loves to cook It's the sort of menu you'd expect if you've seen "Trisha's Southern Kitchen," a Food Network series that features Yearwood cooking Southern meals for her family and friends.
"I'd love to say I had this planned, but honestly, it was a happy accident," Yearwood says of the show. "I wrote a cookbook with my mom and my sister for fun. I never dreamed that there would even be a second cookbook. But when had a New York Times best-seller, the TV shows started calling. I actually thought, 'I don't know if it would be fun to stand behind a counter and tell people to add the butter' or whatever. But the Food Network was great about saying It can be whatever you want it to be. So we created this show that was a very off-the-cuff, not-scripted show that really was the book come to life. Telling the family story. Having my family, my sister and my best buddies on the show. We laugh a lot. And I think I represent most cooks because I'm not a chef. Most people cook like I do."
Yearwood's parents were amazing cooks, she says.
"So my sister and I growing up, our jobs were usually things like setting the table and cracking the ice cubes, because we didn't have an ice maker."
It wasn't until she'd gone off to college that she learned to cook.
"I moved into an apartment," she says. "And I didn't know how to make anything. So I called home and I think the first recipe my mother gave me is her potato salad, which is very Southern and has, like, four ingredients. When I made it and it tasted like hers, I thought 'Oh my gosh, I can do this.' I missed home, I missed my family and I was able to feed myself and my friends and also to create that feeling of comfort from home. There's such a connection there."
Her tailgate party is a benefit for Habitat for Humanity, which she and Brooks have been involved with for "probably 10 years now," she says.
"Garth and I started with Habitat a couple years after Katrina. We went to New Orleans and really we thought we were going to be celebrities that did a couple interviews and swung a hammer for a photograph. And we got hooked. I mean, that day, I learned how to frame a wall. I learned how to put a window in. I was like, 'I want to do this.' It's wonderful to give money. And we do that. We also sign items for charity. There are great ways to give. But getting in and getting your hands dirty, working alongside the homeowners, because Habitat's motto, which I love, is 'a hand up not a handout.' If you're gonna live in this house, you put in sweat equity. If they can't build for some reason, they work in the office, stuffing envelopes or whatever. They earn this home. So it's pretty amazing to see."
'Let's Be Frank' In February, she released a Frank Sinatra tribute album titled "Let's Be Frank."
"I've wanted to make a standards record for about 20 years," she says. "I grew up with my mom's music, which was a lot of things but she really loved old movies and musicals, so I knew all these songs since I was a kid."
That desire to do a full album of standards became more focused on Sinatra songs a couple years ago.

Texto completo: $500,000 TO GET your kid into an elite college? Not cool. But when news about Operation Varsity Blues came out, psychologists and parenting experts who've been following trends recognized it for what it was: just the latest outrageous example of bad parenting they've been observing for decades.
While the dollar signs were supersized, experts say that the bribes reveal the excessive lengths some parents will go to protect their kids — and by extension, themselves — from the burn of failure.
Parenting in America has become an extreme sport. By comparison, the late-20th century “helicopter" version, in which moms and dads hovered around their progeny, always at the ready with a Band-Aid or a cookie, seems mild. (Remember the proverbial trophy for every child and the over-the-top fifth-grade graduation ceremonies? How quaint.)
Now in the 21st century, we're seeing a new kind of parent, one who will go to even greater lengths not just to protect their kids, but to smash every perceived obstacle in their path to minimize failure and create the illusion of success. It's called “snowplow parenting," and it's driving a lot of parents into questionable situations, some downright illegal.
Snowplow parenting was identified as a generational phenomenon as early as 2004. That's when Jean Illsley Clarke, Connie Dawson, and David Bredehoft studied 1,195 participants and that year published the results in the book, “How Much Is Enough? Everything You Need to Know to Steer Clear of Overindulgence and Raise Likeable, Responsible and Respectful Children." In the book, they describe three types of parenting errors: over-doing (failing to teach the concept of “enough"); over-nurturing (doing things for children that they should be doing for themselves, or allowing children to think only about themselves); and soft structure (failure to establish rules in order to shield children from the consequences of their behaviors, including their impact on family and society).
Researchers have found that parents' increasingly elaborate efforts to protect their children from every possible disappointment has caused more harm than good: Coddled children lack the ability to tolerate life's normal frustrations and disappointments. (For an off-the-charts example, see Ethan Couch and the case of affluenza.)
Later, when the victims of snowplowing — the kids — try to figure things out as adults, they discover they can't handle even the most minor challenges. Psychologists are now dealing with an entirely new kind of patient who can't cope with normal setbacks, like losing a job or being unable to afford the latest gadget. What's worse, these formerly overprotected adults sometimes exhibit self-mutilation and other violent and/or anti-social behaviors. Hara Estroff Marano, a longtime editor-at-large at Psychology Today, was compelled to issue this warning: “Wake up America." Marano's 2008 manifesto “A Nation of Wimps: The High Cost of Invasive Parenting" documented a nationwide epidemic of immaturity and emotional fragility.
Why are parents flailing? Some snowplow parents admit that their behavior is a way to address their guilt for spending too much time away from their kids. (The number of work hours among all classes has increased over the past few decades.) But snowplowing is also the natural result of greater competition for fewer resources. In America, we are experiencing reduced opportunities at all levels, even among the most affluent. According to Chapman University's 2017 survey of fear in Americans, more than half of participants feared “not having enough money for the future," a feeling undoubtedly exacerbated by a steady stream of messages from advertisers telling us that what we have is inadequate.
An entire industry has developed around stoking parents' fears. Since 2004, the “Marketing to Moms" conference (known as “M2Moms") has been held annually to train marketing professionals to pick apart new mothers' every aspiration and fear, and then calculate how best to prey on those feelings in hopes of nabbing some of the more than $2 trillion American mothers spend annually.
Many educators have tried to correct course. While she was a dean at Stanford, Julie Lythcott-Haims witnessed the snowplowing up close. She observed parents in near-constant cell phone contact with their offspring; parents showing up to help their adult children enroll in classes; parents contacting professors and meeting with their children's advisers. Lythcott-Haims left the campus in 2012 to write “How to Raise an Adult: Break Free of the Overparenting Trap and Prepare Your Kid for Success," hoping to reach parents earlier in the parenting game. That same year, Jessica Lahey's book, “The Gift Of Failure," aimed at helping parents navigate the middle school years. New York Times columnist Frank Bruni tried to assuage parents caught up in the college-admissions mania with “Where You Go Is Not Who You'll Be: An Antidote to the College Admissions Mania."
In spite of attempts to get parents to chill, the pressure to protect, along with the rise of social media (which allows us to present a highly edited version of our lives to the world), has created a maelstrom of hyper-insecurity powered by ever more irrational ideas about “success."
And here's how we get to the bribing and cheating: Snowplow parents' greatest fear is that their coddled progeny will, at some, point fail. Of course, everyone stumbles in this world. But the irrational concern of the snowplower takes us straight to the dozens of one-percenters who were indicted last week. No doubt many of them were overindulgent parents who worried that if their overprotected children received that college rejection letter — a rite of passage for most Americans — it would deal a crushing blow to their puffed-up teenage egos.
Worse, the rejection letter would signal the incursion of the cruel world on artificially happy homes, precisely the kind of setback these snowplow parents have spent the last 17 years sheltering their kids from.
In this context, is it any wonder that the most affluent Americans have resorted to lying, cheating, and bribing to protect their kids at all costs? When you value the appearance of success rather than actual accomplishment, all's fair in love and college admissions.

Texto completo: If you see a robotic dragonfly buzzing around the Parker this week, it's because Jeff Bezos is back in town.
The billionaire founder of Amazon is in Palm Springs hosting the MARS conference, his annual closed-door showcase of flying machines and other shiny new technology at the Parker hotel on East Palm Canyon Drive. So far, this year's conference has included a robot that does yoga, a passenger drone and an appearance by actor Mark Hamill of Star Wars.
MARS, an acronym that stands for machine learning, automation, robotics and space, is an invite-only event in which attendees demo new technologies. The guest list is typically a mix of academics and people that work at tech companies.
A small clutch of reporters attended last year. The New York Times reported Amazon and Bezos handpicked the three-day event's roughly 200 guests, who engaged in afternoon activities ranging from cryotherapy to flight aerobatics and ended Sunday evening by gathering around a firepit.
In past years, Bezos has tweeted photos of himself piloting a giant robot suit inside the Palm Springs Air Museum and strolling beside a robotic dog.
Based on social media posts, this year's attendees include:
Natalya Bailey, CEO of Accion Systems
Lindy Elkins-Tanton, the director of the School of Earth and Space Exploration at Arizona State University
Nicky Fox, a project scientist for NASA's Parker Solar Probe
Mike Massimino, a professor at Columbia University and former NASA astronaut
Dava Newman, professor in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics at MIT
Siddhartha Srinivasa, director of robotics at Amazon
Ellen Stofan, director at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum
To get a peek at MARS, search for the hashtag #MARS2019 on Twitter.

New 'Arrested Development' episodes feel quite outdated; commentary

Texto completo: The first time I watched "Arrested Development" reminds me of the first time I drank a cup of joe. The show's rapid-fire banter, its subtle running jokes (even in the background of some episodes), the bizarre ensemble of unlikable but compulsively watchable characters and the exceedingly clever meta in-jokes peppered throughout it all made for an entirely new television experience. Like that coffee, I found the show exciting and energizing. It was a whole new world, suddenly burst open, and I didn't think I'd be able to look at TV the same way again.
As any caffeine-drinker knows, however, having the right amount of coffee is key. Too much, after all, isn't energizing but instead leads to a dull, insistent headache.
Netflix dropped eight episodes of "Arrested Development," comprising the second half of Season 5, on Friday. Many have suggested this might the final batch of episodes - and I pray they're correct.
The once-adored show has fallen out of favor twice since Netflix revived it. The first black eye came with Season 4 in 2013, seven years after its cancellation after three seasons on Fox in 2006. Showrunner Mitchell Hurwitz and his crew attempted a radical experiment in the streaming age: to create a show whose episodes could be watched in any order. Each episode followed one specific character and worked as a sort of puzzle, with no true beginning or ending. This was partially due to the cast's scheduling conflicts, but it also felt like a very "Arrested Development" ploy - only it failed miserably.
The second came with the first batch of Season 5 episodes, which dropped last May. They felt (somewhat) like a return to form, but the rollout was tainted by sexual harassment allegations against Jeffrey Tambor from fellow cast members from his Amazon show "Transparent," Trace Lysette and Van Barnes. Tambor was dropped from "Transparent" but remained on "Arrested Development" - which led to a disastrous roundtable interview in the New York Times in which Jessica Walter accused Tambor of being verbally abusive on-set, while the show's male cast members defended him and, in essence, ignored Walter.
But putting all that aside for a moment, and looking only at the content of this second half of Season 5 - it's still a tough hang, to put it lightly. The show is so mired in the past that its title no longer induces chuckles but groans. Humor, of course, is always subjective. But the new episodes don't really seem to traffic in jokes so much as nostalgia.
Sometimes, the humor feels outdated, such as the introduction of a group of hard-boiled, criminal gay men who call themselves the Gay Mafia. They fit into a plotline in which Gob has to pretend to be gay (or maybe he really is). The plotline is supposed to be meta, making fun of Gob for his insecurity with his own sexuality. But the jokes fail, leaving the enterprise feeling like the very gay panic humor it's attempting to mock.
At other times, the show's references feel painfully outdated. It's set just before the 2016 election, and the number of Hillary-is-sure-to-win jokes is exhausting. That's not even mentioning that a large plot point is set around the bumbling Bluths attempting to build a wall on the border of the United States and Mexico (oddly, to appease the Chinese). That's a tough sell for comedy these days.
But the biggest problem with the back half of Season 5 is that it's simply not funny.
"Arrested Development," once a wonderfully layered experience that rewarded repeated watches more than almost any other show, now just feels like work. It's the embodiment of a caffeine headache - insistent, annoying and, worst of all, dull.

Texto completo: The first drug specifically targeted at treating postpartum depression in new mothers has been approved, the Food and Drug Administration announced Tuesday.
Brexanolone, sold as Zulresso, is delivered as a continuous intravenous infusion over the course of 60 hours, the FDA says. The New York Times reports the drug works quickly — within two days — and is estimated to cost $20,000 or more.
"Postpartum depression is a serious condition that, when severe, can be life-threatening. Women may experience thoughts about harming themselves or harming their child," a release quotes Tiffany Farchione, the acting director of the Division of Psychiatry Products in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that postpartum depression nationally impacts one in nine women.
Currently, postpartum depression is treated with counseling and medication that can take weeks to work, The National Institute of Mental Health says. Untreated postpartum depression can last for months or years, NIMH says.
Feb. 21: The realities of postpartum, as told by celebrity moms Beyonce, Chrissy Teigen and more
June 2017: We all know about postpartum depression, but have you heard of postpartum anxiety?
Zulresso will only be available from certified health care facilities through a restricted program called the "Zulresso REMS Program," the FDA says.
Jeff Jonas — CEO of Sage Therapeutics, Inc. , the company that developed Zulresso — told CNN that the drug will be available in June.
The FDA approved Zulresso after two clinical studies demonstrated the medicine outperformed a placebo at improving symptoms of depression over a 30-day period, the FDA says.
Those studies were sponsored by Sage, which is working to offer a pill version of the treatment in the future, the Times reports.

Texto completo: The public on Tuesday will see the search warrant and other documents related to last year’s FBI raids on the home and office of Michael Cohen.
What we might learn: The origin of the investigation, the timeline of events, what investigators were looking for in their search and other details into the case of President Donald Trump’s former attorney and fixer.
U. S. District Judge William H. Pauley III on Monday ordered redacted versions of the documents to be released after nine news organizations, including ABC and CBS News, The Associated Press, CNN and The Wall Street Journal, sought to unseal them citing high public interest and a right to access.
In a Monday statement, Cohen’s lawyer Lanny Davis said the release of the documents furthers Cohen’s interest in “continuing to cooperate and providing information and the truth about Donald Trump and the Trump organization to law enforcement and Congress. ”
More: Did Trump keep his 19 promises to insulate himself from his business? Only he knows.
Opinion: Michael Cohen only flipped because he got caught. That's all we can expect in the Trump era.

Prosecutors had opposed the request, saying disclosure “would jeopardize an ongoing investigation and prejudice the privacy rights of uncharged third parties. ”
The judge’s order will allow for the redaction of information that could impact ongoing investigations. Cohen’s personal information — including phone numbers, email addresses and housing details — will be redacted, according to Pauley’s order.
Pauley acknowledged the media organizations’ point in a 30-page filing on February: “The public interest in the underlying subject matter of the materials — which implicates the integrity of the 2016 presidential election — is substantial," the judge wrote, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
In December, Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison by Pauley for crimes including lying to Congress and paying two women to keep quiet about alleged affairs with Trump. He is scheduled to report to prison in early May.
Cohen went before Congress in February to testify about illegal activities and lies he said he did on Trump’s behalf, labeling the president as “a con man” and “a cheat. ”
Of Cohen’s testimony, Trump said, “It was pretty shameful, I think,” adding that Cohen’s appearance before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee was a “fake hearing. ”
The New York Times, New York Post, Newsday and the Daily News were also among the news organizations in the legal action to access the Cohen documents.

Texto completo: Netflix's "Russian Doll" is arguably the first true TV hit of 2019. Created by Leslye Headland, Amy Poehler and the star of the series, Natasha Lyonne, the show might be described as a raunchier "Groundhog Day" set in New York's East Village. But there's more going on here than that.
As Lyonne's Nadia Vulvokov keeps dying and restarting her life, the team behind the show uses its looping structure to examine midlife crises, gentrification, our need for human connection and possibly the Tompkins Square riots. The reviews have been nearly unanimous in their praise, and as with shows like "Killing Eve" and "Stranger Things," viewers are still dissecting and analyzing it several weeks after its debut. Can't get enough "Russian Doll" yourself? Here's a roundup of great things to read about it.
Reviews
"'Russian Doll": Repetitive Death Syndrome' [ The New York Times]
In his pre-air review, James Poniewozik raved about the show, comparing it to recent eschatological TV comedies like "The Good Place" and "Forever." He writes: "Like its peers, 'Russian Doll' resolves on the necessity of human connection, a familiar homily, but it's too inventive and irascible to feel pat. This is a show with a big heart, but a nicotine-stained heart that's been dropped in the gutter and kicked around a few times."
"'Russian Doll" Is the First Great Show of 2019' [ Esquire]
Tyler Coates raves about the show, writing: "Russian Doll feels like an achievement, a high-concept premise told concisely in a structure that rarely feels confined or tight. It's both freewheeling and contained, and it accomplishes what most shows are unable to pull off: it tells a universal human story in a specific and carefully constructed world."
'Review: "Russian Doll," a Beautiful Puzzle of a Series So Good You'll Watch It Twice' [ LA Times]
Robert Lloyd at the Los Angeles Times offers one of several reviews pointing out the show's replay value, calling it "a beautiful puzzle piece, a circular, multiplane, existential mystery-comedy set in the villages of Lower Manhattan." He continues: "Peopled with memorable characters large and small, it's a show that having watched once -- not hard to do straight through and hard not to do straight through -- you may want to watch again, to admire its machinery and joinery and find the clues you might have missed, but also because it feels just as good the second time around."
'Acerbic Yet Warm, "Russian Doll" Is More Rewarding Than Any Puzzle-Box Show' [ The A.V. Club]
Danette Chavez offers a smart take on the show's flawed protagonist, writing: "The all-woman team behind Russian Doll -- which, aside from Lyonne, Poehler and Headland, includes director Jamie Babbit -- know just how special their lead is, and craft a story both worthy and reflective of her. As much as we might like her, Nadia is deeply flawed, so there are no beelines to betterment, no bromides to dull the show's stinging humor."
Features
'The Key to "Russian Doll" Might Be Tompkins Square Park' [ The New York Times]
Spurred by a series of Twitter posts from the critic Jason Zinoman, The Times's Aisha Harris investigates the theory that the narrative of "Russian Doll" is "an against the grain meditation on the cultural guilt" leftover from the violence that took place in Tompkins Square Park in 1988, and notes that Headland and Lyonne responded positively to this theory.
'How "Russian Doll" Unpacks Trauma and Emerges Triumphant' [ Variety]
Caroline Framke examines the ways in which "Russian Doll" unfolds like a therapy session in her excellent piece on the show's deeper themes and the way they're reflected in its structure. She writes: "By the end, "the broken man and the girl with a death wish" have to deal with the kind of pain they never thought they wanted to explore. But as "Russian Doll" ends up arguing so convincingly, the only way to stop feeling the dull throb of that pain every damn day is to stare it in the face, force it to blink, and move on from there."
'Returning to "Russian Doll," Again and Again' [Boston Globe]
It's rare to see a TV critic return so quickly to a show he has already reviewed in order to dive deeper into its themes, but Matthew Gilbert does exactly that, writing: "In a way, 'Russian Doll' asks what happens when death is off the table. As her reincarnation loop continues -- in episode two, that loop is so speedy that it's played for farce -- Nadia is prodded out of her perpetual sense of pointlessness; her apprehension of death is no longer making her human needs seem futile. The worst happens, she dies, but: It only brings her more life, more chances."
"'Russian Doll" Casts Men in Roles Usually Reserved for Women. The Results Are Brilliant.' [ Vox]
Todd VanDerWerff noticed how the roles played by men in "Russian Doll" were the kind typically cast with women. "In particular, if you look at how Russian Doll uses men, you'll realize how deep the series' interest in centering women's perspectives goes," he writes. "This show uses men the way most pop culture uses women -- which is to say it turns them into supporting players whose inner lives are mostly glossed over in the name of what the protagonist is going through."
Interviews
'Natasha Lyonne Has a New Life. It's Just That She Keeps Dying.' [ The New York Times]
Kathryn Shattuck had a pre-premiere chat with Lyonne about New York, the show's semi-autobiographical themes, the all-female writers' room and more. Speaking about the way death is used is in the show, Lyonne says: "There's probably a bit of a misconception around how key the deaths are. It was more an emotional story of bottoming out. There are metaphorical deaths big and small throughout the day: There are the bigger ones where you just feel like your whole world is collapsing, [because of] health or a relationship falling apart. Then there's the smaller deaths of the text message that didn't get responded to that you're obsessing on, and it feels like you're suddenly a hollow man inside."
'How Do You Dress a Russian Doll?' [ The New York Times]
Ruth La Ferla takes a look at the fashion of "Russian Doll," speaking to the program's costume designer, Jenn Rogien, who also worked on "Girls" and "Orange Is the New Black." Rogien says: "We needed these characters to feel cool and interesting. But we also needed them to feel like real people trapped in a very strange circumstance."
"'Russian Doll": What Made Natasha Lyonne Leap Into Directing Her Netflix Comedy' [ IndieWire]
The creators Natasha Lyonne and Leslye Headland spoke to IndieWire about how they assembled a very close team of personal friends to make the show, and about the vibe of a female-fronted production. Headland joked that day players would comment on how smooth and relaxed everything was on set. "And it was like, 'Yeah, because it's a female AD, and a female director, and a female showrunner and star,"' she said.
"'Russian Doll"'s Charlie Barnett on Alan, Oatmeal, and the Bachelorette Party That Changed His Life' [ Vulture ]
Charlie Barnett, who plays Alan, spoke to Vulture about his time on the show, revealing that they shot multiple endings to the season -- and that he had been too busy to see which one made it to Netflix: "I have to admit, I actually don't even know how it ends. I'm working on another smaller movie with Jamie Babbit right now, and it was also my birthday like two days ago -- I was waiting until I got back home to Los Angeles to finish watching it because I'd only got to episode three."
"'Russian Doll" Creators Say Working With Only Female Directors and Writers on the Netflix Show Happened by Accident but Was "Freeing"' [ Insider]
Headland goes into more detail about the impact of an all-female writing and directing team on "Russian Doll." "It isn't about finding a romantic partner," she says. "It isn't about balancing parenthood and motherhood. It isn't about trying to infiltrate a work force where almost in every industry we're underpaid and underrepresented."
Other Fun Stuff
'This Is That Song From "Russian Doll"' [ The New York Times]
Every time Nadia arrives back in the bathroom at her 36th birthday party, viewers hear the same song, Harry Nilsson's "Gotta Get Up." Aisha Harris offers not just a chance to hear that song again, but Lyonne's comments on why they chose Nilsson. "There was always a kind of ending that was unpleasant that was percolating under the surface of his songs," Lyonne says, "even at their most upbeat and certainly at their darkest."
'Here Are the "Russian Doll" Easter Eggs You Missed While You Were Trying to Figure Out WTF Was Going On' [ Cosmopolitan]
Hannah Chambers has a fun piece that breaks down the references and Easter eggs embedded in "Russian Doll" from the meaning behind that Ariadne poster over Nadia's desk to the revelation that three actors play multiple roles. "The good news is, creators Natasha Lyonne, Amy Poehler and Leslye Headland loaded this series up with tons of Easter eggs, so its binge value is super high," Chambers writes. "Here are some of the hidden details you may have missed while you were freaking out over the prospect of falling down your apartment steps and dying."
'The Deeper Meaning of Russian Doll's Most Mysterious Character, Horse' [ Polygon]
Over at Polygon, Karen Han takes a deeper look at one of the show's most interesting supporting personalities, the homeless man named Horse. She writes, "Rather than being doomed to repeat himself like Nadia or Alan (Charlie Barnett), or being utterly oblivious, as all of Nadia and Alan's friends and family appear to be, Horse seems to possess some grain of agency or knowledge that places him just out of that frame -- he's almost a shepherd."
'Relive the Magic of "Russian Doll" With Its Official Playlist on Spotify' [ Nerdist]
This excellent article on the music of "Russian Doll" offers not only a way to listen to the show's diverse soundtrack but also reveals that Lyonne almost chose songs by Lou Reed and Roxy Music to serve as the tune that Nadia hears every time she "awakens." A s the writer Lindsey Romain notes, however: "it isn't the only song that gives Russian Doll its unique edge. The series is a brilliant, heart-wrenching meditation on topics like mental illness, addiction, and endless cycle of self-destruction, and the entire soundtrack is loaded with gems reflecting its themes. The track list includes jams from John Maus, the Echocentrics, Cults, Pussy Riot, and more."

Rep. Steve King posts meme bragging red states have ‘8 trillion bullets’

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Rep. Steve King posted a meme during the weekend about a hypothetical civil war between "blue states" fighting over which bathroom to use and "red states" with trillions of bullets.
The post is an image of two figures composed of traditionally Democratic-leaning and Republican-leaning states in fighting postures with text superimposed over top. The caption reads: "Folks keep talking about another civil war. One side has about 8 trillion bullets, while the other side doesn't know which bathroom to use."
"Wonder who would win?" the Iowa Republican wrote on Facebook.
Mediaite
The image appears to have originated in a 2013 New York Times book review by Michael Kinsley titled "War of Umbrage."
King's post comes at a time when Muslim civil rights leaders and others have urged for political leaders to be thoughtful in their rhetoric in light of the mass shooting targeting two New Zealand mosques last week that left at least 50 people dead.
King may have posted the meme without much deliberation, as it escaped his notice that Iowa is pictured as a "blue state."
The post follows weeks of lobbying by King for Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy to reinstate him to congressional committee posts.
King was stripped of committee assignments by congressional leadership following years of white nationalist statements, most recently in an interview with The New York Times.
"White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization -- how did that language become offensive?" King said in the January article.
King disputes the quote in a letter to McCarthy that he has asked supporters to endorse.
"In January 2019, The New York Times misquoted me and misrepresented my beliefs as a freedom-loving American," King wrote.
The form letter also includes a button to donate to the King for Congress political committee.
CBS
King was defiant in a February interview with Iowa Public Television insisting "I have nothing to apologize for."
While King disavowed white nationalism, he also argued that term has been "weaponized by the left" to mean racism, but did not provide his own definition of the term.
King has often voiced the far-right theory that immigration and diversity will lead to a collapse of Western civilization. Advocacy groups dedicated to rooting out hate speech say "Western civilization" used in that context is a euphemism for whites.
King voted "present" on a resolution condemning religious intolerance earlier this month.

NJ is trying to give residents more control over their personal data

Texto completo: "It is absolutely a best practice for states to be reviewing their current data breach notification laws."
Eva Velasquez
President and CEO of the Identity Theft Resource Center
The headlines are constant: Millions of accounts hacked. Health and financial data stolen. Personal information shared widely with advertisers and technology companies.
New Jersey is not immune. More than 4 million New Jersey accounts were affected by security breaches in 2017, according to the most recent state estimates, and a Pew survey published that year found that a majority of Americans have personally experienced some sort of data theft or fraud.
Welcome to the new normal.
Against that backdrop, New Jersey is starting to grapple with some of the thorniest questions of the digital age. Yes, consumers can take steps to protect themselves online, as outlined by the state's cybersecurity unit. But what responsibilities do companies have in collecting your personal information? Who controls that data? And what should be done if it's compromised?
State policymakers are debating those issues right now. New Jersey law already requires companies to tell customers when information such as Social Security or credit card numbers is hacked, but a bill on Gov. Phil Murphy's desk would expand that list to include things like email addresses and passwords, which are often all that is needed to break into an online account.
Other measures working their way through the Legislature would allow online users to opt out of having their personal information shared with third parties and require mobile apps to better inform users of how their location data may be used.
The reexamination of New Jersey's laws governing cybersecurity and online privacy comes in the wake of numerous high-profile data breaches — affecting Marriott, Yahoo, Panera, Under Armour, Target, Equifax and Home Depot, to name just a few companies — and as incidents like the Cambridge Analytica scandal involving the unauthorized use of Facebook profiles have made people more sensitive to how tech firms monetize user-generated information.
This month, The New York Times reported that Facebook is under criminal investigation for data-sharing deals it made with scores of other technology companies that provided intrusive access to users' personal information.
Dozens of other states are looking to update their consumer protection policies, too. At least 31 states, for example, considered legislation to amend existing security breach laws last year, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
"It is absolutely a best practice for states to be reviewing their current data breach notification laws and any of the laws that are around identity crimes and cybersecurity and things of that nature because this is such a dynamic space," said Eva Velasquez, president and CEO of the Identity Theft Resource Center, a nonprofit that offers free assistance to victims of identity theft and provides educational resources about online fraud and security.
Her organization tracked 1,244 security breaches that occurred throughout the U.S. in 2018, exposing a staggering 447 million records — more than double the number of records exposed the previous year.
The proposals in New Jersey could have sweeping effects on consumers and companies alike.
The measure closest to becoming law, S-52, would force companies to disclose data breaches involving an expanded definition of "personal information." The bipartisan bill was approved unanimously in the Legislature and now awaits a signature or veto by Murphy, a Democrat.
Current state law mandates that companies tell customers when their driver's license numbers, Social Security numbers, account numbers or credit or debit card numbers have been compromised. The bill would expand that list to include user names, email addresses and passwords or security questions and answers that could be used to gain access to an online account.
"You take someone's user name and password — that can already be linked to their credit card account" on many websites, said Sen. Troy Singleton, D-Burlington, a sponsor of the bill. With notification of the breach, however, consumers can potentially take defensive measures or at least monitor the compromised account more closely, he said.
Another bill that has yet to receive a hearing in committee, A-3541, gets to the heart of another big question after security breaches: When do customers have the right to know that their information was compromised?
Current law simply says disclosures must be made "in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay." The bill would accelerate that timeline, requiring companies to disclose a breach to customers within five days of discovering it unless it is still under investigation by the company or law enforcement.
Other proposals would change what data companies have control of in the first place.
One measure, A-4974, would require mobile apps that collect users' GPS data to share how that data is used and require users to opt in to the disclosure of that data to third parties, such as advertisers.
Another measure, S-2834, is modeled on language from the European Union's sweeping new data protection legislation, known as the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. It would require commercial websites and services to tell users all the "personally identifiable information" they collect and give users a chance to opt out of having that data shared with third parties.
A similar provision was included in the California Consumer Privacy Act, which was also modeled on the GDPR and signed into law last year.
Those bills, which have been approved in one committee but must clear several more procedural hurdles before becoming law, have encountered resistance from companies whose business models depend on the collection and sale of personal information.
Asked for her suggestions about how people can improve the security of their personal information, Velasquez, of the Identity Theft Resource Center, emphasized the need to think critically about where to share such information in the first place.
"Once you release data or provide data to an entity, the ball is now in their court to be good stewards of that data," she said. "Make that decision carefully."
"It is absolutely a best practice for states to be reviewing their current data breach notification laws."

Texto completo: In search of something to read? USA TODAY's Barbara VanDenburgh scopes out the shelves for this week's hottest new book releases.
"House on Fire" by Bonnie Kistler (Atria Books, fiction, on sale March 12) What it's about: A blended family is plunged into crisis when the son of one parent kills the daughter of the other in a drunk-driving accident. Husband and wife are torn in their loyalties – to their children and each other – as the trial date looms, and the kid's story keeps changing. A suspenseful debut rooted in family tragedy.
The buzz: "Evocative writing and wholly realized characters complement a multifaceted tale that's both harrowing and profound," says Kirkus Reviews.
"An Elegant Defense: The Extraordinary New Science of the Immune System" by Matt Richtel (William Morrow, non-fiction, on sale March 12) What it's about: Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times journalist Matt Richtel provides a deeply reported and entertainingly written exploration of the human immune system and how it works, told through the intimate stories of four lives grappling with mortality.
The buzz: "Richtel creates a hard-to-put-down account of the body's first line of defense," says Publishers Weekly.
"The Dragonfly Sea" by Yvonne Adhiambo Owuor (Knopf, fiction, on sale March 12) What it's about: On Pate Island, off the coast of Kenya, a young girl yearning for the father she never knew bonds with a sailor and soon finds herself called to the sea. With a rich and enormous cast of global characters, Owuor depicts the cultural complexities of East Africa in a stirring story of loss and discovery.
The buzz: A starred review in Publishers Weekly calls it a "sprawling, beautiful novel," an epic that "establishes Owuor as a considerable talent."
"Soldier, Sailor, Frogman, Spy, Airman, Gangster, Kill or Die: How the Allies Won on D-Day" by Giles Milton (Henry Holt, non-fiction, on sale March 12) What it's about: In time for the 75th anniversary of D-Day comes this anecdotal history of that fateful day when Allied forces landed on the beaches of Normandy. The day is narrated in a symphony of surviving voices – a teenage Allied conscript, a French resistance fighter, a butcher's daughter – placing the reader in the heat of the action.
The buzz: Kirkus Reviews calls the book a "worthy commemoration of a key historical moment."
"Too Much Is Not Enough," by Andrew Rannells (Crown, non-fiction, on sale March 12) What it's about: Actor and star of Broadway's "The Book of Mormon" and HBO's "Girls" Andrew Rannells tells the story of his life so far in a charming memoir that charts his journey from a hopeful and sexually confused Nebraska kid with big ambitions to the bright lights of New York City.
The buzz: Kirkus Reviews calls it an "inspiring and consistently witty entertainment memoir."

Texto completo: The Pentagon is reportedly lobbying for a more lenient standard for cleaning up toxic chemicals used for decades in firefighting foam that have been found in drinking water in southern El Paso County and around the country.
Even if the Pentagon is successful, the Air Force appears unlikely to get off the hook for cleaning up the contaminated Widefield aquifer serving tens of thousands of residents south of Colorado Springs, state health officials said.
The Defense Department’s push to revise safety standards comes as it faces billions of dollars in cleanup costs tied to its decades-long use of a firefighting foam laced with per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances. The chemicals, known as PFAS, are tied to cancer, liver disease and low infant birth weight.
The lobbying appears aimed at influencing the Environmental Protection Agency’s groundwater cleanup standard — a level at which cleanup would be required of polluters.
In a report to Congress, the Pentagon said an appropriate level is 380 parts per trillion, the New York Times reported. It’s at least five times what the EPA says could be harmful to people, and dozens of times higher than another federal agency says is toxic to people.
At that level, the military could avoid paying to clean up many contaminated sites across the nation, said David Andrews, senior scientist for the Washington D.C.-based Environmental Working Group, an advocacy group.
“Even if it’s the same number of sites, the amount of cleanup you’re doing at each site would be drastically reduced,” Andrews said. “The likely impact is that DoD is really trying to pass on the responsibilities and the cost for cleaning up this contamination. Which is dreadful.”
In a statement, the Pentagon said it takes its cleanup responsibility “seriously.”
“DOD is not seeking a different or weaker cleanup standard but wants the standard risk-based cleanup approach that is based on science and applies to everyone,” the statement said.
Still, one of Delaware’s Democratic U.S. senators, Tom Carper, claimed in a letter to the EPA that the Defense Department is currently only cleaning up sites where groundwater readings exceed 400 parts per trillion, and only removing the chemicals to 70 ppt. The Pentagon was joined by NASA and the Small Business Administration in lobbying for more relaxed standards, the senator said.
The Pentagon report only referenced two PFAS varieties — PFOA and PFOS — even though thousands of other varieties are known to exist. The report was issued last year, and reported Thursday by The New York Times, along with Carper’s letter.
The Defense Department’s maneuvering is expected to have little impact on cleanup operations around Peterson Air Force Base, Colorado health officials say.
State regulations would still force the Air Force to clean up the tainted Widefield aquifer to a more stringent standard that is in line with the EPA’s current health advisory, according to Kelly MacGregor, a Colorado Department of Health and Environment spokeswoman.
The state’s Water Quality Control Commission voted unanimously in April to adopt a site-specific groundwater quality standard of 70 ppt for the same two chemicals — PFOA and PFOS — combined.
Even without the state standard, the aquifer’s contamination downstream from the base is so bad that cleanup efforts around Peterson would likely go unaffected by the Pentagon’s lobbying.
Seven wells drilled about three years ago in the Widefield aquifer showed PFOS at levels of 400 ppt or greater. One well drilled at the Colorado Springs Airport found the chemical at 1,600 ppt.
Neither the state’s adopted groundwater standard, nor lobbying efforts in Washington, D.C., touch on the thousands of other types of chemicals, also called perfluorinated compounds.
For communities affected by use of the foam, such as Security, Widefield and Fountain, that could be a significant problem, Andrews said.
For example, another type of chemical called PFHxS is often associated with use of the firefighting foam. And no other type of perfluorinated compound was as common in drinking water samples taken from Security or Fountain wells as PFHxS, nor present at such high levels, according to EPA drinking water data.
A couple of other chemicals were reported as frequently in wells serving Widefield. But again, none were as consistently high as PFHxS.
It also has been found in the drinking water of dozens of other water districts across the country, EPA results show. The federal Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry says it could cause liver damage and a decreased ability to respond to vaccines.
Several other types of PFAS also have raised health concerns while being found in water systems across the country.
“Really we’d like to see the EPA and the DoD focusing on reducing the total PFAS contamination ... shifting into high gear and taking responsibility for cleaning up all of this contamination,” Andrews said.
The military has previously avoided addressing the foam, despite concerns about its toxicity. A Gazette investigation in 2016 found the Air Force ignored decades of warnings about the foam’s dangers, including studies by its own researchers dating to the 1970s that showed chemicals like those in the foam were harmful to laboratory animals.
Congress has allocated tens of millions of dollars from the Defense Department to address contamination in El Paso County, including helping install treatment plants for water districts and filters on private wells.
But local water districts have been stuck with another roughly $9.5 million in unreimbursed costs, which the Air Force says it cannot pay back. The Security Water District and the Pikes Peak Community Foundation, which owns Venetucci Farm, recently filed a federal lawsuit against the U.S. government seeking at least $18.3 million in past and future costs related to the contamination.
Also, the Air Force is in the midst of a yearslong process to address the chemicals that is similar to the federal Superfund program. Air Force officials issued a report in summer 2017 that admitted chemicals from the foam had leached into the surrounding groundwater. A follow-up report with more test data is expected to be finalized in May.
Even more studies must be completed before any cleanup takes place, however, and they have yet to be funded by Congress, Peterson officials said. Cleanup of the aquifer is not expected until the 2020s, if Congress allocates money for it.

Texto completo: By Abby Mims

Special to The Washington Post

We were meeting with the family again about their daughter's application to Stanford. I had already edited at least a dozen versions of each of the three short essays the school required. Now, her application was projected onto a large screen, and the director of the boutique Silicon Valley college admissions company where I worked was instructing me to move commas and change the order of her activities to "strengthen" her profile.

This was a ridiculous and largely meaningless exercise because we had already polished it to perfection during countless meetings before. Plus, the student whose portfolio we were massaging was exceptionally accomplished -- and she was a legacy to boot. She was primed for Stanford, and further finessing her application was theater to me, yet it was exactly the kind of reassurance her parents were paying tens of thousands of dollars for. As they waited for the director to deem their daughter worthy of applying to the school under restrictive early action, they were anxious, even fearful. When she eventually gave the green light, their relief was palpable.

When I started in college admission the better part of a decade ago, I was stunned at how much parents were willing to pay for the promise of getting their children into an elite school. Even securing our services was motivated by scarcity and status: We took only a few dozen students a year and always ran a wait list. What surprised me even more was what some parents were willing to

do on behalf of their kids, from forcing them into endless STEM activities and community service hours to defying all professional advice and writing their children's application essays themselves.

Knowing all this, I wasn't at all surprised by the latest admissions scandal that broke this week. Fifty people, including the actresses Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin, were charged with bribing coaches and exam proctors to help their children gain admission to universities such as Stanford, UCLA and Wake Forest. Some went so far as to photoshop their kids' faces onto athletes' bodies so they could get "recruited" for sports they didn't actually play.

Regarding the recent arrests, one prosecutor stated, "There cannot be a separate college admissions system for the wealthy." This is a nice sentiment, but it's built on an entirely false premise, one I saw again and again during my own time in admissions consulting. Like too many of the parents of young people I worked with, these adults were acting out of their own insecurities and greed, likely to bolster their own status and bragging rights at parties, all while claiming to be pursuing the best interests of their children.

The system is already broken and has been rigged for the wealthy and powerful for decades, even when no overt quid pro quo can be identified. The rich not only have money, they have social capital -- the kind that fosters connections to university board members, big donors and those at the highest level of the administration, all of which are often leveraged in admissions.

For the wealthy, getting into top schools is a contest not of true merit or character, but a way of gaming the system, with helicopter parents and overachieving teens at the helm, padding résumés and hiring tutors and private admissions counselors, including unscrupulous ones such as William Singer, who appears to be at the heart of the current debacle.

For those outside the system, the actions of these parents probably seem strange, if not downright bizarre. But from the inside, they simply don't. The college admissions process elicits extreme levels of stress and panic, and college counseling has become a widespread industry, with the number of independent consultants increasing by as much as 400 percent between 2005 and 2018. This is not only because of increasing wealth and dwindling acceptance rates, but also because of the fear of not achieving a certain level of societal status and therefore, success. This mind-set potentially helps explain why famous actresses and professionals went to such lengths to cheat the system for their children.

I've witnessed firsthand the genuine belief, among students and parents alike, that without an acceptance to an Ivy League or similarly ranked school, they will not succeed in life. This is a ridiculous notion, but one that was often accepted blindly. One student I worked with, who attended a venerable prep school, was struggling academically, and the added pressure of college applications was too much -- he stopped working on his essays and answering my emails. I told his parents that he might not be ready for college, and a gap year could give him a chance to regroup. His father listened, and he was concerned, but he wanted to move forward with the process. Not long after, his son fell apart entirely and dropped out of school.

"What will we do?" his father said after it happened. "How can we get him back on track?"

Then there was the brilliant programmer. He had been recruited by Google more than once after winning several online code jams, as they didn't realize he was still in high school. But he also had a C on his transcripts, which supposedly meant he couldn't get into the schools his parents' had dreamed of him attending.

"I'm already a failure," he told me. "I don't even think I can get into college."

Equally frustrating and heartbreaking moments like these were common. I tried to reassure students that there was a college for everyone, and often asked them what it was about elite universities that they believed would make such a difference in their lives. Most couldn't tell me. It was all about brand name cache, not about programs offered or, more importantly, if the school was somewhere they could actually grow and thrive.

In my more recent years as a college adviser, I worked at a different company with a broader range of students, where this question of "best fit college" was front and center in our counseling services. We asked all of our students: What do you love to do? How are you pursuing those passions, and what kind of school will match those interests best? Though it was a supportive environment -- and despite my best efforts -- I felt at times that my involvement in the admissions machine was only feeding the stress and anxiety that high schoolers already face. I was also still catering to a privileged pool of students, since they could afford our services.

That student whose essay we'd projected on the screen got into Stanford, of course, but I do wonder who wanted it more, the student or her parents? Although additional details about the latest scandal are bound to come out, many outlets are reporting that most of the students themselves weren't aware of what their parents were doing behind the scenes to get them admitted. If this is true, to me, it is one of the more telling details of the case, further affirming that too many parents push their kids for reasons that have relatively little to do with the kids themselves.

Though my own doubts ultimately carried me out of the counseling industry, I still think about the father whose son had collapsed under the pressure.

"Who will he be?" he asked after his son announced that he wouldn't be applying to any colleges, let alone elite ones.

I didn't have an answer for him then, but now I would say: Why don't you ask your son who he is right this moment, and then, if he's willing to tell you -- listen.

Texto completo: ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia - A new piece of evidence found by investigators on the ground here suggests the Ethiopian Airlines flight that crashed Sunday may have had a problem with a new flight-control system also suspected in the crash of a Lion Air flight in October.
It is the second piece of information suggesting similarities between the two crashes involving Boeing 737 Max 8 jets.
Investigators found a device known as a jackscrew in the wreckage. The jackscrew, used to set the trim that raises and lowers the plane's nose, indicates the jet was configured to dive, according to John Cox, a former pilot and an airline-safety consultant with the Washington-based aviation-safety consulting firm Safety Operating Systems.
Cox, formerly the top safety official for the Air Line Pilots Association, said he was privately briefed on the evidence Thursday by people familiar with the investigation.
"All we can say definitely is that the trim was in a position similar to the position found on the Lion Air airplane and it would cause the nose to go down," he said. "This will be consistent with a nose-down flight path, which they think is likely with the Ethiopian airplane.
"It points to one central link," Cox said. "We need the data from the flight data recorders. We need it as quickly as possible. . . . The faster that we get that information, it will let everyone know what needs to be done. We don't know in fact if these accidents are related. There are some similarities."
Daniel K. Elwell, acting administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration, cited newly refined satellite tracking data and evidence recovered from the wreckage site as factors in his decision to ground the jets Wednesday. That data also showed similarities to the Lion Air flight. Cox said he believes the jackscrew is the new evidence Elwell was citing.
Meanwhile, French aviation experts began work Friday on the plane's heavily damaged data and voice recorders.
Officials with France's Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses, which has extensive experience analyzing crashes in Europe, said that work to retrieve information from the flight data recorder of the Boeing 737 Max 8 has begun in coordination with the Ethiopian investigation team.
President Trump spoke by telephone with Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed on Friday to again express his condolences and underscore the United States' commitment to work with Ethiopian and international civil aviation authorities on the investigation. Eight Americans were among the 157 killed in the crash.
The focus now, however, is on the two "black boxes" that arrived in France on Thursday. Germany had earlier turned down the opportunity to examine the recorders.
The data extracted from the recorders will be used to reconstruct the six-minute flight before the plane crashed in a farm field about 40 miles from Addis Ababa, killing all 157 passengers and crew members. That data includes the voice communication of the pilots and the readings of the various sensors.
Officials from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which sent three investigators, the FAA, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency and Boeing also are assisting in the probe.
Experts say it typically takes almost a month to provide a comprehensive analysis of the data in the recorders, but at least some early information could be available within 24 to 48 hours.
Former NTSB chairman Christopher Hart, who also is a pilot, said the jackscrew, combined with data gathered from the plane's black box, could give investigators a sense of the plane's flying position before the crash.
"By knowing the stabilizer and elevator position they know what kind of forces the plane was experiencing in the moment," he said.
In a preliminary investigation, the crash of a Lion Air Max 8 plane into the Java Sea on Oct. 29 was attributed to a faulty sensor causing an automated system to push the nose of the plane down. The possibility that the same scenario occurred in Ethiopia has prompted precautionary groundings of the plane all over the world. In all, more than 300 people have died in the two crashes involving the Max 8 jet.
Preliminary flight data showed the Ethiopian Airlines plane in trouble almost immediately and struggling to gain altitude in the high thin air above the Addis Ababa airport. The plane descended and then sharply ascended, while moving at speeds far in excess of normal.
Within minutes the pilot radioed the control tower reporting "flight control" problems and was given clearance to return.
In a description of the exchange reported by the New York Times, Capt. Yared Getachew sounded panicked as he requested permission to return to the airport, shortly before losing contact.
Even amid the worldwide grounding of more than 370 of its 737 Max jets, officials at Boeing continued to maintain the planes are safe to fly. The Chicago-based aviation giant has stopped delivery of the planes, a spokesman said Thursday, but their production continues.
In the case of the Lion Air crash in Indonesia, faulty information from the angle-of-attack sensor convinced the automated system that the plane was going to stall and pushed its nose down while the pilots wrestled to pull the aircraft up. The result was an erratic flight path in which the plane descended and ascended repeatedly before plunging into the Java Sea, killing all 189 passengers and crew aboard.
The data from the recorders in Ethiopia could help determine whether the potential links between the two crashes are real and related to this automated feature on the craft - hundreds of which were flown around the world until China decided to ground them Monday and other countries followed suit.
The recorders are required on all flights - all over the world - and are built to withstand fire, heavy impact and intense water pressure.
The Ethiopian Airlines devices were discovered soon after the crash, leading some U.S. officials to hope the insights they contain will quickly help determine more about what caused the jet to crash shortly after it left Addis Ababa bound for Nairobi.
While Ethiopian investigators have the ability to download information from black boxes, they lacked the tools to do so in this case, given the extensive damage, according to the FAA.
Experts were not surprised the Ethiopians opted to send the flight recorders to France rather than the United States, saying such a move was not unprecedented.
"Many times foreign countries just have a good relation with a certain other country," said Jeff Guzzetti, a former NTSB investigator and FAA safety manager. "It is closer to fly the recorders to Europe than it is to the United States. From a technical standpoint, the United States would have been the best place to have it because all your technical experts are in the United States. But in past investigations, foreign countries would not opt to send to the U.S., because they were the ones who built the airplane"

Texto completo: Goldman Sachs, one of the last bastions of crisp-collared, bespoke-suited workplace attire, has loosened up. It announced an official "firm-wide flexible dress code" earlier this month. And at last - after the long, slow undoing of corporate formality - business casual seems to have triumphed in the American workplace.
But for women and minorities who have been playing corporate catch-up for decades, a more casual dress code presents its own complications.
As one Goldman Sachs banker in GQ put it: "All the men are psyched."
For everyone else, dressing more casually for work can be fraught, even risky. Over decades, expensive suits have projected power on Wall Street, almost like a piece of "armor," said Susan Scafidi, academic director of the Fashion Law Institute at Fordham University.
Women at work who feel pressure to prove they deserve to be in the room might be wary of ditching their blazers and pumps.
"We've just achieved the parity of the pantsuit, and suddenly we're told the standard pantsuit is no longer standard workforce attire," Scafidi said. "Women will need to find another way to achieve parity in attire at business casual or some other lower level of formality."
Parity, of course, extends not only to power, but to pay.
Jaclyn Wong, who researches the intersection of gender and professional life, co-published a study in 2016 looking at the differences in how men and women are rewarded for attractiveness in the workplace.
Attractive men and women make roughly 20 percent more than their less-attractive co-workers, Wong found. Even so, they are measured by different standards.
For women, perceived attractiveness is based on grooming, such as hairstyle, makeup, fitness and clothing. They are rewarded, Wong said, for looking the part.
For men, grooming counts far less. If attractive, they tend to be rewarded whether they are well-groomed or not.
"We know that appearance matters for women and people of color in being seen as competent and worthy of respect," said Wong, a professor of sociology at the University of South Carolina. "It becomes this difficult position: 'Do I want to dress down because I don't want to be seen as this kind of stiff and un-fun person, or do I want to continue dressing up because that's the only way people will treat me with respect?' "
Goldman Sachs is following other firms in a hunt for tech talent that is most comfortable with the sneakers and hoodies of Silicon Valley. It is also accommodating a growing number of millennials in its workforce - with about 75 percent of its workers under 40 and dressing in a way that fits more casually dressed clients.
The investment bank, which announced the change in a memo, called for employees to "please dress in a manner that is consistent with your clients' expectations" but stressed that they should "exercise good judgment." A spokeswoman declined to comment beyond the memo.
"Good judgment," of course, is open to interpretation.
"You have to decide: How do you present yourself when you're often the only woman in the room?" said Jane Newton, a managing partner at RegentAtlantic. Newton spent 17 years at JPMorgan and runs a forum for women in leadership on Wall Street. "In a male-dominated environment, gravitas becomes a key variable in decisions that are made about your potential."
Workers tend to take their signals from the top. According to the lore of corporate America, IBM made its first big leap decades ago when executives such as Louis V. Gerstner Jr. changed up the uniform of suit and tie and white collar - by mixing in blue button-down shirts.
A 1995 headline in the New York Times read "Black Jeans Invade Big Blue" after Gerstner said he was rolling out casual dress. Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard's relaxed "Blue Sky Days" on Fridays were said to influence future generations of tech entrepreneurs.
Today, it's Goldman CEO David Solomon, who performs as a DJ in his spare time and has appeared in interviews without a tie.
In the '80s and '90s, there were few role models for women on Wall Street, Newton said, so they tried to blend in. Men in suits cut imposing figures, so women wore blazers with padded shoulders. Men wore ties, so women wore blouses with pussy bows.
Fashion is far more flexible now, she said, but younger women still ask Newton the same questions about how to present themselves to be taken seriously. Sometimes she offers to go shopping with them, or she pages through catalogues to show what works and what doesn't.
Women on Wall Street have adapted to more casual norms. But some still face the possibility that they could be perceived as lacking power when they dress down at work, said Laura Sherbin, managing director of Culture@Work, a division of Working Mother Media that helps companies develop best practices around diversity.
"When a woman is dressed informally, she's more likely to be assumed to be more junior" or to be someone's assistant, Sherbin said. The topic of dress codes still comes up all the time in focus groups she does at companies, she said.
Sherbin recalls working with one management consulting client that had a relaxed dress code. She complimented a sharply dressed female executive whose look - black dress, edgy black leather jacket with zippers - was powerful. The executive, who was headed into a tough strategy meeting, told Sherbin she was relieved to hear it.
"I want to walk in the room and be seen as fierce and somebody who's not going to back down so instantly," the executive said. "I never would have worn pastels today."
For women of color, issues of image at the office are thornier. In schools throughout the country, girls of color are more likely to be punished for dress code violations, according to a report by the National Women's Law Center.
Even the freshmen women of Congress - the most female and diverse group ever - have inspired a huge amount of discussion about red lipstick, hoop earrings and ethnic garb. In some cases, much more than about their actual platforms and ideas.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez put it this way: "If I walked into Congress wearing a sack, they would laugh & take a picture of my backside. If I walk in with my best sale-rack clothes, they laugh & take a picture of my backside."
A more relaxed dress code means a broader range of choices, and "a broader range of choices means greater possibility for error," Scafidi said. "So while men will naturally gravitate toward old-fashioned polos and khakis - or possibly to fleece and jeans - women don't have a business casual uniform in the same way."
Maureen Sherry worked 12 years on Wall Street and was the youngest managing director at Bear Stearns.
"Women never walked in wearing khakis or athleisurewear," she said. "Professional women just didn't do that because we wanted to be in meetings and not have our outfit be a point of discussion."
She wrote a novel, "Opening Belle," about a female Wall Street executive, based partly on her experience as well as interviews with other women.
"A friend of mine wore the first pantsuit on the Salomon Brothers trading floor in 1991, and it caused an uproar," she said. "She still has it" as a kind of trophy.
Today, she said, "if you saw a woman wearing Birkenstocks or loafers, we'd like to think that we're not taking her less seriously as a result, but I'm not sure if that's true."
Although shifting norms add to the litany of micro-decisions women must make before they set foot in the office, they do signal more freedom.
In the past, Newton said, "there were these clear, unwritten rules, but who wrote the rules? The men, so we adapted to them so that we could fit in."
"Now we can write our own rules," she said, "to the extent that we're comfortable."

Texto completo: Robotic surgery was never approved for mastectomy or any other cancer-related treatment, but that has hardly deterred doctors in the operating suite. The equipment is widely used to operate on patients with various malignancies, from breast cancer to prostate cancer.
Yet there have long been questions about how well doctors are trained on the machines, and whether the devices are better for patients than traditional methods.
Now the Food and Drug Administration has warned that there is no evidence cancer patients receiving robotic procedures live longer than those who have traditional procedures. And some research shows that patients with cervical cancer fare worse.
“We want doctors and patients to be aware of the lack of evidence of safety and effectiveness for these uses so they can make better-informed decisions about their cancer treatment and care,” said Dr. Terri Cornelison, assistant director for the health of women at the agency’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health.
Four-armed surgeon
Robotic systems have been on the market for more than 15 years, and have been used for cancer surgery for much of that time. The machine’s tower, which is positioned over the patient, looks a bit like a multiarmed Star Wars droid. Three of its arms hold surgical devices, while a fourth holds a camera.
The robot’s arms are controlled by a computer that replicates the movements of the operating surgeon, who manipulates the robot’s controls while looking at a monitor that provides a magnified, high-definition image of the operating site.
The FDA noted the findings of two studies published last year in the New England Journal of Medicine.
One of them was a clinical trial that was stopped early after investigators found that women with cervical cancer who had minimally invasive hysterectomies, including robotically assisted procedures, experienced four times as many cancer recurrences and six times as many deaths, compared with patients who had the more traditional procedure.
The trial’s findings were especially striking because the surgery, a radical hysterectomy, usually cures patients with cervical cancer, said Dr. Pedro T. Ramirez, lead author of the paper and director of minimally invasive surgical research at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.
A second study funded by the National Institutes of Health used a database to compare the outcomes of 2,461 women with cervical cancer who had different types of surgery. Four years after the operation, 9.1 percent of those who had minimally invasive surgery had died, compared with 5.3 percent of those who had open surgery.
Yet many physicians continue to recommend robotic surgery to patients, despite the evidence of harm. “Several surgeons have said to me, ‘I can’t find a flaw in your study, but I just can’t stop doing it,’ ” Ramirez said.
Ramirez’s own department stopped doing minimally invasive radical hysterectomies in October 2017, when the first study’s results were confirmed.
It’s about patients
“My feeling is, this is about patient care,” he said. “It’s not about how much time you devoted to your training or your ego. It’s an issue of cancer, and having a high likelihood of cancer coming back if you have surgery through this approach.”
It is not clear why cervical cancer outcomes were worse after minimally invasive surgeries. Ramirez suggested that the instruments used to manipulate the cervix and uterus may cause cancer cells to spread.
Another possibility is that the carbon dioxide pumped into the abdomen during robotic and other minimally invasive procedures - it provides working and viewing space for the surgeon - may increase the likelihood of cancer cells implanting, Ramirez said.
The FDA’s warning was not limited to cervical cancer: Robotic surgical devices are not authorized for prevention or treatment of any cancer, nor are they approved for mastectomy (removal of the breast), the agency said.
The agency also urged health care providers “to complete the appropriate training” needed for performing robotic surgery, and urged patients to ask doctors about their training and experience, as well as about their patients’ outcomes.
In 2000, the agency allowed the sale of one of the first robotic surgery systems, the da Vinci Surgical System, under a process called “premarket notification,” which is often used to bring medical devices onto the market without the rigorous safety and efficacy trials required for new drugs.
Under premarket notification, devices are “cleared” for use on the grounds that they are similar to devices already available. The da Vinci system is cleared for some urological and gynecological procedures, among others.
A similar robotic device, the Senhance Surgical System, was approved for gynecological and colorectal surgery, among other procedures.
Not the intended use
But the efficacy of either system for cancer treatment has not been evaluated by the FDA. And none of the systems has been cleared for mastectomy, which has become a frequent use.
The agency said its approval was “based on evaluation of the device as a surgical tool and did not include evaluation of outcomes related to the treatment of cancer.” It reviewed short-term data on outcomes, a spokeswoman said, not the long-term data important to cancer patients.
So why are these machines allowed in cancer surgery at all? According to a spokeswoman, the FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine.
“If a medical provider determines it’s appropriate to use a product off-label, we don’t regulate that,” she said. “However, in this case, we were concerned about scientific journals and media reports referring to off-label uses.”
Many surgeons tout the benefits of robotic surgery, with its smaller incisions, saying the procedures bring shorter recovery times, less pain or blood loss and fewer scars and infections.
Those are important measures, Ramirez said. But “if you tell a patient you may stay in the hospital one or two days longer versus going home the same day, but there is a higher likelihood your cancer is going to come back, what are you going to choose as a patient? Of course, you’ll stay in the hospital.”
Proposals to conduct another clinical trial to test the cervical cancer outcomes would be unethical, Ramirez said, because results from the first study were clear.
Physicians who continue to use robotic and minimally invasive approaches for cancer treatment “in the face of the evidence may put themselves in legal jeopardy,” said Dr. Michael Carome, director of the health research group at Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy organization.
Patients may not have been the only ones caught off guard by the FDA’s warning. Officials at Intuitive Surgical, maker of the da Vinci robotic system, believed their device was cleared for radical hysterectomies and removal of the prostate. The latter would only be done to treat cancer.
“We have reached out to the FDA for clarification,” said Peper Long, a company spokeswoman.

POLICE ON ALERT AT MOSQUES HERE MANY MOURNING NEW ZEALAND MASSACRE VICTIMS

Texto completo: The Christchurch massacre shook the globe, but in Pittsburgh the resonance was especially deep.
The killings Friday at two mosques in New Zealand came as a stark reminder of the violent acts perpetrated in October against three Jewish congregations in Pittsburgh.
"My initial reaction was going back in my memory from my father's death to 9/11, and Tree of Life," said Mizanoor Biswas, chairman of the Islamic Center of Pittsburgh.
Mr. Biswas was one of many local religious leaders and public officials lamenting yet another hate-fueled attack on a religious group, albeit on the other side of the world. Forty-nine people died in the shootings at the Al Noor Mosque and Linwood Mosque.
Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, of the of Tree of Life/Or L'Simcha Congregation, wrote on the congregation's blog that he "wept at the horror of the massacre in the two mosques in New Zealand, as many of you did."
The news compelled him, he said, "to relive my personal horror of Oct. 27 as well as meet my expectation that there would be a massacre in another house of worship. The question was never 'if,' only 'when.' How does one who lived through the horror respond?"
He said there will likely always be "unfathomable acts of violence. ... It's just that we cannot, we must not, let the evil actions of a small number of people outweigh all of the good people that exist on this planet. Some tarnish can always be polished away. Letting the tarnish remain hides the luster and beauty."
Pittsburgh police said they stepped up patrols near mosques and other locations as a precautionary measure in the wake of the New Zealand incident.
Department of Public Safety officials said they had been in contact with Islamic leaders about the increased security measures.
"The City of Pittsburgh will protect all houses of worship and the right to freely and safely practice your religion without fear," the department said in a statement Friday morning.
At least 49 people were killed in the shootings in central Christchurch in an attack that Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern described as "an extraordinary and unprecedented act of violence." Officials said that one man in his late 20s had been charged with murder and three others detained; two explosive devices were found attached to a vehicle and were defused by authorities.
The shootings came nearly five months after the Tree of Life synagogue massacre in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill neighborhood. On Oct. 27 a gunman opened fire inside the synagogue, killing 11 worshipers and severely injuring two others in what was the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in U.S. history.
On that day, "we were added to the long list of communities who have suffered unimaginable loss as the result of ignorance and extremism," the statement from city law enforcement said.
Pittsburgh officials explained that the city police bureau's Intel Unit monitors threats to city residents and visitors, and works closely with law enforcement agencies at local, state and federal levels. "Those efforts continue today, as always," they said.
For some Pittsburghers, it was hard to see the heartache in New Zealand without thinking back to October. There seemed to be at least one thread tying the two tragedies together: The New York Times reported that the gunman, on the website 8chan, uploaded an image titled "screw your optics," a phrase used in the last online post of Robert Bowers, 46, of Baldwin Borough, prior to the Tree of Life massacre, for which he faces federal and state charges.
"The H word has struck again," Rabbi Myers wrote. "While we are housed in temporary surroundings, we will not let H drive us from our home." He urged others to reach out to Islamic neighbors. "They are in pain and need your comfort and reassurance that they are not alone."
He noted that after Oct. 27 he was comforted by "the outpouring of love and support from all good people throughout the world - all races, creeds, colors, sexual orientation, and ages. ... I ask you to share my simple words with others, to reach out not only to the injured communities, but to your Islamic neighbors as well. We might not be able to totally rid the world of evil, but we must do our part to overwhelm it with goodness. I fervently pray I don't have to write this column ever again."
The three congregations affected in the Oct. 27 massacre - Tree of Life, Dor Hadash and New Light - issued a joint statement that members were "profoundly saddened" by the Christchurch massacre, and that "we grieve with our fellow sons and daughters of Abraham on the senseless loss of life due to senseless hatred, which is an abomination in a civilized society.
"We stand beside our Muslim brothers and sisters and mourn alongside the families and friends who have lost loved ones in this unconscionable act of violence," the statement continued.
Early Friday, Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto joined leaders from around the world in expressing condolences and condemnation following the deadly attacks in New Zealand.
Mr. Peduto sent a message of sympathy, saying "the people of Pittsburgh are with you."
Gov. Tom Wolf ordered flags flown at half-staff in honor of the victims, declaring "a moral obligation to stand against it and support our Muslim friends and neighbors."
Bishop David A. Zubik of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh pledged Pittsburgh's "prayers for those killed and injured in this terrible tragedy, for comfort and consolation for their loved ones, and for peace in the hearts of all affected by today's events." He also offered "our support to the Muslim community in Southwestern Pennsylvania."
"Together with so many others, my heart hurts to learn of yet another mass shooting in a place of worship, this time two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand. The senseless taking of innocent life is only made more disturbing when people are targeted because of their beliefs as they gather to pray," he wrote in a statement.
"Our local community knows all too well the shock and horror of a massacre such as this. Yet, an act intended to tear people apart can instead build up a community that is 'Stronger than Hate.' I hope that the Muslim community in Christchurch will know the love and support of their neighbors near and far in the face of the evil they have experienced."
He added: "May civil discourse and mutual respect be the hallmarks of this place we call home."
"The scourge of ethnic and religious hate crimes must be fought unequivocally from all nations," said state Rep. Dan Frankel, D-Squirrel Hill, in a statement responding to the Christchurch shootings. "The communities of Pittsburgh and Squirrel Hill stand with the people of Christchurch. Houses of faith are sacred and intimate, and hate-driven attacks on these places are attacks on all of humanity."
He also urged people here to keep an eye on their neighbors. "Community heals, and tragedy awakens trauma. Mental health services are available through Jewish Family and Community Services and The Center for Victims."

Texto completo: SALT LAKE CITY — Writer Amor Towles wants to make one thing clear: While he too is a fan of the Humphrey Bogart classic "Casablanca," loves a rich bouillabaisse and played word games with his children when they were young, no one should mistake him for Count Alexander Rostov, the titular character of Towles' best-seller "A Gentleman in Moscow."
"I am definitely not the count, (although) my wife wishes I was," Towles, who is coming to Salt Lake's Larimer Center for the Performing Arts on April 2, said in a recent phone interview.
Count Rostov is an elegant courtly gentleman (as the title indicates) sentenced to house arrest at Moscow's glamorous Hotel Metropol in revolutionary Russia for the crime of being an aristocrat. (In a literary nod, it is poetry that saves him from a Siberian gulag or worse.) For the next 30 some years, Rostov finds a career, a family, an enemy — in short, a full life — all within the hotel's walls.
Towles came upon the idea for the book while traveling for his first career as an investment analyst. Each year, he would stay in the same hotel in Switzerland for a conference, and "year after year, I recognized people in the lobby from the year before," he recalled. "And that's where I thought, 'Oh, … it's as if these people never left.'" From there, Towles imagined a scenario where someone didn't — indeed, couldn't — leave a hotel. That idea quickly took him to Russia, which has a long history of placing people under house arrest, and to the Russian Revolution of 1917 and beyond.
As Rostov matured and grew in Towles mind, the writer found that the count's voice became increasingly distinct and, sometimes, even wise. But although Towles shares some commonalities with Rostov, he points out that the character's insights are all his own.
"When (readers) highlight some … human observation from the book that resonated with them — a little bit of philosophy or observation about life — 95 percent of them I never would have had … myself. They never would have occurred to me," Towles said.
In fact, he admitted, he is just as often enlightened by his characters' ideas as are his readers.
"(These thoughts are) almost always the product of imagining I am this person who I am not — the count — and putting him in a situation that I have never been in and then kind of listening," Towles said. "… It kind of comes as this thing that is presented to me by the third party. … So not only am I not the count, I am very conscious of the fact that in taking on the personality of the count or the experiences of the count, … the observations (he) has in that book are really (his) own."
A best-seller when it came out in 2016, "A Gentleman in Moscow" has been described by critics as a "winning, stylish novel that keeps things easy," (NPR) and Rostov a "character so capable, so witty and at ease in the world" (New York Times) that readers might overlook the time period's dangers outside the hotel's gilded doors. With most of the book's narration in third person limited from the count's view-point, Towles decided as he began outlining the story to include a secondary voice to counterbalance Rostov's "intrinsic optimism."
Initially, this second voice provided a window into life outside the hotel — showing readers the "more acute realities of Soviet life, whether that is the risk of arrest, or the shortages, or possible execution. (He detailed the) oppressive governance and all those various elements of Soviet life," Towles said. And unlike the Count, this other character was "more cynical, more sarcastic (and) clearly (had) a more direct experience with some of the worst aspects of the Soviet era," Towles said.
But the deeper Towles got into the story, he found that this secondary voice was becoming problematic — he still needed that voice, but he didn't need another character with a back story. And so that character, with his knowledge of the realities and horrors of the new Soviet world, became the voice of the book's footnotes. Readers of "A Gentleman in Moscow" will recognize his sharp observations and sometimes arch tone, but not his own tale.
While this fictional character ended up being cut down, Towles did have a host of real-life people he could have put in the count's story. The Hotel Metropol, which opened in 1905, saw many of the 20th century's most notable figures pass through its doors. When Towles finally stayed in the Metropol for a week after he had completed the book's first draft, he took with him a stack of first-hand accounts from John Steinbeck, Lillian Hellman, e. e. cummings and others about their stay in the hotel. They provided him with important details, even if most of these famous people didn't make it into his final story. But there was one real-life person who Towles couldn't help but include.
"As a kid I threw a bottle in the ocean off the coast … of Massachusetts and the managing editor of the New York Times, Harrison Salisbury, found it and we corresponded from the time I was 8 to the time I was 18," Towles said.
Salisbury, who wrote a memoir about his experiences as the Times' Moscow bureau chief from the end of the Second World War through the early years of the Cold War, not only appears in Towles' book, he inadvertently assists the count in an important moment.
"It was kind of fun for me, having this strange personal relationship with Salisbury," he said, "to bring it into the book and to share some of his memories of Moscow at that time through the narrative."
And that is largely what Towles aims to do: Write books that are interesting, well-written and enjoyable for him to work on. He wrote his first book, the 2012 hit "Rules of Civility" in his off hours with none of the pressures attached to writing a best-seller. While he's grateful that book allowed him to turn to writing full time, Towles did his best to pursue his second book with much the same mentality — "as something that I just did for myself," he said.
"… I certainly didn't (write 'A Gentleman in Moscow') with the assumption that it would become a best-seller because, you know, the premise 'guy gets trapped in hotel in Russia for 30 years' was not an idea that was engineered for popularity."

J&J loses another talc case
A California jury Wednesday ordered Johnson & Johnson to pay more than $29 million to a woman who claimed that asbestos in its talc-based powder products had caused her cancer. The Alameda County Superior Court jury found that Johnson & Johnson knew about the potential risks its baby powder was contaminated but failed to warn the woman, Teresa Leavitt. Leavitt received a diagnosis of mesothelioma in August 2017. Her lawyer, Joseph D. Satterley, said she had used Johnson & Johnson talc products for more than 30 years. Johnson & Johnson said it was disappointed with the verdict, citing “serious procedural and evidentiary errors in the proceeding," and would appeal. The company has said decades of testing showed that its baby powder did not contain asbestos or cause cancer. More than 13,000 plaintiffs have sued Johnson & Johnson over what they say are cancers caused by its talc products. The New York Times reported last year that the company spent decades trying to keep negative information about the potential risk of asbestos contamination from reaching the public. In July, a jury in Missouri awarded $4.69 billion to 22 women who claimed that asbestos in Johnson & Johnson products caused them to develop ovarian cancer. — NEW YORK TIMES

Facebook exec to leave as company recovers from outage
Facebook said a change in the way it configured computer servers caused a widespread outage of the social-media network and its other services that stretched over two days. "As a result of a server configuration change, many people had trouble accessing our apps and services," Facebook said in a tweet. "We've now resolved the issues and our systems are recovering." From about noon New York time Wednesday, global users encountered only partially loaded pages or no content at all on Facebook's main social network and its related services, including Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. Meanwhile, Facebook also disclosed that chief product officer Chris Cox will leave, the highest-ranking leader to depart since the social-media giant became embroiled in crisis last year. The move follows Facebook's decision to integrate its apps more tightly and use more encryption, a big shift from the company's current focus on public sharing. “This will be a big project and we will need leaders who are excited to see the new direction through," Cox said in a Facebook post. — BLOOMBERG NEWS
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
Fight continues over lost funds for ski-area development
The former owner of Vermont's Jay Peak resort is fighting claims from a court-appointed receiver that it should pay millions in damages as part of a settlement. Canadian Saint-Sauveur Valley Resorts Inc. says the federal receiver in the case assumed liability when he took over in 2016, according to the Caledonian-Record newspaper. SSVR says the settlement would prevent the company from filing its own claims against the businessman who bought the ski resort. Court records show SSVR used the federal EB-5 program to fund development at the resort before selling it to Ariel Quiros. The federal Securities and Exchange Commission says Quiros then used the funds to buy the resort and bilked investors out of more than $250 million. The federal receiver has not responded to a request for comment. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
FINANCE
Trump nominee closes in on World Bank job
The Treasury official nominated by President Trump to be the next president of the World Bank has cleared a major hurdle, with nominations for the position closing with no other candidates emerging. The World Bank says David Malpass was the only candidate put forward by the bank's 189 member countries. Malpass is currently the undersecretary for international affairs at Treasury. The position came open in February when Jim Yong Kim, who had been nominated by the Obama administration, announced he was stepping down. The World Bank said the bank's 25-member executive board will conduct a formal interview in the coming days with the expectation that it will make a decision before the bank's spring meetings, which start April 12. — ASSOCIATED PRESS

New Mexico backs off state-run stores
A proposal that would make New Mexico the first US state to set up government-operated marijuana stores appeared to be dead Thursday in the current legislative session. Senator John Sapien, a Bernalillo Democrat, said lawmakers still have questions about the measure with only hours left before they adjourn. The bill previously passed by the state House would legalize recreational marijuana in New Mexico. However, it stalled in the Senate Finance Committee and it didn't appear that Senator John Arthur Smith, a Democrat who chairs the panel, planned to give it a hearing. Sapien also said some private companies and medical marijuana providers have concerns over how the bill is written. The idea for state-run pot shops came from a trio of GOP state senators who broke with party orthodoxy to embrace legal marijuana. Ten states and Washington, D.C., have legalized recreational marijuana, while legislative efforts to legalize recreational marijuana are underway in New York and New Jersey. — ASSOCIATED PRESS
TECHNOLOGY
Chinese telecom giant pleads not guilty in sanctions case
Huawei Technologies Co. pleaded not guilty Thursday in New York to federal charges that the company defrauded at least four banks by concealing business dealings in Iran in violation of US sanctions. The plea by China's largest smartphone maker marks the formal start of the company's defense in the US case. Meng Wanzhou, Huawei's chief financial officer has also been charged in the case and is free on bail in Vancouver while fighting extradition to the United States. Meng, daughter of the company's billionaire founder, was arrested by Canadian authorities in December at the request of US prosecutors. Huawei is accused of using Skycom Tech Co. to violate a decades-old ban on doing business with Iran, including repeatedly lying to the United States and even to Congress regarding whether its business in Iran violated any American sanctions. US prosecutors allege Meng defrauded banks when she personally made a presentation in August 2013 to an executive of one of Huawei's major banking partners in which she repeatedly lied about Huawei's relationship with Skycom. — BLOOMBERG NEWS
TRADE
EU again splinters on trade approach to Trump
The European Parliament took the rare step of silencing itself on Thursday, signaling how splintered views are in Europe about trade policy toward President Trump. The assembly threw out its own draft resolution on trans-Atlantic commercial ties, minutes after left-of-center political groups pushed through a floor amendment saying EU trade chief Cecilia Malmstrom should be denied the green light for negotiations with the United States on cutting industrial tariffs. Such a demand would have dented a push by Malmstrom to gain permission from EU governments to start the trans-Atlantic talks. As a result, right-of-center members turned against the whole report. Malmstrom is aiming to show progress on a July 2018 political accord Trump reached with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker that suspended the threat of US levies on EU cars and auto parts and resolve other trade disputes. — BLOOMBERG NEWS

Squirrels hand sugar farmers sticky challenge
Vermont maple syrup producers are contending with a late start to the season in the Northeast and an abundant squirrel population with the critters chomping on plastic sap tubing and spouts. Damage from wildlife — deer, bear, woodpeckers, and squirrels — is not unusual for maple operations, but this year squirrels are wreaking havoc in some spots. That means producers must sometimes negotiate deep snow to find and replace damaged lines that transport the sap from the maple trees or other chewed equipment, which producers say can be time-consuming and expensive. Ruth Goodrich of Goodrich's Maple Farm in Danville, Vt., the largest maple producing state, says of the squirrels: "Occasionally they declare war. And it seems like they have this year." — ASSOCIATED PRESS

Texto completo: If you're sick of your noisy, crowded office and think that working from home would be an improvement, I have news.
Your home is definitely an oasis of serenity, free of the endless distractions of a public workspace.
Unless you have children.
I can understand why you would forget that you have children. They're small and slippery and easy to misplace. But if you're part of the 23 percent of workers who did some of their work at home in 2017 and you also happen to be part of the 61.9 percent of married-couple families who have children, you might have a problem.
You want to get serious work done.
They want to sing "The Wheels on the Bus."
Or so I learned in "How to Work From Home With Children," a recent article published by The New York Times and Wirecutter.
Patrick A. Coleman, a work-from-home father, has seen both the good and the not-so-good aspects of working at home with young children lurking about. "When you're in your own home and you're mostly dad," he reports, "you can really lose perspective of that professional life."
This is true, but it's not unsolvable. It's easy to remind yourself of what life is like at the office: just start hitting yourself on the head with a frying pan.
For some people, working from home isn't a choice. Consider Teresa Douglas, whose company switched to all-remote workers. Douglas managed to stay employed and co-authored the "Secrets of the Remote Workforce."
"One mistake parents make is not setting the right boundaries for children," Douglas expressed to The New York Times. To help her children understand when she needs to be left alone, she puts a "STOP -- in a meeting" sign on her door.
Personally, I don't see how a sign is sufficient enough to prevent break-ins. An armed guard would probably do the trick but then you'd have to feed him.
Besides, you can't blame young children for not respecting boundaries. If your manager is always bursting in on you, it's ridiculous to expect better behavior from a 4 year old (though, to be fair, the two probably share the same level of maturity).
Coleman suggests it is easier to separate yourself from your children if there is a physical barrier. (The Pacific Ocean makes an excellent physical barrier, but once you have left the kid on shore, to make it work, you do have to get yourself to Maui.)
One piece of equipment you could try is a baby gate. I doubt this will stop a motivated child from getting their greasy hands on your laptop, but it would work well in an office situation. Can't you just see your IT guy pacing back and forth in front of a 2-foot-high baby gate, trying to figure how to get in?
Another strategy for the work-at-home parent is to manipulate bedtimes. Author Bunmi Laditan said, "I used to put my 4- or 5-year-old down at 9 p.m.," until she finally realized she was "missing that early bedtime window." She moved bedtime to 7 p.m. and "used the extra hours to do chores and get more work done."
If you take this approach to its logical conclusion, you might consider moving bedtime to 5 p.m., or even 3 p.m., but that would be a big mistake (3 p.m. is when you take your nap).
Technology can also help.
As every parent knows, children have an instinct for knowing when you're on the phone with your boss, because that's when they decide to throw a screaming fit. This can be very distracting, especially if your boss is also throwing a screaming fit.
"Noise-cancelling microphones and easy-to-access mute buttons" are the techy solution to the problem, and while not perfect, these devices will simply have to do until evolution moves forward and future generations of children are born with easy-to-use mute buttons.
For now, parents with young children are advised to consider "babywearing." A number of "comfortable carriers" allow you to free your hands by imprisoning the child in fuzzy fleece with enough Velcro strapping to keep an S&M parlor in business for decades.
With the baby attached, you can work away while you gently "rock and sway." The hope is the baby will fall asleep. Of course, the person most likely to fall asleep is you, but given the low expectations your managers have for you, the baby will certainly be able to finish your work.
Just don't expect your baby to deal with your boss. Babies are way too mature for that.

With 'Redoubt,' a cosmic reset button for Matthew Barney

Texto completo: NEW HAVEN — Hawks keen in a bare blue sky in the opening moments of “Redoubt," Matthew Barney's sparse paean to the Sawtooth mountain range, the big nature of his Idaho youth. It wouldn't be Barney if neither blood nor some other bodily fluid was spilled, and quickly; right on cue, there it is: The camera wheels down from on high toward a dark mound drifting in an ocean of blinding snow. As it draws close, the mound reveals itself to be the carcass of a wolf, blood radiating outward from its picked-over ribcage.
“Redoubt," more than two hours of dialogue-free, loose narrative film now on view at the Yale University Art Gallery, doesn't stray far from expectation. In it, a US forestry worker, played by the artist himself, tracks three fatigues-clad women carving a fatal swath through the wilderness.
You'd have to read the notes — handily, several hundred pages' worth accompany “Redoubt" in a tome of essays and images — to know the piece is Barney's reworking of the Greek myth of Diana and Actaeon, the goddess of the hunt and the hapless hunter who stumbles upon her. Like so much of Barney's cerebral, lush, and often perplexing oeuvre, such telling details rarely make it to the screen, where the artist's grand vision unspools in loosely-tied episodes of wordless visual decadence.
This is art, not cinema, and maybe that's the point. Even so, making the implicit demand that a roomful of people sit still for more than two hours as the piece creeps along seems a bit much (it's shown in a theater, not a gallery where you can pass in and out). Barney once told me that his relationship to audiences was “a little askew. . . . I don't really understand what people need." “Redoubt," meditative to the point of somnabulance, bears that out. To the opening, a gathering of the New York art world, elite — a hermetically-sealed circle of consensus for Barney's grandiose visions — I brought a non-art-world friend as my plus-one. I lost count of how many times he discreetly checked his phone to see how much time had passed as the film crept on.
I don't know that I like Matthew Barney's work, but I do admire it. Is there another American artist with the same outsize ambitions or epic sweep? Being ambitious, though, is not the same as being great, and this is where things unplug for me. Watching Barney's films often feels like an endurance test, a war of attrition with my attention span. Visually, his work can be rapturous — and viscerally, uncomfortably so. I can't remember a Barney film I didn't want to walk out of, at least for a moment, aching for relief.
Be that as it may, Barney is one of those rare artists who secured his position in contemporary art hierarchy early on and never lost his footing. The New York Times Magazine, in a 1999 cover story, called him “the most important American artist of his generation." He was 32. I don't know if it was too much, too soon, but Barney's work ever since seems to have been an effort, consciously or not, to prove it right.
The declaration was made on the debatable merits of his five-film, seven-plus-hour “Cremaster Cycle," which he was in the midst of making. It ran loosely — very loosely — along a slim narrative thread pulled from Norman Mailer's “The Executioner's Song," a novelized version of the story of serial killer Gary Gilmore. Barney's celebrity seemed to peak when the last of the series, “Cremaster 3" (they were, of course, made out of sequence) was given a limited theatrical release in 2002. In one memorable scene, the drummer for the death-metal band Slayer pounded out a punishing solo while being enveloped by a swarm of bees. Imagine turning up at the multiplex for “My Big Fat Greek Wedding" and finding that .
“Cremaster" made Barney famous. It also made him an object of scorn, and his tangled, creepy tales an emblem of the contemporary art world's excess and disdain for the larger world. With multimillion-dollar budgets, he made Hollywood-scale productions with no particular audience in mind. Alongside them, he made prints and drawings, and sculptures out of Vaseline or metal for a rapt clientele of moneyed collectors eager to own a piece of his blossoming reputation. (“Redoubt" is no different; the upper galleries at Yale are filled with gaudy sculptures of charred tree trunks some 30 feet long, radiating metallic explosions that look like flash-frozen spurts of blood from gunshot wounds).
Myth, or mythic aspiration, is a Barney staple. However you feel about his work, you can't fault him for a lack of rigor. “Cremaster" explored a dizzying range of deeply American cultish fascinations — Mormons, football, death metal, serial killers — but with a somber, absurd poetic impulse. Barney's penchant for florid imagery can perplex, but it also transfixes: Even now, 15 years later, I can still see the camera wheel past a Utah mountain range shimmering in the darkness, or a crystalline rodeo ring built on the state's great salt flats in “Cremaster 3."
His work has always left me wondering about the slim line between complexity and pretense, and Barney has skirted it as often as not. In “Drawing Restraint 9" (2005), which he made with his then-partner Bjork, a crew of sailors sculpted 25 tons of petroleum jelly — a favorite medium — in the hold of a Japanese whaling ship while his protagonists, slowly, carved off each other's limbs, morphing from land to sea creatures (maybe on the strength of Bjork's celebrity, it was his second theatrical release).
In 2014, his ambition, or hubris, appeared to reach apotheosis: “River of Fundament," a near six-hour saga, swallowed whole Mailer's novel “Ancient Evenings" — widely seen as his most ambitious, and least successful — and belched it back out in bilious chunks. The ancient Egyptian demi-gods of Mailer's epic entwine with Mailer himself, each questing for immortality through a cycle of destruction and rebirth that, it so happens, leads through a primordial river of feces running beneath Mailer's Brooklyn brownstone. Its score, by Barney's collaborator Jonathan Bepler, is a full-scale opera all on its own.
As a critique of Mailer's own vanity, it seemed to reflect back harshly on Barney himself: It was exhausting, punishing, visceral, and foul (a stickler for detail, Barney's titular river flows more thickly than it needed to, to give it credence). At the screening I went to in Detroit — for friends and family, no less — half the audience was gone before the film ended.
“Redoubt," by comparison, feels almost cathartic, a cosmic reset button for an artist whose ambitions had bloated to an unmanageable scale. The piece is positively restrained, unfurling as it does from a woodsy camp — a tent filled with weapons for the goddess's hunt — to a ramshackle trailer at a river's edge.
Barney, as Acteon, lopes into the woods and up sharp, snowy slopes to etch scenes on copper plates; he brings them back to the trailer to be electroplated by an older woman who offers him refuge, a rest. His quest shifts from capturing woody scenes to trying to sketch Diana herself, which almost costs him his life.
It's near-impossible to extract a story, which for Barney is hardly new. Even so, it's the most elegant piece he's ever made. Gone are the prosthetics, the bodily fluids, the bleak fantastical realms and casts of hundreds. Instead, it unspools almost as a pas-de-deux — the elemental world versus the merely human, and the latter's quixotic urge to capture the ineffable.
It occurs to me, finally, that Barney's goal, at its core, isn't all that different from what artists have been doing for centuries: grasping for what can't be held, something cosmic, unimaginable, larger than ourselves. Every great work of art is a spectacular failure, evidence of a noble, but futile quest. That sounds like Matthew Barney to me.

Texto completo: When school's out for summer: The godfather of shock rock is headed to Central Illinois when the weather warms up. Alice Cooper will perform at 8 p.m. July 7 at the Peoria Civic Center theater as part of his 'Ol Black Eyes Is Back tour.
The 71-year-old Cooper has been performing for more than a half-century, pioneering a jarring theatrical brand of hard rock. Drawing equally from horror movies, vaudeville and garage rock, Cooper created a stage show that featured everything from electric chairs to guillotines and fake blood.
With a schedule that includes six months each year on the road, Cooper brings his own brand of rock psycho-drama to fans both old and new, enjoying it as much as the audience does. He averages more than 90 concerts annually, performing throughout the U.S. and abroad. His upcoming tour kicks off in May and includes more than 50 dates, with Peoria sandwiched between stops in Columbus, Ohio, and Dubuque, Iowa.
Tickets for his Peoria show are priced at $35-$75 and go on sale to the public at 10 a.m. Friday via Ticketmaster. VIP packages that include meet-and-greets and stage tours with Cooper are also available.
Intimate acoustics: Indie pop band Lucius, winning praise from many corners, is headed to Central Illinois for an 8 p.m. May 7 performance at downtown Bloomington's Castle Theatre.
The New York Times described the vocals of Jess Wolfe and Holly Laessig as especially gorgeous, while Rolling Stone says the band is powerful enough to knock you over. A pair of talented instrumentalists, Peter Lalish and Dan Molad, round out the group.
After Wolfe and Laessig wrapped back-up singer duties on Roger Waters' latest tour, the group is now together again, touring to support of its 2018 album, "Nudes."
Tickets for its Castle show are $20-$27.50, and available now through Ticketfly.com.
More indie pop: Los Angeles-based lovelytheband will perform 8 p.m. March 26 at Peoria's Monarch Music Hall. The band, best know for its single, "Broken," released its first album, "Finding It Hard to Smile," last summer.
Last year Billboard also dubbed the group among "10 Rock & Alternative Artists to Watch in 2018."
Tickets for the show are $20 and $25, and on sale now via Ticketfly.com.

Boeing jet ban adds to tumult at Austin airport

Texto completo: A decision by the Federal Aviation Administration to ground all Boeing 737 Max 8 and Max 9 planes in the country after a deadly crash Sunday in Ethiopia added to the tumult at the Austin-Bergstrom International Airport on Wednesday, an already busy day with South by Southwest in town and spring break starting next week.
President Donald Trump announced the decision by the FAA to ground the Boeing Max planes on Wednesday after he said “new information” came to light about the deadly Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crash Sunday that killed 157 people.
It was the second deadly crash involving the Boeing 737 Max 8 jet model in five months. In October, all 189 passengers in a Lion Air flight died in a crash in Indonesia.
The Austin airport complied with the grounding order. All of the jets in question have been replaced, and the flights they were serving have been rescheduled, airport officials said.
On Wednesday afternoon, officials said the airport had only one 737 Max 8 plane at its terminals and no others scheduled to come in. The one 737 Max 8 was scheduled for Southwest Flight 1020 to Dallas and was replaced by an alternative plane, Hackett said.
In addition, 35 flights had been canceled to and from the Austin airport because of weather-related issues. Austin airport spokesman Derick Hackett encouraged all travelers to continue monitoring their flight status after a snowstorm in Colorado caused several delays Wednesday.
“We do want to relay the message to passengers that are affected by the weather
and by the grounding to contact their airline directly about rescheduling and re-booking options,” Hackett said. “We are asking passengers to please have a lot of patience because they are dealing with that equipment issue and the severe weather going on in the mountains.”
Hackett said that travelers on Wednesday saw longer-than-normal lines at the ticket counters as the airport worked with the individual carriers to get flights re-booked. But all things considered, he said, it was just another normal busy day at the airport.
“We are prepared to handle it,” he said.
Airlines scrambled Wednesday to remove the Boeing 737 Max planes from their fleets.
Southwest Airlines said it had 34 Boeing 737 Max 8 jet airliners that were grounded, which are used in less than 5 percent of its daily flights. American Airlines grounded 24 planes and United Airlines 14, the companies said.
“Since Sunday, we have been working diligently on contingency plans to prepare our fleet to minimize the impact to customers,” United Airlines said in a statement. “Through a combination of spare aircraft and re-booking customers, we do not anticipate a significant operational impact as a result of this order. We will continue to work with our customers to help minimize any disruption to their travel.”
Southwest customers who are booked on a canceled 737 Max 8 flight can re-book on alternative flights without any additional fees or fare differences within 14 days of the original date of travel, the airline said.
“While we remain confident in the Max 8 after completing more than 88,000 flight hours accrued over 41,000 flights, we support the actions of the FAA and other regulatory agencies and governments across the globe that have asked for further review of the data — including information from the flight data recorder — related to the recent accident involving the Max 8,” Southwest said. “The safety of our customers and employees is our uncompromising priority, and today’s action reflects the commitment to supporting the current investigations and regulatory concerns.”
The FAA had delayed a decision to ground the planes after the two deadly 737 Max 8 crashes, saying that it didn’t have data to show that the jets are unsafe.
Forty-two other countries, however, decided to ground the planes earlier this week and refused to let them land at their airports.
Trump’s order to ground the planes came hours after Canada’s transport minister said that newly available satellite-tracking data suggested similarities between the Ethiopia and Indonesia crashes.
Marc Garneau, Canada’s transport minister, had said that satellite tracing data of the vertical path of the Ethiopian jet at takeoff and comparable data from the Lion Air crash showed similar “vertical fluctuations” and “oscillations.”
The American and Canadian decisions also come after Ethiopian Airlines said one of two pilots on Sunday’s flight reported “flight-control problems” to air traffic controllers minutes before the plane crashed and told controllers that he wanted to turn back to Bole International Airport in Addis Ababa. The pilot was cleared to do so, three minutes before contact was lost with the cockpit, a spokesman for the airline said Wednesday.
The disclosure suggests that a problem with the handling of the aircraft or the computerized flight control system could have been a factor. There has been no suggestion so far of terrorism or other outside interference in the functioning of the aircraft, which was only a few months old.
The crashes have put Boeing on the defensive. The 737 Max is Boeing’s best-selling jet ever and expected to be a major driver of profit with about 5,000 of the planes on order. Boeing’s shares have fallen about 13 percent this week.
Boeing said in a statement it has “full confidence” in the safety of its 737 Max planes but had decided to temporarily suspend operations of the aircraft out of an abundance of caution and to reassure the public of its safety.
After the Indonesia crash, Boeing was expected to update its software and training guidelines so that airlines can teach their pilots to fly the planes more safely and easily. That software update is planned for April.

Resumen: [...]if you want to see more of Dewan, she still makes occasional appearances on NBC's "World of Dance" (though she no longer hosts the show), is in the current movie anthology "Berlin, I Love You," and has a new series, "Mixtape," coming to Netflix. Elena Ferrante has written four connected, best-selling novels starting with "My Brilliant Friend," which inspired an HBO series. Because Ferrante writes under a pseudonym and shuns face-to-face interviews, there have been attempts to guess her real name and speculation about her gender. Back in 2016 there was a short series about an alien invasion that primarily affected members of Congress.

Texto completo: On "The Resident," Jenna Dewan was playing the representative of a medical company and starting to have a relationship with one of the doctors. She was run off the road by some thugs and we have not seen her since. Did she die or will she be back on the show?

Actress-dancer Dewan will be back in the Fox drama's March 25 episode. Fox says Devon (Manish Dayal), who had become attracted to Dewan's character, Julian Booth, will finally discover the truth about what happened to her. But we don't know if she is alive or dead, and Fox is keeping mum about that.

At the same time, if you want to see more of Dewan, she still makes occasional appearances on NBC's "World of Dance" (though she no longer hosts the show), is in the current movie anthology "Berlin, I Love You," and has a new series, "Mixtape," coming to Netflix. You can also find her as @jennadewan on Twitter and Instagram.

Recently the name Ferrante appeared in literature and television as the author of a very popular book. She claims to be a woman from Naples, Italy. But the personal details describing the characters, especially the men, make it obvious (to me) that the author is male, not female. Surely there must be others who have come forward with the same surmise.

There are. Elena Ferrante has written four connected, best-selling novels starting with "My Brilliant Friend," which inspired an HBO series. Because Ferrante writes under a pseudonym and shuns face-to-face interviews, there have been attempts to guess her real name and speculation about her gender.

A New York Times story in 2014 noted rumors "regularly recycled in the Italian press that she is the Italian novelist Domenico Starnone," which Starnone himself called a "groundless hypothesis." In written answers to interviewers' questions, Ferrante maintained she is female. She told Vanity Fair in 2015 that she stays out of the public eye "to liberate myself from the anxiety of notoriety."

Back in 2016 there was a short series about an alien invasion that primarily affected members of Congress. It was called "Braindead," starred Tony Shalhoub among others and was, at times, hilarious.

Are there any plans to replay it any time soon? In view of the craziness that is currently surrounding our government, the timing would be very interesting.

"Braindead" indeed aired for 13 episodes on CBS from June to September 2016. I do not know of any plans for a repeat on the network. You can still find the episodes on the CBS All Access subscription streaming service, on Amazon Prime Video and on DVD.

On reruns of "Perry Mason" I saw a series of episodes where Perry was in the hospital and guest stars took his place -- Barry Sullivan and Bette Davis among them. Was Raymond Burr, who played Perry, sick for real?

Yes. Burr was quite outspoken about the strain of doing the series, and there were times during its run when he had health problems. Surgery (sources vary about what kind) and illness were responsible for fill-ins in several episodes, among them the ones you remember with Sullivan and Davis.

Livability: Cincinnati has 'top-notch infrastructure.'

Texto completo: In a new study by Livability, Cincinnati ranked No. 25 out of 100, and while we can't argue that Cincinnati is a great place to live, there are some questions about the infrastructure score.
Livability said Cincinnati has "top-notch infrastructure" in their Top 100 Best Place to Live in 2019 rankings.
Come again?
"In fact, Cincinnati scored the highest for infrastructure among all of Livability's Top 100 cities for 2019. Why? It's super easy to get around here, with options ranging from the Cincinnati Bell Connector streetcar system to the popular Metro bus service, which brings 20 percent of the downtown workforce into the city each day." — Livability.com
Hey, Livability, take a look at this New York Times story about the Brent Spence Bridge, our beloved and feared 57-year-old bridge, that needs to be replaced.
According to The Enquirer's Scott Wartman, the federal government won't pay for more than one-third of the $2.5 billion Brent Spence Bridge project. That means Ohio and Kentucky will have to come up with at least two-thirds of the money, maybe more. But neither governor has committed to a plan yet.
(Remember in 2017, when the U.S. Department of Treasury released a report ranking the replacement of the Brent Spence Bridge as one of America's top transportation infrastructure megaprojects, but nothing got done?)
Nor did Livability likely read The Enquirer's coverage of issues with the Cincinnati Bell Connector, like that time the streetcar collided with a Metro bus.
The streetcar turned 2 last year, and there are a few big takeaways from the second year around the tracks, according to transportation reporter Hannah Sparling. Ridership numbers are down from early projections, down from revised projections and down compared to year one. Blockages are up. In fact, the Cincinnati Metro is responsible for 39 percent of the blockages from January through August 2018. (That problem has since been fixed).
Not to mention the Columbia Parkway landslides, truck bottlenecks on I-71/I-75 and public pushes for a bus levy to improve services. And, of course, the Western Hills Viaduct literally had a piece of concrete fall off and smash into a truck.
Livability did get a few things right, Cincinnati's climate in six words or less, "Wildly variable – hot, cold, rainy, snowy" and our love of Graeter's and Skyline Chili.

Resumen: Two people familiar with the matter, who were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity, told the Daily News on Tuesday that Attorney General Letitia James issued a subpoena late Monday night to Deutsche Bank for any records relating to Trump's attempt to buy the National Football League team in 2014. In addition to the unsuccessful Bills deal, the sources said James issued subpoenas to Deutsche Bank and New Jersey-based Investors Bank in response to Cohen's similar allegations about possible wrongdoing relating to financing for the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago, the Trump National Doral near Miami and Trump Park Avenue in Midtown. President Trump took aim at Gov. Cuomo after the AG subpoenas were widely reported Tuesday and tied them to the "witch hunt" he claims special counsel Robert Mueller and congressional investigators are conducting.

Texto completo: New York's top prosecutor has opened an investigation into whether President Trump broke the law while trying to bankroll his failed bid to buy the Buffalo Bills - a contentious deal that featured a short-lived smear campaign against Jon Bon Jovi.
Two people familiar with the matter, who were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity, told the Daily News on Tuesday that Attorney General Letitia James issued a subpoena late Monday night to Deutsche Bank for any records relating to Trump's attempt to buy the National Football League team in 2014.
One of the sources said the subpoena came in response to ex-Trump attorney Michael Cohen's sworn testimony before Congress last month that the President exaggerated his wealth in statements submitted to Deutsche Bank in order to more easily secure loans for the Bills offer. Cohen charged that Trump's wealth inflation amounted to bank fraud.
In addition to the unsuccessful Bills deal, the sources said James issued subpoenas to Deutsche Bank and New Jersey-based Investors Bank in response to Cohen's similar allegations about possible wrongdoing relating to financing for the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago, the Trump National Doral near Miami and Trump Park Avenue in Midtown.
Deutsche Bank said it's complying with James's request while an Investors Bank representative did not respond to emailed questions. The AG's office declined to comment on the subpoenas, which were first reported by The New York Times.
Trump ended up losing the bid to buy the Bills to natural gas billionaire Terry Pegula, who offered about $1.4 billion for the upstate New York team. The soon-to-be President had offered $1 billion, a person close to Trump said Tuesday.
But prior to Pegula locking in the deal, Trump orchestrated a vicious character assassination of New Jersey rocker Bon Jovi, who was also bidding on the football team.
Michael Caputo - the longtime Republican operative who would go on to run communications for Trump's 2016 campaign - spearheaded the mudslinging effort, which attempted to discredit Bon Jovi as a traitor after it was speculated that the "Livin' on a Prayer" singer was trying to relocate the Bills to Toronto.
Caputo orchestrated a grassroots effort on Trump's behalf called "12th Man Thunder" that staged anti-Bon Jovi stunts around Buffalo.
One of Caputo's most prominent stunts was establishing "Bon Jovi-Free Zones" at bars and restaurants around the city - jeering that was covered by national media outlets. The group also propagated a boycott of all things Bon Jovi.
But Trump's involvement in the "12th Man Thunder" show was short-lived.
Caputo told The News on Tuesday that he had to end the public relations stunt on Trump's behalf after the soon-to-be President made a formal offer on the Bills and signed a non-disclosure agreement pledging to not speak publicly about the other bidders.
"Within a week of announcing his interest, my role was eliminated," Caputo said.
However, the "12th Man Thunder" group's anti-Bon Jovi campaign continued to operate independently, despite Trump's pullout.
A spokesman for the Trump Organization did not return a request for comment, nor did a representative for Bon Jovi.
Regardless of Trump's exit, the anti-Bon Jovi stunt appeared at least tangentially effective, since Pegula ended up winning the Bills bid.
President Trump took aim at Gov. Cuomo after the AG subpoenas were widely reported Tuesday and tied them to the "witch hunt" he claims special counsel Robert Mueller and congressional investigators are conducting.
"New York State and its Governor, Andrew Cuomo, are now proud members of the group of PRESIDENTIAL HARASSERS," the Queens-born President tweeted. "No wonder people are fleeing the State in record numbers. The Witch Hunt continues!"
Caputo said he had no knowledge whether a Deutsche Bank loan was used to finance Trump's Bills offer or whether the President lied to obtain it.
But Caputo - who has testified in Mueller's Trump-Russia investigation - took a shot at James over what he saw as a "fishing campaign."
"Instead of prosecuting crimes, they've identified someone they want to investigate until they find a crime," Caputo said. "If this is the way that the New York attorney general wants to conduct her business, it's very clear that the real criminals will run amok."
Upon her election in November, James pledged to scrutinize every aspect of Trump's business dealings.
"We are not scared of you," James said in her victory speech. "And as the next attorney general of his home state, I will be shining a bright light into every dark corner of his real estate dealings, and every dealing, demanding truthfulness at every turn."

Texto completo: The Federal Reserve on Tuesday barred two former Goldman Sachs executives from working in the banking industry because of their roles in a multibillion-dollar fraud involving a Malaysian government investment fund.
One of the executives, Tim Leissner, who was one of Goldman's top investment bankers in Asia, has pleaded guilty in a federal criminal investigation of the fraud and has been ordered to forfeit about $44 million. The other executive, Roger Ng, has been charged in the United States with participating in money laundering and bribery, but is in custody in Malaysia.
Goldman Sachs helped the fund, 1Malaysia Development Berhad, commonly known as 1MDB, sell more than $6 billion of debt to investors, ostensibly for projects that would benefit the Malaysian people. But federal prosecutors contend that at least $2.7 billion of that money went to fuel the lavish lifestyles of several people close to a former Malaysian prime minister, including the flamboyant financier Jho Low.
Prosecutors have said some of the money raised for the fund went toward paying bribes to secure business for Goldman Sachs.
Mr. Low, who also has been charged in the United States and Malaysia, attended at least two meetings where Lloyd Blankfein, the former Goldman chief executive officer, was present. But Goldman Sachs has painted Mr. Leissner, the husband of the fashion designer and model Kimora Lee Simmons, as a rogue operator who bears the responsibility for the bank's role in the scandal.
The bank has said that it took steps to make sure that neither Mr. Low nor any other intermediaries played a role in arranging the 1MDB financing deals.
[Read more about Goldman Sachs's efforts to distance itself from Mr. Leissner.]
"Given the Department of Justice's charges last year, this development is hardly surprising," said Jake Siewert, a Goldman spokesman.
Federal prosecutors and banking regulators have continued to investigate Goldman's role in the scandal. The bank has said it faced the prospect of a significant fine to resolve the matter.
In addition to permanently barring Mr. Leissner from the banking industry, the Fed fined him $1.4 million. The banking authorities in Singapore barred Mr. Leissner from working in that country late last year.
A lawyer for Mr. Leissner, who consented to the Fed ban, declined to comment. He is free on bail, which was originally set at $20 million. But the specific terms of Mr. Leissner's bail were kept under seal when a redacted version of a transcript of his Aug. 28 guilty plea was made public in November. Lawyers for The New York Times asked a federal judge last month to unseal the portions of the transcript that describe the terms of Mr. Leissner's bail.
Mr. Leissner is scheduled to be sentenced on June 28.
Mr. Ng's lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, declined to comment on the Fed's action on Tuesday. He previously said his client planned to plead not guilty after he was returned from Malaysia to face the pending charges filed by United States prosecutors in federal court in Brooklyn.
Investigators in the United States have said 1MDB was raided by the former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak and other officials, including Mr. Low, with billions of dollars in siphoned funds used on luxuries including diamonds, designer handbags and fine art, and to help finance the Hollywood film "The Wolf of Wall Street."
Mr. Najib was ousted in last year's election and charged by Malaysian prosecutors with money laundering in August.
Mr. Low, who remains at large, is believed to be staying in China.

Missed Target On Mueller Sentencing

Texto completo: The only way to justify the extraordinarily lenient sentence that federal Judge T.S. Ellis III bestowed Thursday upon Paul Manafort would be if the former Trump presidential campaign chairman had cooperated with investigators.
Not only did Manafort not cooperate; prosecutors contend that he lied to them after agreeing to cooperate.
Yet Ellis sentenced Manafort to 47 months in prison for his conviction on five counts of tax fraud, one count of failure to file a report of foreign bank and financial accounts and two counts of bank fraud.
As Scott Hechinger, a public defender in Brooklyn, put it in a tweet: “For context on Manafort’s 47 months in prison, my client yesterday was offered 36-72 months in prison for stealing $100 worth of quarters from a residential laundry room.”
Judges should have discretion to depart from the guidelines, and in 2017 they did so in fraud cases 43 percent of the time, according to analysis by The New York Times. But in most of those cases, judges honored the requests of prosecutors who recommended reduced sentences due to a defendant’s cooperation in an investigation.
Mueller faces a second sentencing Wednesday in a related case, before federal Judge Amy Berman Jackson, for which the maximum possible sentence is 10 years. The judge also can make the sentence consecutive to the first one.
The question of whether justice is served often is a moving target. In this case Ellis - by crafting a sentence more than four times lower than federal sentencing guidelines - missed regarding Manafort specifically and regarding fair sentencing, generally.

Dick's Sporting Goods will remove guns from 125 stores amid slumping sales, reports say

Resumen: Dick's Sporting Goods, which banned assault-style weapons sales after the Parkland shooting, will reportedly pull hunting weapons at 125 stores.

Texto completo: Dick's Sporting Goods announced Tuesday it will remove firearms from 125 of its stores, according to news reports. The move follows the company's ban on assault-style weapons last year in the wake of the Parkland shooting.
CEO Ed Stack said Tuesday that Dick's will pull hunting gear from 125 stores starting in around August in response to its slumping sales in those stores, Bloomberg reported, a move that may spread to more stores next year.
Dick's last year announced it would ban sales of assault-style weapons after the Parkland, Florida, school shooting and revelations that its shooter, Nikolas Cruz, had purchased a gun from a Dick's store. The company also halted sales of high-capacity magazines and guns to anyone under 21 years old.
Hunting products started vanishing from 10 Dick's stores last fall as the retailer swapped those items for products such as kayaks and baseball gear. Stack said the stores saw higher sales, margins and foot traffic than when they had guns, according to Bloomberg.
Halting assault-style weapon sales put a dent in overall sales for Dick's, the company noted last fall, a dip furthered by a weaker gun market. On Tuesday, the Pittsburgh-area company said net income for the quarter fell to $102. 6 million from $116 million in the year-earlier period, per MarketWatch.
Adjusted same-store sales fell 3. 1 percent over a 12-month period ending Feb. 2 when compared to that period the year prior, The New York Times reported.
Dick's operates 729 stores along with 94 Golf Galaxy stores and 35 Field and Stream stores, according to the newspaper.
The National Shooting Sports Foundation expelled Dick's from membership last year for "conduct detrimental" to the firearms trade group, but Stack remains undeterred in the company's direction.
"If we had a mulligan, we'd do it all over again," Stack said, per CNBC.
The CEO signed a letter last month backing a federal bill extending background checks, the network noted, and recently joined the Everytown Business Council for gun safety.

Alleged bribery scheme went on for years

Texto completo: For years, Yale University allowed women's soccer coach Rudy Meredith to bypass standard student procedures and pick the women he wanted on his team as long as they met the Ivy League school's academic standards.
According to a federal complaint filed in US District Court in Boston, Meredith used that power to earn him hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes from the family of one student, and to demand $450,000 from the father of another.
The bribery scheme allegedly worked this way:
• William Rick Singer operated the California-based Edge College & Career Network, a for-profit college counseling and preparation business that was known as “The Key." He also operated a charity known as Key Worldwide Foundation, which he operated as a nonprofit charity.
• In 2015, Singer and Meredith agreed to use Meredith's student selection authority to make themselves money. Two years later, a Los Angeles based financial adviser made contact with Singer and agreed to make a “donation" to “one of those top schools" for his daughter's “application" to Yale.
• In November 2017, Singer sent the resume and personal statement of “Yale Applicant 1" to Meredith with the note that he planned to “revise" the information to include a connection to competitive soccer.
• On Nov. 13, 2017, Singer sent Meredith a modified application that falsely claimed “Yale Applicant 1" was the co-captain of a “prominent club soccer team in southern California" — although she did not even participate in competitive soccer programs.
• Meredith designated “Yale Applicant 1" as someone he wanted on his soccer team and she was admitted to Yale on Jan. 1, 2018.
• That same day, Singer mailed Meredith a check for $400,000 funneled through the bank accounts linked to the Key Worldwide Foundation charity.
• Singer was paid $1.2 million by the family of “Yale Applicant 1," including $900,000 directed into the bank accounts of the Key Worldwide Foundation charity.
Meredith apparently decided to strike out on his own and on April 12, 2018 met with the father of “Yale Applicant 2" at a Boston hotel, where he demanded $450,000 in cash in order to designate his daughter as a member of his soccer team.
He collected $2,000 as a down payment and $4,000 later from a Connecticut bank.
But the father was not alone. FBI agents secretly recorded the transaction, and were in control of the Connecticut bank account.

Learning From the Hippest of the Hip

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
In 1970, when Hampshire College in Amherst, Mass., first admitted students, it was the hippest of the hip colleges.
Lately, Hampshire's enrollment has been dropping, a bad development for a college that is about 90 percent tuition dependent.
Hampshire alumni and administration officials are struggling to save the school, only one of many where this kind of thing is happening. Green Mountain College, a progressive school in Vermont, has announced that it expects to close after the spring semester. Goddard College, another progressive Vermont school, is fighting to stay alive.
I cover higher education for The New York Times, and the tribulations of small colleges are not a new issue for me. I know that for small institutions, having a distinctive niche is especially important. But if any school had a niche, it was these colleges. Could progressivism have become the wrong niche to have?
The developments at Hampshire, which I wrote about recently for the National section, attracted my attention because it seemed counterintuitive that in an age of increasingly outspoken progressivism, an era that produced Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the newly elected democratic socialist congresswoman from New York, a college founded on progressive principles would fade into the sunset.
But analysts told me that the Wall Street meltdown of 2008 was still being felt in higher education. Students applying to college today vividly remember their older siblings coming home to live in their childhood bedrooms.
Those younger siblings have reacted by standing in line to get into oversubscribed computer science programs, which seem more practical than liberal arts.
"We're in the era of middle-class uncertainty," Dennis Gephardt, an education analyst at Moody's, told me.
There's nothing like going someplace to truly understand it, so I drove to Hampshire in a blinding snowstorm, eager to see what it was like. My first stop was a 7:30 a.m. breakfast with Hampshire's president, Miriam Nelson, known as Mim by students and faculty members at the college. She has been president for less than a year and seemed understandably distressed at being blamed for a crisis that has been years in the making.
The buildings are functional Modernist, not ivy-covered, which seemed appropriate. There is a sustainable building with recycled toilet waste. The students I encountered were decidedly quirky and passionate about their school. It is a place where, one student, Daya Mena, told me, "we're trained to question everything."
In that questioning spirit, Hampshire allows for a student member of the board of trustees. The current trustee is Ms. Mena, a first-generation college student from a Puerto Rican-Dominican family in the South Bronx. If Hampshire had not accepted her, she said, she would probably have gone to community college in New York City.
At Hampshire, she has been able to take classes at surrounding colleges, which are part of a consortium. Her favorite was Smith, the all-women's college, where, she said, sounding truly awed, the women were "absolutely brilliant." The arrangement enabled her to explore courses that might lead to medical school, she said. Still, she wanted to make sure I understood that she considered her Hampshire education rigorous. Her final project, she said, was on using mathematical modeling to predict the impact of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing on the viral dynamics of H.I.V. I spoke to Ms. Mena for about an hour. She said being at Hampshire had changed her ideas about biology.
As night fell, I ended up in Mim's office. It was occupied by students protesting her handling of the financial crisis. She was not there. Students lounged on sleeping bags, did their homework and chatted. Two alumni who live nearby arrived bearing food. One of them, Mary-Moore Cathcart, assured the students that they were not alone.
"There have been thousands of people on the outside of here working on this," she said. "We are you, 20, 30, 40 years from now."
I had the feeling that the students could not really imagine that she was ever like them. But in Hampshire fashion, they exchanged hugs.

Texto completo: Despiterecent measles cases, the deadly virus isfacing high vaccination rates in Bay Area children due to a 2016 law that ended most options for parents to avoid immunizing their kids.
"Measles is extremely contagious and can be very serious. The best defense is vaccination," said Dr. Karen Smith, director of the California Department of Public Health.
Health officials confirmedlast week that at least three Bay Area residents contracted measles in February after an international flight. A sick Santa Cruz County adult inadvertently infected two other passengers one from Santa Clara County and the other from San Francisco who were on the plane.
And in Washington state, a measles outbreak has sickened at least 70 people and forced hundreds of students to stay home from school.
The infections evoke worrisome memories of 2015, when a single sick visitor to Disneyland triggered an outbreak in 146 people from several states, many of them unvaccinated children.
That expanding outbreak was blamed on California's permissive vaccine law, which at the time offered easy-to-obtain exemptions, leaving tens of thousands of children unprotected against exposure to measles, mumps and rubella.
But after a highly contentious political battle, California now requires all children to be vaccinated before entering kindergarten; no "personal belief" exemptions are allowed. Schools also are pushing parents to file necessary paperwork regarding their child's vaccinations, so that fewer records are incomplete.
Almost all California kindergartners 96.9 percent are vaccinated, ranking it among the top 10 states in the U.S. for vaccinations, according to the federal Centers For Disease Control and Prevention.
Before the new law, the vaccination rate was lower: 92.2 percent.
California also reduced the rate from 4.4 percent to 1.9 percent of so-called provisional enrollments, when a student has one dose of a vaccine but not the required full course of all doses.
Meanwhile, some other states, such as Texas, are considering proposals that would allow more vaccine exemptions for personal or philosophical reasons. The internet is contributing to suspicion about vaccine safety by spreading anti-vaccine content, such as linking childhood vaccines to autism, which scientists have said is not true.
On Thursday, Facebook announced a plan to combat vaccine misinformation. It will reduce the ranking of groups and pages that spread false information about vaccines so that they appear less often. Other sites, such as Pinterest and YouTube, are taking steps to block anti-vaccine content from appearing in advertising and search results.
"We are fully committed to the safety of our community and will continue to expand on this work," said a statement by Facebook's Monika Bickert, vice president of Global Policy Management.
An analysis of a state Department of Public Health database shows how much vaccine rates have improved particularly in Santa Cruz and Marin counties, which had some of the largest concentrations of parents who refused to get their children immunized over concerns that the shots caused autism and other illnesses.
In 2014-15, 17 schools in Santa Cruz County had kindergarten vaccination rates below 80 percent. Last year, only two schools did. In Marin County, the number of schools with low vaccination rates fell from 19 to four.
Even in private schools, which typically have larger numbers of unvaccinated children, rates have improved.
Three years ago, 33 percent of the students at the private Waldorf School in upscale Los Altos Hills were fully vaccinated. Last year, 83 percent were full vaccinated.
At Menlo Park's Peninsula School, vaccination rates jumped from 67 percent to 90 percent. Vaccination rates at Sausalito's New Village School have increased from 30 percent to 62 percent.
Meanwhile, schools in lower-income communities are getting better at ensuring that parents get their kids to the doctor and deliver the paperwork.
In Alameda County, where Oakland Unified schools had some of the state's highest percentages of kindergartners whose vaccination records were incomplete, rates have soared from 20 percent at some schools in 2014-15 to 95 percent in 2017-2018.
After news of the recent outbreak, Santa Clara County Public Health Department spokeswoman Britt Ehrhardt offered reassurance.
"The general public is at very low risk of measles as a result of these cases. No other passengers contracted measles as a result of exposure on that flight," she said in a statement issued to this news organization. "Public health investigators have not identified any evidence indicating that measles is spreading within the impacted counties."
Large measles outbreaks are occurring in many countries, including in Europe. So far this year, there have been 206 confirmed measles cases in the United States, mostly among unvaccinated people in New York, Texas and Washington state. Most of the cases in New York affected the Orthodox Jewish communities in Brooklyn and Rockland County, where an unvaccinated child contracted measles in Israel and spread it to unvaccinated children at home, according to The New York Times.
Despite the gains in overall vaccination rates in California and other states, efforts by some high-ranking officials continue to roil the vaccine debate.
In Texas, some lawmakers want to make it easier to opt out of childhood vaccinations, and they're trying to limit public information about exemption rates. And Darla Shine, the wife of former White House communications director Bill Shine, has repeatedly tweeted out debunked information about vaccines.
In February, she expressed sadness that her vaccinated children "will never have the life long natural immunity I have. Come breathe on me!"
"Bring back our #ChildhoodDiseases they keep you healthy & fight cancer," she tweeted.
Measles can cause pneumonia, vision loss, severe diarrhea and even death. In 2017, it killed 136,000 people around the world, including many young children, according to the World Health Organization.
Health experts say measles can be easily prevented with two doses of a vaccine that has been in use since the 1960s. A large new study publishedlast week in the Annals of Internal Medicine found no link between autism and the vaccine, confirming long-accepted consensus among scientists.
"Vaccination is especially important for those who plan to travel internationally," said Smith, of the California Department of Public Health. "Unvaccinated travelers are at high risk of becoming infected and spreading it to others after they come home."

Texto completo: Priscilla Villarreal es una reportera sobre cuatro ruedas: hace lo que ella llama “noticias en movimiento” desde su “demonio azul” , la camioneta con la que recorre las calles de la fronteriza ciudad de Laredo, Texas . Su forma de hacer periodismo es novedosa ya que combina todas las posibilidades que brinda Facebook y, a la vez, cuenta en espanglish historias que pueden ser de utilidad para sus más de 120 000 seguidores (y sumando).
Hija de migrantes mexicanos, Lagordiloca , como se hace llamar en la red social, nació en Estados Unidos hace 34 años. Después de dejar la escuela a temprana edad, tuvo varios trabajos, el último de ellos en un desguace para el que recogía chatarra de tráileres inservibles. Desde 2015, su trabajo como reportera de exclusivas locales ha dado un giro a su vida ya que, según dijo al diario New York Times, le ha ayudado a superar los problemas de depresión y estrés postraumático que venía sufriendo tras la pérdida prematura de su bebé hace alrededor de diez años.
Con una forma desenfadada y directa de contar las noticias, Villarreal informa sobre accidentes de tráfico, redadas policiales o crímenes locales . También ha contadado en primicia temas relacionados con corruptelas en el seno de las autoridades policiales de su ciudad, que han supuesto incluso su detención en un debate sobre los límites de la libertad de expresión del que salió airosa .
Junto con la información, comparte también su opinión sobre el caso y envuelve todo en un ya característico tono de “chisme” . “Yo hablo el lenguaje de las calles y por eso la gente me sigue” – reconoció en una entrevista. En su página de Facebook también se ven artículos de otros medios y recomendaciones de sus lugares favoritos . La pequeña cantidad de ingresos que recibe de los restaurantes que frecuenta le permite continuar con su carrera como reportera.
Los videos en directo por Facebook son su canal estrella de comunicación. Los empieza con un recurrente “¡Qué rollo!” y, a través de ellos, revela las exclusivas, cuenta en pantalla lo que está sucediendo e, incluso, habla de su vida personal y responde al momento a los comentarios de sus seguidores . Por todo ello, no ha tardado en hacerse popular y ha cosechado un gran número de fans -que la paran por la calle para pedirle fotos y autógrafos- pero tambien algunos haters -que critican su aspecto físico o su forma de hacer comunicación.
Villarreal admitió al New York Time que a quien más miedo tiene es a la policía . Y es que el departamento policial de Laredo la tiene en el punto de mira. Según Daxton Stewart -de la Universidad Cristiana de Texas, en su página se publica información que las autoridades no quieren que vean la luz .
En 2017 Priscila Villarreal informó -con nombre y apellidos- del suicidio de un agente de la oficina de aduanas y control de fronteras (CPB , por sus siglas en inglés). Por esta noticia la arrestaron, acusada de delito de tercer grado por uso incorrecto de la información . Antes de este arresto, una oficial de policía había sido suspendida de sus funciones durante 20 días , por considerar que era ella quien suministraba información a Lagordiloca .
Los cargos hacia la reportera fueron desestimados al poco tiempo y, lejos de debilitarla, le otorgaron mayor visibilidad en la comunidad y la acercaron a nuevas fuentes de información .
La popularidad de Lagordiloca crece a pasos agigantados, ya no solo en la pequeña ciudad de Ladero (de 260 000 habitantes) sino también en todo el territorio nacional. Su camioneta, la música de banda y (a veces su madre) son sus mejores compeñeras. Con su trabajo está proponiendo un modo de hacer periodismo que se adapta a su público y a las posibilidades tecnológicas de estos tiempos .

Vermont bill to legalize marijuana sales moves to House

Texto completo: Marijuana Moment is a wire service assembled by Tom Angell, a marijuana legalization activist and journalist covering marijuana reform nationwide. The views expressed by Angell or Marijuana Moment are neither endorsed by the Globe nor do they reflect the Globe's views on any subject area.
As Vermont's legislature resumes following last week's recess, key committees and lawmakers are putting renewed focus on legislation to tax and regulate marijuana sales for adults.
The state Senate gave veto-proof approval to S. 54 earlier this month. Now the proposal goes to the House for consideration, but the larger legislative body isn't going to rush into a floor vote right away; it still has other bills to evaluate before it can take up legislation “crossing over" from the Senate.
“The House has a tendency to go through things with a fine-tooth comb," Representative Sam Young told Marijuana Moment in an interview. “It's just the nature of the House. We've never taken testimony on tax and regulate either."
“The Senate's done it several times, but not in the House," he said. “I believe the support is there, we've just got to do the work and fine-tune some stuff."
The Senate-passed legislation would impose a 16 percent excise tax on sales along with a two percent local option tax for towns that levee the fee. The bill provides for the creation of a three-person Cannabis Control Board that would issue licenses and regulate the marijuana economy. Officials have projected a range of $3.8 million to $7.4 million in revenue in the first fiscal year, with the expected haul rising to as much as $16.6 million by 2024.
The bill has not yet been assigned to a committee by House Speaker Mitzi Johnson, though Representative Sarah Copeland-Hanzas said it is likely to come before the House Committee on Government Operations, which she chairs.
“It could reside in my committee the entire time and I could ask for input from the Judiciary, Agriculture, General and probably the Human Services committees as well," she said.
Copeland-Hanzas said she'll also likely end up needing additional panels to consult on the bill.
Under the legislation as it stands, licenses for cultivators and testing labs would be issued between September and October of 2020. Retailers would receive licenses in spring 2021.
Vermont became the first state to legalize marijuana by legislative action — as opposed to via a voter initiative — in 2018, but it left out any provision to allow its sale. The Senate has passed legislation to legalize and regulate cannabis sales multiple times in the past, but the larger House, where S. 54 sits now, has failed to adopt similar proposals.
While the current bill's path through the House remains to be seen, proponents say newly expanded Democratic and Progressive majorities in both chambers will play to their favor.
“The fact that we have separated the question of whether or not we have marijuana legal for adult consumption from the question of whether or not we have retail sales does make a difference to a lot of people," Copeland-Hanzas said.
Dave Silberman, an attorney and pro bono drug policy reform advocate, said he was looking forward to hearing testimony in the House.
“My sense is the reason that tax and regulate votes have failed in the House in the past is because there have been no substantive committee hearings on tax and regulate," he said. “In order to get big policy done, a lot of people just feel like the process is very important and folks who are sympathetic toward tax and regulate, who are supportive of tax and regulate, have held back because of that lack of process."
“What's different this year is that the speaker has publicly stated that we are going to get multiple committees involved with the process this year, and I think that's a huge step this year," he added. “It's something I've been begging for for the past three years."
Although she has committed to holding hearings on the issue, Johnson has also said she's unconvinced the state is ready for taxed and regulated sales.
“You know, I'm honestly really torn on it," she told Vermont Public Radio in January.
The House's Committee on General, Housing, and Military Affairs is holding on to H. 196, a separate tax and regulate bill, authored and introduced by Young and cosponsored by more than a third of the House's membership. In his legislation, existing dispensaries, which currently only serve patients on the state's medical marijuana registry, could pay a $75,000 fee to start recreational sales to the public next year.
Those collected funds would be used to offset the costs of setting up the Cannabis Control Board. Senate leaders opted to not include a similar measure in their bill, saying it would create an unfair advantage for the current providers.
“I think it could be helpful in front-loading some of the revenue that we need," Copeland-Hanzas said. “This is really all about consumer protection, and it's hard to imagine where in a small state we're going to find a bunch of budgetary dollars to do that."
Other details the House will have to grapple with include the rate at which sales are taxed, funds for education and prevention efforts, and the number of positions on the Cannabis Control Board, which had dropped from five to three positions in the final version of the Senate's bill.
Governor Phil Scott, who reluctantly signed legislation to legalize low-level marijuana possession and home cultivation last year, has said he would be unwilling to sign a bill to tax and regulate sales unless public safety initiatives, including roadside testing, are funded as well.
“To be very direct: There must be comprehensive and convincing plans completed in these areas before I will begin to consider the wisdom of implementing a commercial 'tax and regulate' system for an adult marijuana market," he said last year prior to signing the previous bill.
Young said he's aware of Scott's demands.
“We need to work it out with the governor because we're going to need a signature," he said. “Without it, all the effort is for nothing."

G.O.P. House Members Explain Their 'No' Votes On Antibigotry Measure

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The House passed a resolution on Thursday that condemned anti-Semitism and other forms of bigotry. The resolution, written by House Democrats, began as an implicit response to comments made by Representative Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota, that were widely deemed anti-Semitic, but when some Democrats objected to singling her out, the resolution was broadened to condemn other forms of hatred.
Earlier this year, House Republicans unanimously endorsed a resolution that condemned white nationalism and white supremacy after Representative Steve King, Republican of Iowa, asked when the term "white supremacy" had become controversial, capping years of bigoted comments that had gone unpunished.
This time, they were not so united, and some Democrats demanded to know why.
Here is their answer:
"The frustration on the Republican side was that they watered down the amendment," Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the Republican leader, said at a news conference on Friday. (Mr. McCarthy voted for the resolution; one of his top lieutenants, Representative Liz Cheney, voted against it.)
Representative Andy Biggs of Arizona
"We're here today because a member of this body issued a series of anti-Semitic statements," Mr. Biggs said in a floor speech on Thursday.
He spoke of the difference between justice and mercy, adding: "We now have a pattern and we begin to wonder how we extend mercy when justice cries out against one who is anti-Semitic. It doesn't help that Democratic leaders have attempted to rationalize and protect this individual."
In 2016, Mr. Biggs raised eyebrows when he charged that the Jewish philanthropist George Soros was buying a local election for county attorney.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Representative Mo Brooks of Alabama
Mr. Brooks said he voted against the resolution because its "failure to specifically state opposition to discrimination against Caucasian-Americans and Christians, while reflective of Socialist Democrat priorities and values is, by omission, fatal to the bill."
After Mr. Brooks said in 2016 that Muslims wanted to "kill every gay person in America," the Alabama chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations demanded an apology.
Representative Ken Buck of Colorado
Mr. Buck, in a statement after the vote, criticized the resolution for failing "to address a problem that needed to be confronted."
"Anti-Semitism can't be compared with any other hate speech without marginalizing the history of Jewish oppression," he said. "I will not vote to overlook the anti-Semitism which has been covered up by the Democratic leadership."
Representative Ted Budd of North Carolina
Mr. Budd, reacting on Twitter, said that he voted against the resolution because it failed to name Ms. Omar or list her comments.
Representative Michael C. Burgess of Texas
The legislation, Mr. Burgess said in a statement, "does not adequately refute the anti-Semitism that has been displayed in the U.S. House of Representatives."
Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming
Perhaps the most striking "no" vote came from Ms. Cheney, the No. 3 Republican, because of her role as chairwoman of the House Republican Conference.
"Today's resolution vote was a sham put forward by Democrats to avoid condemning one of their own and denouncing vile anti-Semitism," Ms. Cheney said in a statement after the vote.
The Democrats' resolution left the party with internal questions about where to draw the line on speech.
Representative Chris Collins of New York
Mr. Collins was re-elected in November even after he was indicted on a charge of insider trading. He has kept a low profile, but after his "no" vote, he took to Twitter.
"After reading the final resolution I did not feel it was strong enough in support of Israel, the only true democracy in the Middle East, and that is why I voted no," Mr. Collins said.
Representative K. Michael Conaway of Texas
Mr. Conaway said in a statement that House Democrats "must take bigotry of all kinds seriously, not just instances that fit their progressive liberal agenda."
Representative Rick Crawford of Arkansas
"If Democrat Leaders wanted to specifically address anti-Semitism and a member of their conference who has repeatedly made anti-Semitic comments," Mr. Crawford said on Twitter, "this resolution failed in nearly every way possible."
Representative Jeff Duncan of South Carolina
Mr. Duncan argued that a true condemnation would have made reference to Ms. Omar, and the comments that prompted the resolution.
Mr. Duncan stirred protests in 2017 when he posted on Facebook an image of a white man labeled "Europe" with a noose around his neck watering a small tree labeled "Islam," with one end of the noose tied around it. "Chew on this picture," he wrote.
"Jeff I know you're not racist. Let's put that to the side," Bakari Sellers, a former Democratic legislator in South Carolina, tweeted in response. "But this is bigoted, ignorant and embarrassing."
Representative Louie Gohmert of Texas
In a fiery speech on the House floor on Thursday, Mr. Gohmert complained that the resolution was "watered down."
Mr. Gohmert dealt with his own accusations of anti-Semitism last year after he falsely accused Mr. Soros of collaborating with the Nazis during World War II, a popular myth on the far right. "George Soros is supposed to be Jewish, but you wouldn't know it from the damage he's inflicted on Israel, and the fact that he turned on fellow Jews and helped take the property that they owned," he said on Fox Business Network.
Patrick Gaspard, the president of Mr. Soros's Open Society Foundations, sent a letter to Mr. Gohmert in December demanding an apology for the "disturbing and false anti-Semitic slur."
Mr. Soros was a child in Nazi-occupied Hungary.
Representative Paul Gosar of Arizona
"Without naming the offender, the chastisement is an empty gesture," Mr. Gosar said on Twitter. "It's time for Democrats to take real action against these anti-Jewish remarks."
Mr. Gosar raised eyebrows after the deadly white supremacist march in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017 when he said "an Obama sympathizer" -- funded by Mr. Soros -- "started the rally," then repeated the claim that Mr. Soros "turned in his own people to the Nazis."
Representative Tom Graves of Georgia
Mr. Graves criticized the resolution in a statement as "a sham vote" that failed to directly address Ms. Omar or her remarks.
Representative Peter T. King of New York
Mr. King complained on Twitter that the resolution was weakened because of political correctness, and said it was a "sad day for Congress."
"Victory for hate speech!" he added.
Representative Doug LaMalfa of California
In a statement to The New York Times, Mr. LaMalfa said that the resolution -- which he called a "last-minute, politically driven catchall smorgasbord" -- was an "abomination to the message that should be sent on the anti-Jewish, anti-Israel rhetoric."
Representative Thomas Massie of Kentucky
Mr. Massie joined his colleagues in criticizing the scope of the measure, asking on Twitter, "Now that the resolution protects just about every group on the planet, can we add 'babies on the day of their birth' as a protected class?"
Representative Steven M. Palazzo of Mississippi
A spokeswoman for Mr. Palazzo did not respond to a request for comment.
Representative Mike Rogers of Alabama
"House Democrats had the opportunity to make a strong statement against this vile bigotry by condemning hateful statements," Mr. Rogers in a statement. "Instead, they caved to their radical socialist base and took no meaningful action."
Representative Chip Roy of Texas
Mr. Roy described the resolution in a statement as "a sham cover vote designed to avoid dealing with a rogue member."
Representative Greg Steube of Florida
In a statement, Mr. Steube said the resolution should have mentioned Ms. Omar by name and the context of her remarks.
Representative Mark Walker of North Carolina
In a statement, Mr. Walker said that it was a "spineless resolution" that "provided cover to a politician spreading hatred and anti-Semitism."
Representative Ted Yoho of Florida
"It was a very shallow vote," Mr. Yoho said in an interview on Friday. "They did everything they could to not condemn the one that was brought out to. So I think it was just a show vote."
Representative Lee Zeldin of New York
In a floor speech on Thursday, Mr. Zeldin asked why Ms. Omar was not named in the resolution and noted that she had not apologized for her most recent comments. (She apologized for other remarks seen as anti-Semitic.)
"Why would she be more emboldened to refuse an apology altogether?" he asked in a floor speech. "I don't believe she is naïve. I believe that she knows exactly what she is doing."

Texto completo: CARACAS, Venezuela - Opposition lawmakers and aid groups warned Sunday that an unprecedented nationwide blackout in Venezuela was causing a rising number of deaths, as citizens struggled for a fourth day to find food and water and hospitals were paralyzed.
"What Venezuelans are living today looks like a science fiction movie," said Juan Guaidó, the opposition leader who is spearheading a U.S.-backed campaign to oust President Nicolás Maduro.
At a news conference Sunday, Guaidó said that at least 17 deaths had occurred at hospitals as a result of the outages. Fifteen of them were in the eastern city of Maturin, he said. Meanwhile, a medical aid group, Codevida, said it had reports of 15 people who had died of kidney failure linked to the lack of power.
It was not possible to independently confirm the reports. Venezuela's health minister, Carlos Alvarado, said on state TV that reports of deaths linked to the power outages were "false." The government has blamed the blackout on sabotage by the U.S. government.
Guaidó said the power outage resulted from poor maintenance - specifically, the failure to trim vegetation near major power lines, which caught fire. Although electricity was restored to some areas on Sunday, it was often fickle, failing hours later.
The lack of power has left hospitals depending on generators - if they have them - and has also shut the Caracas metro and virtually halted public transportation. That means many medical personnel can't get to their jobs.
On Sunday afternoon, a 24-year-old woman sat in a chair weeping outside the hospital at the Central University of Venezuela. "My baby just died," she said softly. "There was no pediatric surgeon."
The woman, Alexandra Amundaray, a parking-lot attendant, said her 5-month-old son, Emanuel, had been suffering from dehydration in recent days. On Sunday morning, when he awoke, he was pale and cold, she said. She managed to get one of the few functioning ambulances in the city to rush him to the hospital, where he was treated at the emergency room for a blocked intestine, she said. "They went looking for a pediatric surgeon," she said. "And then he died."
The director of the hospital, Earle Siso, said in an interview that no patients had died because of the power outage; a generator was providing electricity for emergency cases. He denied a shortage of medical personnel. "Our biggest problem is the international blockade that's been in effect since the era of President Obama," he said.
But, shortly before talking to a reporter, he was surrounded by doctors and nurses complaining loudly that their colleagues hadn't reported for work.
A woman waiting outside the emergency room for a doctor to see her 6-month-old daughter, who was suffering from a bacterial infection, said she had been told that only one doctor was working Sunday in the pediatric ward. The woman spoke on the condition of anonymity, saying she feared government retaliation.
Most of the hospital's corridors were dark. Elias Urbaez, a cardiology resident, said that Sunday was his day off but that he had decided not to return home, even though he hadn't been home in two days. He relies on public transportation and worried that he wouldn't be able to get back for his shift Monday.
The doctor had been washing in a basin of water, he said, "but then the water ran out."
The massive blackout comes amid an intensifying political clash. Guaidó, the National Assembly president, maintains that Maduro's reelection last year was illegitimate because of fraud and that under the constitution he is the interim president. Guaidó has been recognized by more than 50 countries.
Guaidó and U.S. officials have accused Maduro's government of blocking delivery of international humanitarian aid to help a population facing soaring inflation and shortages. They have seized on images of trucks set aflame during an opposition effort last month to send convoys of aid over the border. On Sunday, however, the New York Times reported that an investigation of video footage suggests that an anti-government protester accidentally set off the blaze.
Maduro has dismissed Guaidó as a pawn in a U.S.-orchestrated effort to unseat him. The president tweeted on Sunday that the electrical system "has been the subject of multiple cybernetic attacks that forced its collapse and have hurt the efforts to re-connect it nationally. Nonetheless, we are making great efforts so that, in the next few hours, we will restore power in a stable, definitive form."
But few Venezuelans seemed optimistic that the government would succeed in reviving the electrical grid soon. Around the country, long lines formed outside bakeries, supermarkets and gas stations that had power.
Oscar Hernandez, 40, was buying candles Sunday at a supermarket in eastern Caracas. "I'm preparing for Armageddon," said the engineer, whose family had used up all their supply during the blackout.
Victoria Daboin, 27, went to the butcher last week and bought nine chickens, 16 chicken breasts and beef - a major shopping trip in a country suffering from a severe economic crisis. But on Sunday, after 72 hours without electricity, she had to empty her refrigerator, as the meat risked spoilage.
"I'm desperate," said Daboin, a municipal worker.
Alicia Medina, 63, said she had been looking for ice all day to try to preserve the food she has at home. "I went to 10 places and nothing," she said, outside a grocery store in eastern Caracas.
Meanwhile cellphone service remained spotty in much of the country. On Sunday, about 20 cars had parked on the side of a major Caracas highway. Why? "I know I look like a crazy lady," said Carolina Pardo, a 45-year-old trainer at a gym. "But this is the only place I can get a signal in the entire city."

Might Democratic push for reparations benefit Trump?

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Tiptoeing along the edge of caricature, Sen. Elizabeth Warren says: Native Americans should be "at the table" with African-Americans for a "robust discussion" about making some Americans pay reparations to other Americans to atone for misdeeds by still other Americans. The enumeration of the misdeeds, and the assignment of guilt for them, will presumably come later. What is, however, already clear is that the Massachusetts Democrat is going to need a large table.
If reparations are owed to the descendants of all members of minority groups that experienced protracted discrimination, the Irish can apply, citing the widespread practice of employers posting admonitions that "Irish need not apply." Italians, too: An 1895 advertisement seeking labor to build a New York reservoir said whites would be paid $1.30 to $1.50 per day, "colored" workers $1.25 to $1.40 and Italians $1.15 to $1.25. Asians on the West Coast were subject to severe discrimination and violence. And Jews were restricted from acquiring the momentum that elite universities impart on the path to wealth.
Native Americans and African-Americans experienced uniquely severe injustices. However, there must be some statute of limitations to close the books on attempts to assign guilt across many generations to many categories of offenders (racial, ethnic, class). How does one compute the compensation that can justly be extracted from persons who, although they participate today in the national prosperity to which slaves involuntarily made substantial contributions, had no participation in the injustices inflicted?
It is also true that the nation as a whole was injured by the exclusion of African-Americans' talents from American dynamism, both before and after hundreds of thousands of white Union soldiers were killed or maimed - should their descendants be exempted from paying reparations? - in the Civil War that ended slavery. But, then, semi-slavery survived for almost a century in Jim Crow laws after the end of Reconstruction.
If, however, you doubt that American discord can become much worse, try launching a scramble among racial and ethnic constituencies to assign varying degrees of guilt to others for varying degrees of injuries.
Should reparations be means-tested, making affluent African-Americans ineligible? To avoid using moral micrometers to measure guilt and injuries, should lump sums (taken from whom? by what mechanism?) be awarded to groups? Does it matter that 3.1 million African-Americans identify themselves as of mixed race? Or that in the 2010 census, 1.8 million people self-identified as both white and black? Who would administer reparations? And at what cost to social harmony? Racial preferences ("affirmative action") remain broadly unpopular after more than 50 years (the Philadelphia Plan to integrate building- construction unions began in 1967).
And which African-Americans shall count when counting for purposes of reparations? In 2005, The New York Times reported that since 1990, the average annual flow of immigrants from Africa - about 50,000 - had been more than came in chains in any of the peak years of the trans-Atlantic slave trade.
There have been instances when reparations could be precisely targeted to defined cohorts that suffered clearly identifiable injuries. Consider an American infamy recounted in William K. Klingaman's "The Darkest Year: The American Home Front, 1941-1942." In 1942, U.S. Attorney General Francis Biddle and Secretary of War Henry Stimson said "there has been no substantial evidence of sabotage" by people of Japanese extraction living on America's West Coast. But California Attorney General Earl Warren said the "very absence of sabotage" was "the most ominous sign in the whole situation": "I believe we are just being lulled into a false sense of security." So, 120,000 American residents of Japanese descent - a majority of them U.S. citizens - were interned in camps. In 1988, each living survivor was promised a paltry $20,000 in compensation. Two more zeros would have been appropriate.
But today's flippant talk about reparations illustrates a worsening pattern of behavior among congressional Democrats, including presidential candidates. (California Sen. Kamala Harris and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro also express vague openness to reparations.) A quarter-baked idea (reparations, a Green New Deal, Medicare-for-all) is floated. There is a stampede to endorse it before thinking about the idea's dependence on enormous revenues of unknown origin and/or unavailable technologies. Then, when details, or the lack thereof, reveal the idea's wild impracticality, the stampeders breezily say: Nevertheless, the idea is virtuous because it is "aspirational." Which means that the Democratic Party is again assisting, as in 2016, Donald Trump's electoral aspirations.

Trump touts wage gains, strength of the economy after Labor Department unveils weak job report

Texto completo: President Trump touted wage gains made over the past year and the strength of the economy, as reporters pressed him on the weakest job report since September 2017, which was released Friday.

“Well, it's a step. I think you will probably find out it averages out,” Trump told reporters. “The unemployment rate just went lower. We're down now to 3.8 percent. So we had very good news in that. I think the big news really was that wages went up. And that's great for the American worker.”

“Wages are going up. First time for many years. I talked about it during the campaign for over 20 years,” Trump said. “I'm happy about that. The economy is very, very strong.”

According to the Labor Department’s February report on unemployment and hiring, average hourly wages have grown by 3.4 percent in comparison to figures from February 2018. The number marks the highest increase in year-to-year wages in more than 10 years, the New York Times reports. The Labor Department also revealed on Friday that the unemployment rate has hit 3.8 percent, dropping from 4 percent in January.

However, Labor Department data reveals only 20,000 jobs were added in February. The number was significantly lower than projections from analysts who predicted approximately 175,000 jobs would be added, per MarketWatch. In contrast, more than 300,000 jobs were added in January — despite the partial government shutdown that plagued the majority of the month.

Texto completo: After spending two years carefully studying President Donald Trump’s rhetoric — listening to his speeches, watching videos of his political rallies, and analyzing his tweets — I came to one unambiguous conclusion: Sean Hannity is the most powerful and dangerous person in America.
After the 2016 presidential election, many people feared that Fox News would become a mouthpiece for the president, amplifying his message of division and hate. The truth, however, is significantly more alarming. The president has become a mouthpiece for Fox News generally and Sean Hannity specifically.
Consider what we know. First, the president is driven by his ego, not some commitment to a core set of beliefs. He is neither a principled person nor a person of principles. Second, the president is notoriously disinterested in matters of policy. He is too intellectually lazy to read reports, study issues, learn facts, or even listen to his advisers.
Third, the president spends significant portions of his day in “executive time,” meaning he obsessively watches television, principally Fox News. Fourth, the president’s staff regularly present him with printed copies of the chyrons, the all-caps text at the bottom of the screen, from his favorite television programs. He apparently really enjoys seeing his name (as if this weren’t already clear from his buildings). And fifth, the president not only watches Hannity regularly, he also speaks with Hannity regularly. In fact, he has even had Hannity on stage with him at political rallies.

Sean Hannity calls reporters covering Donald Trump rally 'fake news'
2020 Dems should test their mettle in a Fox News debate instead of running scared
Fox News went all in for Donald Trump. In its eyes, the president can do no wrong.
Considering these facts and given that the president often tweets things he has just seen on Fox News, is there anyone who genuinely believes that Trump is the one telling Hannity what to say? The president is clearly not a person of ideas; he’s barely a person of coherent thought, as his recent two-hour rambling “off-script” speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference reaffirmed. Simply put, Sean Hannity is not spreading Donald Trump’s endless stream of lies, self-aggrandizing delusions and wild conspiracy theories, he’s authoring them. And Donald Trump is obediently repeating and tweeting them.
That should be alarming to every American. It should be alarming not simply because Hannity was never elected by the American public to lead anything, but also because Hannity is widely trusted. As Adweek recently reported, Hannity was the most widely watched program on cable news in 2018 (for the second year in a row), drawing 3. 2 million viewers on average. But the popularity of Hannity is based on a fundamental deception. Hannity has convinced a wide swath of the American public that he is a journalist and that his show on Fox News is a news program. Both of these things are demonstrably untrue.
Hannity is not fake news or any news at all
To be clear, I’m not suggesting that Hannity is “fake news” or even biased news. I’m pointing out that Hannity is not news at all. As both Sean Hannity and Fox News have somewhat reluctantly acknowledged, Hannity is a political opinion program. Sean Hannity told The New York Times in August 2016, for instance, that he has “never claimed to be a journalist,” and he affirmed that fact on Twitter in October 2016 when he tweeted he’s a “talk host” and “not a journalist. ”
Hannity’s employer, Fox News, concurs, and on Nov. 15, 2017, the network noted that, “Shep (Smith) is an outstanding journalist, and Sean is an outstanding opinion commentator. ”
But Hannity has also claimed to be a journalist, albeit an "advocacy journalist. " This idea, combined with the fact that Hannity airs on a network with “news” in its title is, to put it mildly, frightening.
This is the state of American politics and democracy: We have a political opinion commentator on the far right (who’s not a journalist, has no journalistic credentials, and follows no journalistic code of ethics) accusing real news outlets like CNN, The New York Times and The Washington Post of being “fake news. ” Meanwhile, that same right-wing opinion commentator is telling the sitting president what to say and think. Welcome to President Hannity’s America.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Michael Cohen directed his former lawyer to approach President Donald Trump about a pardon, his current attorney confirmed Thursday.
But Lanny Davis said the revelation does not conflict with his client's congressional testimony in late February in which Cohen, Trump's former personal attorney, claimed he never asked for a pardon.
In a statement Thursday, Davis stressed that Cohen's willingness to explore a pardon ended when Cohen pulled out of a joint defense agreement with the president's legal team. He said that was when Cohen "authorized me as a new lawyer to say publicly Mr.Cohen would never accept a pardon from President Trump even if offered."
"That continues to be the case," Davis said. "And his statement at the Oversight Hearing was true – and consistent with his post-joint-defense-agreement commitment to tell the truth."
Testifying under oath, Cohen told lawmakers on the House Oversight and Reform Committee, "I have never asked for, nor would I accept, a pardon from President Trump."
Davis told ABC News that Cohen's statement was "literally true."
Cohen "never asked President Trump for a pardon," he said. "His lawyer explored the disingenuous 'dangle' repeatedly floated by Rudy (Giuliani) and Trump in one meeting and never followed up."
In his statement Thursday, Davis said Cohen "directed his attorney to explore possibilities of a pardon at one point with Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani as well as other lawyers advising President Trump."
The New York Times reported Wednesday that Giuliani said he had been contacted by "lawyers for several people" who have become embroiled in the Justice Department investigations around the president. But he said he could not confirm Davis' assertion because of attorney-client privilege.
Giuliani said Trump's policy has been not to consider granting any pardons until the investigations are concluded.
"I always gave one answer, and they always left disappointed," Giuliani said.
Citing unnamed sources, The Washington Post reported that Cohen told lawmakers during closed-door sessions that Trump attorney Jay Sekulow was also part of the pardon discussions. But the paper said Sekulow flatly denied it and said Cohen's claim was "not true."
Sekulow also has denied Cohen's allegation that he helped alter Cohen's previous testimony to Congress. In November, Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about when negotiations over a Trump Tower Moscow project ended. Cohen told lawmakers that Trump's lawyers, including Sekulow, had altered his testimony to obscure the Trump Tower timeline.
Sekulow told The Post the claim was "completely false."
Cohen reportedly offered lawmakers a marked-up copy of that testimony to back up his claim. But The Post reported that a person who had seen the document said the changes "were not substantive" and were not about the Moscow project.
Republicans have cast doubt on Cohen's credibility since he began to cooperate with special counsel Robert Mueller. Those attacks were ratcheted up when Cohen – who had already been sentenced to three years in prison, in part for lying to Congress – implicated Trump in illegal activity during his explosive congressional testimony.
On Twitter, Trump has written several posts accusing Cohen of contradictions between his testimony, where he called Trump a "cheat" and a "racist," and a manuscript he wrote before his legal troubles began, which Trump said was flattering of the president.
After Cohen's testimony, Oversight Committee Reps. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, and Mark Meadows, R-N.C., sent a 30-page letter to Attorney General William Barr in which they referred Cohen for investigation on perjury charges.
Davis called the referral a "sad misuse of the criminal justice system."

For Democrats to win, they must avoid leftist mythmaking

Texto completo: At 29, with her Puerto Rican heritage, megawatt smile and 3 million-plus Twitter followers, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez embodies the rising power of younger female nonwhite digital natives in American politics. If Hillary Rodham Clinton, or HRC, reflects the past, AOC foreshadows the future.
But as a role model for Democrats who desperately want to defeat Donald Trump, AOC is not A-OK. She represents New York City, one of the most liberal cities in the country, and as a self-proclaimed democratic socialist, her radical views on issues like "Medicare-for-all" and a "Green New Deal" fall far outside her party’s mainstream — let alone the national consensus. In the latest NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, only 18 percent viewed the term "socialist" favorably.
"There is, without a doubt, a myth that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez somehow represents the narrative of Democratic primary voters in the country," Democratic pollster John Anzalone told The Washington Post. "Almost half of them identify themselves as moderates or conservatives."
Moreover, she reflects an intolerant impulse among Democratic leftists to purge the party of moderate heretics. After 26 of her fellow House members voted with Republicans to make it harder for undocumented immigrants to purchase guns, AOC threatened to put them "on a list" for primary challenges.
"Since when is it OK to put you on a Nixonian list?" Rep. Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey, co-chair of the centrist Problem Solvers Caucus, protested in the Post. "We need to have a big tent in our party, or we won’t keep the House or win the White House."
The myth Anzalone identifies has bedeviled the Democratic Party since the death of Franklin Roosevelt 74 years ago. Liberals do form a critical component of the party’s "big tent" coalition, and no Democratic nominee can win the White House without their support. That’s why the far-too-late and far-too-grudging endorsement of Clinton by Bernie Sanders (or BS) was so damaging.
That said, Democrats cannot capture the presidency or either branch of Congress by lurching leftward. A candidate in the AOC/BS mold would be a hero in New York, California and Massachusetts — and a disaster in states like Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, which handed Trump the presidency in 2016 and will be critical again next year.
Ed Rendell, the former governor of Pennsylvania, stressed this point to The New York Times: "The more we have presidential candidates or newly elected congresspeople talking about the Green New Deal, talking about ‘Medicare-for-all,’ talking about socialism, the more that plays into the Trump campaign’s hands."
Christopher Borick, a political scientist at Muhlenberg College in Allentown, Pennsylvania, added: "If you want to lock up Pennsylvania for a Democrat, the more moderate Democrats are the key."
The numbers support them. A Gallup poll in January reported that 35 percent of Americans call themselves conservatives, the same number that identify as moderates. Only 26 percent are self-described liberals, the same portion who chose that label in 2016 exit polls.
It’s true that within the Democrats’ ranks, the percentage of liberals is rising, hitting 51 percent this year according to Gallup. But pragmatists still dominate the party. Fifty-four percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents want the party to "move closer to the center" while 41 percent "would rather it shift further left."
The same tension between purists and pragmatists is playing out in the House, where the AOC types are calling for the rapid impeachment of the president. But Democratic leaders are taking a much slower approach, with Rep. Jerrold Nadler, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, insisting that impeachment must meet a "very high bar."
No president has ever been removed through impeachment (although Richard Nixon probably would have been the first, had he not resigned). The bar is and should be "very high."
But denying a president a second term through the ballot box is quite common, and in fact happened three times in five elections between 1976 and 1992. That bar is much lower and well within the reach of Democrats if they can avoid the mythmaking of leftists like AOC and BS and focus on political reality.

The Guthrie’s new season spans Austen to Zacarías; Kurt Elling to sing at the Dakota

Texto completo: Tennessee Williams is one of the faces you see on the Guthrie Theater. (He’s around back.) His play “The Glass Menagerie” has been presented by the Guthrie four times to date: in 1964, 1979 and 1988 on Vineland Place and 2007 in the new Guthrie. It will return – this time to the Wurtele Thrust Stage – in September, with Joseph Haj as director. Williams’ bittersweet play about a struggling family and a gentleman caller will launch the 2019-20 season, a mix of old, new, and new inspired by old.
“The Glass Menagerie” will begin Sept. 14. On Oct. 26, Robert Harling’s women-centric “Steel Magnolias” will move onto the McGuire Proscenium Stage. Because it wouldn’t be Christmas without “A Christmas Carol” – seriously, it wouldn’t – Crispin Whittell’s adaptation of the Charles Dickens tale will begin Nov. 12 on the thrust, with Lauren Keating continuing her run as director. Last year’s “Christmas Carol” featured two Scrooges, Nathaniel Fuller and Charity Jones. Dare we hope for that again?
In the new-inspired-by-old column, the regional premiere of Heather Raffo’s “Noura” will begin Jan. 11 on the proscenium. Like Ibsen’s Nora of “A Doll’s House,” Noura struggles with identity, belonging, others’ expectations and her own desires. Except Nora-with-a-u is a newly-minted U.S. citizen born in Iraq. This will be the regional premiere of a play that had its world premiere as recently as Feb. 2018. Raffo’s mother is American and her father is Iraqi. The Guthrie produced her award-winning solo play “9 Parts of Desire” in the Dowling in 2008.
Next season’s Shakespeare will be “Twelfth Night,” starting Feb. 8, 2020, on the thrust. This season’s Shakespeare, the well-reviewed “As You Like It,” continues through March 17. The two are considered the Bard’s best comedies. Reaching even further back in time, SITI Company’s production of Euripides’ “The Bacchae” will begin Feb. 19 on the proscenium, with Anne Bogart as director. SITI (the Saratoga International Theater Institute) has reconceived the play, written in 405 BCE, for our present day, putting its focus on women and power. Like “Noura,” this version of “The Bacchae” is very new; it premiered last September.
The Guthrie has had great success with adaptations of Jane Austen’s “Sense and Sensibility” (2016) and “Pride and Prejudice” (2003 and 2013), so why not “Emma” ? Bring on the high-waisted dresses and fire up the turntable on the thrust stage. No word yet on whose adaptation this will be, but the two previous Austens were by Kate Hamill. Some Austen scholars consider the movie “Clueless” a worthy adaptation. “Emma” will begin April 11 on the thrust.
Karen Zacarías’ “Native Gardens,” a comedy about warring Georgetown neighbors, was a hit for the Guthrie in 2017. Her “Destiny of Desire,” a comedy about babies switched at birth, will open May 30 on the proscenium. Zacarías calls her new play “a unapologetic telenovela.” José Luis Valenzuela will direct.
Joseph Haj will direct the final production on the thrust stage, the Guthrie’s first-ever staging of “Cabaret.” It will have been six years since Theater Latté Da’s indelible production with Hennepin Theatre Trust at the Pantages, when a very young Tyler Michaels dropped down from the ceiling in torn fishnet tights and into Twin Cities theater history. That should be long enough for a new take on this great classic. Plus we’re in a different political climate now. “Cabaret” will begin June 20.
The final play on the proscenium will be Lynn Nottage’s “Sweat,” her second Pulitzer Prize winner. It will begin July 25. This summer, Nottage’s “Floyd’s,” a Guthrie commission, will end the 2018-19 season on the proscenium. The Guthrie earlier produced another Nottage play, “Intimate Apparel,” in 2005.
The picks
Opens today (Thursday, March 7) at the Minnesota Museum of American Art: The Good Making of Good Things: Craft Horizons Magazine, 1941-1979. For nearly 40 years, the American Craft Council’s magazine documented the history of the American craft movement. The new exhibition at the new M – an adapted and customized version of a nationally touring show – presents a selection of studio craft from the museum’s collection and works by makers who are moving craft forward today. Includes midcentury pieces in wood, metal, fiber, ceramic, and glass. Open during museum hours. FMI. Closes June 2. Note: The American Craft Council, formerly in New York City, moved to Minneapolis in 2010. In 1979, Craft Horizons Magazine became American Craft and is still published by the ACC.
Friday at Hopkins High School: Men in Music. Each year, men from the famed Minnesota Chorale spend 10 weeks working with tenors and basses from area high school choirs. Together they explore the lively repertoire for male voices, and the young singers have the chance to perform side by side with professional singers. It’s a win-win, and add another win for those who will hear them in concert Friday. This year’s concert features singers from St. Paul Central and Hopkins high schools. 8 p.m. in the Hopkins High Auditorium. Free.
Friday through Sunday at the Cowles: BRKFST Dance Company x Kaleena Miller Dance. Breaking meets tap when two powerhouse Twin Cities dance companies meet on the Cowles stage. The BRKFST collective is six performers who draw on breaking, martial arts, burlesque, and contemporary dance vernacular to create something fresh, surprising and new. Credited with updating the tap idiom, Miller is also co-director of the Twin Cities Tap Festival. With music by local composers Renée Copeland, Tom Woodling and Haley. 7:30 p.m. Friday and Saturday, 2 p.m. Sunday. FMI and tickets ($25).
Sunday at the Dakota: Kurt Elling Quintet. Elling followed up the 2018 studio release of his new album, “The Questions,” with a live release of a selection of songs. They’re two different experiences. Elling is sublime in the studio, electric before a live audience. Either way, he has complete control over his four-octave, mahogany-tinged baritone, but live, you get a better sense of what that means, how hard it must be and the risks he takes. “The Questions” is an unusual and pointed collection. It’s not by accident that in the ugly, divided state our nation is in, Elling has chosen to sing Dylan’s “A Hard Rain’s A-Gonna Fall” and a heartbreaking version of Paul Simon’s “An American Tune,” which he recorded on an earlier album, then returned to in Trumpian times. Elling is on a roll; just last weekend at Jazz at Lincoln Center in New York, he premiered his passion project, a live radio-style drama called “The Big Blind.” Let’s cross our fingers he and his quintet make it to Minneapolis in Sunday’s snowstorm after performing in St. Louis on Saturday night. The 7 p.m. show is sold out, but tickets are still available for 9 p.m. FMI and tickets ($30-40).
Monday at Wentworth Library: Club Book: Alex Kotlowitz. Specializing in the topics of urban violence and community perseverance, the Peabody Award-winning journalist and New York Times best-selling author is out with his latest, “An American Summer: Love and Death in Chicago.” Kotlowitz is also the author of “There Are No Children Here,” about two brothers in a crime-ridden Chicago public housing complex, and “The Other Side of the River,” about America’s racial divides. 6:30 p.m. Free.

Texto completo: AGNES MARTIN, Her Life and Art, by Nancy Princenthal, 288 pp. Thames & Hudson $24.95
H ave you ever dreamed of leaving everything behind, living in an isolated cabin and doing nothing but art all day long? This may be every creative's dream at some point, but it requires a great sacrifice. You could live in a flow of remarkable bliss and generate all the art/writing/music you are inspired to do, but ultimately, you'd have to give up the company of the people you love - your friends, children and spouse. In the biography "Agnes Martin: Her Life and Art" by Nancy Princenthal, we encounter a great artist who, whether by choice or necessity, picks art over everything else.
Originally published in 2015, "Agnes Martin: Her Life and Art" has recently been released in paperback. Though other books have been published about Martin since then, this one claims to be the first biography of its kind. It won the 2016 PEN/Jacqueline Bograd Weld Award for Biography.
Agnes Martin lived many years in Taos, including her final years. She was considered one of the great abstract painters of the 20th century. In the Harwood Museum of Art, an octagonal room is devoted to her serene penciled grids on square canvases washed in pale hues.
According to her biography, Martin's life begins on a homestead in northern Saskatchewan. "Martin was a lifelong child of the North American West, bred into self-reliance and wired to spring hard on the world, to make do with little if she had to, and to invent herself as freely if circumstances required."
Throughout the book, Princenthal puts Martin's life in the context of contemporary art. For example, in 1912, the year Agnes is born, the reader learns that the first abstractions of Mondrian and Malevich were in the works.
As a young adult, Martin spends much of her time as a student and grade-school teacher. She has many jobs at the time, but she finally settles down and become a full-time artist in 1946 when she arrives in New Mexico. "And it was in New Mexico during this decade that she made the first paintings that have survived, despite her best efforts to suppress them. Though she would later postdate the moment when her life as a painter commenced, her career as an artist had unquestionably begun."
In 1957, at the age of 45, Martin's friendship with New York gallery owner Betty Parsons leads Martin to the Big Apple where she lives at Coenties Slip with many other emerging artists. "Martin could hardly have chosen a more transformative decade to be in New York… Martin would be recognized as a progenitor - however reluctant - of this movement, which came to be called Minimalism, and which helped cement New York's central place in an explosively active new art world."
It is in New York that Martin's work transforms, and she establishes the method for executing her grid paintings. Princenthal goes into pages of minute detail about how Martin's paintings are created, as well as quotes, reviews of her work and information on where all her work is exhibited. While little is said about Martin's relationships, much is said about her art, making this a comprehensive book for true art fans who want all the nitty-gritty details about Martin's work and the inspiration for her work.
Diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, Martin leaves New York and travels the country, eventually returning to New Mexico. The voices in her head instruct her to rent land and live in an adobe brick home. For many years, she lives as an aesthete with very few belongings or attachments. Since she believes she can hear animals' thoughts, she doesn't keep pets either. "Over and over, [Martin] stressed the importance of working alone, without distraction--no partners of friends, not even dogs."
Many of Martin's writings and lectures are quoted throughout the book, which gives insight into Martin's thoughts and ideals. Princenthal writes that Martin's lectures are not all that different from the tone she takes in her social interactions. Martin tells students in one lecture, "There is no half-way with art. We wake up thinking about it and we go to sleep thinking about it."
In her fifties, Martin receives wealth and recognition. "Hardly alone among artists, Martin had conflicted feelings about success. While she went all out for recognition, she also feared it, as attested by her preoccupation, in her later writing, with the sin of pride." Truly an artist's artist, throughout her extraordinary life, Martin remains grounded and true to her passion for art, never losing touch with her vision.
Princenthal is a New York-based critic and former senior editor of Art in America magazine, for which she continues to write regularly. Other publications to which she has contributed include Artforum, The Village Voice and The New York Times. She is the co-author of two recent books on leading women artists, including "The Reckoning: Women Artists of the New Millennium." Having taught at the Center for Curatorial Studies, Bard College; Princeton University; Yale University; Rhode Island School of Design and elsewhere, she is currently on the faculty of the New York's School of Visual Arts.

Texto completo: Members of the Claremont City Council last week squandered an excellent opportunity to efface the black eye inflicted on the community by one of their colleagues, declining to censure Councilor Jonathan Stone for directing a barrage of online harassment at a local couple. That’s a shame, because censure is exactly what was called for in this situation, and shortsighted because it leaves the door open to such conduct in the future.
As Valley News correspondent Patrick O’Grady reported, the council voted 6-3 against censuring Stone for using social media to attack a resident who objected to a holiday display in the city’s Broad Street Park, and his wife, who was not even a party to her husband’s complaint. (To their credit, councilors Abigail Kier, Nick Koloski and Claire Lessard voted in favor of censure.)
Sean Tanguay, an attorney who attended Wednesday’s meeting to provide legal advice to the council, pointed out that censure carries no legal weight and wouldn’t affect Stone’s ability to carry out his duties.
That is precisely why it was the correct remedy in this case.
Voters, of course, must be the ultimate judges of the conduct of elected officials, and they will render their verdict at the next election. But censure would have put the council on record as opposing ugly and inflammatory conduct by its members, and thus sent a message to the community that those who espouse minority or unpopular views can at least rely on receiving respectful treatment even when councilors sharply disagree.
Mayor Charlene Lovett, who opposed censure, remarked that until “we develop a code of conduct, we are in no position to decide who is censured and who is not.” But it will be difficult, if not impossible, to develop a specific code governing social media use and misuse that can anticipate all the many scenarios that might arise. Really, any such code need be no more complicated than, “Be civil in all your dealings.”
For his part, Stone has previously pointed out — correctly — that he did not surrender his First Amendment rights when he was sworn in as a councilor.
That’s true, but until recent years, social norms constituted a powerful curb on the no-holds-barred expression allowed by the Constitution. Society discouraged the kind of discourse Stone engaged in, such as personal insults and implicit threats, because it was thought to be beneath the dignity required by public debate.
Those norms, unfortunately, have been radically undermined by social media; what now passes for public debate often seems little more than a descent into a swamp of invective. The council could have reinforced more traditional norms by standing up for them publicly.
Another consequence of Stone’s unseemly behavior has been to portray the complaint that prompted it as somehow off-the-wall. The holiday display in a public park of a nativity scene and a menorah, as in this case, may or may not violate the establishment clause of the Constitution. But it is not a trivial matter. Only last week, the U.S. Supreme Court was again wrestling with the issue as it considered whether a 40-foot cross on public land memorializing soldiers who died in World War I was constitutionally permissible. In the course of oral argument, Justice Neil Gorsuch characterized the court’s confusing jurisprudence concerning the separation of church and state as “a dog’s breakfast” that could be clarified in that Maryland case.
Those who suspect that Supreme Court justices live in a rarefied world of theory rather than the real world of experience got some reinforcement from Justice Samuel Alito, who, according to The New York Times, warned that the court’s intervention in the Maryland church-state controversy could lead to divisiveness. “This sort of thing is being handled today in a pluralistic society in which ordinary people get along pretty well and are not at each other’s throats about religious divisions,” he said.
Let’s hope Claremont can figure out how to reconcile such divisions in the future without being “at each other’s throats.” In the meantime, it should ensure that those differences are debated respectfully.

Corporate America to Bernie Sanders: Paying dividends isn't evil

Texto completo: Corporate America wants Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., to know there's another side to their claim that rewarding investors with higher dividends and stock buybacks benefits the wealthy at the expense of the working class.

"Returning some profits to shareholders is not necessarily a bad thing," Josh Bolten, president of the Business Roundtable, and Ken Bertsch, executive director of the Council of Institutional Investors, wrote in an op-ed for the New York Times published Sunday. "Some critics of buybacks miss this point: Money returned to shareholders through buybacks and dividends does not disappear from the economy."

Individual investors, for example, can spend it on large home purchases they've been saving for, while larger shareholders like companies might lend it to other firms that are hiring and growing, they said. The cash can also be "invested in new businesses as seed money for start-ups or financing for emerging technologies," the two noted.

Their rebuttal comes a month after Schumer, the Senate's top Democrat, and Sanders, one of several candidates seeking the party nomination to run against President Trump in 2020, said they would draft a bill to block buybacks from companies not offering their employees such benefits as minimum pay of $15 an hour, healthcare insurance, and fully funded pensions.

Curbing stock buybacks, which have been seized on by critics as evidence that corporations are rewarding themselves and their owners rather than expanding their operations and creating new jobs after the 2017 tax cut, is designed to appeal to middle- and low-income employees who have benefited less from 10 years of economic expansion than their wealthier peers.

Corporate America, which in decades past cared about workers and communities, now serves only shareholders, argued Schumer, the Senate's minority leader. Executives are focused on driving up stock prices with no help for workers, he said in a Facebook video, "and the way they've done that, more than anything else, is with these stock buybacks."

They two didn't propose any specific action on dividends. While stock buybacks may be an arcane topic outside Wall Street, the practice is a straightforward one. To understand it, keep in mind that the value of a publicly-traded corporation is determined by adding together the price of each of its outstanding shares; if the price of an individual share changes, so does the firm's.

One way CEOs and corporate boards who believe their company's price is too low can push it back up is by repurchasing shares from investors.

That not only returns cash to shareholders who may have grown disenchanted with their stock, it also, in theory, drives up the share price by creating extra demand — in much the same way the Federal Reserve buoyed markets by buying trillions of dollars in government bonds after the financial crisis.

There's another benefit, too. The pay of high-ranking corporate executives is typically tied to profit growth, often measured in earnings per share, an artificial construct that divides net income by the number of outstanding shares.

In periods when a corporation's income isn't growing, or is growing less than investors expect, repurchasing shares reduces the number outstanding and nudges per-share earnings higher. If, for example, a company with 100,000 shares garnered net income of $1 million a year, it would report earnings of $1,000 a share. By repurchasing 50,000 of the shares, its management could boost net income to $2,000 a share.

While acknowledging the practice can be abused, the Business Roundtable and the Institutional Investors council noted buybacks also buoy the retirement savings of the majority of American households that own stock through pensions or investment accounts.

Consequently, the Democrats' proposal to limit the practice -- and others similar to it -- are more likely to undermine economic security than accomplish their stated goal of fostering inclusive economic growth. The Business Roundtable represents CEOs of the 200 largest companies in America, while the Institutional Investors council is made up of pension funds and endowments that invest a combined $4 trillion in U.S. financial markets.

It's also a mistake to assume that the record $1 trillion that U.S. corporations authorized for share repurchases in 2018 came at the expense of pay raises, new factories and other investments that Congress hoped the tax cuts would foster, the two groups said. JPMorgan Chase, Walmart, and CVS Health all raised pay for entry-level workers, for example.

And a review of regulatory filings for companies in the S&P 500 shows "those that repurchased stock in the first three quarters of 2018 tended to engage in more capital expenditures and research and development investment than those electing not to do buybacks," Bolten and Bertsch wrote. "American companies invested nearly $3 trillion in the economy during 2018, including $460 billion in research and development. And the firms doing the largest buybacks are also the ones doing the most capital investment."

Trump says Michael Cohen hearing may have sabotaged North Korea summit

Texto completo: President Trump suggested Sunday that Democrats were partly to blame for his failure to secure a denuclearization agreement with North Korea last week.

In a tweet, Trump pointed to public hearing the House Oversight Committee held with his former lawyer Michael Cohen at the same time the president was meeting with Kim Jong Un in Vietnam.

"For the Democrats to interview in open hearings a convicted liar & fraudster, at the same time as the very important Nuclear Summit with North Korea, is perhaps a new low in American politics and may have contributed to the 'walk.' Never done when a president is overseas. Shame!" Trump said.

Trump abruptly walked away from his second summit with Kim in Hanoi after they failed to agree on terms that would see Pyongyang take concrete steps towards dismantling its nuclear weapons and missile programs in exchange for sanctions relief.

Back on Capitol Hill, Cohen faced a grilling from Democrats and Republicans on Wednesday about his relationship with the president and his actions, including lying to Congress in previous testimony. Casting Trump as a liar, schemer, and racist, Cohen testified under oath that his former boss asked him around 500 times to threaten people as his former fixer for a period of roughly 12 years.

Trump told reporters in Hanoi that Cohen's testimony was "incorrect" and condemned the Democratic majority of the panel for scheduling the hearing at the same time as his summit with Kim.

"It's very interesting, because I tried to watch as much as I could," Trump said. "I wasn’t able to watch too much because I've been a little bit busy. But I think having a fake hearing like that, and having it in the middle of this very important summit is really a terrible thing. They could’ve made it two days later or next week, and it would've been even better. They would've had more time.

Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, defended the president's actions during an interview Sunday morning on CNN. "If you can't get a good deal, and the president offered North Korea the best deal it could possibly get — no deal is better than a bad deal," Bolton said. "So the president's decided to shake things up in North Korean diplomacy given the failure of the last three administrations to achieve the denuclearization of North Korea. He, obviously, thinks it's worth trying. We'll see now what comes next."

Trump was even praised by Democratic leadership, after some critics were concerned the president might concede too much the Kim in the hopes of maintaining diplomatic momentum. "President Trump did the right thing by walking away and not cutting a poor deal for the sake of a photo op," Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Wednesday.

In an olive branch to Pyongyang, U.S. officials announced this weekend that the United States would halt planned military exercises with South Korea in the spring after the president complained of their cost. North Korea has long viewed the exercises between the two allies as a demonstration of a threat against the Kim regime. Getting the U.S. to stop the exercises has been one of the major planks in negotiations between the two countries.

Still, it's not clear how much progress Trump is actually making in meeting Kim. Although the rogue regime hasn't conducted nuclear or missile tests since late 2017, the New York Times reported Sunday that North Korean hackers targeted U.S. and its European allies even as the Hanoi summit took place.

Is the American Century over?

Texto completo: "Politics stops at the water's edge" was a tradition that, not so long ago, was observed by both parties, particularly when a president was abroad, speaking for the nation.
The tradition was enunciated by Sen. Arthur Vandenberg of Michigan in 1947, as many of the Republicans in the 80th Congress moved to back Truman's leadership in the Cold War against Stalin's empire.
The tradition lasted until the mid-1960s, when the left wing of the Democratic Party turned viscerally, and even violently, against the war in Vietnam and President Lyndon Johnson.
Republican Presidents Nixon, Reagan and Bush I, with the support of conservative Democrats, led America to final victory in the Cold War
Yet except for brief intervals, like the rallying around George H. W. Bush after the triumphant Gulf War of 1991 and George W. Bush after 9/11, true national unity has never been restored.
Were proof needed, this week provided it.
President Trump flew to Hanoi, Vietnam, to meet North Korea's dictator. Subject of negotiations: Kim Jong Un's nuclear weapons, including his missiles that may be able to reach our homeland.
How did the Democratic Party wish the commander in chief well on his mission for America?
During Trump's first full day in Hanoi, a committee of Nancy Pelosi's House held a public hearing featuring ex-Trump lawyer and "fixer" Michael Cohen, a convicted perjurer and felon who cut a deal with the prosecution for a reduced sentence.
The city loved it. Cable and network TV coverage went gavel to gavel. Cohen's testimony crowded out the Trump-Kim summit and even news of aerial clashes between India and Pakistan.
What were the headlines Trump came home to after refusing to lift sanctions on North Korea, in return for meager concessions Kim offered?
"Cohen Paints Trump as Crooked" was the banner atop page one of The Washington Post. Cohen's depiction of his old boss was boldly quoted above: "He is a racist. He is a con man. And he is a cheat."
"Cohen Accuses Trump of Lies and Cover-ups" ran the page-one headline in The New York Times.
"Cohen Declares Trump a Racist, Cheat and Conman" read the huge headline in the Financial Times.
"Cohen Says Trump Guided Coverup" was at the top of page one in The Wall Street Journal.
Trump is denounced for calling media the "enemy of the people." Yet that media, in news columns as well as editorials, routinely describes him as a racist, sexist, xenophobe, homophobe, Islamophobe and bigot.
Indulging its hatred of Trump is a preoccupation, an obsession of this capital city. Those headlines reveal not only the news judgment of the editors but the agenda of the elite who turn to them first every morning.
That agenda is the breaking of this president; his disgrace and fall; and, if impeachment proves not possible, his crushing defeat in 2020 and subsequent indictment.
The alliance that seeks to bring down Trump is formidable: deep-state leakers and media collaborators; the Democratic Party and House; most of America's commentariat; and the cultural elites in the arts, academia and Hollywood.
As the president is chief of state and head of government, he cannot be indicted. He must first be removed from the presidency. But to remove him, Democrats have to impeach him in the House and convict him in a Republican Senate.
If they cannot, they will have to defeat him at the polls.
In 1968, George Wallace of Alabama tore the Southern populist right out of the Democratic Party. Liberals Gene McCarthy, Robert Kennedy and George McGovern then savaged Vice President Hubert Humphrey from the left. The Grant Park rioters did the rest.
Nixon, leading a minority Republican Party, had a compelling argument: "If the Democrats cannot unite their own party, how can they unite the nation?"
Today, a watching world is asking: If you Americans are at war with yourselves over race, religion, morality, culture and politics, if you cannot unite yourselves, how can you unite the world? And around what?
Maybe the American Century is really over.

Texto completo: Tax refunds are up from where they were this time last year by 1.3 percent following the fourth week of the 2019 filing season, according to new Internal Revenue Service data.

To be more specific, the average tax refund has increased to $3,143 from $3,103 last February, according to cumulative statistics comparing the 2018 and 2019 filing seasons.

Oddly enough, certain newsrooms have responded to this development with total silence. I say “odd,” because it was just a few weeks ago that these same newsrooms rushed to report that tax refunds were smaller this year, suggesting either implicitly or explicitly that the decrease was tied to the Republican Party’s tax reform bill.

“Millions of Americans could be stunned as their tax refunds shrink,” read a headline published on Feb. 10 by the Washington Post. The story reported, "Many Americans may confuse their meager refunds as a sign that they paid more in taxes as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Generally, that is not true." On Feb. 14, the Post ran a story titled, “IRS says average tax refund is down nearly 9 percent so far this year.”

That story included a line that reads, "Many early filers are still upset about getting a smaller refund or unexpectedly owing money, even if they did pay lower taxes overall as a result of the Republican tax bill that passed in December 2017."

As of March 1, the Post has published nothing showing the average refund is now greater than it was at this point in 2018.

Then, there’s the New York Times, which reported on Feb. 12, “Smaller Tax Refunds Surprise Those Expecting More Relief.” (The clear but false implication, contrasting "Smaller Tax Refunds" to tax "Relief," is that the law didn't really cut taxes.) That story reported: "The tax overhaul that took effect last year promised relief, but now that returns are being filed, some people are baffled. They’re getting smaller refunds — or sometimes having to write a check — even though nothing in their situation seems to have changed."

On Feb. 14, the Times also published a story titled, “As Refunds Shrink, Treasury Dept. Reminds Workers of Bigger Paychecks.” On Feb. 22, the paper published a report titled, “Why a Tax Cut Might Not Mean a Bigger Refund.”

As of March 1, the Times has published nothing detailing the new IRS data.

“Anger, Confusion Over Dwindling Refunds. Is Trump's Tax Plan To Blame?” National Public Radio asked on Feb. 14. The Associated Press reported on Feb. 19, “I owe how much? Americans shocked by impact of new tax law.”

As of March 1, you guessed it, neither NPR nor the AP have published anything about the new refunds statistics.

To be fair, there are a couple of points that must be made. First, not all newsrooms have ignored the latest information from the IRS. USA Today, Yahoo News, CBS News, and CNN have been diligent. Good on them. Also, though the Post has yet to report on the new data, its fact-checking team did a good job last month dismantling Sen. Kamala Harris’, D-Calif., nonsense claim that the smaller refunds were the fault of the GOP tax cuts.

Secondly, tax returns are still incoming, and they’re doing so more slowly than last year. We’ve still a way to go, and it’d be premature to claim now that the latest IRS data proves newsrooms and pundits were wrong to highlight the initial data.

But that’s kind of the entire point here: If the initial numbers were enough to justify the initial anti-tax-cut news coverage, why aren't these same newsrooms jumping all over these new IRS figures?

I think we can guess why. I just want to hear them say it.

Transplant rulechange can mean life, death

Información de publicación: Des Moines Register ; Des Moines, Iowa [Des Moines, Iowa]. 01 Mar 2019: A.9.

Texto completo: This story is the second of two parts.
One of the biggest changes in liver transplant policy in years — set to take effect in April — could greatly affect Iowans on waiting lists for the lifesaving surgery.
But some of the state's top transplant surgeons disagree about whether it will actually help or hurt.
The change, enacted in December by the organization overseeing all organ procurement organizations in the U.S., replaces local and regional geographic boundaries that were used to match liver candidates based on donor location. For years that meant, barring emergency cases elsewhere, local patients received preferential access to the limited number of livers donated in their areas.
The new policy prioritizes cases based on concentric circles around transplant centers and medical necessity. In practice, many believe that would favor those who have been on waiting lists longer, often those in bigger cities in a given region.
In late January, U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Sen. Joni Ernst and 20 other senators sent a bipartisan letter to the secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services questioning how the policy change will affect rural and low-income Americans.
Grassley's staff inquired in part because of concerns raised by Dr. Alan Reed, who heads the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics' Transplant Center.
Reed said the policy change will harm those with liver disease in Iowa who are awaiting donors and could threaten the viability of the center's liver transplant program.
UIHC is the only transplant center of four in the state that performs liver transplants — about 23 last year.
"Patients selected for liver transplants have to meet a number of requirements, including the ability to locate near their transplant center just to be placed on the transplant waiting list," Reed wrote.
Reed said under the new policy, patients in Detroit, Chicago and Minneapolis would have to turn down a liver recovered in Iowa before it would become available to a patient on the center's waiting list.
The odds that would happen is high given the disparity in population bases under the new rules, he said. "So high that I fear for the sustainability of our program," he said.
Reed added: "If UI Health Care either receives fewer livers for transplant or has to close our liver transplant program due to lack of sustainable volume and ability to maintain our transplant team, Iowans will have to travel elsewhere for transplants."
Not everyone agrees But most Iowans already leave the state for liver transplants, and most livers recovered in Iowa go to patients elsewhere, statistics obtained from the Iowa Donor Network show.
The UIHC imports only a small number of livers recovered outside Iowa, and it used Iowa-donated livers in the 23 transplants conducted last year. Thirty-five livers recovered in Iowa went to patients outside the state.
Iowa's waiting list for livers is shorter than many, and included 28 this month.
The distribution change enacted on a federal level was initiated in part because of legal action facing organ procurement programs with longer waiting lists and poor track records.
Investigative reports in the past year in both the New York Times and the Washington Post have highlighted those failings.
Last summer, reporters at the New York Times found New Yorkers donate organs at a much lower rate — about 15 percent — than anywhere else in the country. That's despite the fact the city boasts world-class hospitals and transplant surgeons.
Problems meeting minimum performance standards were so great at LiveOnNY, New York's procurement organization, that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, which oversees all such organizations, threatened to let its certification lapse. It opted not to.
LiveOnNY loses a quarter of its most promising cases because workers are unable to secure consent from the families of prospective donors — a loss of about 3,000 donors a year, the Times found.
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has repeatedly found that organ procurement programs "do a poor job of recovering enough organs to meet the need," the Times report said.
The bipartisan letter drafted by Grassley's staff said the distribution change ignores the recommendation of the Liver and Intestine Transplantation Committee, whose members include leading transplant experts.
The change also failed to take into account regional variations in liver donation rates and disparities in the performance of organ procurement organizations, the letter said, and it appears to reward procurement organizations with histories of performance problems, like New York's.
But Qasim Chaudhry, who heads Iowa Methodist Medical Center's transplant program, said the distribution changes could ultimately save more lives.
Because transplant centers will compete in a wider region, they will have to take steps to procure more marginal organs to reduce wait times for patients, he said.
Chaudhry said both Iowa's procurement program and the UIHC have a reputation for being more conservative when it comes to placing donors' organs.
The University of Nebraska Medical Center's program in Omaha, where he trained, performs about twice as many liver donations in a year as the program at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, national statistics show.
That's even though Nebraska has roughly 1.2 million fewer residents.
UIHC's waiting list is longer than other transplant centers in the region. As a result, most Iowans needing liver transplants leave for centers with shorter waiting lists, Chaudhry said.
Next up: Kidney transplants? Methodist has greatly increased its kidney transplants, obtaining donations from other Midwest states, Chaudhry said.
The center accepts some marginalized kidneys turned away by other transplant programs, but focuses more on patient care to assure strong outcomes after the transplant, he said. He acknowledges the hospital takes on a bit more risk, but says it's consistent with the mission of better outcomes for patients.
"It has to do with the leadership of the transplant center's philosophy," he said. "Until they change their mindset, it won't improve. Then the machinery kicks in to make more transplants happen."
Nine years ago, Methodist performed about 15 kidney transplants a year, he said.
Now it does about 55 to 60, he said.
"We transplant people from New York, California and Alabama," he said. "People find us through Google because of the shorter waiting times. For a kidney, our wait is about a year or a year and a half. At Mercy, it's about five years. At the UIHC, it's about three years. Without competition, you can't raise your game."
But Suzanne Conrad, who heads the Iowa Donor Network, Iowa's only procurement program, said criteria for organ distribution depend on the organ. "And what may be fair for liver or heart may not be fair for kidney," she said.
The United Network of Organ Sharing, UNOS, which oversees all procurement programs, also has been exploring a concept of "continuous sharing" for kidneys, or sharing in concentric rings starting at 150 miles and going up to 500 miles from transplant centers.
Dr. Cass Franklin, who heads the transplant program at Mercy Medical Center in Des Moines, said the reason is that organs are considered under law a national resource, and the government is responsible for the distribution. UNOS has been trying to strike a better balance between necessity and equity.
But under the new liver policy, there will be a larger radius of potential recipients under consideration, and decisions will hinge more on on medical necessity.
"The bar is so high, you have to be sicker to get the organ," Franklin said.
"A lot of us would agree you don't want to wait until you are so sick, you run the possibility of not doing well after a liver transplant."
Franklin said transplant surgeons generally have "less better outcomes" using more marginal donors.
"Not only that, if a patient presents earlier in their disease, it gives you an opportunity to select better donors and a better outcome."
Franklin said many liver transplants happen in Nebraska because that program has a long pedigree, and Iowans on the western end of the state are often referred there.
The bottom line, he said, is the nation needs more organ doors. "If we don't increase the resource, we're just dividing the pot differently."
Terri Doocy, a 44-year-old home health care worker in Algona, said people like her who are on waiting lists have to become their own experts, including researching average wait times.
Doocy was diagnosed at 30 with polycystic kidney disease, a genetic disorder shared by her brother.
She said she tried beginning last May to get on a kidney waiting list at Mercy Medical Center, but the process was taking too long.
She said it took less time — about two months — to be placed on the transplant list at Iowa Methodist.
"Methodist told me 18 months was the average wait," she said. "Mercy told me four to five years."
Waits for livers
in Iowa City
In a 100-year period nationally, 12 percent of people would die while waiting for a liver.
At the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, 22.9 percent of people would die per 100 years of waiting for a liver, according to Waitlist Mortality Rates from 2016 to 2018.
Nationally, 43.2 percent of people waiting for a liver transplant get one within a year of joining a center's waiting list. At UIHC, the percentage was 53 percent.
Those who received livers at the UIHC had a 93.6 percent success rate after one year.
Success rates
with kidney transplants
Success rates at one year:
Mercy Medical Center: 93.3 percent
Iowa Methodist Medical Center: 94.2 percent
UIHC: 97.8 percent
Iowa City VA: 100 percent

Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who was staggered by Amazon's decision to pull out of its plans to come to New York City, is working intensely behind the scenes to lure the company back, even connecting with Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder, to make a personal pitch.
The governor has had multiple phone conversations with Amazon executives, including Mr. Bezos, over the past two weeks, according to two people with knowledge of the efforts. In those calls, Mr. Cuomo said he would navigate the company through the byzantine governmental process.
Mr. Cuomo did not offer a new location but rather guarantees of support for the project, one person said. Amazon executives gave no sense the company would reconsider.
The executives also learned of an open letter being arranged for publication in The New York Times on Friday, also urging Mr. Bezos, the company's chief executive, to reverse course again and build the campus in Long Island City, Queens.
The letter was signed by more than 70 supportive unions including the AFL-CIO, local businesses and business leaders, community groups and elected officials including Representatives Hakeem Jeffries of Brooklyn, a top Democrat, Max Rose, a first-term Democrat from Staten Island, and Carolyn Maloney, whose district encompasses the Amazon site, and the former mayor David N. Dinkins.
The letter said that Mr. Cuomo "will take personal responsibility for the project's state approval," and Mayor Bill de Blasio "will work together with the governor to manage the community development process."
So far at least, the company has shown no sign of reconsidering its decision to abandon the deal, in which Amazon promised to create up to 40,000 jobs in Long Island City in exchange for a state grant of $500 million and state and city tax breaks that would have eventually totaled more than $2 billion.
"I've had many conversations with Amazon. I hope that they reconsider," Mr. Cuomo told reporters at an unrelated event Thursday on Long Island. "It would be helpful if the State Senate said that they would approve it; that would be helpful. But in the meantime I haven't heard any changes."
Andrea Stewart-Cousins, the Democratic majority leader of the State Senate, said in a statement that she had indicated her "willingness to work" with Amazon. "I have always been clear that I support job creation and was disappointed with Amazon's decision and hoped they would reconsider," she said.
An Amazon spokeswoman declined a request for comment.
The conversation between Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Bezos appeared to have been the first time the two had spoken at any point about Amazon's plans for Queens, or about the company's abrupt decision earlier in February to cancel the project amid noisy opposition.
Since the deal fell through, Mr. Cuomo has been arguing in public and in private that support for the project was and remains far more widespread than it may have seemed.
"I do believe Amazon should have stayed and fought the opposition," said Mr. Cuomo in a radio interview on Tuesday. "It was a vocal minority opposition. Seventy percent of the people support Amazon."
He reiterated that message to Amazon executives during calls, according to one of the people with knowledge of the exchanges, both of whom requested anonymity in order to discuss the private conversations.
The campus was meant to be one half of what had been called a second headquarters for the company; the other half, with roughly the same number of jobs, is still planned for a Virginia suburb of Washington.
But Amazon faced vociferous opponents -- including local groups, some unions and political activists animated by the surprise victory of Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez -- from the moment it announced its plans for Queens in November. Three months later, with no end in sight for the sustained political pressure and negative attention, executives decided to pull the plug.
Those familiar with the company's thinking have insisted that the decision to abandon the New York City plan had been based on a confluence of factors, including the loud opposition and the lack of any sign it would abate.
"We think we could have gotten New York done, but you have to say, 'At what cost?"' Holly Sullivan, Amazon's director of global economic development, said at an event in Virginia on Thursday. "We made a prudent decision that gives us the opportunity to hyperfocus on D.C."
The advertisement, an open letter to Mr. Bezos that was set to appear on a full page in Friday's newspaper, is aimed at combating the notion that the opposition to Amazon was widespread, arguing that a "clear majority" of New Yorkers support the company.
"We know the public debate that followed the announcement of the Long Island City project was rough and not very welcoming," reads the letter, paid for by the Partnership for New York City, a prominent business group. "But when we commit to a project as important as this, we figure out how to get it done in a way that works for everyone."
Kathryn S. Wylde, the president of the partnership, said the letter had been aimed not just at Amazon but at assuring technology companies generally that New York City welcomed their businesses: "Yes, it's directed to Amazon in hopes they will reconsider. Equally, it is a message to the broader industry."
"The governor's office was working with the business community on how to send this message," Ms. Wylde added, and the result was the letter.
The letter included new supporters as well as many -- such as public housing leaders, local small businesses and unions like Local 32BJ of the Service Employees International Union and the Building and Construction Trades Council of Greater New York -- who backed the deal all along. A spokesman for Mr. de Blasio, whose initial support of the Amazon deal has turned into vigorous criticism after the company pulled out, said the mayor was aware that the letter was being prepared.
The most vocal opponents, like Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, were not among the signatories.
"Our concerns remain the same," Mr. Appelbaum said in response to Mr. Cuomo's efforts. "If Amazon wants to come to New York, it must respect all workers and communities."
One thing that has changed in the last two weeks: Ms. Stewart-Cousins, the State Senate majority leader, withdrew her nomination of Senator Michael Gianaris to the obscure Public Authorities Control Board. The position would have given Mr. Gianaris, who represents Long Island City, the ability to vote down the development project for Amazon when it came before the board in about a year's time.
But Mr. Cuomo refused to appoint Mr. Gianaris, who declined to comment on the governor's efforts, or to formally reject him. And so last week, Ms. Stewart-Cousins selected another Queens representative, Leroy Comrie, to sit on the board, a person who would be more likely to get the governor's approval.
Mr. Comrie did not respond to a request for comment.
"The State Senate made a terrible blunder; everyone, including their members, knows it," said Dani Lever, the governor's communications director. "The governor will take over the process and can comfortably assure Amazon the approval will get done."

Texto completo: By the time Andre Previn became music director of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, he had long rejected the trappings of Hollywood, where he had launched his career.
The four-time Oscar-winning composer had made a decisive switch to the classical music world, conducting the world's great orchestras, performing as a pianist and composing music for the concert hall.
Still, a bit of show business seemed to accompany his time in Pittsburgh. When his PSO tenure started in 1976, billboards announced "Previn!" was in town. Hollywood or not, he was a star, and he delivered a shot of energy into the orchestra and the city.
Andre Previn, the esteemed conductor, composer and pianist, died Thursday morning at his home in Manhattan. He was 89.
His death was confirmed by his manager, Linda Petrikova, according to The New York Times.
Mr. Previn's arrival in Pittsburgh was greeted with such enthusiasm that the PSO added Thursday concerts and still sold out the season on subscriptions alone. And his style quickly made an impact, eliciting a transparent, warm sound from the orchestra.
The partnership soon after resulted in the Emmy-nominated show, "Previn and the Pittsburgh," produced by WQED-TV, which featured interviews; performances by the orchestra and Mr. Previn, who was an accomplished jazz and classical pianist; and appearances by guests such as Oscar Peterson, Yo-Yo Ma and Ella Fitzgerald.
Under his baton, the PSO hired several principal musicians, initiated a composer-in-residence program, garnered new recording contracts, and went on international tours for the first time in more than a decade, renewing the PSO's stature both locally and abroad.
Mr. Previn lived on Mount Washington during his time in Pittsburgh. His open-necked white shirt and sleeveless black tunic vest became a trademark of his style, at the same time that his attire raised eyebrows among conservative audience members. In 1980, one New York Times critic wondered whether the brawny Steel City was compatible with the Previn elegance and lightly textured musical style.
As the city's mood and spending power declined with the collapse of the steel industry, attendance at Heinz Hall followed suit. The sold-out houses, further tested by construction in Downtown, sank to 80 percent capacity in the 1982-83 season. The honeymoon was cut short, too, by criticisms of his interpretations and narrow preferences for repertoire of France, England, Russia and Eastern Europe.
The tension came to a head in 1984, when Mr. Previn suddenly resigned after an acrimonious power struggle with PSO managing director Marshall Turkin. He was released from his contract two years early and accepted the music directorship of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, thrusting the PSO into a period of artistic insecurity.
For the man who had spurned Hollywood, Hollywood-level drama thus accompanied his sudden split from Pittsburgh. But the wounds would heal, and he returned to Heinz Hall as a guest conductor, most recently in 2012, when he led the world premiere of his Triple Concerto for Trumpet, Horn and Tuba, featuring three principal musicians.
"I never had a happier eight years," he told The Pittsburgh Press in 1984, after his resignation. "Not only will I never forget the audiences and this great orchestra, those memories will never dim. Things here were as good as I can imagine."
Born in Berlin as Andreas Ludwig Priwin, Mr. Previn studied at the Hochschule fur Musik and the Paris Conservatoire. His Jewish family fled from the Nazis in 1938 and settled in Los Angeles, where, as a teenager, Mr. Previn arranged music for MGM Studios and played chamber music with violinist Joseph Szigeti, according to "Play On," a book about the PSO by Hax McCullough and Mary Brignano.
He studied conducting with Pierre Monteaux while stationed in San Francisco with the U.S. Army. He won four Oscars for his music for "Gigi," "Porgy and Bess," "Irma la Douce" and "My Fair Lady."
He soon tired of the Hollywood world, however, and devoted his focus to classical music.
"I stayed in the movies too long," he told The Press in 1975, after he was named the PSO music director. "Hollywood is a dead-end street. Its music is dictated by the film, and that's the way it has to be. I cut way down in 1960, and have done nothing for the movies since 1964. That's a long time."
In 1963, he made his professional conducting debut with the St. Louis Symphony and held top conducting positions with the Houston Symphony Orchestra, London Symphony Orchestra and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, in addition to Pittsburgh and Los Angeles.
Among his numerous prizes, he won lifetime achievement awards from the Kennedy Center and the Recording Academy, having won Grammys in various categories.
He married five times, including to actress Mia Farrow and violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter. Mr. Previn's other wives were Betty Bennett, Dory Previn and Heather Hales.
His compositional output included the violin concerto "Anne-Sophie," written for fifth wife Ms. Mutter, whom he divorced in 2006, and the opera "A Streetcar Named Desire," which starred Renee Fleming as Blanche DuBois. He played piano with artists such as Ms. Mutter and cellist Lynn Harrell, and wrote several books about music.
In the twilight of his career, Mr. Previn was asked whether he felt he sometimes spread himself too thin.
"It's been thrown up to me most of my life: 'Why don't I just concentrate on conducting or composing or my own playing or on jazz?'" he replied.
"But the thing is that I'm naturally curious about a lot of different disciplines in music and I enjoy doing them. And as long as people are nice enough to let me, I'll keep on trying."
His motto, according to his website, was "A day without music is a wasted day," and by that mark, he wasted very few of them.

Texto completo: President Trump early last year directed his then-chief of staff, John F. Kelly, to give presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner a top-secret security clearance - a move that made Kelly so uncomfortable that he documented the request in writing, according to current and former administration officials.
After Kushner, a senior White House adviser, and his wife, Ivanka Trump, pressured the president to grant Kushner the long-delayed clearance, Trump instructed Kelly to fix the problem, according to a person familiar with Kelly's account, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal discussions.
Kelly told colleagues that the decision to give Kushner the top-secret clearance was not supported by career intelligence officials, and he memorialized Trump's request in an internal memo, according to two people familiar with the memo and the then-chief of staff's concerns.
It is unclear how Kelly responded to Trump's directive. But by May, Kushner had been granted a permanent security clearance to view top-secret material - a move that followed months of concern inside the White House about his inability to secure such access.
Kushner's attorney publicly described the process as one that had gone through normal channels, a description that Kelly did not view as accurate, according to a person familiar with his reaction.
The former chief of staff, who left the administration at the beginning of this year, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Trump's push to get Kushner clearance - and the chief of staff's concerns about it - was first reported by the New York Times, which also reported that then-White House Counsel Donald McGahn had concerns about Kushner's clearance.
White House press secretary Sarah Sanders declined to weigh in Thursday evening, saying: "We don't comment on security clearances."
Peter Mirijanian, a spokesman for Kushner lawyer Abbe Lowell, said in a statement that "in 2018, White House and security clearance officials affirmed that Mr. Kushner's security clearance was handled in the regular process with no pressure from anyone."
"That was conveyed to the media at the time, and new stories, if accurate, do not change what was affirmed at the time," he added.
An attorney for McGahn declined to comment.
Congressional Democrats said Thursday that they plan to aggressively scrutinize the role Trump played in securing Kushner's clearance. Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), chairman of the House Oversight Committee, noted that his commitee has already launched an investigation into the White House security clearance process and has yet to receive a response to its request for documents.
"The Committee expects full compliance with its requests as soon as possible, or it may become necessary to consider alternative means to compel compliance," Cummings said in a statement.
House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) said in a statement late Thursday that his panel, as well as the House Oversight Committee, will continue in their investigation of the White House's security clearance process.
"The revelation that President Trump personally intervened to overrule White House security officials and the Intelligence Community to grant a Top Secret security clearance to his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is the latest indicator of the President's utter disregard for our national security and for the men and women who sacrifice so much every day to keep us safe," Schiff said. "There is no nepotism exception for background investigations."
Both Trump and his daughter, Ivanka, have publicly denied the president was involved in securing a clearance for Kushner. The president told the New York Times in a Jan. 31 interview that he did not direct Kelly or similar officials to grant a clearance for his son-in-law, and Ivanka Trump told ABC News last month that her father was not involved in the process.
In the first year of the administration, Kushner held an interim security clearance that allowed him to view both top-secret and sensitive compartmented information, which is classified intelligence related to sensitive sources. With that designation, he has been able to attend classified briefings, get access to the president's daily intelligence report and issue requests for information to the intelligence community.
But there was widespread concern in the White House about his lack of a permanent clearance.
In February 2018, Kelly limited the access of employees with interim security clearances to top-secret information in the wake of abuse allegations against a top aide. That new policy caused Kushner's clearance to be downgraded from "Top Secret/SCI" level to the "Secret" level, a far lower level of access to classified information.
At the time, Trump said he would defer the question of Kushner's access to his chief of staff.
"I will let General Kelly make that decision, and he's going to do what's right for the country," the president said during a news conference. "And I have no doubt that he will make the right decision."
The top-secret clearance Kushner was granted last year gave him access to relatively basic classified information. Lowell said at the time that Kushner's "application was properly submitted, reviewed by numerous career officials and underwent the normal process."
Kushner did not receive a clearance to see the most highly classified intelligence the government produces, known as sensitive, compartmented information, or SCI, The Washington Post reported last July.
That meant that Kushner was effectively barred from seeing information gleaned from human spies or from the government's vast signals intelligence apparatus. It's that kind of intelligence that forms the basis of the president's daily intelligence briefing and that is customarily given to senior policymakers and Cabinet officials.
Kushner's lack of SCI access suggests that the CIA has not signed off on his receiving that level of intelligence, security experts said. He had struggled to obtain even his top-secret clearance, in part because of his contacts with certain foreign government officials, The Post previously reported.
Some foreign officials, whose communications were intercepted by U.S. intelligence agencies, privately discussed how they could manipulate Kushner, taking advantage of his complex business arrangements, financial difficulties he had at the time and his lack of foreign policy experience, according to current and former U.S. officials familiar with intelligence reports on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject.
Kushner's foreign entanglements caused anxiety among U.S. intelligence officials who are ultimately responsible for deciding whether he should have SCI clearances, that step above top secret, according to U.S. officials with knowledge of internal deliberations.
The decision to grant an SCI clearance is usually made by the agency that generated the information. The CIA, for example, grants access to human intelligence gathered from agents and operatives. The NSA grants access to intercepted communications and intelligence generated by spying on foreign computer networks.

A question. A thumbs-up. And then an answer from Kim Jong Un.

Texto completo: HANOI - I'm not sure what prompted Kim Jong Un to answer my question. Maybe North Korea's once-reclusive leader was ready to take another tentative step forward on the world stage. Perhaps he was trying to demonstrate to President Trump that he was not afraid. Or it could have been the thumbs-up sign I flashed him.
The gesture was not planned. Nor was it an attempt to demonstrate subservience to the dictator of one of the world's most brutal regimes. Rather, I found myself instinctively trying to bridge a language gap by sending a universal signal - and, perhaps, appear unthreatening to the young leader in his mid-30s who, according to longtime North Korea watchers, had never answered a question from a reporter outside his tightly controlled state media.
"Chairman Kim, are you confident?" I asked. He looked at me. Trump, seated across a small, round table from Kim, had stopped talking. I was standing with a small group of American and North Korean reporters behind a rope, observing a brief photo op at the start of their nuclear summit Thursday.
We locked eyes. I raised my thumb. "Feeling good about a deal?" I said.
Kim turned his head toward an interpreter seated behind him. She translated my question, and he began speaking in Korean.
"Well, it's too early to tell, but I wouldn't say that I'm pessimistic," the interpreter said, channeling Kim. "From what I feel right now, I do have a feeling that good results will come out."
For a journalist, the success of a well-framed question is typically defined by how revelatory the answer. But what about when the very act of answering is what matters most? That was the question my colleagues and I asked ourselves as we arrived at the Metropole ahead of the summit. As the White House traveling press pool for the day, our 13-member group was responsible for chronicling the meetings between Trump and Kim for the hundreds of correspondents in Hanoi and the thousands more in Washington and around the world.
It is an awesome responsibility, and one that comes with a unique set of challenges. Reporting in the White House "bubble" can be frustrating; presidential aides maintain strict controls, with carefully scripted photo ops and limited access to the boss. We travel around the globe to glitzy foreign capitals and remote outposts, and yet we do so surrounded by the same cast of characters - famous television correspondents, high-ranking government officials and the president of the United States. It's a traveling road show that can feel sanitized and so surreal as to be almost Disney-like. Piercing the bubble and tapping authentic emotion - and some honest answers - is the goal.
Although Trump, comfortable with smashing protocols, has upended some of those conventions, his bluster, obfuscation and showmanship present their own challenges. He turns nearly every media opportunity, no matter how mundane, into a dramatic and unpredictable set piece in his reality show presidency. People who interact with him, from foreign leaders to members of Congress to ordinary citizens, often become bit players in the show - even a young tyrant determined to present himself as a rational global statesman and establish himself as an equal to the man in the most powerful office in the world.
In their first meeting in Singapore last June, and at an opening dinner Wednesday in Hanoi, Kim played a mostly silent role, his mere presence outside North Korea's borders a cause for headlines. Though he made brief remarks during a photo op at the Metropole on Wednesday, Kim did not field questions.
White House aides had sought to ban the U.S. pool reporters from a second photo op Wednesday - allowing in only television cameras and news photographers at the start of the dinner - after two wire service correspondents had shouted out questions to Trump. The White House relented slightly after the journalists protested, allowing in one reporter, but the retaliation was reported in the media as an assault on the free press by a president who has denounced mainstream news outlets as "fake news" and sought to discredit critical reporting.
There was speculation over whether Kim, who had kicked out American reporters from his hotel in Hanoi, had felt uncomfortable by the display of shouted questions - unthinkable back in Pyongyang - and asked Trump to keep us out. As reporters waited for Secret Service agents to conduct a security sweep ahead of the leaders' arrival at the Metropole on Thursday, we discussed a strategy for how to engage Trump - and Kim - in a way that would prompt answers.
It's not that we feared offending them; rather, we wanted to break some news instead of being kept in the dark. The White House had scheduled a presidential news conference for the afternoon, so there was general agreement that it was not necessary to ask Trump off-topic questions that could be posed later in a setting where he would be more likely to answer. The better bet was to ask where nuclear negotiations stood and whether progress had been made.
But no one knew what Kim would say - or whether he would talk at all.
I drew hope from the eight North Korean "reporters" in black suits who were with us. Kim's own traveling press pool wore red lapel pins featuring images of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il - the current leader's grandfather and father, a sign they were not objective journalists.
I had been warned by American reporters that the North Korean contingent was sharp-elbowed. In fact, as we went through a security sweep - being "wanded" with handheld magnetometers from both Secret Service agents and North Korean security guards - they were not so fearsome. One, toting a Canon camera, chatted amiably with a New York Times photographer, laughing together over Trump having praised the American newsman the day before. Another allowed me to take a photograph of his lapel pin - which I posted on social media.
Perhaps this was a good sign.
After the Secret Service finished the security sweep, we were led around the corner to a restaurant to wait. Then, showtime: We were marched into a conference room where the two leaders were seated.
I was standing on Kim's side of the room. I crowded toward the rope to get as close as possible, but a North Korean videographer motioned for me to be careful not to upset his camera, mounted on a tripod. I moved a few steps to my right, now behind a few others. I locked my eyes on Kim and, when Trump stopped answering a question from another reporter, I sensed my opportunity.
The moment Kim began to turn toward his interpreter was the moment I felt a sense of possibility. And once he began to speak, in his surprisingly deep voice, the Disney-like veneer faded.
The bubble had been pierced, a reclusive control freak had revealed something, however small - the fundamental currency between a reporter and his subject had been exchanged. Later in the day, Kim would be asked more pointed questions and provide some answers. And he would not get a nuclear deal with Trump, as the talks collapsed.
But now, as reporters were ushered out of the room, it was time to report the historic news.

Texto completo: Not one Republican asked one question of Michael Cohen that was intended to find out whether Donald Trump has done a single thing illegal or even unwise, let alone impeachable. They didn’t even pretend to care.
Instead, the Republican members of the House Oversight Committee seemed anxious to demonstrate their obedience and loyalty to Trump, oft-times seeming like blind partisan loyalty. (There was one exception, Justin Amash, R-Michigan, whose questioning was strangely sweet and nonpartisan. Amash asked Cohen to talk about the principles he has chosen to follow in his life.)
But as for the rest, maybe I shouldn’t have been surprised, but I was. I expected the Republicans to be skeptical of Michael Cohen’s testimony (and, oh, boy were they ever) and I expected them to point out that his current version of events contradicts many lies he told during his past as a loyal Trump henchman. I expected them to be rough on him, and thought they might argue that a ratfink who previously profited off his relationship with Trump deserves that.
But as I watched the whole daylong interrogation of Cohen, I confess I thought some of the Republicans would show some interest — at least fake but maybe even some real interest by the best of them — about whether the current occupant of the Oval is guilty or even mildly implicated in any of the wrongdoing that allegedly helped Trump get elected.
I mean, c’mon. Be loyal to your party within reason. Be skeptical of the various accusations. But at least pretend you care about the teensy possibility that the president’s accusers and disbelievers are not just making up all evidence behind those accusations.
With that said, I should also say that Cohen day at the committee produced relatively little in the way of new blockbusters, although it did produce a fair bit of important leads and some new documentation that will help those trying to understand how low our president is capable of sinking.
My mind went back to Watergate. Yes, there were Republicans in both the House and Senate inquiries of alleged wrongdoing by President Richard Nixon who thought their job was to defend their guy. And there were Democrats who thought their job was to convict.
But there were members of both parties in both houses who recognized a higher loyalty to truth and the law and importance of having a president who was not a crook. Sen. Howard Baker, the leader of the Republicans on the Senate special committee in Watergate days, and Rep. Bill Cohen, R-Maine, who was on the House Judiciary Committee, come to mind.) Baker was famous for demanding of witness after witness a version of his refrain: “What did the president know, and when did he know it?” And he didn’t let his partisan identity prevent him from pursuing that question, which ultimately helped get to the truth.
There was essentially none of that yesterday. Republican members seemed interested only in discrediting Cohen, who, when the final story comes in, may be an unlikely hero, in the literary anti-hero mode. I don’t claim to know whether he will — nor, certainly, how this ends. I’ve long since discovered that I don’t and perhaps can’t truly understand the depth of Donald Trump’s appeal to and hold on his admirers.
I swore I wouldn’t write too much or get into the details, of which few were blockbusters but some of which may, upon deeper examination, turn out to be case-breakers. I don’t claim to know. Cohen will go to prison, which he deserves, and get some leniency for turning state’s evidence, which he also deserves.
The New York Times noted in its summary of Cohen’s testimony that Trump paid him back for the $130,000 Cohen had paid porn star Stormy Daniels to keep her from going public about their sexual liaison. The reimbursement from Trump to Cohen came in several pieces from different sources, but one part was a check signed by Trump himself, Cohen said, and he produced the check with Trump’s signature on it.
But the Times story said its “experts cautioned that nothing Mr. Cohen said drastically altered what was known about any legal case against the president.”
CNN’s Chris Cillizza claimed to have learned eight things from Cohen, which he enumerates here, but confesses that they contain no silver bullet. He led with Cohen’s assertion that he listened over the speakerphone in Trump’s office as Roger Stone tipped Trump off to the timing of Julian Assange’s big dump of emails that would damage Hillary Clinton’s campaign.
One last thing. This was no more than Cohen’s speculation, and there were no follow-up questions on it. But I don’t think anyone can dispute that Cohen is one of the world’s major experts on Donald Trump, which perhaps qualifies him to speculate on what Trump might be capable of, to hold on to power.
But, in passing, and without being asked a question that elicited it, Cohen said that if, perchance Trump makes it to the end of his term, and loses the 2020 election, he, Cohen, does not think Trump would allow a peaceful transfer of the power of the American presidency to the person who might beat him in that election. Again, this is not a fact, and no one asked Cohen to explain on what he based that statement, but it was a majorly creepy moment that perhaps merits some contingency planning.

Texto completo: A 45-year-old restaurant known for incredible sushi.
A nearly 100-year-old spot serving old-school Italian, at least to those lucky enough to get a table.
A struggling-pizzeria-turned-success-story, thanks to artisanal pies.
"This is very nice you know, because we really accomplished something," said Chizuku Fukuyoshi, who has run the sushi restaurant Sagami in Collingswood with her husband, Chef Shigeru Fukuyoshi, since 1974. (It is the second time the restaurant has been nominated.)
Sagami is among the six New Jersey restaurants named as 2019 James Beard Awards semifinalists. The James Beard Foundation made the announcement Wednesday.
The James Beard awards honor the best culinary talent in the country in categories that include best new restaurants, outstanding bar programs, bakers and rising star chefs 30 or younger, among others.
Finalists will be announced March 27 in Houston and the winners will be named May 6 in Chicago.
Here are New Jersey's nominees:
Randy Forrester of Osteria Radici in Allentown, nominated for best chef Mid-Atlantic In winter 2017, the husband and wife team of Randy and Ally Forrester opened Osteria Radici, serving modern Italian food in the tiny borough of Allentown, tucked along the westernmost border of Monmouth County. Randy is the chef, making his own bread and pasta daily. Ally runs the front of house.
Four months later, the restaurant was named a James Beard semifinalist for best new restaurant. It was the only restaurant in New Jersey to be included on the list.
"I have wanted to be a chef since I was a teenager," Randy said last year. "I have dedicated half of my life to the industry and working toward the goal of opening a restaurant. It is surreal to learn that we have received national recognition for our first restaurant."
Go: 4 S Main St.; 609-223-2395, osteriaradici.com.
Maricel Presilla, Cucharamama in Hoboken, nominated for outstanding chef Maricel Presilla, the owner and chef of funky colorful pan-Latin restaurant Cucharamama, is not only an outstanding chef but a highly educated Latina who has earned a Ph.D. in medieval Spanish history from New York University. Cuban-born Presilla not only turns out some marvelous eats at Cucharamama but a block away at Zafra, her first Hoboken restaurant.
Presilla, who is considered to be a pre-eminent expert on Latin and Caribbean cuisine, has been feted numerous times before. Six years ago, her book, "Gran Cocina Latina: The Food of Latin America" was named Cookbook of the Year by the James Beard Foundation and Best General Cookbook by the International Association of Culinary Professionals. In 2012, she was named by the James Beard Foundation Best Chef-Mid Atlantic.
Presilla is one of only two chefs in New Jersey who has ever won a James Beard award. The other is Craig Shelton, then of The Ryland Inn in Whitehouse, names Best Chef Mid Atlantic region in 2000.
Sagami in Collingswood, nominated for outstanding restaurant A block building in the shadow on the high-speed PATCO line and congested Route 130, Sagami is a Collingswood gem.
At 74, Chef Shigero Fukuyoshi continues to create some of the best at Sagami the way he learned as an apprentice in the early 1970s in a New York City restaurant.
This is the second time Sagami has received an Outstanding Restaurant nod from the Beard Foundation; the first was in 2007.
Shigeru Fukuyoshi and his wife, Chizuko Fukuyoshi, who manages Sagami, opened their restaurant in 1974 on the Camden border. Generations of South Jerseyans and Philadelphians have sat in Sagami's cozy wooden booths, where Chizuko recalls holding babies that now bring in babies of their own.
Go: Sagami, 37 Crescent Blvd. in Collingswood; 856-854-9773.
Chef Vola's in Atlantic City, nominated for outstanding service Never been to Chef Vola's?
Us neither. Reservations need to be made months in advance (by leaving a message on their phone line) for this old-school Italian restaurant, which has operated out of an unassuming house on Albion Place since 1921. The place has a top-secret feel, down to its private website, which you need a log in to access. But when the food is consistently great and the service exceptional, word of mouth is all that matters.
Diners adore Chef Vola's butterflied, bone-in veal parmigiana, draped with tomato sauce and served with a steak knife. Plus the piled-high spaghetti and clams, homestyle tossed salad, and banana cream pie.
Go: 111 S. Albion Place; 609-345-2022.
Chef Joey Baldino of Zeppoli in Collingswood, nominated for best chef Mid-Atlantic Chef Joey Baldino must have a sense of humor about the Beard awards by now, as he's been nominated eight times, seven times as Best Chef in the Mid-Atlantic Region.
In its first year, Baldino's Zeppoli was nominated as Best New Restaurant. He also owns Palizzi Social Club, a private club and restaurant, in South Philadelphia.
In his tiny BYOB restaurant in West Collingswood, Baldino has championed Sicilian cuisine since opening Zeppoli in 2011. Baldino learned the ropes at the revered Anna Tasca Lanza cooking school in the Sicilian countryside. He also trained at The French Culinary Institute.
Each summer, Baldino hosts authentic Sicilian barbecues on the restaurant patio that sell out in minutes.
"Dinner at the Club: 100 Years of Stories and Recipes from South Philly's Palizzi Social Club" by Baldino and former Courier-Post restaurant critic Adam Erace is due out later this year.
Go: Zeppoli, 618 W. Collings Ave., Collingswood; 856-854-2670, zeppolirestaurant.com.
Dan Richer of Razza Pizza Artigianale in Jersey City, nominated for best chef Mid-Atlantic This isn't the first time that Dan Richer has been nominated for a James Beard Award. He has been named several times, starting in 2011 when he was a Rising Star Chef semifinalist for his first restaurant, Arturo's Osteria & Pizzeria in Maplewood.
Richer, a self-effacing New Jersey born-and-bred Rutgers graduate, calls himself a humble pizza craftsman. But the pizzas that the 39-year-old crafts are so darn good that a glowing, 3-star New York Times review declared it "the best pizza in New York." Yes, that's right, New York?
He makes those Neapolitan-style pizzas by breaking nearly every rule, not using the requisite tomatoes, flour or even mozzarella that the powers that be say is needed to make the best Neapolitan pizzas. "I try to find out if there is a better way, better ingredient," he said.
He has also said that he had no desire to take his crafts-making skills across the river. Does the craftsman think about taking his skills across the river where the handful of other, undeniably fancier, three-star restaurants ply their trade?
"New Jersey is where I live," he has told USA TODAY NETWORK New Jersey. "New Jersey is where I grew up. I never wanted a big restaurant or lots of restaurants. I'm just trying to make a great product and share it with my community"

Texto completo: PEORIA  Film buffs have several classic films to choose from at special events focusing on two legendary directors: Alfred Hitchcock and Stanley Kubrick.
The Peoria Riverfront Museum is hosting a Hitchcock film festival March 7 through 10 with presentations by author and film critic Marc Eliot before each showing.
The Art of Film: Hitchcock as Master of Suspense will feature Strangers on a Train on March 7, North by Northwest on March 8, Vertigo" on March 9 and Psycho on March 10 in the giant screen theater. All shows are at 6 p.m. except Psycho, which will be shown at 2 p.m.
The selections are considered to be the most pivotal psychological thrillers in Hitchcock's 52-film career as a director.
Eliot is a film critic, historian and New York Times best-selling author. His books include Cary Grant, Walt Disney: Hollywood's Dark Prince and American Rebel: The Life of Clint Eastwood.
Before each film, Eliot will discuss the progress of Hitchcock's personal expression and stylistic development as well as the deeper meanings of the legendary director's films.
A question-and-answer session and book signing will follow each film.
Tickets are $20 per film for museum members; $25 for the general public. An all-access pass, which also includes large popcorn-drink combos is $70 for members and $90 for the general public.
Meanwhile, the popular Six-Week Film Festival, sponsored by the town of Normal, Illinois State University's Department of English and uptown Normal continues through April 3 at the Normal Theater, focusing on the films of Kubrick.
ISU associate professor Bill McBride, who teaches a Film Style and Literature, notes that even those who haven't seen the films are familiar with Hal's red robotic eye and mellow-yet-menacing voice in 2001: A Space Odyssey and Jack Nicholson's maniacal Here's Johnny line in The Shining.
Likewise, McBride said, people who haven't seen 2001 will recognize the musical theme of Strauss' Also Sprach Zarathustra featured in that film. He compared that familiarity with the knife-screeching music of Bernard Hermann in Hitchcock's Psycho.
Remaining films in The Kubrick Spectacle are: Dr. Stangelove: Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb, March 6; 2001: A Space Odyssey, March 20; A Clockwork Orange, March 27; and The Shining, April 3.
A short introduction will precede each movie and a discussion will follow for those who want to stay. Don't worry, the Normal Theater assures everyone their won't be a test for those attending this film school.
The films start at 7 p.m. and are free.

Green New Deal: What is it and what does it mean for climate change?

Resumen: Democrats are in the process of hammering out their climate change policy ahead of the 2020 elections. One proposal is called the Green New Deal.

Texto completo: The Earth is facing a climate change deadline, with a looming tipping point into a dramatically changed, less hospitable planet – and Democratic lawmakers are beginning what's likely to be a long discussion over how best to deal with it.
These first attempts have coalesced under the umbrella phrase a Green New Deal championed by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N. Y. , and Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass.
They introduced a resolution Thursday calling for a dramatic increase in the generation of renewable fuels, such as wind, solar and hydropower sources, and a shift within 10 years to energy systems that are "net-zero" when it comes to greenhouses gases that are the primary contributor to climate change.
The resolution does not call for a full phase-out of fossil fuels, a plank that some environmental advocates had hoped to see. Instead, it pushes for a transition that is rapid but "fair and just to all communities and workers. "
Ocasio-Cortez, who first outlined her environmental plan in December, has enlisted the help of Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass. , who led House efforts on climate change a decade ago.
The resolution is short on details but long on vision for a cleaner environment that promotes jobs and social justice. It also calls for higher education and job guarantees for all U. S. citizens. Some Republicans have panned the effort as another arrow in the left's quiver of radical ideas that are unrealistic and prohibitively expensive.

Here's an explanation of the Green New Deal and how likely it is to pass in Congress.
Question: How did the Green New Deal get its name?
Answer: The phrase itself goes back to 2007, when columnist Thomas Friedman wrote a piece in The New York Times calling for a Green New Deal along the lines of President Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal during the Depression. Friedman envisioned the government backing basic research and setting standards, providing loans and using taxes and incentives to remake the U. S. economy.
The phrase later was taken up by Green Party candidate Jill Stein, who used it as part of her presidential platforms when she ran in 2012 and 2016.
Q: So that was 12 years ago. What's happening now?
A: A news conference on Capitol Hill on Thursday afternoon unveiling the Green New Deal will be the first step. Liberal lawmakers led by Ocasio-Cortez also are pushing for the creation of a new committee in Congress to implement a Green New Deal.
Q: So what's in it?
A: The crux is a broad mandate of meeting "100 percent of the power demand in the United States through clean, renewable, and zero-emission energy sources. "
Getting there depends on an ambitious agenda: drastically reduce carbon emissions over the next decade by spending on green infrastructure that protects the planet while ensuring justice and equity for all communities.
It calls for the federal government to promote and spend on sustainable farming practices, more training for clean energy sector jobs, cleaner transportation systems such as high-speed rail, and spending on technology that will reduce humans' carbon footprint.
Q: Can we really move to 100 percent renewable energy in a decade?
A: That's practically impossible, experts say, especially if nuclear power – which isn't mentioned in the plan and Green New Deal supporters oppose – isn't in the mix. For comparison's sake, renewable sources (hydropower, wind and solar mainly) made up 18 percent of the U. S. energy supply, double what they did a decade ago, according to the U. S. Energy Information Administration.
That share is projected to rise to 31 percent by 2050 if current trends hold up.
Q: Is the Ocasio-Cortez plan what the Democrats will end up doing?
A: Doubtful. This is the beginning of a political give-and-take that likely will extend up to the 2020 presidential election – which is exactly how ideas are supposed to be hashed out in the political arena.
"There will be a message battle," said Robert Shrum, a longtime Democratic political consultant who worked on multiple presidential campaigns, including Al Gore in 2000 and John Kerry in 2004 and now a professor of practical politics at the University of Southern California.
"You have a process whereby you begin with a big idea, like the Green New Deal, and you’re going to have to negotiate parts of it," he said. "Nothing is going to be handed down chiseled in stone from the top of the mountain. "
Q: What's happened already?
A: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. , has revived a special panel, known as the Select Committee on the Climate Crisis, which has named its chair, Rep. Kathy Castor, D-Fla. The members of the panel were unveiled Thursday but do not include Ocasio-Cortez.
The panel has drawn some fire from liberals even before its first meeting because they don't want anyone crafting the Green New Deal who has accepted money from or has ties to the fossil fuel industry. Castor, whose 2017 financial disclosure includes an investment into a utilities mutual fund of between $50,001 and $100,000, opposes such a restriction.
Q: How are the negotiations for a Green New Deal going?
A: They've begun but no actual consensus has been reached and isn't expected for some time. The first concrete steps will likely come as a series of smaller pieces of bipartisan legislation that will be introduced over the coming year. If the Democrats win the White House in 2020, much further-reaching legislation will be attempted.
"There won't be just one piece of legislation, but multiple ones at different times. Which is not unlike the New Deal that President Roosevelt pushed," said Aliya Haq, director of the federal policy group, climate and clean energy program at the Natural Resources Defense Council.
Q: Is it too late to make any progress on climate change?
A: Not at all, though it's certainly true that a United Nations climate report that came out in December said "rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes to all aspects of society" are needed within a few years to ward off the worst effects of climate change.
But people have the ability to make the changes, Haq said. "The only obstacle is political will. We actually have the technology we need to reduce pollution at scale. That would be a real pickle if we didn’t have the technology. But we do," she said.
Q: What do Republicans think of the Green New Deal as it's unfolding?
A: Not much. At least not the ones in power. President Donald Trump continues to promote coal mining and oil drilling, pulled out in 2017 of the global Paris Agreement on climate change mitigation, has repeatedly said he doesn't believe climate change is a man-made problem, and frequently conflates short-term weather systems with long-term climate trends.
Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Chairman John Barrasso, R-Wyo, who represents the country's largest coal-producing state, said he wants to make energy "as clean as we can as fast as we can, in ways that don’t raise costs for consumers. ”
But he calls the goal of 100 percent of renewable fuels an impossibility, especially if it doesn't include an allowance for nuclear energy.
Barrasso lumps the Green New Deal with expanded Medicare and immigration reform as linchpins of a radical agenda that will split the Democratic party.
“As we continue to point out what Democrats are really proposing with this hard left turn, I think that’s going to certainly separate the far-left Democrats from those who are left-leaning but more reasonable in terms of how they see the world," he told reporters last week.
Q: Given Republican intransigence on climate change, will legislation that deals with carbon emissions at the scale needed to combat the problem at the speed that scientists say is necessary ever be politically palatable enough to become law?
A: It certainly won’t be easy, given the general Republican reluctance to acknowledge that climate change is real or to do anything about it that might cost money or harm fossil fuel industries. But it's not impossible. The most likely scenario would involve tying the necessary changes to infrastructure work that will create jobs and enhance the economy, said Norman Ornstein, a conservative political scientist and scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative-leaning, nonpartisan public policy research institute.
“If you do it right, I could see at some point an infrastructure plan that gets broad bipartisan support that includes, as a very significant component, infrastructure on green energy,” Ornstein said.

Texto completo: The Ford Plantation, an 1,800-acre private community in Richmond Hill, this week announced their final phase of home development, Silk Hope.
The member-backed project, which is limited to 53 homes, will be the first new for-sale residential development at The Ford Plantation in more than 15 years. The first model homes, currently under construction, will be available this fall.
The Silk Hope community, which aims to capture both the tranquil feeling of a European village and Lowcountry architecture, is the product of a collaboration of some of the world's top residential architects and landscape designers, including Savannah-based architect Christian Sottile, who conceived and designed the master plan for the community.
Sottile, owner of the international award-winning firm Sottile & Sottile, is known for civic planning and architectural repurposing in historic cities. His work has been featured in numerous publications, including New York Times, Preservation Magazine and Architectural Digest.
"Informed by the European heritage of provincial, picturesque settlements, the Silk Hope homes being developed at The Ford Plantation are characterized by an informal massing that evokes the English and French derivations found in the Lowcountry," Sottile said.
The homes will feature spacious master suite ground-floor living, fireplaces, golf cart and car garages, as well as high-end finishes. The conceptual designs for the homes were produced by world-renowned architect Bobby McAlpine, of McAlpine Architecture in conjunction with Tippett Sease Baker Architecture of Atlanta.
Overall, Silk Hope will offer 12 home styles ranging from a 3,000 square-foot three-bedroom, three-and-a-half baths Village home to Estate homes greater than 5,200 square feet.
The Silk Hope community is centered around a large shared green space with walking paths and riding trails. At completion, Silk Hope will include new amenities including a community pavilion, fountains, walking garden, and community fire pit overlooking the adjacent wildlife sanctuary and marsh. The Edsel Community Farm is also located at Silk Hope, offering a farm-to-table experience.
The firm of Wertimer + Cline, led by Sheila Wertimer, has designed the landscape and gardens to complement the natural beauty of the old oaks located throughout Silk Hope. Wertimer is known for her work on major civic and private residential projects, including public spaces in her hometown of Charleston, S.C.
"It is a real testament to member satisfaction and commitment at The Ford Plantation when members come together to develop such a project, whom all believe will offer new club member prospects spectacular semi-custom home options not found anywhere in the Lowcountry," said General Manager Marc Ray.
The property's history dates to the 1920s when Henry Ford began purchasing property along the Ogeechee River south of Savannah. Utilizing conjoining acreage from three 18th-century plantations, Ford created his winter haven, part of which encompasses the current-day Ford Plantation community.
Ford's Greek Revival manor house, built in 1936, serves as a club amenity used to house guests and members, as well as a special event and gathering space.

Child care costs a reason for having fewer kids?

Texto completo: As Elizabeth Warren sees it, offering affordable child care and early learning are the trifecta of pro-family policy — good for the kids, easier on the parents and a boost for the economy. The Massachusetts senator and presidential candidate spelled out her plan for universal child care and early learning on Feb. 19.
Warren said the challenge of paying for child care today is shaping the most personal of family decisions.
“The financial squeeze is so severe that it’s even deterring families from having kids at all,” Warren said. “The high cost of child care is the No. 1 reason people give for having fewer children than they’d like.”
As it turns out, somebody did ask couples about that, and Warren hewed to the survey results. But while the process of making babies is fairly straightforward, the (hopefully) conscious decision to make them is complicated. Costs, including child care, rank high, but so do other factors.
The survey
Behind Warren’s statement lies a New York Times/Morning Consult poll from 2018. They reached 1,858 men and women ages 20 to 45. Of that, less than a quarter said “they had or expected to have fewer children than they considered ideal.”
Among that group of about 340 people, 64 percent said the reason they would have fewer children was because “child care is too expensive.” The second most common reason at 54 percent was “want more time with the children I have.”
The poll is a “useful data point, but it does not provide extremely strong evidence that this is the No. 1 reason,”sociologist Caroline Hartnett at the University of South Carolina told us.
Harnett said the sample size was small and limited research means, “we can’t cross-check against other polls with similar questions.”
Put another way: One survey does not one social truth make.
Warren’s statement “was reasonable,” said Philip Cohen, a sociologist at the University of Maryland. But Cohen spotted an issue with the way the survey asked people to compare what they were doing to some imagined perfect number of offspring. Cohen called that “fraught,” because it’s easy for people to say what they might ideally like, without having to think too hard about whether they really would like it.
What’s behind the decision to have kids
There’s no question that women in the United States are giving birth at record low rates. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that in 2017, the general fertility rate was 60.2 births per 1,000 women aged 15 to 44, down 3 percent from the year before.
There are three different ways to measure fertility, but two of them show the number is down, and researchers have been trying to figure out why.
There are a variety of reasons.
Cohen noted that women are waiting longer to start having children.
“The long-term trend is toward later births, which is generally going to mean fewer births,” Cohen wrote in 2018.
“People who want later births,” he wrote, “tend to want fewer children, and some people run out of time.”
Cohen told us that plenty of factors play a role. Economic uncertainty, the rising cost of raising children, career demands and family leave policies are all important, he said, “but I don’t have any research to prioritize or rank those things specifically.”
In terms of people having fewer children than they might want, policy analyst Anqi Chen at the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College pointed to a 2010 study that found that the demands of work stands out, especially for women as they get older. Career trade-offs become tougher as women rise in the workforce.
And the research also shows there’s a fundamental challenge of finding someone to have a child with, Chen said. The age when women marry (and men too) has climbed steadily since 1960. Divorce is also more common.
“No one can deny that having a kid is expensive — both in terms of opportunity cost and explicit costs — but it seems that competition from careers and not being in an ideal partnership are also very important,” Chen said.
The New York Times/Morning Consult survey lent some support to this. The top two reasons childless adults gave for either waiting or not wanting to have children were “want leisure time” and “haven’t found a partner.” The third was “can’t afford child care.”
One of the challenges of sorting out the driving forces is they play off of each other. Religion, ethnicity and education heavily influence people’s “taste for children,” as an article from the Boston College retirement research center put it, but those characteristics don’t live in a vacuum, separate from bread and butter concerns, such as the cost of child care.
Our ruling
Warren said, “The high cost of child care is the number one reason people give for having fewer children than they’d like.” That is what respondents said in a survey commissioned by the New York Times.
The experts in fertility that we reached said the cost of raising children is certainly a factor, but that particular survey doesn’t prove that the cost of child care ranks above all others. Experts said research is limited, but what’s been done suggests that a host of forces, including economic conditions, government policy, religion, ethnicity and education all play important roles.
We rate this statement Half True.

Did 'Green Book' win the Oscar just because it makes white people feel good?

Texto completo: It's the morning after the Oscars, and my editors have asked me to weigh in on the best picture win by “Green Book," Spike Lee's angry reaction when the award was announced, and why white viewers and black viewers might see this movie so differently.
My first response was that asking a white movie critic to write such an article is evidence of the problem itself.
My second might be to direct readers to the mordantly hilarious Twitter thread that quickly made the rounds after the win, with the opening salvo — “Green Book thinks you're so articulate" — piled onto with follow-ups. “Green Book doesn't see color." “Green Book wants to touch your hair." “Green Book would have voted for Obama a third time." “Green Book truly believes all movies matter." The New York Times's Aisha Harris spoke for many when she tweeted “Congratulations to DRIVING MISS DAISY for being the first movie to win Best Picture, twice."
There's a lot of love out there for the film, of course. It's a feel-good throwback to the sort of entertaining social-message movies that once united audiences, and it ultimately united enough of the Academy's old guard and its new generation to take the field. The fact that that unity isn't fully there in the critical community, on social media, and among many moviegoers seems to drive some of the movie's fans crazy.
A great many white moviegoers and probably some black moviegoers just adore “Green Book," although to be fair, the handful of people of color I've asked about the movie have rolled their eyes and said they haven't seen it because why bother? They don't have to see it to know it's a story they've been served before. The one that promotes interracial brotherhood by subtly making the white characters take the lead in the struggle for civil rights and equality. The one that subtly weakens and diminishes the black characters, the better to make them victims for the white characters to assist.
Despite such caustic viral critiques as the fake “White Savior" movie trailer cooked up by “Late Night with Seth Meyers," this is still a story that makes white audiences feel happy and comforted by the thought that we mattered, we made a difference, we played an equal part in the fight. That really, it just couldn't have happened without the white folks.
Ask a person of color their opinion of that one and see what they say.
I understand why Spike got up and tried to leave the Dolby Theater when the best picture Oscar was announced. It wasn't that “BlacKkKlansman" lost, it was that “Green Book" won, and in so doing proved that the creative community hasn't moved forward in any meaningful way since “Driving Miss Daisy" won out over “Do the Right Thing" in 1989. A film about the black American experience still has to be filtered through a white lens to be fully embraced by a white audience. We can't — won't — attend to these stories without an onscreen representative to hold our hands.
To which you might respond: Well, “Moonlight" won the best picture Oscar two years ago. And I would say you're right — and also point out that “If Beale Street Could Talk," director Barry Jenkins' follow-up film, was absurdly under-represented at this year's awards (Regina King won the supporting actress award), as was Boots Riley's too-cool-for-Oscar “Sorry to Bother You." “Beale Street" did win best film at the Indie Spirit awards, held the night before the Academy Awards and in the past few years a more reliable arbiter of cinematic quality than the Oscars.
Back to “Green Book": I don't forgive Oscar-winning screenwriters Nick Vallelonga, Peter Farrelly, and Brian Currie for weakening the character of Dr. Don Shirley by isolating him from his family (the opposite of true, say his surviving brothers). I don't forgive them for presenting Shirley as a tragic freak genius caught between the races. (“If I'm not black, Tony, and I'm not white, then what am I?" Shirley tearfully asks his driver-protector in a much-clipped scene.) I definitely don't forgive them for the fried chicken scene in which a casually racist white bouncer instructs a cultivated African-American on how to eat like the real black folk do.
Actually, I wonder why Italian-Americans aren't up in arms over Tony's friends and neighbors, who embody every cartoon stereotype in the book. (The exception is Tony's wife, played by Linda Cardellini as the only genuine human in the film.) I have been informed by an acquaintance who grew up in the North End and who loves “Green Book" that that's exactly what his relatives were like.
Okay, fine. But Nick Vallelonga's telling this story, his father's story, and he can lean on those clichés because he's lived in them and knows their truth. Why, then, did he not approach any of Don Shirley's relatives to find out their truths? Why was Mahershala Ali, who won the Oscar for best supporting actor, not told those relatives even existed? I'm guessing because it might have complicated the sweet story Vallelonga wanted to tell, where his dad matured as a white man by befriending, protecting, and saving a black man unwise to the ways of the world.
I imagine Dr. Donald Shirley was plenty wise to the ways of a world that men like Tony Villelonga navigated with comparative ease, as do many of the Academy members who voted for the film. I imagine Shirley knew exactly what he was doing when he made Nick Vallelonga promise to make “Green Book" only after Shirley was dead. That way he's not around for us to hear what he might have to say in response to the movie.
It might sound a lot like Spike.

Texto completo: Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas' call to kick libel law back to the states is baffling and dangerous. In an era where the president of the United States routinely attacks the press, our landmark libel case, New York Times v. Sullivan, must remain a cornerstone of First Amendment law.
Thomas seems to be supporting President Donald Trump's call to "open up" libel laws to make it easier to successfully sue media companies.
"We are going to have people sue you like you've never got sued before," Trump said at a Fort Worth rally during the frenzied 2016 presidential primary season. His lawyers may have convinced him that this would be tough to do under Sullivan, hence his "enemy of the people" diatribes on Twitter.
The press is under attack from our highest political office and the far right, and in this contentious political climate, journalists must remain protected against a vindictive government bearing down on us via our legal system.
In the landmark Sullivan ruling, the Supreme Court set a standard for actual malice that had to be met for press reports about public officials could be considered libel. Sullivan was birthed 55 years ago from civil rights-era conflicts as African-American leaders criticized police brutality against protesters in Alabama.
Without Sullivan, coverage of the protests in the South would have been squelched as southern public officials sought to use libel law as a cudgel to silence civil rights leaders and the reporters who covered them. Indeed, Sullivan was as much a civil rights case as it was a libel case.
Civil rights, Vietnam and Watergate reporting How ironic then that Justice Thomas, the only African-American on the Supreme Court, is calling for a retreat on these civil rights-era protections. He made this remark in a concurring opinion released Tuesday when the court turned down an appeal from Kathrine McKee, who accused Bill Cosby of sexual assault. She sued Cosby for libel after his lawyers called her dishonest.
Thomas often treads his own path in the area of First Amendment law. He is a noted defender of advertising, also called commercial speech, questioning why it should be more heavily regulated than other types of speech, even political speech. He has questioned laws that regulate political contributions, and strongly supported less government regulation of street and lawn signs. However, he has opposed free speech protections for high school students and prisoners.
During the middle of the last century, the media and civil rights protesters often faced financially crippling libel suits filed by public officials and even police officers such as L.B. Sullivan of Montgomery, Alabama. The Supreme Court's 1964 ruling in Sullivan cleared the way for more robust coverage of the Vietnam war and Watergate. The free press is compromised if it is not free to cover issues of public concern without fear of being hauled into court.
Journalists don't always win libel suits To be clear, journalists are not totally protected from libel suits, nor are we owed blanket immunity from reckless practice. For instance, Sen. Barry Goldwater, the 1964 Republican presidential nominee, prevailed in his libel suit against Fact magazine over "The Unconscious of a Conservative: A Special Issue on the Mind of Barry Goldwater," which was published before the election.
The magazine contended that Goldwater had a severely paranoid personality and was psychologically unfit to be president. Under Sullivan, Fact editor Ralph Ginzburg was found to have acted with actual malice: knowledge that the content was false before he published it or with reckless disregard of whether the information was false.
Provable truth is the ultimate defense in a libel suit. According to our federal law via Sullivan, if reporters get it wrong, they can certainly lose a libel case. And that's how it should be.

Texto completo: As Roman Catholic dioceses in New Jersey and across the country continue to release the names of hundreds of priests credibly accused of sexually abusing children over the decades, many are asking why this behavior seems to be so much more prevalent among priests than others.
Over the years, some have attributed the problem to the church's all-male clergy, the oath of celibacy, sexual orientation, or all of these factors combined.
But research has debunked the notion that celibacy or sexual orientation are at the root of the problem, and experts say sex offenders, though overwhelmingly men, are no more likely to be priests in the Catholic Church than filling similar roles of authority in any other institution.
"If people think that you're more likely to get sexually violated by a priest than by a stepfather or soccer coach or a school teacher, then you're just not paying attention to the data," said Thomas Plante, a psychology professor at Santa Clara University whose research has focused on sex offending clergy. "Sex abuse of children is a common phenomenon wherever you look, but particularly during the last half of the 20th century."
The American Psychiatric Association has found that about 3 to 5 percent of the general male population in the U.S. are pedophiles. And in 2004, a U.S. Department of Education study of educators committing sexual misconduct found that about 5 percent of school staff sexually violated children.
From 1950 to 2002, of the 109,694 priests in active ministry, 4,392 — or 4 percent — were accused of sexual abuse, according to a 2004 John Jay report on the nature and scope of the crisis.
New Jersey has 16,000 people on its sex offender registry, which is far less than 5 percent of its male population. But it's crucial to note only 30 percent of sexual abuse cases get reported to authorities, according to the U.S. Department of Justice.
Some experts say the reason priest sex abuse has become so prominent an issue is not because there are more sex abusers among priests than in the general population, but because victims have become more empowered to speak out.
Some of that has to do with societal changes, a growing freedom to talk about sex generally, and a declining number of churchgoers, which has made it easier to challenge a secretive church hierarchy that had closed ranks to protect abusive priests.
Holding church leaders accountable, reviewing policies pertaining to interaction with children, and more research on how the problem persists in other organizations is needed in order to limit the opportunities of abuse, experts say.
Long-running crisis The crisis in the Catholic Church has come into the spotlight again since August, when a Pennsylvania grand jury report detailed cases of abuse by more than 300 priests over 70 years.
Dioceses across the country have been releasing names of abusive priests since.
Recently, the church found former Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, the archbishop of the Newark Archdiocese from 1986 to 2000 and founding bishop of the Diocese of Metuchen in 1982, guilty of sexually abusing seminarians and minors over several decades. Last week, Pope Francis took the unusual step of defrocking McCarrick, who is the first U.S. cardinal known to have his ecclesiastical status revoked.
Pope Francis and bishops from around the world began meeting Thursday at the Vatican for a four-day conference to address the global crisis of the sexual abuse of minors by Catholic priests.
The Newark Archdiocese, along with New Jersey's four other dioceses — Paterson, Metuchen, Trenton and Camden — earlier this month released the names of 188 priests credibly accused of sexually abusing children. Many of those priests are dead, and the others have been removed from ministry. The lists didn't include names of those who are currently in litigation or under investigation, or those affiliated with religious orders.
The abuse in many cases took place years, even decades ago.
Experts say most cases of sexual abuse have gone unreported. The New Jersey Attorney General's office set up a hotline in the fall for survivors to report sexual abuse within the Catholic Church. The line was inundated with calls the first two weeks, the office said at the time.
"Clergy sexual abuse isn't a new problem, just one that's been given more attention — and for good reason — in the past few decades," said Dorothy Rogers, the chair of the religion department at Montclair State University.
Societal changes spurred by feminism and the gay rights movement have contributed to people being more open to look at the problem of sexual abuse, not only in the religious organizations but other institutions, Rogers said.
"People are more free now to talk about sex in general — including sexual abuse," she said.
According to the Pew Research Center, 67 percent of adults in New Jersey identify as Christian and 34 percent as Catholic. Rogers said less people across the country are religious, which makes it easier to hold church leaders accountable.
"More people in the U.S. now identify as non-religious than ever before, [so] more people see 'the church' as just one of many organizations and they ask: Why treat religious leaders or groups any differently?" Rogers said.
Prevention and education efforts have increased dramatically since the public became more aware of how pervasive child sexual abuse is.
Organizations where adults have contact with children — for example, the Boys and Girls Club of America, Boys Scouts of America, the Girl Scouts and public schools — have developed training to prevent child abuse and neglect.
Pedophilia Only a few of the priests accused of sexual abuse in the United States from 1950 to 2010 had serious pathological, developmental or psychological behaviors that could have led to their discovery before they committed abusive acts, according to a report by the John Jay College Research Team in 2011.
Less than 5 percent of the priests were motivated by pedophilia, according to the John Jay report, called "The Causes and Context of Sexual Abuse of Minors by Catholic Priests in the United States."
According the U.S. Department of Justice, about 60 percent of perpetrators of sexual abuse are known to the child but are not family members, such as family friends, child care providers and neighbors.
Some priests who committed sexual misconduct were abused as minors, the John Jay report stated.
"Priests who were sexually abused as minors themselves were more likely to abuse minors than those without a history of abuse," the report stated.
However, just because someone has been sexually abused as a child, doesn't mean they will become sex offenders and abuse others, according to research by the U.S. Department of Justice.
Celibacy, gay priests Some have pointed to celibacy as a contributing factor to priests sexually abusing children, but the John Jay study did not find this to be the case.
"Just because somebody can't have sex, doesn't mean they're going to go after kids," Plante said. "There are a lot of people out there who don't have sex for a variety of reasons, including medical problems, but they're not seducing children."
Church leaders have often blamed "homosexuality" as the reason behind the criminal acts of sexual abuse.
Though less than 10 percent of priests have publicly come out as gay in the country, about 30 to 40 percent of the American Catholic clergy are gay men, according to estimates from gay priests and researchers in a recent report by the New York Times.
But the John Jay study found that "priests who had same-sex sexual experiences either before seminary or in seminary," or who engaged in sex after ordination, "most likely" exhibited these behaviors with adults.
"These men were not significantly more likely to abuse minors," the study stated.
"Sadly, gay men have been terribly scapegoated," said Plante. "They're not more likely to harm a child than a straight person is. The vast majority of sex offenders out there are not gay men by any means. Many are married with families."

Texto completo: It sounds like something out of Dickens: A wealthy private school on Manhattan's Upper East Side wants to build a multimillion-dollar athletic facility that will shroud the remnants of a 19th-century orphanage that was uncovered during demolition. The only thing standing in its way is the local priest -- the same man whose accusations led to a cardinal's being defrocked by the pope.
At the end of a recent Sunday Mass, the Rev. Boniface Ramsey reminded his congregation of this latest crusade. "I just want to talk to you all again for a moment about the wall of St. Joseph's Orphan Asylum," Father Ramsey said. "The wall is now in danger of being obscured again by the Spence School. This is a big deal for our parish because there was a relationship between that orphanage and our parish all those years ago."
As his congregants at St. Joseph's Church were aware, the neighborhood drama started after a parking garage on East 90th Street was demolished to reveal a forgotten artifact: an eight-story neoclassical facade that was part an orphanage that cared for thousands of children over a century ago.
The orphanage was founded in 1857 and closed around 1920. Today the building is a condominium, its eastern facade improbably untouched, hidden by the garage for decades. But its resurrection will be brief: The lot belongs to Spence, the elite all-girls school, and construction is underway on a facility that will feature nine squash courts and an ecology center. When the building is completed next year, the orphanage facade will be hidden again.
In a statement, Spence said: "The fact that the site will once again serve children, after a hiatus of over a century of connection with St. Joseph's, should rightfully be honored."
It added, "While we will never know whether any young girl's path passed through both our institutions, the inspiring possibility cannot be excluded and should be considered by all."
A sense of obligation has also motivated Father Ramsey's cause. His church and the orphanage were affiliated, and they both tended to the German immigrants of the Yorkville neighborhood in the late 1800s. Several weeks ago, after the garage came down, he started mentioning the wall during sermons and in church bulletins, and he recently wrote to the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission.
Before a recent Catholic youth league basketball game, Father Ramsey walked three blocks north to the future Spence site. "My aim is to make a fuss about this, and I will continue to make a fuss about this," he said. "What frustrates me is that Spence should have consulted with the neighborhood. All I want is a plaque. Something that will show what was here. That way the privileged children of Spence can know that children who had no such privilege came before them."
Crusading against Spence is not quite as daunting as speaking out against the diocese. Outside of his parish, Father Ramsey, 73, is best known as a whistle-blower in the sexual abuse case of Theodore E. McCarrick, a former cardinal and archbishop of Washington. But the private schools of Manhattan can be formidable institutions to meddle in the affairs of. Father Ramsey is unfazed.
"I'm intimidated by the cardinal," he said. "Not the Spence School."
Spence was founded in 1892, and it sits a block away from Central Park on East 91st Street. The school's tuition, according to its website, is about $ 52,000 per year, and its alumnae include Gwyneth Paltrow, Kerry Washington and Anna Wintour's daughter. The future athletic facility, which is known as Spence 412, will feature a regulation basketball court and a dance studio. Spence purchased the site for $ 26 million in 2011.
An email from the school's real estate lawyer viewed by The New York Times suggested concern as Father Ramsey's cause gained notice. "We should talk," the note began. "I have been watching this grow from a cute little story to the sprouting of a public campaign."
"Apparently, one of the Good Father's options," it continued, "is to request that LPC" -- a reference to the Landmarks Preservation Commission -- "begin the designation process for landmarking the building. You can't make this stuff up. Call me for more and a few suggestions."
Although the orphanage wall is now at the center of a distinctly New York drama, part of its facade had been visible to perceptive pedestrians for decades. But most knew little about its past, including Father Ramsey, who recognized the structure only from a book about St. Joseph's history. Urgency about the wall's fate accelerated last month after the weekly community newspaper Our Town ran a story about Spence's plans for the lot.
"We don't think of ourselves as the Upper East Side," Father Ramsey said. "We're Yorkville. So, when I found out one of the last real parts of old Yorkville was about to disappear on the account of people not from here, who didn't even ask anybody, I had to do something."
A kind of preservationist fever has since spread around the neighborhood.
"When the girls who go to Spence grow up, I think they will be disappointed to find out what the parents did to the orphanage wall," said Zora Szemenyei Silber, 62, a retired elementary schoolteacher and part of St. Joseph's congregation. "Children don't forget."
Jim Sidebotham, 68, expressed disdain when he visited the facade. "Like Spence needs more space," he said. "Squash courts? Just what the girls need. That's got to be the height of effete, elite snobbery."
Ben Kallos, a City Council member who represents the Upper East Side, has been trying to temper such passions. "The wall takes us back to the roots of Yorkville, and it harkens back to 'Oliver Twist,"' Mr. Kallos said.
But, he added, Spence lawfully secured its rights to the site long before there was interest in the orphanage. "I'm hopeful Spence can come up with a solution, but I'm also not sure how much can realistically be done now, and how fair it would be to the school so far into their project."
Earlier this month, Father Ramsey appeared resigned to the fate of the facade. "It looks dim," he said. But last week, as news of the cause spread, Spence agreed to hear Father Ramsey's complaints. Mr. Kallos organized a meeting in his offices.
Spence was represented by its head of school, its architect, a member of its communications team and its lawyer. Father Ramsey arrived alone and brought with him a large book containing baptismal records of the orphanage, its tattered pages filled with rows of cursive handwriting.
Spence proposed ideas: creating a permanent exhibit to honor the site's past, having Father Ramsey talk to students during an assembly, starting a scholarship named after the orphanage. "It seemed like they really wanted to accommodate me," Father Ramsey said afterward. "I don't know how many of those ideas will ever go further than that room."
The school did agree to his main request: a commemorative plaque.
Back at his church, Father Ramsey reflected on his quest. "I feel I went to bat for the orphans," he said. "Now I won't have to go marching up and down the building site with a placard to protest the whole thing. But if that ends up being necessary, I'll come back."

Francis Street First United Methodist Church has created a Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) club for young girls in the community.
The Girls Who Code club is split into two different age groups. Third to fifth grade is one group for girls while the other is girls in grades six through 12.
The club’s mission as stated on its Facebook page is: “To close the gender gap in technology. Let’s help our daughters to get a skill that will change their and your future. Girls Who Code Club will be solving problems in our community, empower friends and parents, and define the future of our world.”
Pastor Dr. Lydia Istomina hopes young girls will be able to learn and build their confidence through the program for the future workforce.
“When girls get a wonderful education, and in most cases they do, but then when it comes for us women to apply for a job and we look at the job description and we don’t feel like we are 100 percent fit,” Istomina says.
The club is a derivation of the New York Times bestseller “Girls Who Code: Learn to Code and Change the World,” written by Reshma Sauhjani.
Istomina explains “Girls Who Code” also teaches girls how to interact with each other as well as teaching them lessons in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.
“This program also teaches is a sisterhood and that bravery that they need in certain professions and in life. It creates the kind of environment of respect, mutual respect, and of course, we engage parents.”
Co-facilitator of the program at the church, Becky Hickok, believes the program is a place for girls to be comfortable with trying new things.
“With this program, I hope to form a group where girls feel safe to try new things. One that if they fail, they aren’t afraid to try again if needed. Computers and coding are the future & I hope to see a flood of young ladies leading the way.”
Francis Street First United Methodist Church will host the club every Saturday at the church from 3 to 4 p.m. until April 6.
To learn more about the club, visit the church’s Facebook page or contact Francis Street First United Methodist Church at 816-279-7466 .

PAYING FOR PROGRESSIVE IDEAS GETTING FISCAL ABOUT POLICY PROPOSALS

Texto completo: Whoever gets the Democratic nomination, she or he will run in part on proposals to increase government spending. And you know what that will mean: There will be demands that the candidate explain how all this will be paid for. Many of those demands will be made in bad faith, from people who never ask the same questions about tax cuts. But there are some real questions about the fiscal side of a progressive agenda.
Well, I have some thoughts about that, inspired in part by looking at Elizabeth Warren's proposals on both the tax and spending side. By the way, I don't know whether Ms. Warren will or even should get the nomination. But she's a major intellectual figure, and is pushing her party toward serious policy discussion in a way that will have huge influence whatever her personal trajectory.
In particular, Ms. Warren's latest proposal on child care -and the instant pushback from the usual suspects -has me thinking that we could use a rough typology of spending proposals, classified by how they might be paid for. Specifically, let me suggest that there are three broad categories of progressive expenditure: investment, benefits enhancement and major system overhaul, which need to be thought about differently from a fiscal point of view.
So, first off, investment -typically spending on infrastructure or research, but there may be some room at the margin for including spending on things like childhood development in the same category. The defining characteristic here is that it's spending that will enhance society's future productivity. How should we pay for that kind of outlay?
The answer is, we shouldn't. Think of all the people who say that the government should be run like a business. Actually it shouldn't, but the two kinds of institution do have this in common: if you can raise funds cheaply and apply them to high-return projects, you should go ahead and borrow. And federal borrowing costs are very low -less than 1 percent, adjusted for inflation -while we are desperately in need of public investment, i.e., it has a high social return. So we should just do it, without looking for pay-fors.
Much of what seems to be in the Green New Deal falls into that category. To the extent that it's a public investment program, demands that its supporters show how they'll pay for it show more about the critics' bad economics than about the GND's logic.
My second category is a bit harder to define, but what I'm thinking of are initiatives that either expand an existing public program or use subsidies to create incentives for expanding some kind of socially desirable private activity -in each case involving sums that are significant but not huge, say a fraction of a percent of GDP.
The Affordable Care Act falls into that category. It expanded Medicaid while using a combination of regulation and subsidies to make private insurance more available to families above the new Medicaid line. Ms. Warren's child care proposal, which reportedly will come in at around 1/3 of a percent of GDP, also fits. So would a "Medicare for All" proposal that involves allowing people to buy in to government insurance, rather than offering that insurance free of charge.
It's harder to justify borrowing for this kind of initiative than borrowing for investment. True, with interest rates low and demand weak it makes some sense to run persistent deficits, but there are surely enough investment needs to use up that allowance. So you want some kind of pay-for. But the sums are small enough that the revenue involved could be raised by fairly narrow-gauge taxes -in particular, taxes that hit only high-income Americans.
That is, in fact, how Obamacare was financed: the revenue component came almost entirely from taxes on high incomes (there were some small items like the tax on tanning parlors.) And Ms. Warren has in fact proposed additional taxes on the wealthy -her proposed tax on fortunes over $50 million would yield something like four times the cost of her child care proposal.
So benefit enhancement can, I'd argue, be paid for with taxes on high incomes and large fortunes. It doesn't have to impose on the middle class.
Finally, my third category is major system overhaul, of which the archetype would be replacing employer-based private health insurance with a tax-financed public program -the purist version of Medicare for all. A really major expansion of Social Security might fall into that category too, although smaller enhancements might not.
Proposals in this category are literally an order of magnitude more expensive than benefit enhancements: private health insurance currently amounts to 6 percent of GDP. To implement these proposals, then, we'd need a lot more revenue, which would have to come from things like payroll taxes and/or a value-added tax that hit the middle class.
You can argue that most middle-class families would be better off in the end, that the extra benefits would more than compensate for the higher taxes. And you'd probably be right. But this would be a much heavier political lift. You don't have to be a neoliberal tool to wonder whether major system overhaul should be part of the Democratic platform right now, even if it's something many progressives aspire to.
My main point now, however, is that when people ridicule progressive proposals as silly and unaffordable, they're basically revealing their own biases and ignorance.

Texto completo: For three years, Jesse Krimes mailed pieces of bedsheets out of prison while serving a five-year sentence. The sheets were his art - he used hair gel and a plastic spoon to imprint images he found in the newspaper.
Six years later, his work, "Apokaluptein: 16389067" - 39 prison-issued sheets at 40 feet long and 15 feet tall - is on display in "The O.G. Experience," an art exhibit featuring the works of formerly incarcerated men and women, in conjunction with the release of a new HBO film, "O.G." that debuts on Monday, Feb. 25.
Krimes' piece hangs like a tapestry at the Studio 525 NYC gallery in Chelsea, depicting images of war amid advertisements featuring happy women culled from The New York Times between 2010 and 2013. 
"I would make one section and mail it out and make another section and mail that out," he told amNewYork at the opening on Tuesday. "Obama was still president, Trump's advertisements were transferred in this. It was a way to mark time and keep my own sanity in the process." 
amnwOG190221_quote
The time capsule-like piece shows what Krimes says is a problematic view of the world because the images of women in the ads are all interspersed with death and destruction .... "and then there's an ad for Macy's and an ad for J. Crew," he said.
Krimes, who co-curated the exhibit, has two other works in the gallery, including a reproduction of a solitary jail cell and a collection of used prison playing cards and soap that he altered with print. 
It's among the works of 14 other formerly incarcerated artists, which Krimes says is a first.
"It's never really been done before," he said. "A lot of times there are exhibitions that work through ideas or issues of incarceration, but they very seldom include people who have lived the experience. In many ways, this exhibition is designed to showcase the people who have lived that experience and are making incredibly critical and complex artwork. It pushes back against this narrative that people who have been in prison are underrepresented and misrepresented and continually spoken for when they can speak for themselves."
Mary Baxter's "Ain't I A Woman," is a triptych multimedia project with her own music that tells the story of her life before, during and after imprisonment. Her lyrics tell her truth and comment on the country's prison system: "It's not a school to prison pipeline, it's a prison to prison pipeline." 
Artist and co-curator Russell Craig used ox blood to paint Rorschach-like portraits of black Americans who were killed in police-involved shootings in "E-Val," which hangs along an entire wall within the gallery. A few feet away, his self-portrait is displayed, but instead of a canvas, Craig used his own legal documents during his incarceration, including parole papers, statements of employment and prison resident schedule, among others. 
Lucinda Martinez, HBO's senior vice president of multicultural and international marketing, says the exhibit picks up where "O.G." leaves off.
"It picks up on the hope part of it, the idea that prison can be restorative or spark the conversation about looking at justice not just as punitive, which is how our system currently works, mostly," she said. "It's about how [prisoners] can still be inspired and how there are programs of reform that could change the conversation. I think this exhibit forces you, through the art, to look past your first screen of judgment and see the humanity of people." 
If you go: The gallery is at Studio 525 NYC, 525 W. 24th St., and it is free and open to the public 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Wednesday through Saturday and on Monday, and from 10 a.m. to

US looks into J&amp;J over asbestos-baby powder link

Texto completo: The Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating Johnson & Johnson over concerns the company's baby powder may have contained asbestos.
The agencies subpoenaed the company in the wake of several jury awards to plaintiffs who claimed the company's talc products were tainted with asbestos and caused their cancers. The agencies seek documents about those matters and other suits Johnson & Johnson faces filed by shareholders and pension holders over the situation.
Johnson & Johnson shares fell 1.4 percent in early trading Thursday to $134.43.
About 13,000 plaintiffs seek claims in pending lawsuits involving talc-based body powders. "The Company is cooperating with these government inquiries and will be producing documents in response," Johnson & Johnson said in an SEC filing Wednesday.
Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., the top Democrat on the Senate Health Committee sought information from Johnson & Johnson about the company's knowledge of potential asbestos in its talcum-based products.
Last year, courts in New Jersey and California awarded damages to plaintiffs who claimed Johnson & Johnson talc products tainted with asbestos caused their mesothelioma. In July, a St. Louis jury awarded $4.7 billion to 22 women who said asbestos in the company's talc powder contributed to their ovarian cancer.
In the SEC filing, Johnson & Johnson said, "The Company believes that it has strong grounds on appeal to overturn these verdicts."
Johnson & Johnson said in a statement to USA TODAY that the agencies' and Sen. Murray's inquiries "are related to news reports that included inaccurate statements and also withheld crucial information that had already been made public in the litigation and in prior media reports about the ongoing talc litigation that adversely impacted our share price in late December 2018."
The statement continued: "Decades of independent tests by regulators and the world's leading labs prove Johnson & Johnson's baby powder is safe and asbestos-free, and does not cause cancer. We intend to cooperate fully with these inquiries and will continue to defend the Company in the talc-related litigation."
The Justice Department and the SEC declined to comment.
Details about the DOJ and SEC inquiries come two months after reports in The New York Times and Reuters revealed documents suggesting the company knew about the risk of asbestos in its powders for decades and sought to keep the issue quiet.
Johnson & Johnson stock plummeted 17 percent after those reports, resulting in a decline in the company's market value of about $40 billion.
Those reports also prompted Murray to seek information from Johnson & Johnson, she said.
"I am troubled by recent reports of an alleged decades-long effort by Johnson & Johnson to potentially mislead regulators and consumers about the safety of one of its products, which may have resulted in long-term harm for men, women and children who used Johnson & Johnson baby powder," she wrote in a letter to Johnson & Johnson Chairman and CEO Alex Gorsky late last month.

Texto completo: A documentary about the country singer Charley Pride airs on PBS. And "Chef's Table" returns on Netflix.
What's on TV
AMERICAN MASTERS -- CHARLEY PRIDE: I'M JUST ME 9 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). "When Jackie Robinson went to the major leagues, I was picking cotton beside my dad," the singer Charley Pride recalls near the beginning of this documentary. "And I said to myself, 'Here's my way out of the cotton field."' While Pride didn't end up becoming a baseball star, he did break his own ground as a trailblazing country music star -- and as one of the relatively few black performers to reach his level of success in the genre. This hourlong documentary charts Pride's rise, beginning with his childhood in Sledge, Miss., where he was born in 1938 to a family of sharecroppers. Dolly Parton, Brad Paisley, Whoopi Goldberg, Marty Stuart, Willie Nelson and others make appearances.
TONE BELL: CAN'T CANCEL THIS 10 p.m. on Showtime. The comedian Tone Bell, known as the fiancé in the CBS sitcom "Fam" and a war-veteran-turned-security-guard in Netflix's "Disjointed," discusses student loans (paid) and Alaska (cold) in this comedy special.
INTERSTELLAR (2014) 10:25 p.m. on FXM. Environmental catastrophe is at the center of Christopher Nolan's anxious and ambitious space movie, which stars Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway as astronauts on a mission to find humans a new home planet. That the search is necessary is a product of a Dust Bowl-like blight that has rendered Earth unable to produce most crops (other than corn). In his review for The New York Times, A. O. Scott wrote that the film "distills terrestrial anxieties and aspirations into a potent pop parable, a mirror of the mood down here on Earth."
What's Streaming
CHEF'S TABLE on Netflix. The sixth season of this food profiles a new set of a chefs. Asma Khan, who founded the Indian restaurant Darjeeling Express in London and put together a kitchen staffed entirely by women, talks here about formative experiences growing up in India. In another episode, the American chef Mashama Bailey gives a tour of her restaurant, the Grey, built in a former segregated bus station in Savannah, Ga. As in previous seasons, both the chefs and their food are presented simply, admiringly, and with a minimalism that reads as a rebuke of the bloated excess favored by food competition shows.
LOVING VINCENT (2017) Stream on Hulu; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube. If you're on a Vincent van Gogh kick after seeing "At Eternity's Gate," consider this lush animated feature about the artist's life from the directors Dorota Kobiela and Hugh Welchman. An Oscar contender in 2017, the film was marketed as the first full-length animated film to be made entirely of oil paintings on canvas. It follows a young man (Douglas Booth) investigating the painter's death about a year after it happened. In his review for The Times, A. O. Scott wrote that the viewer "becomes accustomed to the images, and astonishment at the film's innovative, painstaking technique."

Texto completo: Robin Bell's projection was visible outside the D.C. hotel for only a few minutes, but the local artist's scathing message about President Trump was momentous enough to make national headlines.
One night in May 2017, Bell parked his van and projector across the street from the Trump International Hotel and beamed blue text reading "Pay Trump bribes here" above the west entrance of the building. Within hours, CNN, the New York Times and other news outlets picked up the story, shining a spotlight on Bell's visual displays of activism. Now the artist has a bigger (and more official) canvas to work with - the Corcoran School of the Arts and Design's Flagg Building - for his indoor exhibition "Open," which runs through March 31.
It's an earnest - yet also more than a bit irreverent - look at censorship, accountability and transparency that raises an eyebrow at politicians.
"The exhibit is meant for people to think about what 'open' means," says Bell, 40, who taught video production at the Corcoran College of Art and Design, the school's previous incarnation before it became part of George Washington University. "Asking [the public] to be open is asking them to do more work, to take on something that they're scared of. The world is a scary place, so let's look at this together, and let's be open about it and talk."
"Open" also serves as a prelude to a larger exhibition coming to the Flagg Building in June that will explore the Corcoran's decision to cancel a Robert Mapplethorpe retrospective in 1989. The late New York photographer's show at the space - then the Corcoran Gallery of Art, which closed in 2014 - was scrapped just weeks before its scheduled opening over concerns that its content would affect the museum's government funding. The traveling retrospective - organized by Philadelphia's Institute of Contemporary Arts - had received funding from the National Endowment for the Arts and contained sexually explicit images with homoerotic and sadomasochistic themes.
"The loudest, most racist, homophobic voices are dominating social media and our spaces right now," Bell says. "A lot of the same struggles with censorship still exist - they just take different forms in different places."
Following the cancellation of "The Perfect Moment," hundreds of protesters gathered at the Corcoran and projected images of Mapplethorpe's photographs on the museum's exterior. Thirty years later, the building is once again covered in protest projections, albeit indoors, for Bell's "Open." The first thing visitors will notice when they walk in is a projection engulfing the atrium's staircase, which flashes images of Bell's past works of protest. The display sets the tone for one of "Open's" most dramatic installations, "The Swamp," which is housed in the adjacent gallery.
Portraits of national and local government officials - including some D.C. Council members - are projected onto elevated blocks in the darkened room. Bell says it was important to him to highlight politicians beyond the president in the exhibition. Brightly colored abstract images also appear sporadically.
"Being in D.C., I've noticed that you can be in certain places and have people in power walk by, and nobody notices them," Bell says. With "The Swamp," "I wanted to figure out a piece that could visually represent the people who are making decisions."
During its run, "Open" will be an ever-evolving piece of art, with Bell altering the projections based on the news of the day and people's reactions to the exhibition. The show will be a critique of present-day censorship, but also a testament to how far the Corcoran has come since the canceled Mapplethorpe show, three decades ago.
"A lot of people have said, 'Is the Corcoran still open?,' when I told them that I was doing a show here," Bell says. "Yes, it is - it is open. It's changed, but it's open."

Suing to protect the right to just be left alone

Texto completo: Unlike citizens of most every other nation, Americans are not required by law to carry identification when they are simply walking around. Just as there is no national religion, there is no official language here, and we are free to gab in any tongue we choose.
So what possessed a United States Customs and Border Protection officer who last spring stopped two American women in a small Montana city and asked for their identification because, he said, he heard them speaking Spanish?
Well, there’s an easy answer to that rhetorical question: It was the false color of law, the un-American pretense that a uniform creates the right to invade others’ privacy without probable cause, that led the officer to pretend he could ask for something he had no right to.
Because, plain and simple, there is no national ID card here, and there is no need to carry anything with you as you go about your daily business — or to show even a driver’s license to law enforcement if there is no real reason to do so. But the undeniable truth is that police officers around the country quite often act as if this is not the case. It simply makes life easier for them if they can figure out who you are and run your name through the system when they have any suspicions at all.
In some small way, the fact that we can stroll ID-free helps keep the fully bureaucratic state at bay.
And that’s why we are glad that the two women in Montana, Ana Suda and Martha Hernandez, are suing the government agency in a symbolically important case brought by the ACLU.
They were in a convenience store in Havre, Montana, on May 16, 2018 when, the lawsuit alleges, Agent Paul A. O’Neal commented on Hernandez’s accent, calling it “very strong.” He then asked where they were born. Hernandez was born in California and Suda in Texas.
When the women expressed shock at the agent’s question, The New York Times reports, he said he was “dead serious” and asked to see their identification.
The pair were in possession of their valid Montana driver’s licenses, and, probably smartly, deciding to produce them, maintain as we might that they didn’t have to.
The officer briefly detained them in the store’s parking lot, the suit alleges. The women filmed the encounter on their phones, and asked on camera why they were being stopped.
“Ma’am the reason I asked you for your ID is I came in here and I saw you guys are speaking Spanish, which is very unheard of up here,” the agent said. The town is 35 miles from the Canadian border.
The agency has lots of real work to do. Frivolous lawsuits would only make that harder. But this kind of fighting back against false authority is so very important for Americans to continue to do in an increasingly un-private age. It is not against the law to speak Spanish — or Klingon, for that matter.
Government intrusion on individual liberty, whatever its rationale or purported justification, must be kept within reasonable limits.
In a society that values liberty, it is untenable for government agents to use accents or choice of language as a starting point for infringing on individual liberty.

Texto completo: It's likely you grew up with Dr. Seuss. His 1957 books "The Cat in the Hat" and "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" are just a couple of classics woven into the fabric of American life.
Since 2003, the town of Taos has been participating in the National Education Association's Read Across America Day, celebrated Feb. 25 - March 1. This is no small gimmick. The annual, coordinated initiative celebrates Dr. Seuss' s birthday. Across the country, millions of students, teens, working adults and retired grandparents participate each year.
Some may think celebrating Dr. Seuss is "just a kid's thing." But the author's universal messages of diversity, tolerance and environmental conservation continue to be important today.
To that end, the town of Taos is kicking up the fun factor a notch. Taos is hosting its first-ever "Dr. Seuss Spirit Week" for kids and adults across the community. To show your spirit, plan to participate each day that corresponds with a favorite Dr. Seuss book:
Monday (Feb. 25): "One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish" - Wear the colors red and blue.
Tuesday (Feb. 26): "Fox in Socks" - Wear bright, colorful, fun or just plain crazy socks. You will want to roll your pants up on this one.
Wednesday (Feb 27): "Wacky Wednesday" - Wear wacky clothes, such as mismatched, inside out or backward.
Thursday (Feb. 28): "Sleep Book" - Wear pajamas that are school and work appropriate.
Friday (March 1): "Cat in the Hat" - Wear your favorite hat - the sillier, the better.
Also on March 1, Taos students will be released from school early. All children and adults are invited to attend the Dr. Seuss Birthday Party at the Taos Youth and Family Center from 1 to 4 p.m. The first 300 children will receive a good quality backpack filled with a marker, pencil, notebook and free book.
"We're providing our community with a fun, safe and supervised event. It's more than just a book and a party. It's all the traditions that we bring spending time together," said Judy Esquibel, community events coordinator for the town of Taos.
Esquibel's favorite book is "Cat in the Hat." She keeps little Dr. Seuss characters in her office year-round. "At the birthday party, we have a staff member and volunteers dressed up like Dr. Seuss characters. We'll have Cat in the Hat, Thing 1 and Thing 2. And for the first time this year, the Grinch will be there."
In addition to the party, Esquibel has arranged volunteers to read to 167 students in the Head Start/YDI programs. For example, Mayor Dan and First Lady Della Barrone will be reading at Taos Pueblo. Michelle Jacquez-Ortiz, a staff member with U.S. Senator Tom Udall's office, will read at Llano Quemado.
Kate Alderete is the director of the Taos Public Library. Her favorite book is "Bartholomew and the Oobleck" (1949) about a king who eventually apologizes for his dislike of the weather. "We teach children that 'please' and 'thank you' are very important," Alderete said. "But we forget that another key magical phrase is 'I'm sorry.' "
In his lifetime, author Theodor Seuss Geisel wrote and illustrated close to 50 books. He has won numerous literary awards, a few Academy Awards for screenwriting and was bestowed with the Pulitzer Prize Special Citation.
Seuss lived in La Jolla, California, for many years. Its local scenery was part of his zany inspiration. In fact the Smithsonian Magazine has an article about the real "Original Lorax Tree" still found in Scripps Park today.
In a 1991 obituary upon his death, The New York Times quoted Seuss as saying: "If I start out with the concept of a two-headed animal, I must put two hats on his head and two toothbrushes in the bathroom. It's logical insanity."

'Merchants' casts grim eye on news business

Texto completo: One of the facts bemoaned by traditional journalists in the current state of the news business is that, with a growing banquet of news to offer on any given day, in any given hour, consumers are opting for boiled down listicles and scannable reads.
It's the antithesis in style to what The New York Times used to embody, particularly by its former senior editorial leader, Jill Abramson, the first woman to serve as the paper's Washington bureau chief, managing editor and executive editor – the top job in American print journalism.
But as everyone knows , Abramson didn't last long at the top; just three years. In May 2014, she was fired for allegedly poor management and being too "difficult" for even hard-boiled Times journalists to handle.
Her account of what happened as laid out in her new book, "Merchants of Truth: The Business of News and the Fight for Facts," is absorbing and fair – and it's likely the first section many journalists will turn to.
"There was no simple reason I was fired. I was a less than stellar manager, but I also had been judged by an unfair double standard applied to many women leaders. Most of all, I became the first woman editor at a very bad time in journalism," she writes.
Now comes "Merchants," published Tuesday (Simon & Schuster, ).
Reviews have been generally positive, mixed with sharp criticism. There already has been a contretemps over whether she accused the Times of being biased against President Donald Trump in its coverage. She batted that away as an exaggeration of something taken out of context. A fair reading backs her up.
Now she and her publisher are dealing with more serious charges of factual errors and plagiarism lodged late Wednesday in a series of tweets on Twitter by a reporter for one of the four news organizations she examines in the book, Vice – which under her gaze does not come off as a journalistic paragon.
Simon & Schuster issued a statement Thursday promising revisions if warranted in the 534-page book. Abramson also issued a statement to USA TODAY that the passages in question involve facts that were imperfectly cited in her 70 pages of footnotes. "I wouldn't want even a misplaced comma so I will promptly fix these footnotes and quotations as I have corrected other material that Vice contested," she said.
Meanwhile, the book as published documents the crisis: Journalism may have not yet been annihilated but the barbarians are at the gate and banging hard. More news than ever is out there and more people than ever are in need of reliable information in order for democracy to function, Abramson observes.
At the same time, she reports, the journalism business model is stuttering and a steadier replacement is not yet obvious. Every news company struggles to produce a product for the digital age amid sharp staff cuts, while more consumers, marinated in "the internet is free!" assumptions, are unwilling to pay for it, Abramson says.
The author explores this grim state through the experiences of two legacy media titans, her former employer, the Times, and the Washington Post, fighting to retain their "values" in a maelstrom, and two digital titans, BuzzFeed and Vice, "improbable players" in an arena where social media drives large numbers of consumers to news.
"I was determined to capture this moment of wrenching transition – and to do it as a reporter, my first calling," Abramson writes.
She has her pet peeves: The sometimes dishonest nature of clickbait headlines, designed to capture attention but promising more than they deliver. Tedious business meetings watching PowerPoint presentations of eye-glazing data charts. The "ridiculously" few women in senior editing jobs at the Times, a deficit she is most proud of improving during her tenure.
She is alarmed about the chipping away of the traditional wall between the news side and the business side. When the new CEO of the Times told her he expected new "revenue-producing products" to come from the newsroom, she snapped, "If that's what you expect, you have the wrong executive editor ... The truth had flown out of my mouth before I could edit either its substance or tone."
Abramson doesn't see an entirely trouble-free future for any of her examined news organizations, despite their various successes. "All four are endangered," she warns. That even goes for the Post, which was rescued in 2013 by its "white knight," Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos, who bought the family-owned paper for $250 million with the idea that "restoring its glory would be a contribution to democracy."
For legacy media survivors, following the trials and tribulations of two newspapers may involve equal measures of envy, dread and schadenfreude. BuzzFeed and Vice may seem like alien entities.
Abramson traces how BuzzFeed began with a steady diet viral cat videos, but founder and "virality" genius Jonah Peretti and his team figured out how to connect with a mostly disaffected young audience through their emotions – at the "beating heart of the internet." They pioneered a new business model – native advertising – and by the end of 2011, BuzzFeed had "pivoted" to original news reporting, beefing up its reporting staff with a goal of being taken seriously.
Vice started out as a print lads mag constantly pushing the bounds of bad taste in the quest to be "edgy," which led to such outrages as "The Racist Issue." In 2017, Vice's 18 hours of footage of the deadly Charlottesville, Va., Unite the Right rally garnered a total of 50 million views and became the "defining image" of the violence, Abramson says.
Non-journalists may find "Merchants" dense and complicated, with something surprising or infuriating on every page. Journalists working today already know in their guts most of what Abramson is reporting, if not in the depressing detail she presents.
Abramson earns three stars for her thoroughness and insights, but this is not a beach read, and certainly not a happy read. Unless, of course, you believe journalists are the enemy of the people.
Jill Abramson and "Merchants of Truth" are facing charges of plagiarism.

'Despot' don is under fire; N.Y. Times shows lies, attack on free press

Texto completo: He's picking on the wrong old gray lady.
The ongoing war of words between President Trump and The New York Times reached a fever pitch Wednesday, with both sides slinging insults as they argued over one of the fundamental principles of American democracy: the rights of the free press.
The commander-in-chief set off the fiery exchange with one of his most inflammatory anti-media insults - this one prompted by yet another damning news story about his administration in The Times.
"The New York Times reporting is false. They are a true ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!" Trump tweeted as part of a chain of media-hating morning posts.
Times publisher A.G. Sulzberger quickly hit back - branding Trump as a "reckless" despot for continuing to use the ugly phrase to demean and diminish news coverage he doesn't like, and at a time when violence against journalism is on the rise globally.
"The phrase 'enemy of the people' is not just false, it's dangerous," Sulzberger said. "As I have repeatedly told President Trump face to face, there are mounting signs that this incendiary rhetoric is encouraging threats and violence against journalists at home and abroad."
The assertive public push-back came after the President attacked The Times for reporting Tuesday that he had asked acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker to put a political ally in charge of the federal investigation into Trump's ex-lawyer Michael Cohen last year.
The Times cited interviews with dozens of current and former U.S. officials to back up the allegation that raises serious questions of whether the President tried to obstruct a criminal investigation he has a direct stake in.
And when Trump falsely claimed in another tweet that the "dishonest" newspaper didn't reach out to the White House for comment on the bombshell piece, The Times communications teams didn't hesitate to slap him down.
"The White House was given 5 days to respond to the details of our investigation," the comms team's Twitter handle responded directly to Trump's post. "The Times followed up multiple times but no response was given on the record until the President addressed the story after its publication."
Trump's love-hate relationship with the press has been on full display since the very earliest days of his 2016 presidential campaign - and it's only grown more heated since he took up residence in the Oval Office.
At times, he's openly derided reporters at press conferences, grown combative when urged to answer questions, threatened to revoke credentials, and told journalists to sit down and shut up - and heckled the mainstream press in general as being the mouthpiece of "fake news." Only Fox News host Sean Hannity, conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh and other media that show support for his policies earn presidential praise.
At rallies, Trump frequently elicits cheers from the audience by mocking the press. He's referred to journalists as "sick people," questioned their patriotism and said they are trying "to take away our history and our heritage."
"I really think they don't like our country," he said at one rally in 2017 - remarks that were highlighted by The Times.
Sulzberger on Wednesday blasted Trump's constant raging at the press for doing its job, saying the President's inflammatory insults and "enemy of the people" attitude was a dangerous throwback to dark times.
"It has an ugly history of being wielded by dictators and tyrants who sought to control public information," Sulzberger said Wednesday. "And it is particularly reckless coming from someone whose office gives him broad powers to fight or imprison the nation's enemies."
Former Presidents Thomas Jefferson, John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan were all committed to the idea that "a free press was essential to democracy," Sulzberger added

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
For nearly five months, Joe Coscarelli and Melena Ryzik, culture reporters for The New York Times, collected accounts from dozens of sources, who detailed troubling behavior by Ryan Adams, the Grammy Award-nominated singer-songwriter. They outlined a spectrum of inappropriate acts, including emotional abuse of romantic partners and explicit text-message and video-chat exchanges with a minor Mr. Adams never met in person.
In response to The Times's investigation, several high-profile artists who had worked with Mr. Adams reacted online.
Karen Elson, the model and musician, wrote on Instagram, "I also had a traumatizing experience with Ryan Adams." (She later deleted the post.) Todd Wisenbaker, a guitarist who has worked extensively with Mr. Adams, posted a statement on Instagram with the caption: "This is incredibly hard for me to do, but Ryan, please get help." The pop star Mandy Moore, who was once married to Mr. Adams, repeated her own allegations against him on Marc Maron's "WTF" podcast.
"We've seen a number of musicians or people who are in that world say, yes, I've had a bad experience with Ryan Adams," said Ms. Ryzik. In the days since the article ran on Feb. 13, the reporters said they have received at least a dozen additional direct tips.
On Feb. 14, the F.B.I. opened an inquiry into whether Mr. Adams's communications with the underage fan constitute a crime. Through his lawyer, he has denied the allegations.
Mr. Coscarelli and Ms. Ryzik started their reporting after two nearly simultaneous events early last October: a discussion with a source who alluded to misconduct by a musician who turned out to be Mr. Adams, and an anonymous tip delivered through The Times's tip line that suggested looking into his treatment of women.
Mr. Coscarelli and Ms. Ryzik reached out to women known to have dated or otherwise been associated with Mr. Adams -- touring with him as a supporting act, for example.
With the women who had firsthand experiences and decided that they may want to come forward as sources, "the initial interview was always an hour and a half long, at a minimum," Ms. Ryzik said.
Over the next few months, they were in contact with those women multiple times, making several trips to Los Angeles and Ohio to speak with them in person. In some cases, sources put them in touch with other women who had stories to share. There were, Mr. Coscarelli said, "many official interviews and then hundreds of texts, emails, check-ins, quick phone calls." In the days after publication, Ms. Ryzik estimated that she had texted with Ms. Moore six times.
As they listened to the women's experiences and gathered corroborating information from other sources, they discovered certain patterns of behavior. In relationships, Mr. Adams could be controlling: insisting that one partner, the musician Phoebe Bridgers, prove her whereabouts, for example, and threatening suicide if a woman didn't respond to his messages immediately. In the case of the young woman who was a teenager when she developed a texting relationship with Mr. Adams, several details stuck out as especially disturbing: video calls on Skype in which he exposed himself; nicknames for her body parts.
Mr. Coscarelli and Ms. Ryzik have worked on several articles about sexual abuse, separately and together. One thing they've learned about addressing such a delicate subject is that the women involved know their experiences best. "They know what the most damaging and damning parts of their accounts are," Ms. Ryzik said. "If something sticks out to them as, 'This really shows what the problem is,' then that's the kind of detail that you want in the story."
It has been more than 500 days since The New York Times published its first article detailing the film producer Harvey Weinstein's yearslong record of sexual harassment and assault allegations. The reporting set off a sea change both for Mr. Weinstein, who was arrested last May and is awaiting trial, and for culture at large. The #MeToo movement has unseated titans in industries including media, restaurants, politics and business, in many cases as a direct result of Times reporting that has continued to expose abuses of power and created ripple effects for those involved.
One reason Mr. Coscarelli and Ms. Ryzik, as well as their editors, Caryn Ganz and Ian Trontz, felt the Ryan Adams story was important to tell was it provided a window into the complicated power arrangements that undergird the world of pop music. "The music industry isn't like Hollywood; it doesn't operate in the same kind of power structure," Ms. Ganz said. "An artist can wield just as much power as a large executive; it's just a matter of their influence and connections."
Mr. Coscarelli said the Ryan Adams case is an example of a complex spectrum of behavior that includes subtler abuses of power that have been harder to document -- but are much more common.
"I think as we're moving into Year 2 of #MeToo reporting, often it's not the R. Kellys and the Harvey Weinsteins of the world," he said, referring to two men who have been accused of rape or sexual abuse by many women, "but people who are abusing their power in more complex, but equally pernicious ways."

Texto completo: There are three things Marc Martel says he won't do to impersonate Freddie Mercury. He won't wear Mercury's trademark yellow jacket. He won't go onstage wielding Mercury's favored half microphone stand. And he won't grow a full mustache.
Here's the one thing Martel needs to do: open his mouth. Through genetics and musical aptitude, the 42-year-old singer is a vocal doppelgänger for the Queen frontman. That's a gift that has led Martel, formerly the leader of a Christian band in Canada, to a lucrative second career in recent years -- and a prominent but invisible role in "Bohemian Rhapsody," the hit biopic nominated for five Academy Awards at the Oscars on Sunday. It's not the life Martel planned, but it's landed him on "American Idol" and in front of crowds of thousands worldwide. "I keep realizing how weird a situation I'm in," Martel said in a phone interview. "I'm trying to keep a good head about it."
Rami Malek embodies Mercury onscreen, but as he told The New York Times last year, "No one wants to hear me sing." During the performance sequences in "Bohemian Rhapsody," the movie sometimes employs Mercury's actual vocals from the Queen archives, but that wasn't always practical -- some scenes demanded a stunt vocal-cord performer.
[Relive one of Freddie Mercury's great moments: when Queen took "Bohemian Rhapsody" to Live Aid.]
The film's creators have conceded that the sung vocals in the movie are largely by Mercury and Martel, although they haven't broken down the specifics of who contributed what; doing so might distract from Malek's performance. Martel, who received a fleeting "additional vocals" billing, acknowledged that he worked on the movie, but citing his nondisclosure agreement, would not go into detail. That leaves him with a ghostly status much like that of Marni Nixon, who provided the singing voices both of Maria in the movie of "West Side Story" (for Natalie Wood) and Eliza in the movie of "My Fair Lady" (for Audrey Hepburn), without credit.
Even though Martel doesn't get the awards-show glamour that Malek is enjoying, he's proud of his contributions to "Bohemian Rhapsody." The first time he saw it wasn't at a red-carpet event: He caught it in Cool Springs, Tenn., with his wife and manager, wearing "our comfy clothes." He had wanted to enjoy the movie as a spectator, but "I couldn't help waiting for the next scene where I was going to hear my own voice," he said. So the Martels bought out a movie theater showing, invited 80 of their closest friends and treated it like a party.
Martel grew up in Montreal listening to pop (George Michael was a favorite) and Christian music (his parents worked at a church as pastor and choir director). All he knew of Queen was the scene in the 1992 comedy "Wayne's World" where the characters rock out to "Bohemian Rhapsody" in an AMC Pacer.
He started a Christian rock band called Downhere with some friends in college; in 2001, they signed a record deal and moved to Nashville. He believes that the first person to tell him he sounded like Freddie Mercury was the Downhere bassist Glenn Lavender. It was a compliment, given how Mercury was one of the great singers in rock history, possessing a pellucid tone, a three-octave range and an operatic quality that could make even paeans to bicycle riding sound emotional. But Martel didn't initially take it as praise.
"That's cool -- I sound unoriginal," he recalled thinking. But he checked out Queen's greatest hits, hoping to learn something from Mercury (who died in 1991 of AIDS-related pneumonia): "I never thought it would amount to anything more than a fun karaoke trick."
In 2011, however, with Downhere having run its course after seven studio albums, Martel heard that the Queen drummer Roger Taylor was putting together an authorized tribute band called the Queen Extravaganza and won a spot on vocals with an audition video of "Somebody to Love" that went viral.
[Video: My "Somebody To Love" audition Watch on YouTube.]
Martel sounds close enough to Mercury that he can itemize the subtle differences: "I'm not British, so I don't usually sing with an accent. I don't have extra teeth like he did, so my Ss come out normally -- his were very piercing," he said. "But even if I don't try to sing like Freddie Mercury, people still hear him in my voice, no matter what I do. I have this weird unique thing where I can sound like him, so why wouldn't I?"
Martel now steadily tours with his own Ultimate Queen Celebration and also does shows with the Black Jacket Symphony and Symphonic Queen. He said the Queen catalog has made him a better singer and inspired him to take better care of his voice -- while he felt comfortable backing off a high note in one of his own songs when necessary, he doesn't like to disappoint Queen fans who expect to hear a song the way they know it from the radio.
Last year he released an album of Queen covers, "Thunderbolt & Lightning," and his YouTube covers of Queen classics have become popular enough that he finds himself recognized in public -- especially outside the United States, which was never the band's biggest market. Martel, who has concerts booked in 14 countries this year, from Ukraine to New Zealand, notes that American crowds generally don't know the arm movements and clapping that traditionally accompany "Radio Ga Ga," while international audiences will do it unprompted.
Although Queen has been a part of his life for nearly a decade, Martel is still figuring out "what being a tribute artist means," he said. "For some reason, there's a stigma around it." A little defensively, he cited Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley and classical musicians as interpreters of other people's work. Martel records an annual Christmas EP and still writes songs, but he doesn't currently have an outlet for them; he dreams of a day when he can throw just one original into a set of Queen covers.
He recalled a recent conversation with his manager, who told him, "I'd like you to consider your songwriting the way I view my golf game -- I love playing golf, but it's not what's paying the bills right now." That was hard for Martel to hear, but he ultimately accepted its wisdom.
"The next five years, there's going to be a lot of Queen," he said, and chuckled. "But at the same time, I'm going to work on my golf game."

GOP hire at CNN is even worse than it appears

Texto completo: A few months before the 2016 presidential election, Sarah Isgur tweeted some advice to Donald Trump: "The only 3 words that should be coming out of Donald Trump's mouth this week are: 'Clinton' 'foundation' 'emails.' "
But that kind of helpful counsel wasn't enough.
In early 2017, Isgur was summoned to meet with President Trump in the Oval Office, where she needed to pledge her loyalty to be named the Justice Department's spokeswoman by Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
Now CNN has hired Isgur - who has no journalism experience and once slammed her new employer as the "Clinton News Network" - as a political editor.
The network, under heavy fire for the move, was insisting by Tuesday night that she wouldn't be directing political coverage, although that surely is what a political editor might be expected to do.
Isgur is helping to "coordinate coverage across TV and Digital," a spokesman told Vox, and will be "making sure that stories are featured on the right shows and articles get posted online at the right time."
That sounds a lot like damage control.
But why CNN made this move to begin with is the deeper and more troubling question.
It strongly suggests that the network's big thinkers - including head honcho Jeff Zucker - are aiming for a kind of false fairness: a defensive, both-sides-are-equal kind of political coverage that inevitably fails to serve the voting public.
This approach is not guided by what's good for citizens, but by a ratings-first effort to position the network in the middle of Fox News Channel on the right and MSNBC on the left.
That could be an interesting and even useful place to be if it were done right.
If CNN could be truly fair-minded - thoughtfully impartial - it could serve a purpose in the campaign ahead. It could be one of the places you'd turn if you wanted to get the straight story on complex or contentious issues, away from the hyperpartisan cacophony.
But this move signals that no such thing will happen - or is even sought.
If you're trying to deepen understanding, bridge the divide or do excellent journalism, this is one of the last moves you'd make.
As Columbia University journalism professor Bill Grueskin told me Tuesday, Isgur's lack of journalistic expertise caused him to wonder "if Jeff Zucker would ever have brain surgery performed by a dentist."
"Have the media learned anything since 2016?" is a question I often hear from the hopeful and the righteous. I've asked it myself many times.
But to learn something, news organizations - with CNN toward the top of the list of offenders - would have to recognize that they need to learn something.
But no.
This is the same CNN, under the same leadership, that in 2016 hired the bullying and ultra-partisan Corey Lewandowski as a commentator after Trump fired him as campaign manager.
It's the same CNN that this month inexplicably and foolishly gave Starbucks founder Howard Schultz a prime-time "town hall" event to promote his scattered notions of a run as an independent 2020 presidential candidate.
That Trump has spent the past two years mocking and endangering CNN's journalistic staff makes Isgur's hiring even more incomprehensible - and insulting.
Of course, as many have pointed out, there has long been a revolving door between politics and the news media. William Safire went from Richard Nixon aide to New York Times columnist. George Stephanopoulos, once a strategist and spokesman for Bill Clinton, is the host of "This Week," ABC's Sunday morning news show. And CBS last year named former Republican operative Caitlin Conant to the powerful role of political director.
That doesn't make it right.
"Let's build the industry (and world) that we want, not blindly accept current realities," as Washington Post national reporter Wesley Lowery pointedly put it on Twitter. "I'd like a world where partisan hacks aren't laundered into journalism via our newsrooms."
At a time when so many talented and experienced journalists are out of work because of layoffs in a teetering industry, this makes even less sense. There are countless better choices out there.
Far from being reformed from a time when it aired Trump rallies live during the 2016 primary season and let the candidate call in by phone to comment on this and that, CNN seems to be doubling down on a ratings-first, fair-in-name-only approach to politics.
That's a shame and - as an extraordinarily consequential election approaches - it's dangerous.
To its credit, CNN has plenty of high-performing reporters and editors.
What it lacks is a public-spirited mission, articulated at the highest level and backed up with every hire and decision.

Trump Escalates Attacks on The New York Times, Calling It a 'True Enemy of the People'

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — President Trump on Wednesday took direct aim at The New York Times, calling the news organization a “true ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE," in an escalation from his previous lashings, which were typically addressed to a group of news organizations or over specific Times articles.
Trump did not cite a specific article in his Twitter post, but his declaration came a day after The Times published a report describing how he had tried to influence and undermine investigations surrounding him, his presidential campaign, and his administration.
Trump has long denigrated American news outlets that in his view deliver less-than-favorable reports.
The president has periodically returned to that expression during moments of peak criticism. But Wednesday's denigration went a step further, suggesting that The Times reporting, across the board, was not to be trusted and was done to the detriment of Americans.
The Times' publisher, A.G. Sulzberger, in a statement cited previous presidents of both political parties who not only championed the free press, but said it was a crucial foundation of a free society.
“But in demonizing the free press as the enemy, simply for performing its role of asking difficult questions and bringing uncomfortable information to light, President Trump is retreating from a distinctly American principle," Sulzberger said.
The Times also defended the article about Trump, which it said “was rigorously reported and based on a review of confidential White House documents as well as interviews with dozens of current and former government officials and others close to President Trump."
A Times reporter contacted the White House about the article on Friday, days before it was published, and continued to press for comment over the following days.
New York Times
SOUTH PORTLAND, Maine — Senator Susan Collins said Wednesday that she would vote for a congressional resolution disapproving of President Trump's emergency declaration to build a wall on the southern US border, becoming the first Republican senator to publicly express support for such a measure.
The lawmaker from Maine said she would vote for a resolution as long as it focused only on the declaration.
The president's action "completely undermines" the role of Congress and is of "dubious constitutionality," she said, while attending a Coast Guard ceremony.
"If it's a 'clean' disapproval resolution, I will support it," she said.
Trump declared an emergency last week to obtain funding for the wall beyond the $1.4 billion Congress approved for border security. Trump's use of the emergency declaration has drawn bipartisan criticism, and 16 states have filed a lawsuit against the declaration.
"I do support the lawsuit that was filed by the states. That may be the quickest way to get an injunction that would halt this transfer of funds," she said.
Collins spoke at the Coast Guard facility in South Portland, where high-ranking officials were celebrating an upgraded command center for northern New England.
All told, $2.3 million was spent on upgrades to the 1,100-square-foot command center with new communication equipment, electronics, and generators to help the Coast Guard respond to maritime distress calls.
Noting that Coast Guard personnel went without pay during the recent government shutdown, Collins said she cosponsored legislation to ensure that the Coast Guard will never again be the only uniformed military branch that is not paid under such circumstances.

WASHINGTON — In the 24 hours since launching his second presidential bid, Bernie Sanders has raised roughly $6 million, announced a campaign manager — and drawn the notice of President Trump.
The independent senator from Vermont, who built a deep stable of low-dollar donors during his 2016 campaign, touted his fund-raising haul in a Wednesday morning tweet, in which he claimed 225,000 contributors since making his new bid official Tuesday morning.
There will be no official record of early campaign donations for several weeks.
In morning tweets Wednesday, Trump also greeted Sanders' entry into the contest.
"Crazy Bernie has just entered the race. I wish him well!" Trump said, using the same nickname he used to deride Sanders when he sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016.
Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, responded on Twitter shortly afterward.
"What's crazy is that we have a president who is a racist, a sexist, a xenophobe and a fraud," he wrote. "We are going to bring people together and not only defeat Trump but transform the economic and political life of this country."
Sanders announced his second White House bid Tuesday.

Texto completo: BY JUANA SUMMERS
The Associated Press
WASHINGTON - Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said Tuesday that he will seek the Democratic presidential nomination again, a decision that will test whether he can still generate the progressive energy that fueled his insurgent 2016 campaign.
"Our campaign is not only about defeating Donald Trump," the 77-year-old self-described democratic socialist said in an email to supporters. "Our campaign is about transforming our country and creating a government based on the principles of economic, social, racial and environmental justice."
An enthusiastic progressive who embraces proposals such as "Medicare-for-all" and free college tuition, Sanders stunned the Democratic establishment in 2016 with his spirited challenge to Hillary Clinton. While she ultimately became the party's nominee, his campaign helped lay the groundwork for the leftward lurch that has dominated Democratic politics in the Trump era.
The question now for Sanders is whether he can stand out in a crowded field of Democratic presidential candidates who also embrace many of his policy ideas and who are newer to the national political stage. That's far different from 2016, when he was Clinton's lone progressive adversary.
Still, there is no question that Sanders will be a formidable contender for the Democratic nomination. He won more than 13 million votes in 2016 and dozens of primaries and caucuses. He opens his campaign with a nationwide organization and a proven small-dollar fundraising effort.
"We're gonna win," Sanders told CBS.
He said he was going to launch "what I think is unprecedented in modern American history": a grassroots movement "to lay the groundwork for transforming the economic and political life of this country."
Sanders described his new White House bid as a "continuation of what we did in 2016," noting that policies he advocated for then are now embraced by the Democratic Party.
Trump told reporters that Sanders ran a great campaign in 2016 but that he believes the senator "missed his time."
"I like Bernie," Trump said, noting Sanders' criticism of free trade. "The problem is he doesn't know what to do about it. We're doing something very spectacular on trade."
Sanders goes into the campaign with several advantages, including the name recognition he earned from his last run. In a sign of the enthusiasm surrounding his campaign, Sanders raised $4 million on Tuesday from nearly 150,000 individual donors.
California Sen. Kamala Harris raised $1.5 million in the first 24 hours of her campaign. She was previously the biggest fundraiser in the race.
Sanders could also be well-positioned to compete in the nation's first primary in neighboring New Hampshire, which he won by 22 points in 2016. But he won't have the state to himself.
Harris was in New Hampshire on Monday and said she'd compete for the state. She also appeared to take a dig at Sanders.
"The people of New Hampshire will tell me what's required to compete in New Hampshire," she told shoppers at a bookstore in Concord. "But I will tell you I'm not a democratic socialist."
Sen. Elizabeth Warren of nearby Massachusetts will be in New Hampshire on Friday.
One of the biggest questions surrounding Sanders' candidacy is how he'll compete against someone like Warren, who shares many of his policy goals. Warren has already launched her campaign and has planned an aggressive swing through the early primary states.
Shortly after announcing her exploratory committee, Warren hired Brendan Summers, who managed Sanders' 2016 Iowa campaign. Other staffers from Sanders' first bid also have said they would consider working for other candidates in 2020.
The crowded field includes other candidates who will likely make strong appeals to the Democratic base including Harris and Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York. The field could grow, with a number of high-profile Democrats still considering presidential bids, including former Vice President Joe Biden and former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke.
While Sanders had been working to lay the groundwork for a second campaign for months, it was unclear whether he will be able to expand his appeal beyond his largely white base of supporters. In 2016, Sanders notably struggled to garner support from black voters, an issue that could become particularly pervasive during a primary race with several nonwhite candidates.
Last month, he joined Booker at an event in Columbia, South Carolina, marking Martin Luther King Jr. Day. In 2016, Sanders lost the South Carolina primary, which features a heavily black electorate, by 47 points.
Sanders also faces different pressures in the #MeToo era. Some of his male staffers and supporters in 2016 were described as "Bernie bros" for their treatment of women.
In the run-up to Sanders' 2020 announcement, persistent allegations emerged of sexual harassment of women by male staffers during his 2016 campaign. Politico and The New York Times reported several allegations of unwanted sexual advances and pay inequity.
In an interview with CNN after the initial allegations surfaced, Sanders apologized but also noted he was "a little busy running around the country trying to make the case."
As additional allegations emerged, he offered a more unequivocal apology.
"What they experienced was absolutely unacceptable and certainly not what a progressive campaign - or any campaign - should be about," Sanders said Jan. 10 on Capitol Hill. "Every woman in this country who goes to work today or tomorrow has the right to make sure that she is working in an environment which is free of harassment, which is safe and is comfortable, and I will do my best to make that happen."

Texto completo: PHILADELPHIA - The U.S. Supreme Court announced Tuesday that it will not consider a defamation case involving Bill Cosby. But the announcement came with a twist: Justice Clarence Thomas called for a reconsideration of the nation's libel laws.
Kathrine McKee, one of the dozens of women who have accused Cosby of sexual assault or sexual misconduct, had asked the Supreme Court to review her case, in which she said Cosby's lawyer damaged her reputation in a letter after she publicly accused Cosby of raping her. Lower courts dismissed her case because they found that by disclosing her allegations against Cosby to the media, she had become a public figure. That "public figure" distinction makes it harder to sue for defamation.
Thomas, in a 14-page opinion issued Tuesday, agreed with the court's decision not to take McKee's case. But he used it as an opportunity to call for a review of libel standards for public figures.
In a landmark 1964 case, New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, the Supreme Court ruled that public figures must prove that a statement about them was made with "actual malice," or a disregard for whether it is false, in order to succeed in defamation cases.
McKee was unable to prove actual malice so her case could not proceed, Thomas wrote. But Thomas said the court should question this precedent and suggested the justices should, with a different case, reconsider New York Times Co. v. Sullivan.
"We should carefully examine the original meaning of the First and Fourteenth Amendments," Thomas wrote. "If the Constitution does not require public figures to satisfy an actual-malice standard in state law defamation suits, then neither should we."
President Donald Trump, who often complains about the media, has called for changing libel laws. On Sunday, he complained in a tweet about "Saturday Night Live" and said it is "very unfair and should be looked into" that television shows can get away with mocking Republicans. In September, he suggested directly in a tweet that libel laws should be changed.
The 1964 case involved a paid advertisement printed in the New York Times that supported the civil rights movement and alleged that the movement faced terror from police in Alabama. L.B. Sullivan, the commissioner of public affairs in Montgomery, Alabama, sued the newspaper and alleged that the statements were made against him because he supervised the police department. The Supreme Court ultimately ruled that public officials cannot collect damages for defamation unless they can prove that false statements made about them were made with "actual malice" or a reckless disregard for the truth.
"We did not begin meddling in this area until 1964, nearly 175 years after the First Amendment was ratified," Thomas wrote. "The states are perfectly capable of striking an acceptable balance between encouraging robust public discourse and providing a meaningful remedy for reputational harm. We should reconsider our jurisprudence in this area."
Thomas' opinion notes little about Cosby, who is serving a three- to 10-year sentence in state prison for assaulting Andrea Constand at his Cheltenham, Pennsylvania, home in 2004.
The case involving McKee was one of several legal battles the actor has faced. Several of the dozens of women have accused him of sexual misconduct have sued him for defamation; he has sued others. In October, the Supreme Court denied a petition from Cosby's lawyers involving a defamation suit brought by Janice Dickinson, a supermodel and one of Cosby's most famous accusers. Dickinson was one of five women who testified last year in addition to Constand at Cosby's trial in Montgomery County Court.

The rest of the world is finally catching on to this Indian staple

Texto completo: Ghee has been around for millennia, and it's hailed as a 'superfood'
The very first solid food my mother fed me as a baby in our southern India household was mashed-up rice mixed with a little ghee. This set the stage for my lifelong love affair with this nutty, rich, golden clarified butter.
In recent years, ghee has become a global phenomenon, trending as a "superfood" and beloved by followers of the popular Keto diet. But its history - real and legendary - is long.
Ghee originated in India, where the heat was not conducive to storing butter for long periods. But when that butter was clarified - heated until the water evaporates and the milk solids separate away - the product had a long shelf life. For thousands of years, ghee has been featured in Indian recipes, and even in Hindu mythology, which attributes its origins to the divine. The story goes that Prajapati, lord of the creatures, rubbed his hands together to create the first ghee, which he then poured into flames to create his offspring. As a result, ghee is poured into sacred fires by Hindus to this day, a practice thought to be auspicious for marriages, funerals and other ceremonies.
It was also extensively consumed as part of a balanced diet. Ancient Sanskrit literature describes ghee as fit for the gods. Foods cooked in ghee are considered superior to those that eschew it; Vedic cooking divided all food into kacha khana (food not cooked in ghee) and pucca khana (food cooked in ghee). Modern Indian cooking no longer differentiates in this way, but the practice is carried on in religious ceremonies and cooking for festivals such as the Hindu festival called Navratri.
Ghee has also been venerated through the ages for its medicinal properties in Ayurvedic medicine, which prescribes it as a cooling food (it lowers the body's temperature), as a digestive aid, and even as a salve to soothe burns. In "A Historical Dictionary of Indian Food," K.T. Achaya writes that ghee is "strengthening, aids digestion, and acts quite powerfully on the mind, improving the memory and intellect." That's not all. Ghee is also high in butyrate, which reduces inflammation in the body, and it is also rich in vitamin A. It is also perfect for people who are lactose intolerant because hardly any of the butter's lactose or casein remains.
Gone are the days when ghee was thought to clog up arteries, and gone are the unhealthy trans fats that tried - and failed - to replace it.
The United States has a particularly amusing history with ghee. In the 1950s, upon discovering that American dairy farmers had more than 260 million pounds of surplus butter, the government had a novel idea: Convert the butter into ghee, and offload it onto the Indian subcontinent, where millions of people adore the stuff.
The government took this prospect so seriously that dairy expert Louis H. Burgwald was dispatched to India, where he dutifully peddled the American ghee and got merchants to sample his wares. The first lesson that he learned was that tastes for ghee varied across the length and breadth of the subcontinent. The ghee preferred in the south and the west (ghee made from the milk of cows) varied vastly from the ghee preferred in the north and the east (ghee made from buffalo milk). Burgwald was enthusiastic, though, and reported back to his bosses that if regional tastes could be catered to, then the Indian subcontinent was ripe for the picking. Eventually, nothing came of the undertaking.
In a 1955 article in the New York Times headlined "Ghee is for good," veteran writer R.K. Narayan waxed lyrical about its bountiful delights. "Ghee is, no doubt, clarified butter," Narayan wrote, "but it is also something more, in the same way that wine is more than the juice of a squeezed grape. Ghee is like a genius born to a dull parent." He calls the invention of ghee the subcontinent's highest achievement.
Today, ghee is widely available, both online and in stores. Without the milk solids of butter, it can be used for frying and other high-heat cooking. Use the ghee as you would use any fat: roast vegetables with it; slather it onto meat to baste; fry eggs with it. You can even stir it into your coffee (for that trendy "bulletproof" approach) or your morning porridge (which I love to do). Refrigerate your ghee if you like, but it's not a requirement and will keep at room temperature; it will solidify in the fridge but melt at room temperature or when heated.
To make your own, the same way I do at home, here's how to achieve pure golden, slightly nutty ghee:
Heat a pound of unsalted organic butter (preferably made from the milk of grass-fed cows) in a heavy-bottomed pot over low heat without stirring. Be patient. Eventually, the butter will begin to simmer and make a slight crackling sound.
After about 20 minutes, the crackling will stop, and there will be a thin layer of fat on top and heavier solids at the bottom of the pan. Watch the ghee very carefully to make sure that it doesn't burn. The butter should be a clear golden color on top, with very few air bubbles on the surface. At this point the ghee is done, and you can toss a handful of fresh curry leaves into it if you'd like.
Turn off the heat and allow it to sit for an hour, then strain it carefully into a clean, dry, airtight container. The sediment at the bottom can be discarded, but the foam on top is okay.
Store away from light and heat for three months, or refrigerated for up to a year - although in my experience ghee never lasts that long.

Bernie Sanders' real significance isn't progressive policy; it's empowerment for the alienated

Texto completo: “Medicare for all,” "free college," and a $15 minimum wage may come to mind when you think of Bernie Sanders, who just jumped in the 2020 race for the White House.

But these progressive policies weren’t the fuel that carried Sanders to his astonishing success against Hillary Clinton three years ago. The Bernie 2016 phenomenon wasn’t about a socialist wish list as much as it was about political empowerment.

“Real change,” Sanders says at the beginning of his 2020 campaign launch video, “never takes place from the top on down, but always from the bottom on up.”

That wasn’t a mere introduction to his policy proposals. It’s the heart of what Sanders offers: a promise to give political power to people who feel they have none. Sanders is pledging to fight not only inequality, racism, and climate change, but the underlying problem of disenfranchisement and political alienation.

“If this campaign is about anything,” Sanders said at a New Hampshire rally in 2016, “it is about revitalizing American democracy — making sure that every American knows how powerful he or she is to determine the future of this great country.”

This resonated with his base. "His message from the beginning," Sanders delegate Tascha Van Auken told me at the Philadelphia convention, "is that no matter who is elected, the important part is that the grassroots becomes more active and builds networks, and builds a movement ... "

This is why new campaign finance restrictions and overturning the Citizens United Supreme Court decision were at the heart of Sanders' revolution.

As a libertarian-leaning conservative, I don’t put much stake in campaign finance restrictions. But I came to appreciate what the Sanders folks wanted: They were desperately seeking a voice and some power in politics.

It’s easy to dismiss these folks as big government liberal busy-bodies, but there’s a more charitable reading:

Man is a political animal. Men and women live out their potential not only by running their own lives, but also by shaping the world around them. Modern America has left so many people — particularly young adults and the working class — impotent to shape the world around them.

We are far less connected to the institutions through which Americans used to exercise their political muscles. About 44 percent of all Americans are not active in any sort of religious, civic, hobby, athletic, neighborhood, or volunteer organization, according to a new survey by the American Enterprise Institute.

Other Democrats try to tap into the same sentiment. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., like Sanders, says the system is rigged in America today. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., promises to be a warrior “for the people” who lack one.

But the politician who best tapped into alienation in recent years — even better than Sanders — was Donald Trump. Sometimes spinning conspiracy theories to cast his opponents as illegitimate, sometimes pointing out fairly, like Sanders, how special interests have too much power in Washington, Trump rallied the alienated behind him in the GOP primaries, and then in the general election. (My new book, Alienated America , makes this argument at length.)

Conservatives early on were put off by Trump's strongman-type promises, which were based on the premise that the president could “bring back” the American dream. Sanders has even grander visions, even more likely to undermine his overarching goal of empowering the disenfranchised.

You cannot empower regular people by empowering the central government. A powerful central government empowers the well-connected, who can afford the best revolving-door lobbyists. It strips power away from the local and voluntary institutions where ordinary individuals can actually have influence.

Sanders endorses a $15 minimum wage, and in his campaign video he points out that Amazon has embraced that wage. So he must understand that imposing such a wage on all employers would crush the mom and pop shops that form a part of cohesive neighborhoods, replacing them with alienating leviathans.

“The great paradox of progressive populism,” New York Times columnist David Brooks wrote aptly, in response to the "Green New Deal" that Sanders endorses, “is that it leads to elitism in its purist form.”

Truly "revitalizing American democracy," to use Sanders' phrase, requires restoring the active civic life where the regular guy and gal can have actual influence.

Sanders’ policy proposals are as far left as the rest of the Democratic vanguard. But at bottom, his overarching message and mission is one that conservatives — especially those who want to learn a lesson from Trump’s win — must take to heart: A real, healthy populism centers on returning power to an alienated people.

Kaiser Permanente to open medical school in Pasadena, offer free tuition for first classes in 2020

Texto completo: Kaiser Permanente is opening a hospital-run school of medicine in Pasadena, announcing Tuesday, Feb. 19 it would waive tuition for its first five graduating classes in an attempt to jump-start medical careers minus the typical crushing student debt.
The Kaiser Permanente School of Medicine said it has received preliminary accreditation and will begin accepting applications from prospective students in June for admission in the summer of 2020.
This will be a unique learning institution for Kaiser, which plans to waive all tuition for the full four years of school at its campus at 98 S. Los Robles Ave. Those classes — with 48 students each — will run from 2020 through 2024.
Tuition would typically cost $55,000 a year, saving each student $275,000.
“This is primarily about making sure all students, regardless of backgrounds, aren’t deterred from pursuing a career in medicine due to the prospect of going into massive debt,” said Kaiser spokesman Vincent Staupe. “This is also about wanting students to be able to choose a medical specialty that they are truly passionate about, rather than choosing one based solely off financial need.”
Kaiser hopes the strategy will prompt more students to pursue lower-paying specialties in the primary care field, or work in under-served areas since they wouldn’t be burdened with overwhelming debt.
The school will use a “small-group, case-based medical curriculum” that are designed to prepare future physicians to become collaborative leaders committed to prevention, fluent in data-driven care and adept at addressing the needs of under-served patients and communities.
Dr. Mark A. Schuster, the school’s founding dean and CEO, said the health care giant is developing a school committed to providing “outstanding patient care in our nation’s complex and evolving health care system.”
The school said it has recruited a diverse group of leaders with vast health care experience who, in turn, created a curriculum that includes three academic pillars — foundational science, clinical science and health systems science.
The school’s clinical education will take place primarily in Kaiser Permanente hospitals and clinics in the greater Los Angeles area and in partnered community health centers.
Other medical schools at universities have taken steps recently to decrease their students’ financial burden. Columbia University, for example, is using a $250 million gift for a new endowment that will fund a range of scholarships and grants meant to ensure none of its medical students incur debt.
About three-quarters of medical school students graduate with debt, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges; members of the 2017 graduating class who had debt reported a median amount of $192,000.
Kaiser’s medical school has received preliminary accreditation from the Liaison Committee on Medical Education, a different process than usual because, unlike the universities that open medical schools, it is not already a degree-granting institution.
The New York Times contributed to this report.

Texto completo: PASADENA, Calif. - Amazon's"Transparent" wrapped the show's finale on Feb. 8, a one-shot movie musical that will debut on Prime later this year. Star Jeffrey Tambor was fired from the series after allegations of sexual harassment. Showrunner Jill Soloway would not deny that Mr. Tambor's Maura Pfefferman has been recast ("I just want you to see the movie, and there are few surprises in there; we dealt with that question") or confirm that the character will be killed off but suggested the movie finale is about "loss."
Amazon renewed"Jack Ryan" for a third season; season two arrives later this year.
No news on when the long-gestating Amazon "Lord of the Rings" series may see the light of day, but there are now social handles for the project (LOTRonPrime on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram).
Amazon Studios co-head of television Vernon Sanders said he is "hopeful" sci-fi drama "The Expanse," which moves from Syfy to Amazon for its fourth season, will debut its new season before the end of the year (any delay would likely be due to extensive special effects work).
New York Times best-seller "The Power" by British author Naomi Alderman - teenage girls in the world develop the power to electrocute people - will become an Amazon series.
Jennifer Salke, head of Amazon Studios, said Matthew Weiner's "The Romanoffs" was always designed to be a one-season show, so a second season seems unlikely, but Amazon continues to talk with Mr. Weiner about future projects.
Amazon's "Good Omens," based on the book by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman, will debut all six episodes on May 31. Mr. Gaiman revealed Benedict Cumberbatch will play Satan in the story of an angel (Michael Sheen) and a demon (David Tennant) who like Earth and team up to try to stop Armageddon.
Al Pacino will head the cast of Amazon's "The Hunt," a 1977-set Jordan Peele-produced Nazi-hunting revenge drama, as the lead Nazi hunter.
A very 'Brady' request
HGTV is giving a makeover to the house used as the exterior on "The Brady Bunch" for a September series, "A Very Brady Renovation," and the show's producers are seeking vintage furniture and home decor that matches or approximates set dressing from the sitcom. A photo gallery of items sought - and how to contact the network - can be found at HGTV.com/Brady.
'AGT' changes
When NBC's "America's Got Talent" returns in summer, it will have a new host and new judges. Tyra Banks is out as host, replaced by Terry Crews, who hosts "America's Got Talent: The Champions." Judges Heidi Klum and Mel B depart while Gabrielle Union and Julianne Hough join the judges' panel alongside returning Simon Cowell and Howie Mandel.
Channel surfing
A "Breaking Bad" movie that picks up the story after the series finale with Jesse (Aaron Paul) on the run will first stream on Netflix before airing on AMC, per The Hollywood Reporter. . THR also says Nickelodeon is in talks with CBS TV Studios for an animated "Star Trek" series targeted at kid viewers. . Season three of "Queer Eye" debuts March 15 on Netflix. . CNBC reports Apple will launch its long-gestating streaming service in April or May, with original programs free for Apple device owners and a platform to subscribe to streaming services such as Starz, Showtime, CBS All Access and Viacom networks. .

Texto completo: NEW YORK - Lee Radziwill, the stylish jet setter and socialite who found friends, lovers and other adventures worldwide while bonding and competing with her sister Jacqueline Kennedy, has died. She was 85.
Anna Christina Radziwill told The New York Times her mother died Friday of what she described as natural causes. The Associated Press left messages Saturday and Sunday for the family.
The husky-voiced Radziwill shared her older sister's affinity for fashion and globe-trotting, as well as her dark, wide-set eyes and high cheekbones. They were confidantes as young women, and Radziwill was a frequent guest at the White House during President John F. Kennedy's administration. She was with the president when he made a trip to London in 1961, and Kennedy was godfather to Radziwill's daughter, Anna Christina.
The Kennedys and Radziwills spent Christmases together in Palm Beach, Florida, and the sisters traveled to India and Pakistan. Radziwill helped select the wardrobe for what became one of Jackie's signature moments - her trip to Paris with her husband in 1961.
"She had to travel a lot and liked to have me with her, Radziwill wrote in "Happy Times, a memoir published in 2001, seven years after her sister's death. "Apart from mutual affection, I think our strongest bond was a shared sense of humor.
But tensions emerged after Kennedy's assassination, in 1963.
Radziwill had worried that her brother-in-law's ascent would overshadow her and told Gloria Steinem for a McCall's magazine interview that her life during the JFK years was "so limited, so . jet-set, empty, cold, and not true.
In 1968, Jackie wed the Greek billionaire Aristotle Onassis, whom Lee herself had once thought of marrying, only to have her sister urge her not to. Friends would say Radziwill felt betrayed and never entirely forgave Jackie.
Radziwill's life apart from her sister was eventful enough. She married a prince, Stanislas Radziwill of Poland, and had two children, Anthony and Anna Christina.
There were friendships with Steinem, Rudolf Nureyev, Andy Warhol and Truman Capote, whom she joined for a 1972 Rolling Stones tour.
"I can see how people found him (Mick Jagger) sexy, she told interviewer Sofia Coppola for a 2013 New York Times story. "But I found him a little repulsive. (Keith Richards would call her "Princess Radish.)
She began work on a film with collage artist and photographer Peter Beard about her childhood in East Hampton, New York. But after a few creative evolutions, and the introduction of filmmakers Albert and David Maysles, it became "Grey Gardens, the classic documentary about her eccentric aunt and cousin.
Edith Bouvier Beale and her eponymous daughter were immortalized in the 1975 release, later a Broadway musical and Emmy-winning HBO movie.
Radziwill also made forays into interior decorating and fashion event planning. A brief, unhappy acting career in the 1960s proved she was best at playing Lee Radziwill, with critics panning her work in a stage production of "The Philadelphia Story and a TV adaptation of the Otto Preminger film "Laura.
Another scrapbook memoir, "One Special Summer, was a 1974 release that followed her first trip to Europe when she was 18, chaperoned by Jackie, then 22. At the end of the trip, the two put together a collection of drawings, photos and handwritten anecdotes about their voyage. They created the book originally to thank their mother for the trip.
In the introduction to her memoir, Radziwill wrote that "so much has already been said about my family and the people I was close to, that it would be more enjoyable to only remember the best times with them.
It seemed at times that tragedy followed tragedy. In the aftermath of the death of her beloved nephew, John F. Kennedy Jr., on July 16, 1999, her own son died of cancer less than a month later, on Aug. 10, at age 40. Anthony Radziwill had been the best man at Kennedy's wedding.
Her 10-year marriage to Herbert Ross, her third husband, ended that year, as well. The choreographer and award-winning director of "Funny Girl and "Steel Magnolias died in 2001.
Born Caroline Lee Bouvier on March 3, 1933, in New York City, she was the second daughter of John V. Bouvier III and Janet Norton Lee. They divorced in 1940.

That Esquire cover and how we talk about white men today

Texto completo: Ryan Morgan is a 17-year-old student from Wisconsin who likes grouse hunting, hanging out with his girlfriend and playing Madden NFL on his Xbox.
He appears to be ordinary in a lot of ways -- or presumably, editors at Esquire magazine perceived him that way, which is why they put him on their most recent cover with an all-caps headline: "An American Boy."
The story promised to unpack "what it's like to grow up white, middle class, and male in the era of social media, school shootings, toxic masculinity, #MeToo, and a divided country."
Some people weren't having it. "Happy Black History Month, everybody," news anchor Soledad O'Brien tweeted sardonically on Tuesday.
"We do not need more features about how tough it is to grow up male and Caucasian," read another response. "We need more coverage of how tough it is to navigate the patriarchy."
The author of the Esquire piece defended the story to CBS, saying she hadn't approved the cover line and found it misleading. Hot takes abounded, and different commenters claimed the backlash proved the original story was necessary. In short, it was America in 2019.
Certainly, Morgan doesn't represent all white men. Part of the blowback occurred because he represented a specific male who, born of media desire to understand red-state voters, already gets a lot of coverage: a conservative-leaning heartlander grappling with a changing order, one who's heard of #MeToo but worries about its impact. Morgan discussed how he sometimes felt persecuted because he likes President Donald Trump, and silenced as a male. Editors displayed one of his quotes on the cover: "I know what I can't do, I just don't know what I can do."
The other reason there was consternation, I expect, wasn't about Morgan at all, but about a broader question we're culturally grappling with. How should we talk about white men today?
We talk about them all the time, in the sense that Trump, Robert Mueller, Elon Musk, a dozen televised Bachelors and movie-star Chrises (Pratt/Evans/Pine/Hemsworth) are all white men in regular conversational rotation.
But how do we talk about them like an anthropologist would? Recognize them without lionizing them, analyze them without demonizing them -- how do we tell their stories while remembering that their stories, as a group, were often the sole narrative, told at the expense of others'?
Esquire's editor, Jay Fielden, explained that the piece would be part of a series, one that would feature teenagers of various backgrounds: "white, black, LGBTQ, female." The story about Ryan Morgan could turn out to be one piece of an illuminating whole.
But it's still noteworthy, I think, that editors chose to begin their series with him. Not only because February is Black History Month, but also because the choice reinforces the idea that being white and male is the standard version of being human. That other versions, with other bells and whistles, would be released in the coming months -- but if you were looking for the classic floor model of a person, a straight white man is who you'd get.
The evening I started to read about the Esquire controversy I saw another headline, about presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif. She'd just done a radio interview where she was invited, as she often is, to discuss her relationship with race and gender. The hosts asked her to respond to people questioning "the legitimacy of your blackness."
Harris isn't alone. It's rare to find an interview with a woman or a person of color where they're not asked specifically about being a woman or a person of color. "Kirsten Gillibrand's unabashedly feminist campaign," read a Tuesday New York Times headline about the New York senator and likely presidential candidate, which went on to discuss Gillibrand's "woman plus" platform.
Women are asked to talk about their identities because we recognize that those identities matter -- that women's accomplishments, struggles and worldviews are all related, in some way, to the lives they'd lived and the bodies in which they'd lived them.
We haven't requested the same introspection from white men. They haven't been asked to talk specifically about how being male impacted their worldviews; they haven't been asked how being white has shaped their opinions on policy. You don't ask the floor model what it thinks of being a floor model, you just wait for, I dunno, the new self-parking feature to come out so you can use the original floor model as a standard for comparison.
I thought of Kamala Harris, and then I thought of Ryan Morgan.
It's time -- it's beyond time -- that we figure out ways to talk thoughtfully about what it means to be a white man. The problem isn't that Esquire wrote a story about Morgan, the problem is that it presented the story using a rapidly outdated way of thinking: that white men are the default model. That the #MeToo movement can be seen as a metaphorical assault on white male identity rather than women's attempt to avoid being literally assaulted.
I'm actually deeply interested in "what it's like," to use Esquire's language, to be a young white man. But to do that, we need to ask them questions like we ask Kamala Harris, or Kirstin Gillibrand, or Ben Carson, or other nonwhite or female Hollywood producers or CEOs. Not, How is your life difficult right now, but How do you think your life has been shaped by the identity into which you were born?

Texto completo: WBUR turned the popular New York Times column “Modern Love" into a podcast back in 2016, calling upon celebrities to lend their voices to the stories of “love, loss, and redemption" that have left us tearing up on the Red Line at times.
William Jackson Harper , who plays Chidi on the NBC comedy “The Good Place," was in town Friday to record an episode of the podcast with host Meghna Chakrabarti (both pictured above) at the Huntington Avenue Theatre in front of a sold-out audience.
Harper also read a story about a tiny creature that teaches the other animals and birds to appreciate being different, which will air Tuesday on “Circle Round."
Kate Winslet , Uma Thurman , Sandra Oh , Jake Gyllenhaal , Sterling K. Brown , and Harper's “The Good Place" love interest, Kristen Bell , have all recorded episodes of the podcast.

Laws on abortion come with consequences

Texto completo: Abortion is occupying many state legislatures lately, as the possible end of Roe v. Wade is contemplated. In Tennessee, one introduced bill would ban abortion in the state if Roe is overturned, even in part, while another would ban the procedure at the first sign of a fetal heartbeat. A law in New York and presently failed bill in Virginia would expand the right to late-term abortion.
As New York Times columnist David Leonhardt recently wrote, "Abortion is such a vexing issue because it involves an unresolvable clash of rights — the right of a woman to have control over her own body and the right of a fetus to live."
But the legal and political debate over rights and who deserves them causes blind spots to develop in what kind of society we would like to have.
The anti-abortion camp too often focuses on the legal effort to ban abortion without doing anything to practically accommodate the consequences of doing so. This is not a new argument, but one too infrequently repeated.
If abortion is illegal, adoption must become simpler and less expensive. But deeper in this argument is something more disturbing.
Black babies are aborted at rates higher than the black population — depending on the calculation, at about 30-40 percent of abortions.
The black abortion rate in some states is terrifying. In 2015, 60 percent of abortions in Alabama were of black babies and 78 percent in Mississippi, according to numbers from the Kaiser Family Foundation.
Black babies were 49 percent of abortions in Tennessee.
Anti-abortion people know this, yet fail to address how difficult it is to get black babies adopted. Black children are disproportionately represented in the nation's foster-care system, according to the Adoption Network Law Center, and that is just considering the children who were not aborted.
In a good-hearted effort to get black babies adopted, many states offer discounts on fees for adopting black children, which articulates the perverse notion that black children are worth less.
But the abortion-rights camp has a problem that is in many ways harder to fix. As they operate in service of making abortion easier to obtain, technology is presently in the business of making many more unsettling facts known about pregnancies.
The failed bill in Virginia would have permitted a late-term abortion if the pregnancy affected the mental health of the mother, even temporarily.
This may seem reasonable, but laws once codified often permit unintended consequences.
We now have available to us technology that, with varying accuracy, will allow us to detect prenatally certain factors in, for example, genetic diseases. Again, something good, but this knowledge, not properly contextualized, can and will harm the mental health of the most courageous expectant parent and will lead to decisions made without due consideration of all the facts.
Imagine, if you will, being told that your child could be born with a disease that in time will cause the child to have trouble communicating, eating, walking and any number of regular activities.
That sounds stark. But then imagine never being told that your child's intelligence would remain intact, and your child could grow up to obtain an Ivy League education and live, as nearly as possible, an essentially normal life.
Such diseases do exist, and their rate of prenatal detection will only grow. In a world where more and more loopholes are added to permit abortion, we will grow ever more dependent on doctors to paint an accurate picture of the possibilities. Doctors who are only human.
A society that values its most defenseless must commit itself to seeing as many babies born as medically possible, and that these babies will be cared for by loving parents, birth or adopted, regardless of race. There will, of course, always be unavoidable exceptions.
The good news is, no matter the direction of the political debate, this is a cause that requires no passage of law. People of all political beliefs can commit themselves to it today. Eventually, the politics will catch up.

Texto completo: Flip open the covers on the half a dozen books listed here, and pretty soon you'll start hearing voices.
But that's O.K. when those voices are as provocative, thoughtful, funny and fascinating as are those in the six nonfiction titles that we've assembled in honor of Black History Month.
One voice belongs to a woman whose career in public service would seem at cross-purposes with that of her crime lord husband. One belongs to a man who nearly gave up hope when he was sentenced to life in prison as a teenager - and now is free and owns businesses that give ex-offenders a fresh start. And one voice belongs to a 19th-century white guy from Kentucky - John Marshall Harlan, the only U.S. Supreme Court justice to declare in a landmark court case that segregation by race was illegal.
All the titles below were written by local authors. Five have been published in the past month, and one comes out in April. And all will illuminate this particular corner of the world; five of the books are set in Maryland, while the sixth is a national story with profound local ramifications.
Here they are, in alphabetical order by title:
"Baltimore Civil Rights Leader Victorine Q. Adams: The Power of the Ballot," by Ida E. Jones
Victorine Q. Adams, the first African-American woman to serve on the Baltimore City Council, was a force so imposing that she couldn't be overshadowed by any man - not even by her husband, the Baltimore gambling kingpin, William "Little Willie" Adams.
When some suggested that she won the 1967 election solely because her wealthy husband financed her campaign, she wrote the following rebuttal, published on Dec. 25, 1971, in the Baltimore Afro-American: "I should be regarded not only as the wife of Willie Adams but as a woman who has used her influence and affluence to better the community in which she lives."
The author is the archivist for Morgan State University, which holds Victorine Adams' papers. Jones writes in the biography's preface that she sought to document all the various "lines" that her subject crossed - racial, gender and voter registration - in her remarkable 93-year life.
"Baltimore Civil Rights Leader Victorine Q. Adams: The Power of the Ballot" was published Jan. 21 by Arcadia Publishing and The History Press. 128 pages, $21.99.
"The Master Plan: My Journey from Life in Prison to a Life of Purpose," by Chris Wilson
Baltimorean Chris Wilson put together his "master plan" of all the things he intended to accomplish and the steps he'd have to take to get there at age 19 while he was serving a sentence of life in prison. But the 40-year-old Wilson no longer is behind bars. He was released in 2012 and subsequently founded the Barclay Investment Group, which seeks to employ former felons.
Wilson's story began with a childhood characterized by hunger, neglect and physical abuse. His story is so unusual that it earned him two invitations to the White House and has been featured by such publications as Forbes, Fortune and The Baltimore Sun. "It really feels good to help people to earn an honest living," Wilson wrote for The Sun in 2015. "I can't help but to wonder where I would be if so many people hadn't put their faith in me and helped me be a better person."
"The Master Plan: My Journey from Life in Prison to a Life of Purpose" was released Feb. 5 by G.P. Putnam's Sons. 432 pages, $27.
"Plantations, Slavery & Freedom on Maryland's Eastern Shore," by Jacqueline Hedberg
Jacqueline Hedberg is a retired history teacher whose family has lived in Dorchester County for 350 years. When she read a 2015 article about a shameful episode in her birthplace's past of which she was unaware - the forced migration of enslaved people from Maryland to such Southern states as Louisiana and Mississippi - she was shaken.
"Why didn't I know that story?" she wrote in the book's preface. "Why didn't I know about coffles - those trains of slaves, chained together, forced to walk more than one thousand miles from the Chesapeake to the slave markets of the South?"
For the next few years, Hedberg pored over wills, deeds, bills of sale and other public records. She read roughly 100 books, journals and other documents, seeking to learn all about the slave trade on Maryland's Eastern Shore. She taught what she found to the students in her adult education classes at Towson University, and then condensed it into this book.
"Plantations, Slavery & Freedom on Maryland's Eastern Shore" was published Jan. 21 by Arcadia Publishing and The History Press. 160 pages, $21.99.
"Separate: The Story of Plessy V. Ferguson, and America's Journey from Slavery to Segregation," by Steve Luxenberg
The second published book by Baltimore author Steve Luxenberg has only been out for a few days and it's already generating buzz. This deeply researched story of the people involved in what is widely considered to be among the worst Supreme Court rulings of all time received a long and mostly laudatory review from The New Yorker and was named by The New York Times as one of 12 new books to watch for in February. Luxenberg also participated in NPR's "On Point" on Feb. 8 in an hourlong discussion of race relations in the U.S.
Many books have been published previously about the Plessy v. Ferguson case, which permitted "separate but equal" treatment based on race. Luxenberg, a former editor for The Baltimore Sun, decided instead to focus on three of the main players and to explore their contradictions: Albion Tourgee, a white civil rights advocate, designed the legal strategy for Plessy. A New Englander, associate justice Henry Billings Brown, wrote the majority opinion that declared segregation to be legal. The sole dissent was written by a Southerner, Associate Justice John Marshall Harlan.
"Separate: The Story of Plessy V. Ferguson, and America's Journey from Slavery to Segregation," was published Feb. 12 by W. W. Norton & Company. 624 pages, $35.
"Uncle Tom's Journey from Maryland to Canada: The Life of Josiah Henson," by Edna M. Troiano
The image of an "Uncle Tom" that exists now in popular culture - of a servile black man - couldn't be further from the truth about the real-life human being behind the stereotype.
Josiah Henson was born into slavery in 1789 in Charles County. As an adult, he escaped to Canada with his wife and children, established a settlement for fugitives and repeatedly returned to the U.S. to lead others to freedom along the Underground Railroad. Henson published a bestselling autobiography and became an acclaimed preacher and lecturer, as well as the inspiration for the title character in Harriet Beecher Stowe's "Uncle Tom's Cabin."
In recent years, several books have resurrected the story of this once-forgotten man. Troiano writes in the book's preface that she set out to explore how Henson disappeared from history and why his name isn't typically mentioned alongside those of more celebrated Maryland abolitionists such as Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman.
"Uncle Tom's Journey from Maryland to Canada: The Life of Josiah Henson" was published Jan. 21 by Arcadia Publishing and The History Press. 179 pages, $21.99.
"We Speak for Ourselves: A Word from Forgotten Black America," by D. Watkins
Baltimore's D. Watkins is the kind of guy who during a five-minute conversation will bring up 15 unrelated big ideas, nearly all of them interesting. His third book, an essay collection, is chock full of the author's blunt opinions about how to engage in productive conversations about race in America.
Watkins is the self-admitted former drug dealer turned author and college professor who became nationally known in 2014 after his essay about life in East Baltimore, "Too Poor for Pop Culture," went viral.
You'll have to wait to read his new book - "We Speak for Ourselves" won't be published for a few months - but the essay titles and chapter headings seem to indicate that success hasn't mellowed Watkins. A few samples: "Intellectually Curious or Racist?" "The Sad Truth is Black Lives Really Don't Matter" and "Did You Know There are Different Types of Black People?"
Yep - Watkins isn't just outspoken. He's also funny.
"We Speak for Ourselves: A Word from Forgotten Black America" will be published April 23 by Atria Books. 208 pages, $25.

What Dan Mallory's incredible story says about publishing

Texto completo: I have been delayed in writing this column because I've been searching the floor for my jaw, which dropped off my face somewhere midway through reading Ian Parker's profile of suspense novelist A.J. Finn in the Feb. 11 issue of The New Yorker.
A.J. Finn, author of the best-seller "The Woman in the Window," is actually the pseudonym for Dan Mallory, a publishing industry insider and book editor. That was widely known. What wasn't widely known was Mallory's history as a serial fabricator of his own biography -- including degrees unearned, jobs not held, and most disturbingly, an identity as a cancer survivor, which appears to have been entirely made up.
Parker's rendering of Mallory's story must be read in full to be properly appreciated, but the upshot is the tale of a handsome, "charming" man who talked his way into publishing's innermost circles, performing a chameleon-like change to please and flatter whatever audience could further his ambitions.
Mallory is presented as a fan of suspense novelist Patricia Highsmith, but Parker implies that Mallory is more like Highsmith's most well-known character, Tom Ripley, a sociopath who will not let anyone get in the way of his own success and pleasure. Parker even relates how British suspense/detective novelist Sophie Hannah may have based aspects of characters in her books on Mallory after he worked with her as her editor.
It is a bizarre, incredible story, and I don't have any idea what impact it will or won't have on Mallory's career. He has another book due as part of a multi-book, multi-million-dollar deal, but Parker suggests that "The Woman in the Window" may borrow quite liberally from other sources. Increased scrutiny for whatever Mallory may produce next will surely up the stakes.
The question as to whether the revelations of Mallory's character and behavior should alter one's enjoyment of the novel or the decision to read the book is real, but it's not particularly new. Mallory faking cancer and then suggesting he did so because of untreated mental illness -- as he relates in a statement to Parker in response to the impending publication of the article -- is a pretty low thing. But we've been wrestling with bad people making highly consumable products for eons.
It seems just last week (because it was last week) that I was championing the human element in publishing, but the story of how Mallory advanced in big-time publishing circles reveals some of the structural challenges that face an industry where credentials sometimes rest on who seems to fit the right image.
Handsome, charming, male.
Mallory's odd and occasionally abusive behavior was apparently well-known inside of publishing. Some publishers dropped out of bidding on his book when the true identity of A.J. Finn became known, but little to nothing of substance was done. A co-worker at Morrow, Mallory's one-time employer and current publisher, remarked to Parker, "There's a horror movie where all the teachers in school have been infected by an alien parasite. The kids realize it, and of course nobody believes them. That's what it felt like."
Morrow's boilerplate response, refusing to comment specifically while touting the #1 New York Times best-seller status of "The Woman in the Window," is concerning. It suggests that whatever romantic notions I may hold about publishing, business is business. Where there is money to be made, a prominent man can abuse his status at the expense of other employees.
This does not make me less inclined to champion the human element in publishing, but we can urge those at the top of the publishing food chain to take care of those further below.

Book recommendations from the Biblioracle
John Warner tells you what to read next based on the last five books you've read.

1. "The Thurber Carnival" by James Thurber
2. "The Power of Myth" by Joseph Campbell
3. "Night" by Elie Wiesel
4. "Man's Search for Meaning" by Viktor Frankl
5. "Educated" by Tara Westover
-- Robert G., Chicago
This is some heavy stuff on some of the deepest existential dilemmas we face. Even the stories of James Thurber -- which can be seen as entertainments -- are infused with those troubles. This brings to mind Flannery O'Connor's "Wise Blood."

1. "Where the Crawdads Sing" by Delia Owens
2. "Rules of Civility" by Amor Towles
3. "Crudo" by Olivia Laing
4. "The Great Believers" by Rebecca Makkai
5. "Calypso" by David Sedaris
-- Amber P., Urbana, Ill.
I'm dipping back in time a bit, but I think this one has become a kind of contemporary classic: "The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time" by Mark Haddon.

1. "The Idiot" by Elif Batuman
2. "Brooklyn" by Colm Toibin
3. "Becoming" by Michelle Obama
4. "A Separate Peace" by John Knowles
5. "The Poisonwood Bible" by Barbara Kingsolver
-- Patricia B., Chicago
I feel like we should be getting a new book from Jhumpa Lahiri one of these days, but until then, Patricia can tide herself over with "The Lowland," a deeply satisfying family story well matched with some of her recent reads.

Women on Money &amp; Mindset: Who’s in your personal brain trust?

Texto completo: The term “brain trust” is a term that was used by James Kieran, a New York Times reporter, to describe the group of leaders assembled by Franklin Delano Roosevelt during his presidential administration. President Roosevelt brought these “brains” together to advise him, decode problems and design new solutions for America.
When you think about it, having your own personal brain trust is a wise thing, no matter what our title or position. Life is complex, and those with whom we surround ourselves can make a difference in the way we look at life, contribute and enjoy the ride.
Who’s in your brain trust? And can the people in it support and challenge you in the following five ways?
Perspective
Living in the 21st century requires complex decision-making, being able to see and understand a problem or challenge from all angles.
Albert Einstein told us that we can’t solve problems with the same mindset that created them. However, it’s often difficult to step outside oneself to see other angles. Having a brain trust made up of people who come from various industries and backgrounds means you can tap into a vast pool of experience for greater perspective and creative solutions.
President Roosevelt’s brain trust helped him enact 19 laws to meet America’s challenges in just his first 100 days in office. He freely admitted this was due to having an intellectual powerhouse to bring ideas and perspective that he could not bring to the table alone.
Powerful support
It can get lonely as you carry out big responsibilities. Carrying this alone can cause isolation and stress. Unburdening and processing with family members or coworkers often creates greater stress on these relationships and can’t always provide the kind of support you need to meet life and work demands effectively.
It’s important for you to create a safe and powerful support system that is trustworthy, confidential and helpful in processing the complexity of your challenges.
Challenge
If you want to continue to grow so you lead both your life and work solidly into the future, you need input. What are you not seeing that you need to examine? How is not leading at a higher level affecting your life and work?
With great responsibilities, you can operate from “stress mode” as you address the immediate and urgent. This can develop tunnel vision and you will lean on familiar approaches that cannot meet more complex problems. This dynamic will prevent you from solving these problems, and meeting the important goals that will truly make a difference for you and the others around you.
A brain trust will challenge you where you might be playing small with limited thinking or approaches. It will provide that safe space for you to confront where you are holding yourself back and decide how you want to move forward.
Accountability
Change is hard. Growth is hard. Without an accountability mechanism, the biggest goals and commitments are seldom met successfully. As you process and make the necessary decisions to move forward, a brain trust will keep you accountable to yourself and your personal and professional commitments.
And because a brain trust’s only agenda is your agenda, you can count on your brain trust as an unbiased and supportive group that has your best interests in mind. This will help you to stay on track and to focus where you need in order to meet goals.
Community
How edifying and uplifting is your community? If you are like most, you have little time to enjoy the nurturing benefits of connection and community. In fact, your responsibilities and pace can limit your ability to form a meaningful community and to enjoy the gifts and benefits of bonds and belonging.
Your community can feel fragmented and might be made up solely of some of these:
* frantic seasonal socializing to reconnect with old friends during holidays
* etworking and brainstorming with peers
* industry- or business-specific meetings with colleagues
* connections with families of your kids and grandkids during sports season
* a weekly (if even that!) church experience
An intentionally focused community that encourages intellectual improvement, supports personal and professional growth, and genuinely cares about you is invaluable and rejuvenating. What’s more, being able to connect with this kind of community in a time of crisis or celebration is priceless.
How effective is your own brain trust? Here’s to taking charge to make yours exceptional, so that you can enjoy a more meaningful and rewarding journey in your life and work.

Texto completo: The term “brain trust” is a term that was used by James Kieran, a New York Times reporter, to describe the group of leaders assembled by Franklin Delano Roosevelt during his presidential administration. President Roosevelt brought these “brains” together to advise him, decode problems and design new solutions for America.
When you think about it, having your own personal brain trust is a wise thing, no matter what our title or position. Life is complex, and those with whom we surround ourselves can make a difference in the way we look at life, contribute and enjoy the ride.
Who’s in your brain trust? And can the people in it support and challenge you in the following five ways?
Perspective
Living in the 21st century requires complex decision-making, being able to see and understand a problem or challenge from all angles.
Albert Einstein told us that we can’t solve problems with the same mindset that created them. However, it’s often difficult to step outside oneself to see other angles. Having a brain trust made up of people who come from various industries and backgrounds means you can tap into a vast pool of experience for greater perspective and creative solutions.
President Roosevelt’s brain trust helped him enact 19 laws to meet America’s challenges in just his first 100 days in office. He freely admitted this was due to having an intellectual powerhouse to bring ideas and perspective that he could not bring to the table alone.
Powerful support
It can get lonely as you carry out big responsibilities. Carrying this alone can cause isolation and stress. Unburdening and processing with family members or coworkers often creates greater stress on these relationships and can’t always provide the kind of support you need to meet life and work demands effectively.
It’s important for you to create a safe and powerful support system that is trustworthy, confidential and helpful in processing the complexity of your challenges.
Challenge
If you want to continue to grow so you lead both your life and work solidly into the future, you need input. What are you not seeing that you need to examine? How is not leading at a higher level affecting your life and work?
With great responsibilities, you can operate from “stress mode” as you address the immediate and urgent. This can develop tunnel vision and you will lean on familiar approaches that cannot meet more complex problems. This dynamic will prevent you from solving these problems, and meeting the important goals that will truly make a difference for you and the others around you.
A brain trust will challenge you where you might be playing small with limited thinking or approaches. It will provide that safe space for you to confront where you are holding yourself back and decide how you want to move forward.
Accountability
Change is hard. Growth is hard. Without an accountability mechanism, the biggest goals and commitments are seldom met successfully. As you process and make the necessary decisions to move forward, a brain trust will keep you accountable to yourself and your personal and professional commitments.
And because a brain trust’s only agenda is your agenda, you can count on your brain trust as an unbiased and supportive group that has your best interests in mind. This will help you to stay on track and to focus where you need in order to meet goals.
Community
How edifying and uplifting is your community? If you are like most, you have little time to enjoy the nurturing benefits of connection and community. In fact, your responsibilities and pace can limit your ability to form a meaningful community and to enjoy the gifts and benefits of bonds and belonging.
Your community can feel fragmented and might be made up solely of some of these:
* frantic seasonal socializing to reconnect with old friends during holidays
* etworking and brainstorming with peers
* industry- or business-specific meetings with colleagues
* connections with families of your kids and grandkids during sports season
* a weekly (if even that!) church experience
An intentionally focused community that encourages intellectual improvement, supports personal and professional growth, and genuinely cares about you is invaluable and rejuvenating. What’s more, being able to connect with this kind of community in a time of crisis or celebration is priceless.
How effective is your own brain trust? Here’s to taking charge to make yours exceptional, so that you can enjoy a more meaningful and rewarding journey in your life and work.

NBA; ALL-STAR NOTES; Abdul-Jabbar's act of charity

Texto completo: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is auctioning off four of his five Lakers championship rings -- from 1980, 1985, 1987 and 1988 -- among a collection of hundreds of items of personal memorabilia.
"One of the reasons I'm here is to mention my auction," Abdul-Jabbar said after a news conference announcing this year's Basketball Hall of Fame finalists. "I have a charity where we send kids to camp to learn about STEM [Science, Technology, Engineering, Math]. I'm gonna auction off all my stuff.
"I can't afford to pay all the rental fees and insurance. I'm just tired of it. It can help me support my foundation. ... A significant portion of the proceeds will go to help me help the kids learn about STEM education. That's one of the main reasons I'm here, to get some support from my friends in the NBA."

The minimum bid for each ring is $60,000. The auction also includes game and practice-worn jerseys, All-Star rings and a "Wells Fargo Carriage Figurine Presented to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for Amazing Coaching."
On the site hosting the auction, GoldinAuctions.com, Abdul-Jabbar says he is not experiencing personal financial hardship. Abdul-Jabbar incurred millions of dollars of debt in the 1980s related to a bad investment entered into by his then-financial advisor.
"My sports memorabilia also have a history," Abdul-Jabbar said in his blog post. "My history. My life. And, oddly, since my life is still happening and ever-evolving, I am less personally attached to those items than I am to my desire to create new history for myself -- and futures for others."

HOF finalists
The Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame announced 13 finalists for this year's class, as well as its two media inductees and two lifetime achievement award winners.
Two local products were among the finalists. Marques Johnson, who attended Crenshaw High and played at UCLA before being selected third overall in the 1977 draft, was one. Another was Paul Westphal, who went to Aviation High in Redondo Beach before playing at USC.
Longtime Clippers broadcaster Ralph Lawler was awarded the Curt Gowdy Media Award for excellence in electronic media and Marc Stein of the New York Times was given the award for excellence in print media.
Four-time defensive player of the year Ben Wallace and seven-time All Star Jack Sikma were first-time finalists, along with Johnson and Westphal.
The repeat finalists included Leta Andrews, the all-time winningest high school coach; former referee Hugh Evans, two-time NBA coach of the year and former Clippers coach Bill Fitch, four-time All-Star Bobby Jones, five-time All-Star Sidney Moncrief, five-time Division II coach of the year Barbara Stevens, former Kings star Chris Webber and five-time WNBA All-Star Theresa Weatherspoon.

James' ambassadors
The LeBron James Family Foundation continued an annual tradition of bringing 23 students who are part of their 330 Ambassador program to the All-Star city for community service and career development activities, as well as a visit with James.
Friday morning, the students worked with the charity Samaritan's Feet, which washes feet and provides shoes to people who need them, donating 400 pairs to local students.
"It made me think about my little sisters," said Lulu Montes, a high school senior in Akron who has been a 330 Ambassador for three years. "As a student who has also been in their shoes, I think it's great that we can say words of encouragement to them. It was a very, very powerful moment."
The group spent the afternoon with the Carolina Panthers to learn about career opportunities.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump's abrupt decision to withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria provoked widespread fears over a future resurgence of the Islamic State. But it may have a silver lining: Other countries have signaled they are willing to take back their citizens who joined the terrorist group but are now detained in makeshift camps.
About 850 men and several thousand women and children from nearly 50 countries are being held in northern Syria in detention camps for Islamic State fighters and sympathizers. They have been locked up indefinitely, in ad hoc wartime prisons and refugee camps, by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, which is allied with the United States.
Most of those detainees' home countries have been looking the other way, despite the Kurds' pleas to relieve them of that burden. But Trump's sudden announcement on Dec. 19 that he intended to withdraw U.S. troops soon has since called into doubt the Kurds' ability to maintain control of the prisons and camps.
That, in turn, has led to concerns that the foreign fighters could escape or be freed and return home to launch attacks - and to a new burst of activity to repatriate some of them.
There is no indication that Trump was thinking about how to manage the detainees when he announced the Syria withdrawal.
"Unintentionally, it may be that Trump's disruptive style has had a positive impact in forcing countries to face problems that they would rather kick down the road," said Daniel Fried, a former senior State Department official who retired in 2017 and is now a fellow at the Atlantic Council.
The prospect of repatriating citizens who had joined the Islamic State, and trying to prosecute or reintegrate them into society, has raised daunting concerns for many allied governments over security, legal and political risks. Not one detainee from the makeshift Syrian camps was returned to their home nation in the last five months of 2018.
But in lanuary, Kazakhstan announced that it had repatriated about 46 of the detainees, including about 41 women and children. Four American officials said Oman and Tunisia also took back some of their citizens from the Kurds.
A Tunisian official denied that his government had agreed to repatriate any Islamic State fighters or their families. But several other officials said up to nine people among what was described as a large number of Tunisian detainees have been returned.
Adel al-Jubeir, a senior Saudi official, said last week his government was willing to repatriate some 50 Saudi men who are being held in the Kurdish camps.
Reports last month indicated that France is close to deciding whether to bring back about 130 of its detained citizens, including men, women and children.
Other European countries with large numbers of detained citizens, including Germany and Belgium, are said to be closely watching how Paris will decide, with an eye toward echoing it. - (The New York Times)

Political Cornflakes: Inside Trump’s attempt to claim victory in his border wall defeat

Texto completo: Happy Friday! Good news: The government isn’t shutting down again. But getting to this point wasn’t easy. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was on the phone with President Donald Trump three times yesterday trying to convince him that the new budget deal was the best he could get and spinning it as a win -- which it really wasn’t. Trump was assured, though, by his folks that he could declare a national emergency, a move that will spark litigation and possibly congressional rebukes. Here’s a look at how the deal went down. [WaPost]
Topping the news: Utah’s members of Congress all reacted differently to the budget bill that passed on Thursday — some more positively than others. [Trib] [DNews] [KUTV]
-> After facing much controversy, Utah lawmakers decided to abandon two pieces of legislation that would have prevented people from changing their gender on their birth certificates and or driver licences. Lawmakers said they will defer consideration of the proposals. [Trib] [DNews] [KSL] [KUTV]
-> The Orrin Hatch Foundation is asking the Utah Legislature to donate $2 million to fund a center in the former senator’s name. The money would come from taxpayers. [Trib]
Tweets of the day: @BarackObama: “In the year since their friends were killed, the students of Parkland refused to settle for the way things are and marched, organized, and pushed for the way things should be - helping pass meaningful new gun violence laws in states across the country. I'm proud of all of them.”
-> @CandickBackus: “Standing here today are 25 female legislators, a historic number for the Utah Legislature.”
-> @StephenAtHome: “Things Howard Schultz doesn't see: 1. Color 2. The writing on the wall.”
Happy Birthday: today to former state Rep. Mel Brown and SITLA Associate Director and General Council John Andres and on Saturday to Attorney General Sean Reyes.
Behind the Headlines Tribune government and politics editor Dan Harrie, reporter Taylor Stevens, and columnist Robert Gehrke join KCPW guest host Marcie Young Cancio to talk about the week's top stories, including the evacuation of a Salt Lake City apartment complex deemed unsafe to occupy.
-> Every Friday at 9 a.m., stream “Behind the Headlines” at kcpw.org, or tune in to KCPW 88.3 FM or Utah Public Radio for the broadcast. Join the live conversation by calling (801) 355-TALK.
Friday quiz: Last week, 95 percent of you knew about efforts to put 4.8 beer in Utah’s grocery stores, but only 57 percent knew about a Sundance film revealing the late actor Anton Yelchin’s battle with cystic fibrosis. Think you kept up with the news this week? Take our quiz to find out. A new one will post every Friday morning. You can find previous quizzes here. If you’re using The Salt Lake Tribune mobile app, click here. [Trib]
In other news: After sending out a memo yesterday, Intermountain Mountain Healthcare announced that it will begin writing cannabis recommendations for qualifying patients during a news conference Thursday morning. Advocates said they hope their announcement leads other physician networks to do the same. [Trib] [DNews] [Fox13] [KUTV]
-> 149 years after a Utahn became the first woman to vote in all of America, lawmakers unanimously voted in favor of a resolution proposing to designate Valentine’s Day as Women’s Voter Registration Day. [Trib]
-> A committee decided on the sculptor who will depict Martha Hughes Cannon, Utah’s first state senator and in the country. The sculpture will be completed by Ben Hammond. [Trib] [KUTV]
-> Sen. Mitt Romney expressed concern that the Trump administration had yet to explain its findings on Jamal Khashoggi’s murder, the Washington Post journalist killed in 2018. [Trib]
-> Utah Republican lawmakers held a series of private meetings where they discussed implementing a tax-reform effort. While the meetings didn’t go into specifics, one Utah senator said they focused on some of the threats to the state’s budgets. [Trib]
-> Despite several environmental groups’ strong opposition, a bill proposing to make the permanent disposal of uranium possible in Utah passed out of its Senate committee hearing on Thursday. [Trib]
-> Robert Gehrke penned an impassioned editorial condemning landlords’ failures to provide their tenants with essential safety functions, citing the recently evicted Georgia Apartments as an example. He also blamed Utah legislators for failing to create policies that hold landlords to an adequate standard. [Trib]
-> Tribune cartoonist Pat Bagley offers his take on former Sen. Orrin Hatch’s supporters asking for taxpayer money. [Trib]
Nationally: CNN interviewed the Tribune’s very own Benjamin Wood for his coverage on the Utah Legislature’s decision to roll back Proposition 3. [CNN]
-> White House officials said that President Donald Trump plans to use emergency powers to override Congress’s spending package that cleared both the House and Senate on Thursday in order to secure funding for the border wall. Press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that Trump intends to sign the spending package in addition to taking executive action. [NYTimes] [WaPost] [Politico]
-> The New York Times kept tabs on how each senator voted on Thursday’s compromise spending package — the majority of which voted in favor. [NYTimes]
-> The Senate voted and confirmed William P. Barr as attorney general 54 to 45. [NYTimes] [WaPost] [Politico]

'El Chapo' heading to Supermax prison? Who else is inside the hellish 'Alcatraz of the Rockies'

Texto completo: It’s been described as a “high-tech version of hell" and it holds some of the nation’s most dangerous criminals – including, maybe soon, Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman.
The federal government’s ADX "Supermax" prison in Florence, Colorado, is “the prison of all prisons,” said Louisiana State Penitentiary maximum-security warden Burl Cain.
It makes sense that a drug lord who's already escaped two high-security Mexican prisons would be sent there. In 2001, Guzman bribed his way out of prison in a laundry basket. In 2015, he escaped out of another penitentiary in a movie-style jailbreak: crawling into a hatch beneath his shower and hopping on a waiting motorcycle through a tunnel dug underground.
Federal authorities haven't confirmed exactly where Guzman will be held, but U. S. Attorney Richard Donoghue said Thursday that Guzman faces "a sentence from which there is no escape and no return. "
Here's what you should know about his possible new home:
How secure is it?
The prison, also called the "Alcatraz of the Rockies," is surrounded by razor-wire fences, gun towers, heavily-armed patrols and attack dogs. Snipers guard the grounds in gun towers. No inmate has ever escaped the prison.
More: 'El Chapo' escaped from two prisons. This time, he’s probably headed to the 'Alcatraz of the Rockies'
What's a prisoner's day like?
Inmates spend about 23 hours of every day in solitary confinement inside a 12-by-7-foot cell made of concrete with a small window. The room is designed so that inmates cannot have contact with others or much of the outside world.
"You're designing it so the inmates can't see the sky. Intentionally," former Supermax prison warden Robert Hood told CNN. "You're putting up wires so helicopters can't land. "
Each cell contains a toilet, shower and bed (a concrete slab with a thin mattress). Meals are slid through openings in the doors.
“This place is not designed for humanity . . . It’s not designed for rehabilitation," Hood told The New York Times.
An hour of outdoor time for inmates placed in restraints is allowed some days inside a cage slightly larger than the cells. Travis Dusenbury, who spent 10 years locked up in the prison, told Vice that that was the only contact he had with people, if his neighbor's schedule lined up with his.
"The closest human contact you could get was what we called 'finger handshakes' through the fence," Dusenbury said.

Texto completo: CHICAGO - The Chicago Cubs and Sinclair Broadcast Group are launching a regional sports network in 2020 that will be the team's exclusive TV home.
The Cubs said today the Marquee Sports Network will carry live game broadcasts and pregame and postgame coverage. Cubs games will be in one place, instead of split between two broadcast stations. The Cubs signed five-year contracts with WGN and WLS in 2014 ahead of plans for the network launch in 2020.
Sinclair president and CEO Chris Ripley told the Chicago Tribune negotiations are underway to sign up cable and satellite providers and streaming services for the network.
Cubs president of business operations Crane Kenney expressed confidence fans will have many ways to watch, saying the team expects "to have more distribution with the new network than we have today."
Phillies, Nola agree to 4-year deal
CLEARWATER, Fla. - Pitcher Aaron Nola and the Philadelphia Phillies have agreed to a $45 million, four-year contract, avoiding a salary arbitration hearing scheduled for this week.
The 25-year-old right-hander set career bests last year when he was a first-time All-Star, going 17-6 with a 2.37 ERA. He would have been eligible for free agency after the 2021 season.. Under a deal announced Wednesday, Nola gets a $2 million signing bonus, $4 million this year, $8 million in 2020, $11.75 million in 2021 and $15 million in 2022. Philadelphia has a $16 million team option for 2023 with a $4.25 million buyout.
Nationals trade Gott to Giants for cash
WASHINGTON - The Washington Nationals have traded right-handed reliever Trevor Gott to the San Francisco Giants for cash. Wednesday's move comes after Washington designated the 26-year-old Gott for assignment to make room on the 40-man roster for starting pitcher Jeremy Hellickson. Gott went 0-2 with a 5.68 ERA in 20 appearances totaling 19 innings for the Nationals in 2018, with 15 strikeouts, 10 walks and four home runs allowed.
FOOTBALL
Bears' Cohen, Colts' Leonard inducted into Black College Hall of Fame
ATLANTA - Darius Leonard, the AP's Defensive Rookie of the Year, and Tarik Cohen have been honored by the Black College Football Hall of Fame as their top pro players for 2018.
The award, announced Wednesday, recognizes the most outstanding professional football player from a historically black college and university. Arizona Cardinals safety Antoine Bethea was selected as the inaugural recipient in 2017.
Indianapolis linebacker Leonard played at South Carolina State and was selected by the Colts in the second round of last year's draft. He finished his rookie season with an NFL-high 163 combined tackles (111 solo), eight pass deflections, seven sacks and one interception. His 163 tackles broke the franchise record and helped Leonard make the All-Pro team.
Bears running back and return specialist Tarik Cohen attended North Carolina A&T and was drafted in the fourth round in 2017. During the 2018 season, Cohen rushed for 444 yards and three touchdowns. He also had 71 catches for 725 yards and five touchdowns, along with a league-leading 411 punt return yards. He was an All-Pro as a punt returner.
Chiefs owner heads NFL finance committee
NEW YORK - Kansas City Chiefs owner Clark Hunt is replacing the late Bob McNair as head of the NFL's influential financial committee.
Hunt has been on the committee for seven years. McNair passed away in November.
Other owners on the committee are Atlanta's Arthur Blank, Tampa Bay's Joel Glazer, Indianapolis' Jim Irsay, Jacksonville's Shahid Khan, New England's Robert Kraft, Philadelphia's Jeffrey Lurie and Miami's Stephen Ross.
BASKETBALL
Krzyzewski: 'No knowledge' of sexual assault allegation against ex-player
LOUISVILLE, Ky. - Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski says he has "no knowledge" of a woman's allegation that she was sexually assaulted by a former Blue Devils basketball player and he believes the school should and will investigate.
Lawyer Nancy Erika Smith has said her client, Meredith Watson, was raped by a basketball player while she was a student at Duke. The New York Times and other publications have identified the player as Corey Maggette, who has denied the allegation. The reports cited a friend of Watson, R. Stanton Jones, who said she told him about the alleged assault at the time.
Watson has also said Virginia Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax sexually assaulted her while they were students at Duke in 2000. Smith said Watson told a high-ranking administrator about the assault by a basketball player but was dissuaded from filing a complaint or notifying police. Maggette played at Duke in the 1998-99 season and then left for the NBA.
Krzyzewski was asked about the allegation after Duke's 71-69 victory over Louisville on Tuesday night. He said he wasn't aware of the details.
"At that level for that serious an accusation, it's always university level. Our university, they'll handle everything and that's what should happen," Krzyzewski said.
Trail Blazers sign Enes Canter
PORTLAND, Ore. - Center Enes Kanter has joined the Portland Trail Blazers.
Kanter was waived by the New York Knicks along with Wesley Matthews following the trade deadline last week. Kanter announced Wednesday on Twitter that he had signed with the Blazers for the rest of the season.
Kanter was once a starter for the Knicks but fell out of the rotation altogether when the team - with the worst record in the league - turned its focus to younger players.
Cavs' Love to sit out ahead of break
CLEVELAND - Cavaliers forward Kevin Love will sit out the final game before the All-Star break to get further rest following foot surgery.
Love has not suffered any setbacks since returning last week to play for the first time since having the operation in November. The five-time All-Star has played in two games.
The Cavaliers have been pleased with his recovery and don't want to push things. After facing the Nets on Wednesday, Cleveland won't play again until Feb. 21.

Democrats should take lessons from 2016 GOP field

Texto completo: For the second presidential cycle in a row, a crowded field of candidates has emerged in the race to claim a major party's nomination. The sheer number of hats in the ring could produce a nominee outside the small coterie most pundits expect to win out.
Dubious? Just think about 2016.
In the last presidential election, most of the Republican candidates were seen as beacons of the "establishment." With Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, Carly Fiorina, Scott Walker, Rick Perry, John Kasich and Chris Christie all competing to win the hearts and minds of more moderate GOP primary voters, Donald Trump won by collecting support from Republicans with an appetite for a different brand of candidate — and he succeeded. In other words, the crowded field opened the door for an outsider who was (and could still be) largely out of step with many others inside his own party.
This time, the situation is flipped. Democrats are the party with the crowded field. But maybe more important, many Democratic candidates are not focusing on winning over moderate voters. Quite the opposite; they're keyed on winning over the Democratic Party's base voters and others on the far left. If history repeats itself, these candidates will end up slicing that electorate into such small portions that they could open the door for a competitor with a different message and outlook.
No one knows who will emerge as the Democratic nominee, and the widely held presumption that the 2016 race would be yet another contest between someone named Bush and someone named Clinton should give prognosticators pause. But the crowded field among Democratic candidates signals that the unexpected today might seem inevitable tomorrow. Voters eager to see a candidate emerge with a promise of getting Democrats and Republicans to work collaboratively should stay engaged.
Nancy Jacobson is a founder of the nonprofit organization No Labels.
What others are saying Dean Obeidallah, CNN.com: "President Donald Trump is now confronted with a gang of women who are all gunning for him. And if he responds in usual Trump fashion, with his no-holds-barred attacks, he could drive away more female voters than he did in the 2018 midterms. That could potentially not only be devastating for Trump, but also for many Republicans on the 2020 ballot."
Tara McGowan, The Hill: "Trump's campaign has excelled at leveraging digital ad dollars to keep the controversies surrounding the Trump administration from reaching his supporter base online. ... Coupled with Trump's own tweets, thousands of Facebook ads placed by his re-election campaign and dozens of conservative 'media outlets' driving the same narrative, Trump's chosen message blanketed the feeds and phones of voters nationwide."
David Leonhardt, The New York Times: "If I were Trump, I would fear Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Sherrod Brown of Ohio. Either would be well-positioned to take back blue-collar states Trump needs like Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania and maybe even Ohio and Iowa. They could also play well in the Sunbelt suburbs of Arizona, Florida and North Carolina. And if I were the other 2020 Democrats, I'd be studying how Klobuchar and Brown have succeeded where so many other Democrats have been failing."

What to know about the 25th Amendment: It's never been used, but ex-FBI head says officials thought about it

Resumen: Here's what you need to know about how the 25th Amendment allows removal of a president unable to handle the job

Enlaces: https://upfinder.upf.edu/openurl/34CSUC_UPF/34CSUC_UPF:VU1?genre=article&amp;atitle=What+to+know+about+the+25th+Amendment%3A+It%27s+never+been+used%2C+but+ex-FBI+head+says+officials+thought+about+it&amp;author=Groppe%2C+Maureen&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;date=2019-02-14&amp;rft.btitle=&amp;rft.jtitle=USA+Today+%28Online%29&amp;issn=&amp;isbn=&amp;sid=ProQ%3Anorthcentralnews_

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – In the more than 50 years since the Constitution was amended to create a way to remove a president unable to do his job, the process has never been triggered.
But the former acting director of the FBI says officials thought about it.
Andrew McCabe told "60 Minutes" in an interview that top Justice Department officials discussed whether Vice President and a majority of the cabinet would be willing to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove President Donald Trump from office.
"They were counting noses," 60 Minutes' Scott Pelley told "CBS This Morning" in a preview of his interview with McCabe that will air Sunday. McCabe, who was fired by then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions last year, has written a book coming out next week, "The Threat: How the FBI Protects America in the Age of Terror and Trump. "
After news of McCabe's comments broke Thursday, tweeted that McCabe is "a disgrace to the FBI and a disgrace to our Country. "
And Vice President Mike Pence called "any suggestion" of triggering the amendment "absurd," according to NBC News reporter Andrea Mitchell, who spoke with him while traveling in Europe. She quoted him as saying, "I could not be more proud to stand with him and the words or writings of a disgraced FBI agent won’t change that fact for the American people. "
McCabe took over as acting FBI director after Trump fired James Comey in 2017. Sessions fired McCabe after concluding that he had misled internal investigators. The Justice Department disputed McCabe's characterization of discussions about the 25th Amendment, but did not deny that they had taken place.
What is the 25th Amendment?
The amendment, ratified in 1967, created a legal mechanism for designating a head of state when the president is disabled or dead. It also formalized the historical practice for the vice president to permanently take over if the president dies or resigns, and gives the president and Congress shared power to replace a vice president.
Why was it written?
John F. Kennedy’s assassination brought renewed interest to presidential succession questions. Lyndon B. Johnson’s ascension to the presidency meant that – for the 16th time – the country had no vice president. And there was no tested way of dealing with a severe presidential illness. Johnson previously had suffered a heart attack and the next two people in line to be president were the 71-year-old speaker of the House and the 86-year-old president pro tempore of the Senate.
Has it been used before?
Gerald Ford followed the first two sections of the amendment when becoming Richard Nixon’s vice president after Spiro Agnew resigned, and when becoming president after Nixon’s resignation. The amendment’s third section, which allows for a president to temporarily cede power and duties to a vice president, was used once after Ronald Reagan was shot and twice when George W. Bush underwent surgery under general anesthesia. The fourth section, a process for removing a president when others believe he is “unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office,” has never been used.
When did the author intend the 4th section to be invoked?
Former Sen. Birch Bayh wrote in his book “One Heartbeat Away: Presidential Disability and Succession” that he knew the most controversial aspect of the amendment he authored would be how to handle the rare instances when a president’s team disputed his ability to serve.
“You know, fellows, we've talked about this problem a hundred times,” Bayh recounted telling his aides when they were in the final stages of negotiation. “The only time it would present itself – the only time the president would say 'I'm well and able' and the vice president and cabinet would disagree – would be if the president was as nutty as a fruit cake. ”
Why is it being talked about now?
The amendment got new attention after President Donald Trump's inauguration and re-emerged as a top talker after some of Trump's controversial comments and actions, or because of inside reports about the workings of the White House.
In 2017, for example, Trump triggered questions about his stability when he tweeted he has a bigger "nuclear button" than Kim Jong Un of North Korea.
Michael Wolff’s “Fire and Fury,” published last year, painted a picture of a president not up to the job.
“It's not unreasonable to say this is 25th Amendment kind of stuff,” Wolff said in NBC’s "Meet the Press" appearance.
In Bob Woodward's book "Fear: Trump in the White House", then-White House chief of staff John Kelly calls Trump "an idiot" who has "gone off the rails. "
In an opinion piece published by The New York Times last year, the anonymous author wrote that Cabinet members had "whispered" about invoking the 25th Amendment because of Trump's increasing erratic behavior.
Soon after, The New York Times reported that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein discussed invoking the 25th Amendment when the White House had been plunged into chaos after the firing of FBI Director James Comey. The report said Rosenstein suggested wearing a wire during encounters with the president while proposing the recruitment of other administration officials to support the president's removal.
Rosenstein called the story "inaccurate and factually incorrect. "
In the "60 Minutes" interview airing Sunday, McCabe said the suggestion came up more than once and was so serious it was discussed with FBI lawyers, Pelley told "CBS This Morning. "
How could the 25th Amendment be triggered?
The vice president and a majority of the Cabinet could declare the president unable to “discharge the powers and duties of his office. ” If the president disputes that determination, two-thirds of both the House and the Senate must vote to put the vice president in charge.
In addition, lawmakers can designate through legislation an alternative group – other than the Cabinet – that the vice president could work with to declare a president unable to serve.
Is the amendment clear on what qualifies as an inability to serve?
No. And Jay Berman, one of the Bayh aides who worked on the amendment, said that was intentional.
“It didn’t settle the issue of what it is,” he said in an interview. “It provided a mechanism for addressing the issue. ”
Would a psychiatrist or other doctor need to weigh in?
Bayh assumed the vice president would consult with medical experts, but the drafters never felt comfortable that the decision would be made solely by a group of doctors, according Berman. Section 4 was not intended to overturn the verdict of the electoral system, or to be a substitute for impeachment, Berman said.
“It was certainly on our mind that the impeachment proceeding was still something that was available in the case of a president that had violated his oath or hadn’t performed his duties,” he said. “That truly should be the first line of defense in any case where there’s an issue about removing the president. ”
Is it likely to be used?
The anonymous senior official who wrote the New York Times opinion piece said discussions of invoking the amendment didn't go farther than the early whispers.
"No one wanted to precipitate a constitutional crisis," the author added. Instead, officials are trying to to "do what we can to steer the administration in the right direction until – one way or another – it’s over. "
In his statement last fall denying that he suggested wearing a wire, Rosenstein also said he wanted to be clear that "based on my personal dealings with the president, there is no basis to invoke the 25th Amendment. ”
Plus, Pence has given no indication that he questions Trump’s ability to be president.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Representative Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York, on Wednesday defended his characterization of President Trump as the "grand wizard of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue," saying Trump has exhibited racially insensitive behavior for decades.
Jeffries, chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, was pressed during a CNN interview about comments made this week at a Martin Luther King Jr. Day celebration in Harlem at which he referred to the term for the leader of the Ku Klux Klan.
"I did a use a colorful phrase, but of course I don't believe that the president is a card-carrying member of the KKK," Jeffries said. "But it did capture a troubling pattern of racially insensitive and outrageous, at times, behavior that spans not months, not years, but decades."
Jeffries, elected to his leadership post in November, cited several examples, including Trump's insistence that the "Central Park Five" were guilty, even though DNA evidence exonerated them in the notorious 1989 rape case in New York.
Jeffries also cited Trump's advocacy of the "racist lie" that President Barack Obama was born abroad as well as comments Trump made after a deadly clash at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017.
Jeffries noted he has "consistently said no" when asked whether he considers Trump a racist. But he said Trump's "series of racially insensitive remarks" should not be ignored. "We cannot whitewash that. We cannot hide it," he said.

Pete Buttigieg, the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Ind., announced Wednesday that he was entering the Democratic presidential primary, a long-shot campaign that may test the appeal of a youthful, Midwestern profile.
In an e-mail to potential supporters, Buttigieg said he was forming an exploratory committee and cast himself as a candidate of the future, stressing his generational identity and calling for policies “untethered to the politics of the past" on issues like climate and economic opportunity.
“What will America look like in 2054, when I reach the age of the current president?" Buttigieg said. “How will we look back on 2020?"
He also released an introductory video. A veteran of the war in Afghanistan, Buttigieg was a consultant at McKinsey before entering politics.
It is unclear whether a municipal executive who oversees a city of about 100,000 people can be a viable candidate for the presidential nomination. While several other current or former mayors are considering campaigns, they all hail from iconic cities like Los Angeles, New Orleans, and New York and have records of managing sprawling bureaucracies or navigating major crises. Buttigieg has a far more modest record.
He began to draw national notice in the aftermath of the 2016 presidential election, delivering an essay, “A Letter from Flyover Country," that counseled Democrats on how to recover from their defeats that year. He ran unsuccessfully to chair the Democratic National Committee, withdrawing before the vote in winter 2017. Buttigieg, who is gay, also chided Democrats for being overly focused on the presidency, at the expense of competing for important state and local offices.

WASHINGTON — House Democrats will investigate the Trump White House's security clearance practices and what they call "grave breaches" of procedure that gave potentially compromised individuals access to the country's most sensitive secrets.
The investigation, announced Wednesday by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee's chairman, Representative Elijah Cummings, Democrat of Maryland, is seeking to expose why the White House cleared certain individuals and to close loopholes.
The panel also plans to challenge the administration on why it has not been more responsive to congressional requests regarding security clearances, as required under law.
Among those whose cases the panel plans to scrutinize are former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russian officials; Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner, who failed to disclose several contacts with foreign officials; and former White House staff secretary Rob Porter, who was accused of spousal abuse.

WASHINGTON — Attorneys for Paul Manafort on Wednesday rebutted allegations the former Trump campaign chairman lied to investigators and broke his plea deal, saying any misstatements he made in special counsel Robert Mueller III's probe of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election were unintentional.
In a redacted version of a 10-page document filed under seal, Manafort's attorneys told a federal judge "a fair reading" of the government's allegations "does not support the conclusion that Mr. Manafort intentionally provided false information."
Rather, they said, "when placed in proper context, much of the evidence presented by [Mueller's office] merely demonstrates a lack of consistency in Mr. Manafort's recollection of certain facts and events. Indeed, many of these events occurred years ago, or during a high-pressure US presidential campaign," which Manafort left under fire.
Prosecutors said they are ready to back up their accusations by presenting witnesses at a hearing scheduled for Friday before US District Judge Amy Berman Jackson.

Texto completo: Drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman twice escaped from prison in Mexico. With his conviction on drug trafficking and murder charges in U.S. federal court this week, he is likely headed to a far more secure facility: the so-called Alcatraz of the Rockies.
The federal prison, known as "Supermax," is an administrative maximum U.S. penitentiary in Florence, Colo., about an hour south of Colorado Springs, and is considered to be among the most secure sites in the United States.
Built in 1995 for $60 million, it is currently home to 402 inmates -- a veritable Who's Who of violent criminals who live in the most restrictive conditions in the country. Here are a few of the facility's most notorious residents whom 61-year-old Guzman would be joining.

Theodore Kaczynski
Known as the Unabomber, Kaczynski, 73, terrorized the country beginning in 1978. Over the next 17 years, he mailed or hand-delivered bombs that killed three people and injured two dozen. When his cabin in Montana was raided in 1996, federal agents found bomb-related items and 40,000 handwritten journal pages.
He pleaded guilty in 1998 and was given four life sentences.
Dzhokhar Tsarnaev
The Boston Marathon bomber was sentenced to death for killing three people and injuring more than 260 others in his explosives attack on April 15, 2013, near the race's finish line. The death penalty conviction was for two of the people killed in the bombing.
His brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, apparently killed the third victim days later in a shootout with police that also resulted in Tamerlan's death.
Dzhokhar, 25, has been at Supermax awaiting execution since 2015.
Richard Reid
Three months after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Reid boarded a plane in Paris that was headed to Miami. En route, he tried to detonate a bomb hidden in his shoe. Fellow passengers restrained him, and the flight landed in Boston, where Reid was arrested. Reid, who became known as the "shoe bomber," was convicted in 2003 after pleading guilty to felony counts that included attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction and attempted murder of passengers on an aircraft.
In his statement at his conviction, he said: "I am at war with your country. I'm at war with them not for personal reasons but because they have murdered so many children and they have oppressed my religion and they have oppressed people for no reason except that they say we believe in Allah."
U.S. District Judge William Young responded: "You are not an enemy combatant. You are a terrorist. You are not a soldier in any war. You are a terrorist. To give you that reference, to call you a soldier, gives you far too much stature. And we do not negotiate with terrorists. We do not sign documents with terrorists. We hunt them down one by one and bring them to justice. So war talk is way out of line in this court." Reid is 45.
Terry Nichols
He helped Timothy McVeigh commit what at the time was the deadliest terrorist attack on U.S. soil: the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City on April 19, 1995.
McVeigh was executed in 2001 for his part in the attack, which killed 168 people -- including 19 children. Nichols was convicted of criminal conspiracy and involuntary manslaughter in the deaths of eight federal law enforcement agents.
Nichols, 63, has been at Supermax since his conviction and hasn't had a quiet time there. He sued the prison in 2009 for not providing him with whole-grain foods and fresh raw vegetables and fruit in accordance with religious and dietary needs. The case was dismissed by a federal judge a year later. In 2015, he filed a petition asking the government to turn over seized weapons to his ex-wife. That effort failed, and the weapons were ordered destroyed.
Zacarias Moussaoui
He pleaded guilty in 2006 as a conspirator in the Sept. 11 attacks and was sentenced to life at Supermax. During his trial, it was revealed that he had bragged about his ties to Al Qaeda, but testimony and evidence also showed that FBI officials in Washington were skeptical that he was a threat to the country. He was in jail the day of the attacks -- arrested three weeks prior for overstaying a visa.
When he left court after sentencing, he yelled; "America, you lost!" But U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema, at his sentencing, had a different view.
"You came here to be a martyr, and to die in a great big bang of glory," she said. "But to paraphrase the poet T.S. Eliot, instead you will die with a whimper. The rest of your life you will spend in prison." Moussaoui is 50.
Ramzi Yousef
Convicted in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, Yousef has a terrorist track record that also includes the bombing of a Philippine Airlines flight in 1994 and a plot to bomb a U.S. airliner the following year.
He was convicted in 1997 for his role in the World Trade Center bombing, which left six dead. His sentence was life plus 240 years. He is 50.

Optimism in Economy Wanes. Will It Rally?

Texto completo: Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines -- and the power-brokers who shape them.
__________
The government shutdown and the late 2018 stock market tumult eroded confidence in the economy among business owners and consumers alike last month.
Now that the stock market has rallied and the government has reopened, will optimism about the economy rebound, or is the recent slide an indication of a more lasting shift?
In January, both the National Federation of Independent Business's optimism index for small businesses and the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index fell to their lowest levels since at least November 2016. And the Conference Board's index of consumer confidence posted its steepest decline over the past few months since 2011.
Those three indexes had jumped in the months after Donald J. Trump was elected president on optimism that his pro-business agenda of reduced taxes and regulation would ignite economic growth. The indexes peaked last year as the stock market marched to record highs, and despite the recent pullback, they remain at historically elevated levels.
Businesses, policymakers and investors often use sentiment surveys to evaluate the direction of the economy. If confidence is high, the thinking goes, business owners and consumers are more likely to open their wallets to make purchases, hire employees and expand their operations. If those same groups are worried about the future, they are more likely to curtail their spending.
But upward swings in sentiment do not necessarily translate into increased spending and economic growth. The economy, for instance, remained sluggish for more than a year after consumer and business confidence jumped in the months after the 2016 election.
Such indexes are also sensitive to short-term moves in the stock market and political developments that have little effect on spending.
Indications that sentiment is set to rebound are beginning to appear. Economic confidence recovered in a poll conducted in early February for The New York Times by the online research firm SurveyMonkey.
The University of Michigan releases a preliminary version of its survey roughly halfway through each month and then its final report at the end. Last month, the final figure, although the lowest since October 2016, showed a slight uptick from the preliminary version, which was released during the shutdown. Also, the survey's personal financial expectations index, considered a better indicator of household spending than the overall index, held up during the period.
The university will release its preliminary consumer sentiment index for February on Friday.
The report on small-business sentiment also offered reasons to think the slide in confidence may be temporary. Within the index, expectations among business owners about their sales and the overall economy had the biggest declines. But those segments typically have been the most sensitive to gyrations in the stock markets.
Meanwhile, expectations for business spending, which had slid sharply since August, stopped declining.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Michael Barone: Why are leading Democratic presidential candidates endorsing 'the green dream or whatever they call it?'

Texto completo: There’s an old joke about an egotistical politician whose disgruntled speechwriter, just before quitting, prepares a draft that promises the moon, and specifics for how to pay for it, on the first two pages. The third page is left blank, except for the words “you’re on your own now.”

That’s the position in which the "Green New Deal" package of freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s, D-N.Y., co-introduced by Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., has left several Democratic presidential candidates who had rushed to endorse it. AOC (as she’s often called) herself has tried to repudiate some of it as an early draft or even a Republican prank. Strangely, reporters from the New York Times and the Washington Post have indulged these false alibis.

Someone wrote the document, someone whose goal is to “achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions and” — incidentally — “create economic prosperity for all” in just 10 years.

One representative plank: “Build out high-speed rail at a scale where air travel stops becoming necessary.“ Another: “Create affordable public transit available to all, with goal to replace every combustion-engine vehicle.” A third: “Work with farmers and ranchers to create a sustainable, pollution and greenhouse gas free, system that ensures universal access to healthy food.”

Sounds kind of drastic. Especially if you sometimes fly several hours to vacation or visit relatives or if you drive an SUV or a pickup truck. Or if you eat meat from methane-emitting cattle or hogs.

But AOC’s folks, in the FAQ which they maintain was sent out by mistake (or something), assure voters that their goal is “net-zero, rather than zero emissions in 10 years, because we aren’t sure that we’ll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast.”

So, these same people who say they couldn’t put out the right press release assure us that they “can ramp up renewable manufacturing and power production, retrofit every building in America, build the smart grid, overhaul transportation and agriculture” in 10 years.

By this point, it should be apparent that the "Green New Deal" — “the green dream or whatever they call it,” in Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s words — is never going to happen. If you had any doubts, California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced this week that he was ditching his predecessor Jerry Brown’s controversial high-speed rail line which, as Newsom said, “would cost too much and take too long.” It was sold to voters in 2008 as costing $40 billion. The latest estimates were it will take $77 billion until completion in 2033.

But it’s worth reflecting on what the "Green New Deal" tells us about American leftists. Far from encouraging 21st-century technology, they want to abandon 20th-century technology (planes, non-electric autos) and go back to the 19th (trains). And far from accommodating individual choices, they want to boss everyone around.

Those family farmers they extol will have to wait to bring their products to town if their electric vehicles are out of juice because the wind isn’t blowing or the sun isn’t shining and if they’re still waiting for the “affordable public transit” to reach their farm. (Maybe they can use bike lanes?)

It’s not at all clear that coastal sophisticates will be content to be stuck on slow-moving trains and stuck off on sidings for 20 or so hours out in what they like to call Flyover Country, until someone cleverer than Gavin Newsom can gin up the federal printing press to pay for high-speed rail tracks between Manhattan and Hollywood.

Those on the political Left — whether struggling Generation Z bartenders from Queens or rich homeowners in Brentwood — share a withering contempt and thinly veiled hostility toward ordinary middle-income people: the ones raising families and shopping at malls and navigating enormous SUVs (needed for the kids’ car seats) into the fast-food carryout lanes.

Leftists love to confine vulgar people to rail lines — high-speed rail or urban subways — and force them into high-rise apartments which they design. They hate single-family-home suburbs and the automobile which lets ordinary people go where they want to go, when they want to, with as many stops as they like.

Voters feel differently. In France, where most people live beyond walking distance of the Paris Metro, the Yellow Vests have led a successful rebellion against a carbon tax, i.e., a tax on driving. In Washington state, voters last fall, even in the county that includes Seattle, soundly rejected a carbon tax last November.

Now, Markey says it’s unfair for Republicans to bring his own "Green New Deal" to the Senate floor. That's probably because even if the label polls well, he suspects that the substance won’t.

So, why have presidential candidates Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, and Elizabeth Warren endorsed this foolishness? Good question.

Texto completo: HARTFORD — The Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP) recently announced that the state has received approximately $1 million in funds from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that are available for communities, local conservation groups, and other organizations to improve water quality in lakes, rivers, and streams that are not meeting water quality standards. DEEP administers these grants and is now accepting proposals for fiscal year 2019.
“Protecting Connecticut’s waterways is at the core of our agency’s mission,” said DEEP Commissioner-designee Katie Dykes. “These funds will help to improve water quality by controlling nonpoint sources of water pollution, benefiting flora and fauna throughout our watersheds. Healthy and vibrant watersheds are key to ecotourism, which is a significant driver of economic activity in the state.”
The funding comes from Section 319 of the Federal Clean Water Act, which is a federal program to control nonpoint sources (NPS) of water pollution. Previous grants have supported projects for dam removals, conservation practices on farms, and treatments of polluted runoff. Proposals may be submitted by any interested public or private organization and must be received by April 3. Information can be found at http://www.ct.gov/deep/nps
Foundation scholarship forms available
Main Street Community Foundation invites area nonprofit organizations to apply for grants through its competitive General Grant Cycle. Local students are also invited to submit scholarship applications for 75 scholarship opportunities. All guidelines, eligibility criteria and links to the online applications are available on the Foundation’s website, www.mainstreetfoundation.org.

Library to host author discussion
SALISBURY — Geoffrey Brown, author and historian, will discuss his book, “The Lakeville Crucifix, a tale of prejudice and nativism,” Feb. 16 at 4 p.m. at the Scoville Memorial Library. The story relates the historical conflicts that occured in one small Connecticut town. The event is a collaboration of the Salisbury Association Historical Society (SAHS) and the Scoville Memorial Library
In the summer 1882 the rector of the recently built St Mary’s Church erected a life-sized crucifix on the front lawn of the church. By 1883 events in Lakeville became so controversial that they made the front page of The New York Times” and the Hartford Courant, and appeared in papers across the United States. The Times’ page one headline read “Lakeville Crucifix” and local historian Geoffrey Brown used it as the title of his new book about what has been called a “religious war.”
Brown unearths the history behind this long forgotten occurence and outlines the series of events that comprised the Lakeville Crucifix incident. According to Brown, “The most interesting aspects of the incident, were not the events themselves, but instead the collision of trends and movements taking place in Northwest CT and elsewhere in the United States during and prior to the incident.”
Brown recovers and re-publishes local history from New England and the Northeast, and first began doing so in the 1980s while he was employed at CitiBank.
For information and to attend, call the library at 860-435-2838 or visit ScovilleLibrary.org.
Historical society hosts program
SHARON — On Saturday, February 16 at 2 pm the Sharon Historical Society & Museum will host a free public guided tour of their new three room exhibit, “Sharon Cures: Centuries of Medicine in One Small Town,” with co-curators Marge Smith and Susan Shepard. Following the tour, guests are invited to hear and share recollections of local legend, the spitfire country doctor Josephine Evarts who practiced in Sharon and surrounding towns from 1929 to 1979.
The exhibit reveals the history of medicine in Sharon from 1738 when the town was founded in the unsettled part of colonial Connecticut to today’s Sharon Hospital in words, photos, and objects from the 18thh century through today. Visitors can learn about the very first doctors and their methods. The stunning but little known story of Sharon fighting its way through a small pox epidemic in 1784 using controversial small pox inoculations is told in documents and illustrations. An 1830’s doctor’s ledger of his daily calls and patient treatments is on display. Dr. William Coley, now recognized as the Father of Cancer Immunotherapy, was a Sharon resident. Contents of the 1900 medical bag of Sharon Hospital’s founder, Dr. Jerome Chaffee, are on display along with common quack medicines that people were using and doctors were fighting against. Today, the medical industry is the largest employer in Sharon, but the story of its evolution has never been told before in one place.
Smith and Shepard, award-winning curators and area historians, developed the exhibit from the Sharon Historical Society collections, extensive research in original town documents and with advice from Connecticut medical specialists.
The Sharon Historical Society & Museum is located at 18 Main Street, Sharon. For information, call 860-364-5688, visit www.sharonhist.org or the Sharon Historical Society on Facebook.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump likes to say that he hires only the best people and that his White House operates like a well-oiled machine.
But a steady stream of insider accounts flowing out of the West Wing suggests there's more madness than method to the president and his administration.
The most recent entries are two books that just hit best-seller lists, one by former White House aide Cliff Sims, the other by ex-New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a onetime Trump adviser.
OPPOSING VIEW: Donald Trump wasn’t elected to just be conventional
Sims dishes about Oval Office back-stabbing in his explicitly titled "Team of Vipers. " Christie's "Let Me Finish" laments Trump's choice of "amateurs, grifters, weaklings, convicted and unconvicted felons . . . hustled into jobs they were never suited for. "
The authors join a pantheon of disgruntled leakers or tattling ex-staffers telling tales of incompetence at the highest executive levels. Last week, someone handed Axios three months of Trump's daily schedule, revealing in mortifying detail how the president spends more than half of his workday in "executive time" activities such as watching TV, tweeting and making calls.
The consistent and growing evidence of internal dysfunction is growing increasingly difficult to ignore or explain away. Remember, these accounts aren't coming from Democrats or anti-Trump pundits. They're from people who have worked inside the administration and seen White House operations up close and personal:
► A senior Trump administration official, writing an anonymous column in The New York Times, characterized the president as "impetuous, adversarial, petty and ineffective," with decisions that are "half-baked, ill-informed and occasionally reckless. "
► Journalist Bob Woodward, in his best-selling book "Fear," diagnosed a White House suffering a "nervous breakdown," with aides stealing papers off Trump's desk to deter bad policy. Former Chief of Staff John Kelly was quoted as saying: "We're in Crazytown. "
► "Fire and Fury" by writer Michael Wolff and "Unhinged" by Omarosa Manigault Newman, the ex-White House aide and former television reality star, questioned the president's mental well-being.
Sprinkled throughout these tell-all tomes are unflattering assessments of the president by some of his top-drawer executives. Ex-Defense Secretary James Mattis, according to Woodward, said Trump comprehends like a "fifth- or sixth-grader. " And former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has never denied multiple reports that he labeled Trump a "moron. "
Trump and his supporters have questioned the credibility of some writers, or dismissed their accounts as sour grapes. But you have to wonder how so many aides who were hailed as brilliant choices on their way into the administration suddenly became incompetent hacks on their way out.
With more books in the pipeline, the Trump campaign is eager to try to enforce nondisclosure agreements signed by ex-staffers. What doesn't the White House want the public to know?
People who've served inside the Trump administration keep trying to warn the world that something is terribly awry. Americans ignore them at their peril.

The Spell of Tennessee Williams and His Lover

Texto completo: In his 1956 book "In the Winter of Cities," Tennessee Williams printed a small and exquisite poem titled "Little Horse," a tribute to his lover Frank Merlo. This poem ends:
Mignon he is or mignonette
avec les yeux plus grands que lui.
My name for him is Little Horse.
I wish he had a name for me.
Williams and Merlo were together from roughly 1947 to 1963, a stretch during which the playwright composed some of the American theater's enduring classics, including "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof," "Suddenly Last Summer" and "The Rose Tattoo."
Merlo was a working-class New Jersey boy from an Italian family and a charming young war hero. When they met, Tennessee Williams was already Tennessee Williams, flush from the success of "A Streetcar Named Desire," voluble and lit as if by klieg lights.
Not long into their relationship, Williams wrote in a letter to a friend: "Have I ever told you that I like Italians? They are the last of the beautiful young comedians of the world."
Williams and Merlo's years together are the subject of Christopher Castellani's blazing new novel, "Leading Men." Writing fiction is to no small degree a confidence game, and "Leading Men" casts a spell right from the start.
"Truman was throwing a party in Portofino," the first sentence reads, "and Frank wanted to go." This is Italy, 1953. You know Truman's last name without being told. What you've yet to learn is how reliably tender and evocative Castellani's onrushing prose can be.
His first achievement in "Leading Men" is to create a world, one inhabited largely by young, charming gay men, that seems to be comprised almost entirely of late nights and last cigarettes and picnics on good blankets and linen suits with the trousers rolled to the knees. This writer's scenes glitter, and they have a strong sexual pulse.
At the end of one party, in writing that has some of F. Scott Fitzgerald's opaline poise, Castellani observes: "Then, slowly, as the ashes fluttered away and the eggy firework smell wore off and the yachts cut their radios, couple by couple staggered back up the steep narrow inclines, men in each other's arms, men with women, packs of friends, their songs and shouts and laughter bouncing off the stone in hollow echoes."
His second achievement is to pry this milieu open and pour a series of intricate themes into it -- not merely the nature of fidelity and of the artistic impulse but also the manifold variety of estrangements and humiliations that come with being the lover of a much more famous and talented man.
Williams and Merlo drift aimlessly around Europe. Williams writes intensely (he had a fierce work ethic) and enjoys himself nearly as fulsomely.
Merlo is Williams's factotum and aide-de-camp. He makes the reservations and buys the tickets; he mends Williams's socks, plumps the pillows and goes on late-night pill runs. "It was a job in itself keeping track of who he was angry with, and who was jealous of him, whose parties he was looking forward to and whose they'd have to make up some excuse to get out of."
Merlo had a sense of humor about his position. In life, as in this novel, when asked what he did, he replied: "I sleep with Mr. Williams." Theirs was, for many years, a great love, one that Castellani describes as a "one-night stand that lasted 15 years -- or 16, or 14, depending on who told the story."
In John Lahr's agile 2014 biography, "Tennessee Williams: Mad Pilgrimage of the Flesh," Lahr notes that Merlo's other fundamental task was to tend to Williams through his "hysterical outbursts, his paranoia, his hypochondria."
"Leading Men" is largely told from the perspective of 10 years after its opening scene, when Merlo is dying from lung cancer in Manhattan and hoping Williams will visit.
The book wraps a second, slightly less successful story around this first one. It's about a fictional actress named Anja Blomgren whom Williams and Merlo meet in 1953. She goes on to become a Garbo-like film legend, adopting the name Anja Bloom. More centrally, in terms of this novel's plot, she comes to possess the only copy of a short, final, previously unknown Williams play, which he had sent to her before his death. A young man wants to have it produced.
Castellani hews closely to the facts of Williams and Merlo's time together without being pinned down by those facts. There is nothing dutiful about the reimagining of their lives. This book is a kind of poem in praise of pleasure, and those pleasures are sometimes stern. Its author knows a great deal about life; better, he knows how to express what he knows.
This novel's furniture is spare but well-placed. There are just enough pivotal scenes (one involves a pack of feral boys and the apparent rape of two women) that each leaves room for overlapping echoes to rebound.
Williams and Merlo were not monogamous. Williams once called crab lice his "occupational disease." Merlo cheated, too, sometimes in revenge. He grew distant and moody over time.
Men like Merlo were often scorned, even by other gay men. (Truman Capote once asked the poet James Merrill's lover, the writer and artist David Jackson, "Tell me, David, how much do you get a throw?")
The love Merlo and others felt for the great men in their lives was not recognized by society. Among this book's characters is the writer John Horne Burns (1916-1953). Burns's unanticipated death in this novel leaves his longtime male lover with this painful realization: "His name would never appear beside Jack's anywhere but private letters and the backs of photographs."
"Leading Men" has a few dead nodes in it and the subplot, involving the reclusive actress and a production of Williams's final play, generates fewer sparks than does the account of Williams and Merlo's dazzled propinquity.
But this is an alert, serious, sweeping novel. To hold it in your hands is like holding, to crib a line from Castellani, a front-row opera ticket.

President Undertakes a Desultory Search for a New Punching Bag

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The Democratic takeover of the House of Representatives was a blessing in disguise for a president who needed a foil, Republicans predicted last November. President Trump, who had only the press and the special counsel to battle with, they said, would find a useful antagonist in Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
It hasn't exactly turned out that way.
After a series of misadventures, Mr. Trump has conspicuously laid off personal attacks aimed at Ms. Pelosi. Even as the standoff over funding a border wall appears to be finally ending with a deal seen as a defeat for the president, he has blamed unnamed Democrats but not their most prominent leader. And there has been no undermining Trumpian nickname -- the president has said his moniker for Ms. Pelosi is, simply, "Nancy."
Mr. Trump, who once stalked Hillary Clinton, the former Democratic nominee, around the presidential debate stage and continues to encourage "lock her up" chants at his rallies more than two years later, simply gazed up at Ms. Pelosi during his State of the Union address -- and then found himself the target of ridicule for the picture of her giving him what appeared to be a dismissive clap of the hands.
"She has a unified Democratic caucus behind her, and she's not intimidated," said Representative Katherine M. Clark, Democrat of Massachusetts. "I don't think that Donald Trump has run into that too often in his life, and he doesn't know quite what to make of it all."
Without his anticipated punching bag, Mr. Trump has been left searching for an alternative, delivering haphazard attacks on Democrats as they announce their presidential campaigns, trial-and-error hits on an inchoate field of 2020 contenders.
The question is whether a strategy of personal attacks that helped lift Mr. Trump to victory in 2016 will work when there's no clear political opponent who rises above the rest.
"Amy Klobuchar announced that she is running for President, talking proudly of fighting global warming while standing in a virtual blizzard of snow, ice and freezing temperatures," Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter on Sunday. "Bad timing. By the end of her speech she looked like a Snowman(woman)!"
Giving it right back, Ms. Klobuchar responded, "I wonder how your hair would fare in a blizzard?"
On Saturday, Mr. Trump officially welcomed Senator Elizabeth Warren to the presidential field, writing on Twitter: "Today Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to by me as Pocahontas, joined the race for President. Will she run as our first Native American presidential candidate, or has she decided that after 32 years, this is not playing so well anymore? See you on the campaign TRAIL, Liz!"
At a rally in El Paso on Monday night, Mr. Trump attacked Beto O'Rourke, the former Texas congressman who is considering a presidential bid. "We were challenged by a young man who lost an election to Ted Cruz," Mr. Trump said. "They said, 'Hey, you're supposed to win in order to run.' By the way we -- I -- I'm one for one."
Democratic operatives predicted Mr. Trump's attempts to personally demonize his political opponents won't work when it's not one on one.
"He's better with a foil, but unless he can hone in on one or two people, it ends up being less than the sum of its parts," said Brian Fallon, a former press secretary for Mrs. Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign. "If he's scattershot weighing in on everyone who announces a presidential campaign, it's not going to have the intended effect."
Mr. Trump's allies disagree. "The Democratic field is both undefined and starting out with positions on the far left," said Raj Shah, a former White House spokesman who is now advising Mr. Trump's 2020 campaign. "Raising the profile of these out-of-touch positions and their controversies plays to the president's advantage."
Some of Mr. Trump's attacks appear to be doing just that. Ms. Warren, whom Mr. Trump has long viewed as an easy target, has apologized for identifying herself as Native American for two decades, essentially admitting that she did what Mr. Trump has accused her of: misrepresenting her race.
Republican National Committee officials said they credited Mr. Trump with forcing the Native American issue back to the forefront. "The president reignited the conversation about her false Native American heritage claims last year, and she still can't move past it," said Ronna McDaniel, the committee's chairwoman.
But in general, his denigration of Democratic presidential candidates is not being guided by any field data from his campaign about who his most viable opponent is, and what the candidates' biggest weaknesses are, according to a campaign operative.
Trump officials said they viewed Senator Cory Booker, Senator Kamala Harris and Ms. Warren as the three most viable candidates, so far, to enter the race. But Mr. Trump has not landed on a strategy for diminishing Ms. Harris, and has praised her instead. "I would say, the best opening so far would be Kamala Harris," Mr. Trump said in an interview with The New York Times last month. "Better crowd, better enthusiasm. Some of the others were very flat."
Meanwhile, he has weighed in on candidates considered second tier, as well as those who have yet to enter the race.
Ms. Klobuchar's snow-blanketed kickoff rally turned into a briefly viral moment that Mr. Trump simply couldn't pass up, the operative said. His strikes against former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who has yet to decide whether he will run, appear to be in the workshop phase.
"When I say something that you might think is a gaffe, it's on purpose; it's not a gaffe," Mr. Trump said at a recent off-the-record lunch with network anchors. "When Biden says something dumb, it's because he's dumb."
Rather than individuals, Mr. Trump's campaign operatives, meanwhile, are hoping to elevate Democratic positions that seem out of step with the mainstream, like a 70 percent top tax rate, abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement and questioning American support for Israel.
The only presidential tweet backed by political advice, they said, was Mr. Trump's broadside against the "Green New Deal," an ambitious Democratic proposal that seeks to combat climate change by calling for the United States to eliminate additional carbon emissions by 2030.
Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump's campaign manager, discussed the Green New Deal with Mr. Trump, an aide said, citing it as an example of a vulnerability for Democrats, and a way to brand them as "socialists."
"I think it is very important for the Democrats to press forward with their Green New Deal," Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter on Saturday. "It would be great for the so-called 'Carbon Footprint' to permanently eliminate all Planes, Cars, Cows, Oil, Gas & the Military -- even if no other country would do the same. Brilliant!"

As if trying out an alternative target, on Sunday he went after Amy Klobuchar, who is running for president.

Texto completo: It never fails. You can almost set your watch to it.

If a Democrat does or says something incredibly, perhaps irredeemably, stupid or vicious, you can bet good money major newsrooms will ignore it for as long as it takes for their reporters to make the story about the supposed conservative overreaction. To be clear, the problem with the “Republicans pounce” trope isn’t merely that newsrooms report on the conservative reaction. Reaction articles are fine! The issue is that newsrooms often won’t touch a story that reflect poorly on Democrats at all until it can be made into something broader about how Republicans and conservatives are supposedly exploiting the moment.

Call it the “Republicans pounce” or “Republicans seize” trope.

This weekend, for example, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., lied about the rollout of her preposterous "Green New Deal,” which included the circulation of numerous “frequently asked questions” sheets.

The FAQs pages from her office claimed, among other things, that the "GND" aims to lower fossil fuel emissions to “net-zero, rather than zero emissions, in 10 years because we aren’t sure that we’ll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast.” The FAQs also boasted that the House resolution would provide “economic security for all who are unable or unwilling to work.” Neither cow farts nor “unwilling to work” are included in the actual resolution co-sponsored by more than 100 Democratic lawmakers.

The FAQs were rightly ridiculed and mocked by critics, and even supporters, of Ocasio-Cortez’s proposal. But rather than own up to authoring the ludicrous documents, the congresswoman and her team initially denied all involvement, alleging instead a vast right-wing disinformation campaign.

Ocasio-Cortez later backed away from pinning the FAQs on nefarious interlopers, and her team has mostly admitted to writing the language included in the accompanying materials to the "GND." But they’re still pushing the line that the GOP and its supporters also distributed “doctored” versions of documents her staff made publicly available. The “doctored” defense, which isn’t even the first time that Ocasio-Cortez has gone down this road, is meant to confuse and obscure the truth that she is responsible personally for saying or doing something abjectly ignorant.

But never fear, congresswoman! The press is here to run interference on your behalf.

Following Ocasio-Cortez’s obvious attempt to mislead the public this weekend, the New York Times published a headline that reads, “Ocasio-Cortez Team Flubs a Green New Deal Summary, and Republicans Pounce.”

The article actually reads:

"Over the weekend her staff backed away from the document, saying it was incomplete and had been published by accident, after Republicans pounced on the plan, citing a blog post of frequently asked questions. That post included language that called for economic security “for all who are unable or unwilling to work.”"

This is a classic iteration of the “Republicans seize” cliche, not just because it makes the GOP the focus of Ocasio-Cortez's botched rollout but because "Republicans seizing" is the first, and presumably last, time the newspaper has made any mention of the congresswoman's bungling and dishonesty. The only other in-depth reporting the Times has on Ocasio-Cortez introducing the "GND" is an article titled, “Liberal Democrats Formally Call for a ‘Green New Deal,’ Giving Substance to a Rallying Cry."

It’s a bad joke at this point. If a story reflects poorly on Democrats, chances are you won’t hear about. Not until Republicans “pounce," that is.

Texto completo: Stock buybacks have never been more popular on Wall Street -- or more vilified in Washington.
Companies spent $1 trillion buying their own shares last year, but the corporate-finance tactic gets no love from Sens. Chuck Schumer and Bernie Sanders. They want to restrict buybacks unless a company pays workers at least $15 an hour and offers pensions, health care and paid sick leave.
Their proposal, described in a New York Times op-ed, modifies an earlier Democratic bill that would have banned buybacks outright. Both approaches reflect a misunderstanding of how buybacks work.
Sanders and Schumer argue that instead of repurchasing shares, companies should be investing in their businesses -- hiring workers, building factories and so on. The trouble is, there's no evidence that buybacks lead companies to skimp on such investments.
No firm would stay in business long if it passed up profitable investment opportunities, but we shouldn't want managers making iffy bets for the sake of empire-building. Better to return cash to shareholders than use it to buy a spare corporate jet, or make an acquisition that's likely to destroy value.
That's all buybacks are: a way of returning cash to investors. Sanders and Schumer refer to them as "corporate self-indulgence," but they actually impose discipline on management.
"If it sits around in the firm, cash has a tendency to burn a hole in managers' pockets," says Mark Leary, associate professor of finance at Washington University's Olin Business School. "From a shareholder value perspective, you should return excess cash to shareholders."
Those shareholders typically reinvest the cash in other companies -- including younger firms that are, in fact, making capital investments and hiring workers.
"If a company has no attractive projects, it's better to return that cash to shareholders than to expand its operations just for the sake of expanding," says Stan Veuger, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute. "Shareholders typically reinvest the money their portfolio throws off."
A buyback ban would make our capital markets less efficient while doing nothing to create jobs or raise workers' wages. The version proposed by Schumer and Sanders also would discriminate against certain industries.
Firms that employ mostly high-wage workers, such as Apple or JPMorgan Chase, might qualify for buybacks. The majority of companies probably would not. Technology and financial companies' shares would rise at the expense of firms -- and their workers -- in lower-wage sectors like retailing and food service.
Charles Cuny, an Olin School senior lecturer, points out another unintended consequence: "If stock buybacks are important ... then a firm with sub-$15-an-hour employees might be tempted to subcontract the associated work out of the firm, in order to avoid this constraint."
In other words, never underestimate businesses' ability to find ways around a flawed law. Schumer and Sanders already anticipate that companies might return cash to shareholders by paying higher dividends, so they write that Congress "should seriously consider policies to limit the payout of dividends."
That's dangerous thinking. The value of a company's shares lies in the stream of future cash an investor expects them to produce. If you restrict both dividends and buybacks, it becomes very hard to unlock that cash.
In such a world, companies have a harder time raising money on the stock market and investors face lower returns in their mutual funds, IRAs and 401(k) plans.
Sanders and Schumer may be trying to strike a blow against inequality, but what they're proposing would instead be a blow to prosperity.

Music's Quill revisits Elizabethan era The ensemble of early music performs John Dowland's 'First Book of Songs' in Portland.

Texto completo: Music's Quill, the flexible early music ensemble led by lutenist Timothy Burris, has shown itself to be comfortable, and persuasive, in a broad repertory that runs from the late Medieval through the Baroque eras, and in the various national styles that arose during that five-century period. But within that, the group has a special affinity for the music of Elizabethan England, a rich repertory, suffused with a delicious current of melancholy, offset by a lively, playful amorous side.
Reasonable listeners can disagree about who the greatest Elizabethan composer was. A good case could be made for William Byrd, on the strength of the breadth of his output, both sacred and secular. But John Dowland has his partisans as well. Though his output did not match the variety of Byrd's - largely because Byrd had a court position, something Dowland sought unsuccessfully all his life - Dowland was the greatest lutenist of the age, and England's greatest song composer before Purcell.
Last season, Music's Quill devoted an evening to Dowland's "Second Book of Songs" (1600), giving beautifully shaped accounts of the book's 22 pieces. On Saturday evening, the same musicians returned to the small, round chapel in St. Luke's Cathedral with that work's predecessor, the "First Book of Songs" (1597).
For me, the "First Book" is the best of Dowland's four published song collections. Like the "Second Book," it includes 21 songs and a lute work. Granted, the "Second Book" includes Dowland's signature piece, "Flow My Tears," the vocal version of his "Lachrymae Pavan." But the "First Book" is packed with melodically rich, harmonically adventurous, lyrically clever songs about love (mostly unrequited) and death, the Elizabethans' favorite preoccupations.
Many are still in the repertories of singers beyond the early music world - among them, "Unquiet Thoughts," "Can She Excuse My Wrongs," "If My Complaints Could Passions Move," "Come Again" and "Come, Heavy Sleep," the last of which is the basis of Benjamin Britten's extraordinary solo guitar work, "Nocturnal" (1963).
For anyone in need of a refresher on the scoring conventions of the day, Dowland's collections were printed as "table books," with as many as five melody lines and a lute accompaniment, each printed facing a different direction so that performers sitting around the table could easily read one of the parts. The performing forces were whoever was available: A song could be performed by a lutenist and one singer, five singers taking one melody line each, or instrumentally by groups of gamba or recorder players, or even a keyboardist, working from the lute and top vocal line.
Music's Quill adopted the same configuration that worked so well last year, with tenor Timothy Neill Johnson accompanied by Burris on lute and Todd Borgerding on viola da gamba. For the most part, these were straightforward readings, each song presented with all its verses (performers sometimes drop one or two), and with often subtle ornamentation providing variety along the way.
Johnson, interestingly, performed most of the concert seated between Burris and Borderding, creating a closer sense of ensemble than is typical when a singer stands, yet sacrificing nothing in tone or vocal power. He also brought a fine sense of drama to the proceedings, endowing his brisk account of "If My Complaints Could Passions Move" with an energy that added emotional weight to those complaints. At the other end of the expressive spectrum, he brought a sublimely despondent sensibility and sound to "Go Crystal Tears" and an exquisite sense of resignation to "Come, Heavy Sleep."
Other pieces stood out for their interpretive inventiveness. The book's lute work, "My Lord Chamberlaine His Galliard," appears with the instruction "for two to play on one lute." Instead, Burris and Borgerding shared the honors, with Borgerding plucking (rather than bowing) the melody line on the gamba.
Borgerding also took a solo in "Now, O Now, I Needs Must Part," taking a verse for an appealing, improvisation on the song's melody. And Johnson was at his most daring in a reading of "Come Again" that began more slowly than is typical, but unfolded with a rhythmic flexibility that let him convey, with a visceral immediacy, the shifting passions and amorous enticements of the text.
Burris and company have not committed to a full Dowland cycle, but there are only two more books - the "Third Book of Songs" (1603) and "A Pilgrim's Solace" (1612) - and about five concerts' worth of solo lute works. That could take us to the 400th anniversary of Dowland's death, in 2026.

Editorial: Boards were right to reject Ascent charter school

Texto completo: Numerous aspects of the charter school applications recently submitted by Ascent Classical Academy Flatirons to Boulder Valley School District and Adams 12 Five Star Schools are attractive and no doubt appeal to some families in the district. The school would offer a classical education in the liberal arts and sciences with an emphasis on the great Western traditions going back to ancient Greece and emphasizing the intellectual touchstones of American political philosophy. Ascent aspires not just to develop young minds but also foster good character, training students "to live virtuous lives."
Hard to argue with that.
But the school's submission was inadequate in many ways and left too many unanswered questions. That is why the BVSD board made the right decision late last month when it denied the application. Adams 12 did the same thing last month. Ascent has appealed the decision to the state Board of Education, which should uphold the well-reasoned and appropriate denials.
The list of the application's shortcomings is long. It sought waivers from many of the school districts' policies without sufficiently explaining why. It fell short in describing how it would recruit and serve a diverse student population, including minority students and those with disabilities. It left many doubts about the level of parent and community involvement that would be possible at the school as well as the transparency of school board meetings. It raised significant questions about Ascent's ability to maintain a productive relationship with the school district. And it failed to demonstrate parent involvement in the initial idea to locate an Ascent school in Boulder County — the BVSD denial resolution says, "The application does not mention any involvement by parents with respect to the preparation of this application and the development of the school."
Derec Shuler, head of Ascent, in a guest commentary published in the Daily Camera, said that 625 students had signed up for the school, but added that the school had "been up-front with BVSD about parent demand coming from a wide area" beyond the district. In fact, Ascent gives the impression of an institution foisting itself on the district rather than one that was developed to meet local demand, and its background goes some way toward explaining the withholding approach organizers took with their attempt to build a school in east Boulder County.
Ascent representatives told Adams 12 that they collected "536 expressions of interest" as of Dec. 18, but board members questioned the general way the question was posed: "are you in favor of high quality school options in the Flatiron region" versus "would you enroll your child in Ascent Classical Academy Flatirons if it is approved by the board?"
Ascent proposes to operate under a charter management agreement with Golden-based Ascent Classical Academies. The school would replicate an education model implemented in two other Ascent schools in Colorado: Golden View Classical Academy in Golden and Ascent Classical Academy of Douglas County. Shuler, who leads the steering committee that's shepherding the Boulder Ascent school through development, is director of ACA and founder of the Golden school. Others on the steering committee are employees of either ACA or one of the two existing Ascent schools, except for Heidi Ganahl, a conservative CU regent, and Rob Williams, a Douglas County resident.
State law allows a charter school to contract with an education management provider, such as ACA, but the school's governing board must maintain independence from that provider. There's ample reason to doubt that's possible in Ascent's case. How can Shuler maintain independence from the very organization he directs?
Ascent's provenance actually goes way beyond Golden — all the way to Hillsdale College, in Michigan, and the college's Barney Charter School Initiative, which promotes the founding of classical charter schools like Ascent. Hillsdale's stated mission is, in part, to maintain "the immemorial teachings and practices of the Christian faith." (The name Ascent is an apparent allusion to Jesus' ascension.) The college's president, Larry Arnn, endorsed then-candidate Donald Trump in 2016. Vice President Mike Pence and the far-right Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas have given recent Hillsdale commencement addresses. Its alumni have jobs throughout the Trump administration. The school refuses public money and therefore avoids Title IX guidelines on sex discrimination and sexual assault protocols, the New York Times reported . "It has refused to engage in the otherwise required reporting on student race and ethnicity, let alone develop an affirmative action plan," the Times reported. "Openly gay or lesbian students are a rarity, and The Princeton Review consistently ranks Hillsdale among the 20 least LGBTQ-friendly campuses."
What does this have to do with the Ascent in the Broomfield and Boulder areas? Plenty, unfortunately.
Hillsdale would be the primary source of the Ascent staff's professional development, according to the school's applications. The college would supply "principal mentoring, development of curriculum, teacher education, and visits to advise on the operation of the school."
The Ascent organizers hold up Golden View as a credit to their cause in Boulder. That school was approved in 2015 by a conservative Jefferson County school board that was deemed so out of touch with constituents that voters recalled three members that year . The Colorado Independent reported that the school's family handbook states that "sexual intercourse will only be discussed in the context of a monogamous relationship between two people of opposite sexes," and that abstinence is the only "100 percent safe approach to sex." Condoms would be discussed "only with respect to their limited effectiveness in prevention of sexually transmitted diseases." As the Independent reported, this all appears to contravene state sex education law, which requires lessons on contraception and for the material to be meaningful for gay and transgender, as well as straight, students.
Golden View had been granted a waiver on the state's sexual education mandates, but it had agreed to abide by the law's intent, the Independent reported. In Ascent's applications, it similarly sought a waiver from the Comprehensive Human Sexuality Education state statute. Its explanation of why it wants the waiver is a one-sentence affirmation that it will meet state standards on the subject. It's not reassuring.
The Ascent organizers have sometimes appeared dismissive of the charter application process, and Shuler has been explicit about wanting to take away a school district's very ability to approve charter schools. "We need to support the expansion of high quality charter options by helping to end exclusive chartering authority in Colorado," Shuler said during an address last year in Denver at the Western Conservative Summit. "This is what gives local school boards exclusive rights to approve or limit charter schools and other publicly funded options."
He's not looking specifically to expand school options in the Broomfield and Boulder areas. He's out to transform the American education system. No wonder he might chafe at BVSD and Adams 12 charter policies.
When it made its original submission last August, the Ascent application was so incomplete the BVSD school board declined even to review it . The application sought waivers from 401 of 419 district policies without offering reasons or replacement plans. The charter organizers appealed that decision to the state Board of Education, which by a 5-2 vote ordered BVSD to review the application . Boulder Valley Superintendent Rob Anderson, in a sign of cooperation, announced that he would recommend approval , but with some conditions. By the time BVSD voted on the application last month, Ascent had frustrated Anderson's hopes. "I was optimistic that, given Ascent's stated desire to be part of our community, they would understand our position and accept the conditions we put forth as a measure of good faith to our future partnership," Anderson said. "Three weeks later my perspective has changed. Instead of embracing what we asked for, Ascent has asked for no conditions."

State and local charter application policies are in place not to create arbitrary roadblocks or provide some pretext for a denial but to ensure that publicly-funded schools are accountable to the community and serve the best interests of students in a fair and equitable manner. Ascent's advocates might argue that the Boulder application was denied because of some bias against the school model or prejudice against a perceived political bent, but the application's weaknesses justified rejection.
That's too bad. It's likely that a classical education would be an excellent match for many students in the Broomfield and Boulder communities. The organizers might consider a private model for Ascent. But any school that takes money from district taxpayers must adequately demonstrate that it can serve a diverse student body, value transparency and community engagement, and adopt a secular curriculum that respects all members of society. That's not too much to ask — and, when it hears Ascent's new appeal, that's what the state board of education must demand.

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
There were graceful Great Danes, curious German shepherds and regal Rhodesian Ridgebacks. There were Lord Tareyton and Lady Gretchen and Buster and Mingus; tiny terriers and yawning cocker spaniels and snow-covered poodles; dogs in strollers and dogs in goggles, dogs on playgrounds and in sunroofs and on airplanes; goldendoodles that stared into your soul and briards that tugged at the heartstrings.
The dogs -- specifically, the good dogs of New York -- could be found in a treasure trove of photos in The New York Times's archives.
This week, 20 of them were brought back to life in the latest installment of Past Tense, an archival storytelling project from The Times that uses the archive's six million photos, dating back to 1896, to tell new stories. This selection shows the historical relationship between New Yorkers and their dogs.
"Part of what you see in the chronicles of the paper is how much dogs are citizens of New York," said Veronica Chambers, the editor of Past Tense. "They become part of our community, and people recognize dogs."
While other Past Tense stories have re-examined important moments in history, this project was more serendipitous. The Times's morgue is not organized such that a search for "dog" will turn up all dogs; but the dogs showed up when the team least expected it.
Dogs appeared in archival images that ran the gamut -- in President Calvin Coolidge's famed menagerie; trudging through New York's blizzards and manning its newsstands; peeking out from under voting booths during elections -- and editors couldn't help but take notice.
"That's what I kind of love about this archive," said Megan Paetzhold, one of six people who has spent the past six months working to scan and digitize six million photos from the morgue. "You can tell that it developed out of the immediacy of news."
As a dog lover (to which her collie mix, Hamida, can attest), Ms. Paetzhold couldn't resist sharing the dogs she encountered with her colleagues in an internal chat. And so the collection of potential images for the story of New York's dogs slowly grew larger and larger.
Ms. Paetzhold and her colleagues have been making their way through about 1,500 drawers full of photos. One fateful day a few months ago, she hit upon numbers 191 and 192. In them: a combined 4,000 dog photos, going back to the 1940s.
"I stumbled across that drawer on accident, and it was the happiest day of my life," she said.
To narrow down the thousands of dog photos to the 20 that made the final article, editors looked for funny, light images; striking ones; and ones that "spoke to being a dog in New York," said Jessie Wender, a Times photo editor. They also sought photos that spoke to the ways dogs have always affected humans.
"Dogs break boundaries in New York," Ms. Chambers said. "It breaks down the guard we have up with each other."
New York has a rich history with dogs, which made it fitting to narrow the scope of the project to just this city's pooches. The first professional dog walker is believed to have worked on Manhattan's Upper East Side in the 1960s. And the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, happening this week, has been held in the city since 1877. Dogs have appeared in the pages of The Times since 1851, when the paper was founded, and their photos since the 1890s (when The Times covered Klondike races).
Some trends are evident, like the German shepherds, Doberman pinschers and other guard dogs that seemed to overtake the streets in the more dangerous New York of the 1960s and 1970s. But other aspects of the human-canine relationship are timeless.
"People have always been kind of crazy about their dogs," Ms. Paetzhold said. "There's photos of people in the '50s with their dogs in strollers, walking around New York City. I love that. It's like people have always been really extra with their dogs."
As they narrowed the final images, the Past Tense team held a round-table meeting of dog aficionados -- the photographer Landon Nordeman, whose photographs of the Westminster Dog Show established his career in portraiture, fashion and street photography; the artist and writer Maira Kalman, whose illustrations regularly appear on the cover of The New Yorker; Amanda Hess, a New York Times critic, who has written about how dogs and cats have been represented in culture; the artist and writer Jeff Hamada, who created the Instagram account @chillwildlife; the Times archivist Jeff Roth; Lydia DesRoche, who trains animals for Broadway and theater; and Sheila Bridges, an interior designer and animal lover. They were joined by one special guest expert: Grace, a boisterous, modern-day Jack Russell terrier.
The group discussed the photos amid Grace's intermittent whines and yaps as she moved from lap to lap, eyeing the box of treats at the room's center. As the group pondered the differences between cats and dogs, Grace's eyes darted around the room.
"Looking at Grace right now, every single second, she has a different expression on her face," said Andy Newman, a Times reporter who wrote the Pet City column until 2017. He added that while cats' expressions run a limited range -- "There's 'You've got to be kidding me' or 'I hate you' or 'Give me food,"' he said -- dogs' "emotions and thoughts show immediately in their faces."
But cat lovers, too, can rejoice, because their feline companions will be the subject of their own Past Tense project in the near future.

Texto completo: A special guest to the State of the Union address (SOTU) was invited by First Lady Melania Trump as an example of someone who was called names and bullied.
He is Joshua Trump, 11, from Delaware. Apparently, other kids called him names because of his last name. No, he is not related to the president.
Attending the SOTU speech was Pocahontas, Little Marco, Crazy Maxine Waters, Lyin' Ted. Likely watching on TV was Crooked Hillary, Little Rocket Man, Low Energy Jeb, the Failing New York Times and 17 angry Democrats.
Yes, name calling and bullying should be condemned. The president should perhaps listen to his wife. For once.

O Canada, you stand steadfast

Texto completo: After the Canadian foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, tweeted concern about Saudi Arabia's imprisoning of a women's rights activist, the crown prince there seemed to go nuts.
Saudi Arabia announced that it was expelling Canada's ambassador, halting flights to Canada, ending purchases of Canadian wheat, recalling students from Canada and selling off Canadian assets. Did the United States or other Western countries stand up for an old friend and ally, Canada?
Not a bit.
Yet Canada stuck to its principles. When a young Saudi woman, Rahaf Mohammed Alqunun, fled to Bangkok last month and warned that she would be killed by her family if she was forced home, it was Canada that again braved Saudi fury by accepting her.
Freeland was at the airport to welcome Alqunun as a "very brave new Canadian." And Prime Minister Justin Trudeau didn't mince words, saying, "We'll stand up for human rights and women's rights around the world."
Canada may be one of the world's more boring countries, as yawn-inspiring as sensible shoes, but it's also emerging as a moral leader of the free world.
There's no one else. The United States under President Donald Trump is on a nationalist tear. Britain's leaders seem determined to drag their people over a Brexit precipice. France is distracted by protests. Germany is preparing for succession.
So Canada is stepping up.
During the worst of the Syrian refugee crisis, President Barack Obama admitted just 12,000 Syrians and provoked a furious backlash, including Trump's Muslim ban. Canada accepted 40,000 Syrians, with Trudeau appearing at the airport to hand out winter coats to these new Canadians.
All around the world, doors to refugees were clanging shut. But Canadians were so eager to sponsor Syrians that organizations were clamoring for more of them.
Trump gets headlines with his periodic threats to invade Venezuela to topple President Nicolás Maduro, but Canada has been quietly working since 2017 to help organize the Lima Group of 14 nations pushing for democracy in Venezuela. When Canada recognized the opposition leader Juan Guaidó as interim president, he won credibility because nobody sees Ottawa as an imperialist conspirator.
Canada has spoken up about the mass detention of about 1 million Muslims in the Xinjiang region of China even as Muslim countries have mostly kept mum, and it detained a Chinese executive at the request of the American government. China retaliated by arresting Canadians and sentencing one to death, but Canada is sticking to its guns - even as Trump undercut Canada by suggesting that the case against the executive might be dropped for political reasons.
For aid programs in the developing world, countries usually try to finance big, glamorous projects that will get lots of attention. Instead, Canada champions programs that are extremely cost-effective but so deathly boring that they will never be discussed on TV - initiatives like iodizing salt to prevent mental impairment.
Whenever I say something nice about Canada, I get indignant emails from Canadian friends pointing out the country's shortcomings (which are real). Fortunately, Canadians don't seem capable of mean emails. Not even of mean tweets. One study found that Americans' tweets are loaded with curses and words like "hate": Canadians' tweets are larded with "awesome," "amazing" and "great."
Today there's a vacuum of constructive global leadership. Canada may be incapable of a mean tweet, but it's tough when necessary - and it may be the leader the world needs.

Bad news, readers: Spiegel &amp; Grau closes, Wattpad launches imprint

Texto completo: Two stories that came across my radar in the same recent week suggest something about the future of books and publishing.
The first story was the announcement that Wattpad, a popular app for the posting of fan fiction and original stories is launching Wattpad Books, a publishing division that will use their "Story DNA Machine Learning technology to take 'the guesswork' out of the publishing equation," as Wattpad CEO Allen Lau told The New York Times.
The other story announced the closing of Penguin Random House imprint, Spiegel & Grau.
I try my hardest to resist my curmudgeonly tendencies, but neither of these is good news.
The average reader likely doesn't pay much attention to a book's imprint, a subdivision within a larger publisher granted to editors of particular accomplishment and influence. Cindy Spiegel and Julie Grau individually and then together have been responsible for books like "Orange is the New Black," "The Kite Runner," as well as works by Brene Brown, Suze Orman, the Beastie Boys and even Gary "Baba Booey" Dell'Abbate, producer of the Howard Stern Show.
Their imprint was also the home of Chris Jackson, who Vinson Cunningham of The New York Times credits with "building a black literary movement" by publishing such writers as Ta-Nehisi Coates and Bryan Stevenson ("Just Mercy"). Jackson has gone on to helm an imprint of his own at Penguin Random House, One World.
A publishing imprint is an embodiment of a particular editorial sensibility, even when those sensibilities range from highly literary to Artie Lange ("Too Fat to Fish") as was the case at Spiegel & Grau. Imprints are personal, human, the product of individual passions and reflective of the individual quirks we all have inside of us.
The Wattpad algorithm, on the other hand, will crunch and munch the "opinions of 70 million users" to see "what's resonating with them as a starting point," according to Ashleigh Gardner, who will oversee the new publishing initiative.
Wattpad claims this will correct for the "monoculture" of the publishing industry.
I can testify from experience that it can be frustrating to find the right editor to say yes to publishing your book. As the author of several unpublished novels, it's tempting to believe that if one could just bypass the gatekeepers and get to the people themselves, accolades will surely commence.
And like any industry, the upper echelons can perhaps get a little insulated, but to believe that publishing is a monoculture is to never have walked into a single bookstore and seen the incredible diversity of titles. Granted, it's a diversity that still could improve, but that happens through the intentional efforts of editors like Julie Grau, Cindy Spiegel and Chris Jackson.
Our algorithms, on the other hand, are more than willing to bake in existing status quo biases while hiding those biases under a sheen of "math." Please don't mistake these algorithms for anything like objective or democratic processes.
More importantly, books are not like other commodities. Even when a book is loved by many readers, each of those individuals may love it for a different, sometimes unknowable reason. Writer and publishing industry veteran Maris Kreizman reminded us of this in a 2017 essay, declaring, "The best things in life are unquantifiable," while telling the reader how she found both a husband and dog when she turned away from the algorithmic intrusions of Tinder and Petfinder.
Not all technological interventions are, by definition, progress.
If we're not careful, we'll filter our way right out of the experiences we find most meaningful.

Book recommendations from the Biblioracle
John Warner tells you what to read next based on the last five books you've read.

1. "The Witch Elm" by Tana French
2. "The House of Broken Angels" by Luis Alberto Urrea
3. "Norwegian Wood" by Haruki Murakami
4. "The Privileges" by Jonathan Dee
5. "Arcadia" by Lauren Groff
-- Emily J., Chicago
I'd be curious to see how Emily responds to "Conversations with Friends" by Sally Rooney, a novel I'm not even sure I liked, but which I seem to keep thinking about from time to time, even though I finished it months ago. What's up with that?

1. "The Killer Inside Me" by Jim Thompson
2. "I Am Legend" by Richard Matheson
3. "House of Leaves" by Mark Z. Danielewski
4. "Gould's Book of Fish" by Richard Flanagan
5. "Milkman" by Anna Burns
-- Peter D., Freeport, Ill.
Peter doesn't seem to mind the "difficult" or off-the-beaten-path books, so I'm going to reach deep into my shelves and pull out a short story collection that I'm not sure I've ever heard of anyone else reading: "Camouflage" by Murray Bail.

1. "The Incendiaries" by R.O. Kwon
2. "Killing Commendatore" by Haruki Murakami
3. "The Wife" by Meg Wolitzer
4. "Transcription" by Kate Atkinson
5. "Becoming" by Michelle Obama
-- Elizabeth B., Wilmette
It's mostly fiction on this list, but I'm recommending Susan Orlean's "The Library Book," because it's absolutely delightful and there isn't a human alive who would write into a columnist asking for a book recommendation who wouldn't love this book.

Sublime sushi at a contentious address

Texto completo: If you're a raw fish fancier and can accommodate a splurge, forget - if you can - the location of the restaurant I'm here to tell you about. Good sushi counters are easy enough to find in Washington. Great ones have the power to transport you to a different realm.
Perhaps you've already heard about Sushi Nakazawa. The restaurant, introduced last summer, is a branch of a same-named Japanese retreat in New York that garnered four stars, an "extraordinary" rating, from the New York Times in 2013. Counter seats at the original remain a precious commodity. An admired chef will do that to a stretch of seating. No less than Daisuke Nakazawa, a character in the acclaimed documentary "Jiro Dreams of Sushi," lends his name to the brand.
The Washington spinoff benefits from the talent of Masaaki Uchino, Nakazawa's acolyte. Trained in his native Japan, Uchino met his mentor in Seattle and helped open Sushi Nakazawa in New York. Uchino's stage is fronted with 10 tall stools, into which guests settle after positioning their feet on a step and sliding into position with the help of one of several suited servers. To the side of the marble surface is a small, undistinguished dining room, although in three visits, I've never seen anyone at a table. If you're shelling out more than a Franklin per person, and you will, you want a front-row seat.
Hot towels are proffered, and drinks are poured: Soto Junmai Daiginjo sake for the guest who asks for something on the mineral-y side and Aki no Mori Houjicha tea for the one who's taking time off from alcohol. (The tea is produced from stems and leaves roasted over charcoal.) Customers watch Uchino, whose assembled props include a sharp knife, brushes for applying sauces and a blowtorch, with what seem to be equal parts reverence and expectation. There is no menu, at least not until the end of a meal. The chef is serving what he thinks you should eat, which is mostly wild fish. On occasion, upgrades are dangled before you. Osetra caviar transferred from its tin to a bit of rice and gilded with a few bits of dried nori and gold leaf will set you back an additional $40: sushi for the 1 percent.
The first three bites of nigiri show off salmon in different guises: chum with a sprinkle of Japanese sea salt, hay-smoked sockeye whispering of a campfire, and robust king salmon, simply brushed with soy sauce. The catch is all from Alaska, which the chef says competes with Japan in quality.
Scallop sushi ("aged 10 days," intones a voice behind me) contains a surprise: a pinch of yuzu pepper between the dewy featured ingredient and the lightly vinegared rice. The unexpected dynamite causes diners' eyes to pop and the chef to grin as he points to the source of the heat in a small bowl on his workspace. Squid, dotted with plum sauce and sliced so sheer you can read through it, reveals the green under it to be shiso, that punchy relation to mint. A lobe of house-cured karasumi, or dried mullet roe, is grated over a strip of black fin
sea bass. The sunny yellow filings that threaten to hide the sea bass add a sumptuous salinity to the fish.
Dinner unfolds like a lovely play. Cured and pickled gizzard shad, we're told, is among the most traditional sushi, depicted as it is in Japanese paintings dating to the 18th century. History, thy name is herring. To prepare the palate for the voluptuous aged yellowtail that follows, we take a bite of the young ginger that the chef prepares in-house.
Uchino introduces each course as he sets it before you, after which an attendant leans in to repeat the announcement. (From a distance, the back-and-forth must look like a U.N. function.) Dinner in stereo is also reminiscent of a master class, with students encouraged to ask questions. A co-chef stands to Uchino's side, typically preparing the next treat. Watching the colleague strip some tiger prawns from their shells, and deploy a tweezer to devein them, reminds us that we eat first with our eyes. The eventual course is gently warm, sweet and tender.
You know you're approaching the end when a flight of lean-to-rich tuna is served. While I like them all for different reasons, chu-toro, or medium-fatty tuna, lingers in my memory for its umami and balance. Call it the Goldilocks of tuna. It's "just right."
Given the price of admission, there's little margin for error or displeasure. (Eel? I've had finer, less-cloying versions.) Something as little as a stray grain of rice on your black lacquer tray is quickly erased with a wet cloth. If the servers are as sober as Secret Service agents, they break character now and then to let you know it's okay to have fun. Pointing to the aptly named halfbeak, a member of the needlefish family, one host remarked on its "unfortunate underbite."
As the chef gets to know you, or as diners open up, he'll tailor the procession of fish to your taste. Signal that you're getting full, for instance, and he might make smaller pillows of rice going forward. And if you've dropped by before, he offers different tastes.
To close the feast, there might be a faintly sweet bite composed of just four ingredients, one of which imbues mountain yam, egg and sugar with a hint of the sea. "Shrimp!" a guest at the counter correctly guesses.
"Would you like to revisit anything?" a server always asks. Tempting as it might be to eat another fatty tuna hand roll, the quality and quantity of the tasting menu are plenty to digest. If there's one nit, it's the flimsy wooden chopsticks. Sushi Nakazawa prompts fans to go the totally acceptable route and eat with their fingers.
Two hours, about what it takes to eat 20 or so courses, go by quickly. So can your money if you like to drink (wines by the glass average $22) or incorporate some a la carte fancies. A morsel of wagyu A5, the highest grade of Japanese beef (rib-eye, in this case) costs $13. Its richness, however, is such that a single well-marbled, garlic-lit, blow-torched bite can sate some carnivores. "Everybody's favorite fish!" jokes the chef as he hands over the prized beef.
About the location. Sushi Nakazawa is a tenant of the Trump International Hotel, with a 10-year lease. While you can't access the dining room from the lobby of its controversial building, the restaurant is tucked on the back side of the property, next to a Starbucks. The connection to an owner who once derided Washington's food scene, and, more significantly, to a divisive POTUS, gives some potential patrons pause; five people turned down invitations to join me on multiple visits.
All I can say is this: For singular sushi, the omakase at the Nakazawa counter is best in class. Ultimately, though, chef's choice is your choice.

Texto completo: An online fundraiser set up for Jayme Closs and her family has tripled its goal after raising almost $50,000 since the abducted girl's return, with donations coming from all over the country.
Angela De Andriano created the GoFundMe campaign on Jan. 11 — the day 13-year-old Jayme was reunited with her family after her parents were murdered and she went missing for 88 days. On Thursday, De Andriano upped the fundraiser's goal to $150,000.
According to the GoFundMe account, De Andriano is the niece of Sue Allard, Jayme's aunt.
Allard's sister Denise Closs was shot to death in her own home in Barron on Oct. 15 as she tried to hide with Jayme in a bathroom, police say. Jayme's father, James Closs, had just been shot through the front door and killed by 21-year-old Jake Patterson, according to prosecutors.
Patterson put the girl in the trunk of his car and took her to his home and kept her under his bed, threatening to harm her if she tried to escape, according to a criminal complaint.
Jayme was able to run from the home on Jan. 10.
The Facebook page "Healing for Jayme Closs" confirmed the fundraiser set up by De Andriano is legitimate. The money will go directly to the family to use for "medical appointments, general care, or any other basic needs Jayme may have going forward," De Andriano wrote on the GoFundMe page.
"Every dollar is a blessing," De Andriano wrote. "Thank you all."
Nearly 1,000 people from around the world made donations big and small to the campaign. An anonymous donor contributed $5,000, the largest single gift to the campaign.
Allison Lattanze, a mother of two teens from Pennsylvania who donated $50 to the GoFundMe page, told a USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin reporter that she wanted to help the Closs family in any way she could, since the case felt personal to her as a mother.
"It's important for a lot of us who were following the case to let Jayme know that people really care and wish her well," Lattanze said.
Greg Lara, who lives in New York, said that he first heard about Jayme's case and the fundraiser from a story in The New York Times that was shared on Facebook. He said he "just felt compelled to contribute."
"I was very moved by the poor girl's story; it's such a horrible thing to lose both your parents that way," said Lara, who gave $25. "I thought that someone in her (and her family's) situation will need all the help she can get."
Hormel Foods announced in January that the company would be donating its half of the $50,000 reward promised for Jayme's safe return to the teen for her "bravery and strength." Hormel Foods owns the Jennie-O Turkey Store in Barron, where Jayme's parents worked up to the day they died.
In an update posted at the end of January, Jayme's aunt and legal guardian Jennifer Smith thanked the donors for their "love and support."
"Jayme is doing pretty good," Smith said. "We love to see her smile and even more, laugh with a few of her close friends. It's the best feeling ever. We have a long road of healing and recovery as we move forward; small steps."

FINGER-POINTING ON FUTURE OF AMAZON DEAL

Texto completo: ALBANY - Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo on Friday accused the Democratic-controlled state Senate of "governmental malpractice" for what he said was threatening the multibillion-dollar deal to bring an Amazon headquarters to New York, after a published report that said the retail giant is having second thoughts.
"If Amazon doesn't come to New York, it is because of the political opposition. For the state Senate to oppose Amazon was governmental malpractice," Cuomo told the Long Island Association business group in Woodbury. "And if they stop Amazon from coming to New York, they are going to have to have the people of New York State to explain it to. It is irresponsible to allow political opposition to overcome sound government policy."
The blistering attack sparked a harsh back-and-forth between the Democratic governor and the Senate. The focus of Cuomo's ire, Sen. Michael Gianaris (D-Astoria), an Amazon critic who represents the area where the company might build, said the governor was to blame for making a "secret" and "bad" giveaway deal with Amazon. The senator also raised the possibility that Cuomo had "orchestrated" the threat of Amazon leaving as a way to silence critics.
"It's very curious that he had a slide ready to be presented 10 minutes after news broke that Amazon was reconsidering," Gianaris said. "A cynic might believe this is all orchestrated. The governor's always about pointing fingers at anyone but himself. He made a secret deal with Amazon. He made a bad deal with Amazon. He has to live with the consequences of that."
The internet giant announced in November it had chosen to build half its East Coast headquarters in Long Island City, Queens, and the other half in Northern Virginia, promising 25,000 jobs for each location. New York and Virginia beat out numerous other competitors.
Cuomo said the state and city will provide $3 billion in tax breaks and aid to Amazon, one of the world's richest companies, while the company would provide $27 billion in tax revenue, adding, "I would do that all day long." The area is zoned for mixed commercial and residential use.
Cuomo cited a Washington Post story published Friday morning that quoted sources as saying Amazon may pull out of the New York deal because of local opponents, who have decried the tax incentives promised to one of the world's biggest companies.
Friday afternoon, The New York Times published a story citing officials familiar with Amazon's thinking that said the Washington Post story went "too far" and the company wasn't thinking of backing out of coming to Long Island City.
In either case, it's clear the political fighting is nowhere near an end
"I would not want to be a Democratic senator coming back to my district to explain why Amazon left," Cuomo said, directing his wrath fully at the Senate. He accused the Democratic majority of "pandering" to some Queens residents fearful that the Amazon headquarters will jack up housing prices in the name of "corporate welfare."
Cuomo, in particular, has bashed Senate leadership for nominating Gianaris to serve on the arcane but crucial Public Authorities Control Board, a panel that signs off on many state grants and tax incentives. Any member of the three-person panel can veto a project - it's the panel that killed Mayor Michael Bloomberg's plans for a Manhattan football stadium more than a decade ago.
Cuomo told Newsday the situation is "critical." He has met with increasing questioning of the deal and earlier this week blamed Amazon for not doing a good enough job of persuading opponents to step back.
"I'm doing everything I can to persuade them to stay," Cuomo said at Newsday's offices following the event. "But it's totally up to them and I think it's imminent."
Asked if he thought the nomination of Gianaris could prompt Amazon's second thoughts, Cuomo said, "Yes, definitely."
An Amazon spokesman in a prepared statement said Friday the company is "working hard to demonstrate what kind of neighbor we will be," citing employment, workforce training and computer science classes for schools.
The Senate hasn't said it opposes the deal. Cuomo struck the agreement unilaterally in a national competition created by Amazon with little information released publicly about tax breaks and incentives. The Senate has called for more information on the project.
Gianaris said the terms of the state and city deal with Amazon were "unacceptable."
"They are anti-union," Gianaris said. "They have no concern about the impact they might have on communities they join. ... Amazon is just take, take, take and doesn't give a damn about the communities it destroys in the process."
Cuomo spokesman Rich Azzopardi denied any orchestration with The Washington Post story or in promoting any false threat of losing Amazon, dismissing it as a conspiracy theory. "Someone has their tin foil hat on a little too tight," Azzopardi said.
A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins (D-Yonkers) said that Gianaris would bring accountability to the PACB and that Cuomo was trying to splinter Democrats just weeks after they took control of the Senate.
"It is unfortunate that the governor is trying to divide the Democratic Party at this crucial and historic time," spokesman Mike Murphy said.
Beyond criticism of the aid Amazon would receive, city activists have expressed concerns whether the neighborhood's infrastructure could handle the company, including the impact on subways and rents.
Part of the opposition from the legislature came after Amazon said it wouldn't commit to hiring only workers represented by unions, which have significant influence in Albany.
"If the Amazon deal falls apart, they will have nobody to blame but themselves," said Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, a labor group that hopes to provide workers to Amazon. "A major problem is the way the deal was put together shrouded in secrecy and ignoring what New Yorkers want and need. They arrogantly continue to refuse to meet with key stakeholders to address their concerns, despite requests from New York's top elected officials to do so."
Sen. Jim Gaughran (D-Northport) promised to speak with Gianaris. However, Gaughran also noted he and other senators have limited say in the Amazon project: "There is no bill in the Senate for us to vote on."
Other Long Island Democratic senators in the audience - Cuomo implored them to bring "sanity" to the Senate - said they supported the Amazon project.
A vote in the legislature on whether Amazon receives all of the promised tax credits is likely a year or more away. It might be a year before the PACB has to take any action on the state incentives, officials have said.
A spokesman for Mayor Bill de Blasio said: "The mayor fully expects Amazon to deliver on its promise to New Yorkers."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- President Trump's oldest daughter, who serves as a senior adviser in the White House, denied on Friday that her father was involved in issuing security clearances for her or her husband, Jared Kushner.
Ivanka Trump made the remarks during an interview with the ABC News host Abby Huntsman in an interview for "The View."
"There were anonymous leaks about there being issues," Ms. Trump said. "But the president had no involvement pertaining to my clearance or my husband's clearance, zero."
Asked what had delayed her security clearance, as well as the clearance for Mr. Kushner, Ms. Trump replied, "There weren't any, other than a backlog that exists of close to a million clearances across government."
Her comments marked the first time that she has spoken about the clearance issue that dogged both her and her husband for the first year of the administration. She described the delays -- which lasted into May 2018 -- as part of a normal course of business.
"This isn't new," Ms. Trump said. "This was happening under the Obama administration, the Clinton administration."
Mark Zaid, a lawyer who specializes in security clearances, said that Ms. Trump was citing a backlog that does not apply to her or her husband, given their special status as presidential family members and the ability of the White House to ask for expedited clearances for high-ranking advisers.
"Her comment is not as black and white as she portends it to be," Mr. Zaid said.
She and Mr. Kushner, who has a broad portfolio including Middle East policy, received clearances last year, after what multiple officials within government described as delays caused by concerns that the F.B.I. and the C.I.A. flagged about their foreign contacts and private business.
The questions surrounding their clearances lingered for many months. But when Mr. Kushner received a clearance in 2018, his lawyer, Abbe Lowell, described it as a normal process.
"With respect to the news about his clearances, as we stated before, his application was properly submitted, reviewed by numerous career officials and underwent the normal process," Mr. Lowell said at the time. "Having completed all of these processes, he's looking forward to continuing to do the work the president has asked him to do."
A report by NBC recently revealed that career White House security specialists had rejected Mr. Kushner's clearance twice, but were overruled by their supervisor. A senior administration official confirmed that account to The New York Times.
In a recent interview with The Times, Mr. Trump said he had no role in getting officials to give his son-in-law a clearance.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

In blog post, a rare public statement for private leader

Texto completo: Jeffrey P. Bezos has long guarded his personal privacy and that of his businesses with vehemence. Amazon kept major initiatives, such as the Kindle e-reader, secret for years. His space venture, Blue Origin, once had a rocket crash but didn't report the mishap for days. Visitors to the space company's headquarters have been routinely asked to sign nondisclosure agreements, even if just visiting for a holiday party.
This quest for privacy imploded in recent weeks as Bezos, the world's wealthiest man and the owner of The Washington Post, faced perhaps the most personal crisis of his career. The National Enquirer published a series of stories, including intimate texts and photos, about his extramarital relationship with a former TV anchor, prompting Bezos and his wife of 25 years, MacKenzie Bezos, to announce their planned divorce over Twitter.
Then, according to a blog post Bezos published Thursday, the tabloid threatened to blackmail him with additional photographs of Bezos and the woman he was dating. He responded in
the blog post by including copies of Enquirer emails detailing the alleged threat. The move revealed graphic descriptions of what the images showed.
The Enquirer on Friday said it had only been engaged in "good faith negotiations to resolve all matters with him" and would investigate the claims by Bezos before taking "whatever appropriate action is necessary."
The blog post Thursday night startled many in the technology industry and beyond, quickly spreading to internal online forums at Amazon, the company he founded in 1994 and for which he remains chief executive, board chairman and the largest shareholder.
But some longtime associates and observers also considered his confrontation with the Enquirer to be a classic Bezos move. As Amazon's CEO, he has relished the chance to rewrite the script when it came to managing public relations. Perhaps even more so, he has thrived on seeking to vanquish rivals, whether they be corporate behemoths such as Walmart or upstarts such as Diapers.com. With the Enquirer, Bezos has twice seized the initiative by essentially scooping the tabloid, revealing news of his divorce and of the additional pictures before its reporters could.
Even as the controversy has grown, Bezos has been spotted in public settings looking jovial, as he did when he appeared briefly on national television during the Super Bowl, standing and chatting near NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell. He appeared last month at the annual dinner of the Alfalfa Club in Washington, a black-tie event that attracts some of the city's biggest names.
"He is playing his hand as well as he can, given what has been made public," said Shel Kaphan, the first Amazon employee after Bezos and his wife. The "damage is done and I think he probably calculates correctly that it isn't going to get measurably worse for him if the photos come out."
Kaphan added, "It would be very typical of Jeff to strategically weigh his options in a detached way and pick the one that would leave him in the best position or minimize further damage to him."
Bezos, who declined an interview request made through Amazon officials Friday, typically is described as cerebral, ruthless and relentless as a businessman, with a particular ability to focus on long-term goals in the face of short-term pain.
Bezos and his company have faced multiple controversies during his public life. In Amazon's early years, it faced skepticism over whether the company could ever turn a profit and survive. But he relentlessly focused on underpricing competitors and other customer innovations, earning the trust of investors that one day Amazon would make money.
In 2015, when the New York Times published a detailed investigation describing a "bruising" workplace culture at Amazon, the company responded with a 1,300-word blog post detailing what the company argued were flaws in the story's reporting. Jay Carney, Amazon's senior vice president for global corporate affairs and former press secretary to President Barack Obama, titled the response, "What The New York Times Didn't Tell You," and engaged in an tit-for-tat exchange with the Times's executive editor over the coverage.
In more recent years, as lawmakers have raised questions about whether Amazon was compensating its workers enough and other aspects of its business model, the company made announcements of plans to hire 100,000 new workers and, later, to introduce a $15 minimum wage. Amazon spent $14 million on lobbying last year, a record for the company.
Bezos in recent years has raised his public profile. He bought The Post and the biggest home in Washington, and has appeared at entertainment award shows and high-profile rocket launches. He even drew attention for a more muscular physique and more refined wardrobe than earlier in his life.
His ownership of The Post has led to clashes with candidate and now President Trump, who has argued that the Amazon founder bought The Post to advance his financial interests. When Trump was a candidate in December 2015 and criticized Bezos in several tweets, he replied on Twitter. "Finally trashed by @realDonaldTrump. Will still reserve him a seat on the Blue Origin rocket. #sendDonaldtospace."
He largely has avoided further clashes with Trump, though he has said it is wrong of elected officials "to demonize the media."
Trump has from time to time continued to criticize Bezos. After the Enquirer published its article on Bezos's expected divorce, Trump tweeted, "So sorry to hear the news about Jeff Bozo being taken down by a competitor whose reporting, I understand, is far more accurate than the reporting in his lobbyist newspaper, the Amazon Washington Post. Hopefully the paper will soon be placed in better & more responsible hands!"
In publicly challenging the Enquirer, Bezos gambled in a way that's rare in a corporate world where the more common approach could be to protect valuable businesses from controversies before they might spread in unpredictable ways. The stakes are particularly high for a man who has drawn the ire of an aggressive publisher that thrives on controversy and whose chief executive is David J. Pecker, a longtime friend of Trump. Pecker has received immunity from prosecution as part of the Justice Department's investigation into campaign finance violations by Trump's former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen.
Bezos wrote in the post on Medium, a self-publishing site, "If in my position I can't stand up to this kind of extortion, how many people can?"
The accusations about the Enquirer's reporting came at a critical time for Bezos's empire, which increasingly has sought to work with the federal government. Amazon Web Services, which holds a $600 million cloud computing contract from the CIA, is vying for a $10 billion contract to build a cloud computing system for the Pentagon. Late last year, Blue Origin won its first major government contract, a $500 million deal from the Air Force to help develop its New Glenn rocket.
"As a billionaire, he can afford to take the risk to respond this way," said Jim Lukaszewski, a crisis consultant based in Minneapolis. "He skipped all the steps that get people in trouble . . . This neutralizes the power of this predator."
Bezos, who bought The Post in 2013 for $250 million, said in his online post Thursday that owning the news organization is "a complexifier" in his decisions about how to respond to political and other pressure. At a technology conference in 2016, he said that he admired Katharine Graham, the Post's late publisher who supported the newsroom's Watergate coverage even when a Nixon associate threatened that she was "gonna get her tit caught in a big fat wringer" if a particular story was published.
"With Kay Graham as my role model, I'm very willing to let any of my body parts go through a big, fat ringer if need be," Bezos said at the conference.
However this clash with the Enquirer turns out, it has revealed elements of Bezos's personality not widely known before, including a degree of personal indiscretion that has surprised longtime associates and observers.
Bezos and his romantic partner, former TV anchorwoman Lauren Sanchez, appeared together in public, including at the Golden Globe Awards, before he publicly announced an end to his marriage to MacKenzie Bezos, a fiction writer who helped him found Amazon. The couple have four children together.
While extramarital affairs are hardly novel, some Bezos watchers expressed surprise that he would send provocative text messages given the ease of copying and sharing them with others.
Bezos amassed a fortune of more than $125 billion running a technology company at a time when such breaches of personal privacy were becoming routine. Bezos long has preached within Amazon that personal actions by employees - and there is no more visible one than Bezos - can reflect poorly on a company, said his biographer Brad Stone, author of "The Everything Store."
"It's kind of inexplicable considering his messages inside the company," Stone said. "This was somebody who has been careful and strategic about every move in his personal and professional life over 50-plus years."
Once the affair was exposed, Bezos's response comes right out of the playbook of his longtime security consultant, Gavin de Becker. In "The Gift of Fear," he wrote that "extortion is a crime of opportunity, usually committed by amateurs."
De Becker added that when someone threatens to reveal marital infidelity, the best response is to say, "Hold on a moment, let me get my wife on the line and you can tell her right now."
The immediate pain, he wrote, is better than a prolonged period of blackmail during which the damaging information may ultimately be revealed anyway.
For much of his career, Bezos personally avoided the limelight, and the penchant for secrecy extended to his company and to his philanthropic endeavors. Until 2018, when he announced a $2 billion commitment to support preschoolers and the homeless, he had said very little about what he planned to do with his fortune.
Bezos also is known for staying silent on quarterly earnings calls with analysts and investors, and the company has banned recording, typing and photography at its shareholder meetings. Reporters at such meetings were allowed only to take handwritten notes.
"I never think of us as secretive," Bezos once said at a meeting in response to questions about these practices. "We're just quiet. . . . We talk when we have something to say."
Blue Origin, his space company, also has kept a low profile, even though space is one of his main passions and now comprises, as he has said, "the most important work I'm doing." That included not revealing a 2011 crash until urged to by NASA, which had begun to worry about conspiracy theories spreading among those who noticed that something had gone awry.
In the early 2000s, Bezos started quietly acquiring hundreds of thousands of acres in West Texas, where Blue Origin now launches its New Shepard rocket. He purchased the land under corporate entities named for explorers. There was Joliet Holdings and Cabot Enterprises, the James Cook and William Clark Limited Partnerships and Coronado Ventures.
All were linked to a firm with a Seattle post office called Zefram LLC, named for Zefram Cochrane, a character in the Star Trek franchise. As he was scouting the land, a helicopter carrying Bezos crash-landed in a creek, flooding the cabin with water before he and others could escape. Later, he would say that "it was harrowing. We were very lucky. I can't believe we all walked away from it."
At the time, Amazon downplayed the crash, saying only that Bezos "is fine. We're business as usual."

Texto completo: TONIGHT'S MUST-TRY: "Live From Lincoln Center," 9-10:30 p.m., PBS.
There's an endless pipeline, Nya feels, sending young black men from public schools to prisons. As a passionate teacher, she tries to stop it ... often futiley. So she sent her son upstate, to a private school. Now comes devastating news: After attacking a teacher he considered racist, he may be expelled.
Can she pierce his rage? When "Pipeline" debuted at the Lincoln Center, critics raved about the play and its star, Karen Pittman. Variety called it "emotionally harrowing," the New York Times agreed, but said it's "frustratingly unresolved." Now TV viewers can get a burst of off-Broadway theater intensity.
TONIGHT'S MIGHT-SEE: "Crazy Ex-Girlfriend," 9 p.m., CW.
Here's a different kind of theater-on-TV experience: Stuffed with musical-theater veterans, "Crazy" uses original songs – clever, quirky ones – in the midst of its comic/tragic stories.
It has often had Rebecca be self-consumed and self-destructive. But now a doctor has spotted what could have become a major heart attack for her friend Paula; Rebecca must set her own troubles aside.
Other choices include:
"The Sunshine Boys" (1975), 6 p.m., Turner Classic Movies. George Burns was 80 when he won the Academy Award for this dandy Neil Simon comedy, making him (for a while) the oldest person to win an acting Oscar. In TCM's Oscar month, that's followed by two psychiatry dramas – Bette Davis' "Now, Voyager" (1942) at 8 p.m. and Barbra Streisand's "The Prince of Tides" (1991) at 10:15.
"Big Brother: Celebrity Edition," 8 p.m., CBS. It's a two-hour edition, setting up a one-hour show Monday and he two-hour finale Wednesday.
"Be My Valentine, Charlie Brown," 8 p.m., ABC. This 1975 classic finds holiday angst for Charlie, Sally and Lucy. Rounding out the hour are short Valentine bits, adapted from the "Peanuts" strip.
"Blindspot," 8 p.m., NBC. In an effort to save Jane, Patterson and Rich are on a Peruvian treasure hunt.
"Blue Bloods," 10 p.m., CBS. Brothers collide when Danny goes against Jamie's direct order during a hostage negotiation. Also, their sister Erin is asked by Nicky to help a friend who may lose his scholarship for a crime he didn't commit.

Texto completo: Hart Island is in the Pelham Islands group, officially a part of the Bronx. East of the lively City Island, it is a grave site, New York City's own potter's field -- a term from the New Testament that has come to denote a burial place for the poor, the anonymous, people without family or without family that can afford a marked resting place. The site is managed by the city's Department of Correction and is not open to the public.
Brendan J. Byrne's documentary "One Million American Dreams" guides the viewer through several true narratives of how one might end up there. These stories can be heartbreaking. There's a mother who had no funds to bury her dead infant. And a Cuban émigré working to send money to his family back home, who fell prey to dementia before dying incommunicado.
Hart Island, the writer Luc Sante says in an interview, is emblematic of an indifference that all cities cultivate out of practical necessity. But in New York, he notes, the indifference is exaggerated.

A case in point: the story of one drug addict whose family was never contacted after his body was found, kept as a medical-research cadaver for three years before being shipped to Hart Island. It took a New York Times reporter little more than a single phone call to locate the man's widow.
"With all honor to the dead, they are dead," Sante says glumly at one point. Nevertheless, this documentary makes a powerful case that the city's lost dead are due more honor than what Hart Island currently extends.
Not rated. Running time: 1 hour 30 minutes.

The Catholic Church Played Major Role in Slavery

Texto completo: Headnote The National Newspaper Publishers Association (NNPA) has launched a global news feature series on the history, contemporary realities and implications of the transatlantic slave trade. Visit www. blackpressusa.com for full series coverage
This is Part 2 in a Series on Slavery in America.
"When the missionaries arrived, the Africans had the land and the missionaries had the Bible. They taught us how to pray with our eyes closed. When we opened them, they had the land and we had the Bible." - Jomo Kenyatta, First President of Kenya, Africa
The Catholic Church played a vital role in the trans-Atlantic slave trade, according to historians and several published theses on the topic.
The trans-Atlantic slave trade was introduced by the coming of the Europeans who came with the Bible in the same manner that Arab raiders and traders from the Middle East and North Africa introduced Islam through the trans-Saharan slave trade, according to AfricaW.com, a premiere informational website available throughout the continent.
"In fact, the Church was the backbone of the slave trade," the authors wrote. "In other words, most of the slave traders and slave ship captains were very 'good' Christians."
For example, Sir John Hawkins, the first slaveship captain to bring African slaves to the Americas, was a religious man, who insisted that his crew "serve God daily" and "love one another." His ship, ironically called "The Good Ship Jesus," left the shores of his native England for Africa in October 1562. Some historians argue that if churches had used their power, the Atlantic slave trade might have never occurred.
By the same logic, others argue that the Catholic church and Catholic missionaries could have also helped to prevent the colonization and brutality of colonialism in Africa. However, according to a 2015 Global Black History report, the Catholic church did not oppose the institution of slavery until the practice had already become infamous in most parts of the world.
In most cases, the churches and church leaders did not condemn slavery until the 17th century.
The five major countries that dominated slavery and the slave trade in the New World were either Catholic, or still retained strong Catholic influences including: Spain, Portugal, France, and England, and the Netherlands.
"Persons who considered themselves to be Christian played a major role in upholding and justifying the enslavement of Africans," said Dr. Jonathan Chism, an assistant professor of history at the University of Houston-Downtown.
"Many European 'Christian' slavers perceived the Africans they encountered as irreligious and uncivilized persons. They justified slavery by rationalizing that they were Christianizing and civilizing their African captors. They were driven by missionary motives and impulses," Chism said.
Further, many Angl°Christians defended slavery using the Bible. For example, White Christian apologists for slavery argued that the curse of Ham in Genesis Chapter 9 and verses 20 to 25 provided a biblical rationale for the enslavement of Blacks, Chism said.
In this passage, Noah cursed Canaan and his descendants arguing that Ham would be "the lowest of slaves among his brothers" because he saw the nakedness of his father. A further understanding of the passage also revealed that while some have attempted to justify their prejudice by claiming that God cursed the Black race, no such curse is recorded in the Bible.
That oft-cited verse says nothing whatsoever about skin color.
Also, it should be noted that Black race evidently descended from a brother of Canaan named Cush. Canaan's descendants were evidently light-skinned - not Black. "Truly nothing in the biblical account identifies Ham, the descendant of Canaan, with Africans. Yet, Christian apologists determined that Africans were the descents of Ham," Chism said.
Nevertheless, at the beginning the sixteenth century, the racial interpretation of Noah's curse became commonplace, he said.
In 2016, Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. offered a public apology after acknowledging that 188 years prior, Jesuit priests sold 272 slaves to save the school from financial ruin.
This is how The New York Times first reported the story: The human cargo was loaded on ships at a bustling wharf in the nation's capital, destined for the plantations of the Deep South. Some slaves pleaded for rosaries as they were rounded up, praying for deliverance. But on that day, in the fall of 1838, no one was spared: not the 2-month-old baby and her mother, not the field hands, not the shoemaker and not Cornelius Hawkins, who was about 13 years old when he was forced onboard.
Their panic and desperation would be mostly forgotten for more than a century. But this was no ordinary slave sale. The enslaved African Americans had belonged to the nation's most prominent Jesuit priests. And they were sold, along with scores of others, to help secure the future of the premier Catholic institution of higher learning at the time, known today as Georgetown University.
"The Society of Jesus, who helped to establish Georgetown University and whose leaders enslaved and mercilessly sold your ancestors, stands before you to say that we have greatly sinned," Rev. Timothy Kesicki, S.J., president of the Jesuit Conference of Canada and the United States, said during a Liturgy of Remembrance, Contrition, and Hope.
"We pray with you today because we have greatly sinned and because we are profoundly sorry."
During the early republic, Catholics celebrated the new Constitution for its guarantee of religious liberty while simply accepting its guarantee of slaveholding, according to Blackthen.com.
Internal church politics mattered too. When the Jesuit order was suppressed in 1773, the plantation system of the order in Maryland was seen as a protection for their identity and solidarity.
The universal church taught that slavery enjoyed the sanction of Scripture and natural law. Throughout the antebellum period, many churches in the South committed to sharing their version of the Christian faith with Blacks. They believed that their version of Christianity would help them to be "good slaves" and not challenge the slave system, Chism said.
"Yet, it is important to note that African Americans made Christianity their own, and Black Christians such as Nat Turner employed Christian thought and biblical texts to resist the slave system. Furthermore, Black and White abolitionist Christians played a major role in overturning the system of slavery," he said.

Omar and Zeldin finally see eye to eye; Truce called after week-long war of words between the two representatives

Texto completo: Rep. Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., who is Jewish, recently received a voice mail that he wanted Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., who is Muslim, to hear.
So he sent it to her publicly on Twitter.
It was a virulent, vulgar message from a man who wished "Hitler would have done his ... job." The anonymous man called Zeldin and "you people" "maggots" and "animals," suggesting the United States's support for Israel equated to killing Palestinians and that Zeldin himself was complicit. He told Zeldin to stop calling people anti-Semitic because "you're worse than Hitler."
"This new VM just came into my office," Zeldin wrote in a tweet that tagged Omar on Jan. 31. "This is just another day in my world as an American Jew in Congress. Would love to know what part of this hate filled, anti-Semitic rant you disagree with?"
His latest tweet to Omar was part of a week-long war of words between the two representatives as each accused the other of being discriminatory against Jews or Muslims, respectively.
Omar retweeted others who called Zeldin Islamophobic after he suggested Jan. 29 that she had no place on the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.
Zeldin accused Omar of being anti-Semitic because she supports the right to boycott Israel, and because of past anti-Israel comments she apologized for last week.
But after days of sparring, the voice mail seemed to change things. It appeared to align the Republican and Democrat against one thing they both detest and both experience - religious discrimination.
Rather than continuing the Twitter battle involving one of the world's most hotly debated controversies, Omar proposed an apparent truce.
"This is heinous and hateful," she responded on Twitter, referring to the voice mail left for Zeldin. "I too am flooded with bigoted voicemails and calls every day. Maybe we could meet and share notes on how to fight religious discrimination of all kinds? Maybe over Somali tea, in your old office which I happen to be in now."
"Let's do that!" Zeldin responded. He then urged her to support a resolution he has sponsored that rejects anti-Israel and anti-Semitic hatred, saying her backing the bill would be "a step in the right direction."
The fracas between Omar and Zeldin revolves around the representatives' differing positions on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the anti-Israel movement called BDS, for boycott, divestment and sanctions. On Jan. 29, Zeldin took to the House floor to promote his resolution condemning that movement, telling colleagues that anti-Semitism has managed to infiltrate "American politics and even the halls of Congress."
He appeared to be referring to Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., a Palestinian Muslim, and Omar, because of their support for the right to boycott Israel. He explicitly called Omar anti-Semitic on Twitter later, and has said her appointment to the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee amounted to "empowering" anti-Semitism.
But Omar's view on the issue, she has contended, has nothing to do with religion. Rather, she has said, she supports the right to boycott Israel because she condemns the Israeli government's treatment of Palestinians. She has said she opposes bans on boycotting Israel because she believes it is un-American to ban people from boycotting.
Later that same day, after Zeldin's impassioned speech on the House floor, he took to Twitter to share some personal news - while also denigrating Omar in the same breath.
"Was just selected as Ranking Member of the (House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations)!" he wrote. And then: "Just learned Freshman Rep. Ilhan Omar was also put on this committee w oversight of US foreign policy. Crazy to watch what House Dems are empowering/elevating."
Some called his statement an "Islamaphobic dog whistle" - or rather a "bullhorn" - that suggested Omar was not fully American and therefore shouldn't oversee U.S. foreign policy.
Omar appeared to agree. Sharing a tweet that described Zeldin's statement as Islamophobic, Omar responded by suggesting the congressman simply couldn't handle having to work alongside Muslim women in the House, appearing to mock him with a tongue-out, winky-face emoji tacked on to the end of her tweet.
"Don't mind him," she wrote. "He is just waking up to the reality of having Muslim women as colleagues who know how to stand up for bullies! It's gonna be fun watching him lose his marbles."
"Those poor innocent ISIS fighters & Palestinian terrorists right? Give me a break!" Zeldin responded. "That's a problem no matter your religion or gender Ilhan. Your anti-Semitic & anti-Israel hate is strong & wrong & those terrorists have US blood on their hands as well."
Then came the discussion over the anti-Semitic voice mail. "Are you saying you disagree w/everything said in that voice mail?" Zeldin asked Omar in the tweet sent after midnight. "I sure do."
Omar did not send another tweet to Zeldin, but earlier on Jan. 31 she appeared on Comedy Central's "The Daily Show with Trevor Noah," where the comedian asked her to further explain her anti-Israel comments from 2012.
In a resurfaced tweet, Omar had said: "Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel" - language many said evoked Nazi conspiracy theories about Jews' power to hypnotize the world.
Omar told CNN on Jan. 17 that she did not know "how my comments would be offensive to Jewish Americans," and that she was "clearly speaking about the way the Israeli regime was conducting itself" during the Gaza conflict.
Bari Weiss, a New York Times columnist, explained to Omar why many Jews found it so offensive in a biting commentary last week that prompted Omar to backpedal and apologize for not putting enough energy into "disavowing the anti-Semitic trope I unknowingly used."
When Noah broached the subject, Omar compared her defensiveness about her tweet - denying that she was anti-Semitic - to the way poor white people react when some say they still possess "white privilege."
"With that tweet, what I finally realized is the realization that I hope that people come to when we're having a conversation about white privilege," she told Noah. "You know, people would be like, 'I grew up in a poor neighborhood. I can't be privileged. Can you stop saying that? I haven't benefited from my whiteness!' And it's like, 'No, we're talking about systemic, right?' And so for me, that happened for me.
"I was like, 'Do not call me that (anti-Semitic). ... And it's like, 'Oh, I see what you're saying now.' I had to take a deep breath and understand where people were coming from and what point they were trying to make, which is what I expect people to do when I'm talking to them about things that impact me or offend me."
Omar clarified that in any conversations about Israel or the BDS movement, she is criticizing the Israeli government, not Jews in general.
"What's important in this conversation is that we separate the land, the people, and the administrations," she said.

Texto completo: Nl/bkm CHEYENNE Historic Preservation Board will meet to discuss Carey Building The Cheyenne Historic Preservation Board will meet from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. Jan. 19 at the Historic Governors' Mansion Carriage House to update its working strategic plan. The plan is a working document to help board members keep track of the projects they work on, and how they relate to the major goals and objectives of the board. A few of their major accomplishments have been updating and expanding the existing Capitol North Historic District, updating and expanding the Downtown Historic District, stabilizing the Warren Rest House in Holliday Park, updating their rules of practice, and fundraising for the Historic Airport Fountain, with some restoration starting this summer. A few goals they continue to work on are partnering with the Downtown Development Authority for the Fa?ade Improvement Program and hosting a preservation summit in May. Following the planning meeting, the board will convene a special discussion at 1:30 p.m. to discuss the Carey Building and the new municipal courthouse. The meeting will be in the same location. The board received $40,000 from the City of Cheyenne to help remove historic items from the Carey Building prior to its demolition, thus allowing construction to begin for the city's new courthouse. Some of the items they hope to have removed are pieces of the banister and newel posts, light fixtures, fireplace surrounds, old doors and hardware, and a window or two. Cheyenne MPO releases updated snow and ice control information The Cheyenne Metropolitan Planning Organization has released an updated snow and ice control guide, which will provide local residents and visitors information and resources when it comes to driving in winter weather conditions. The guide features a priority snow plow plan; an interactive map of snow plow routes for the city, county and WYDOT; frequently asked questions; what to do in the event of a snowstorm; city ordinance information for snow, ice and slush removal from sidewalks; and an interactive snow closure area map. To view the updated guide, visit www.cheyennecity.org and click on the snow and ice control guide link on the homepage. This new interactive webpage is replacing paper pamphlets used in the past. Furloughed employees to receive free admission to local facilities On Friday, Mayor Marian Orr announced that due to the partial federal government shutdown, the City of Cheyenne would offer free admission to various venues for furloughed employees. With a federal ID, these employees and a guest can receive free admission to the Ice and Events Center, the Aquatics Center, and shows and events at Cheyenne Civic Center, based on availability.

Wyoming named in New York Times' "52 Places to Go in 2019" Wyoming was named one of the New York Times' "52 Places to Go in 2019" earlier this week.

Texto completo: A Bud Light Super Bowl ad meant to shame competitors for brewing their beer with corn syrup has angered corn producers, prompted MillerCoors to buy a full-page New York Times ad defending its use of the ingredient and given consumers a crash course in the chemistry of beer.
The #corntroversy or #corngate, as it has been labeled on Twitter, has prompted brewers and dietitians to come to the defense of the common use of corn syrup in beer, where it gets converted into alcohol during fermentation.
Despite the backlash, the ad may have its intended effect of driving people away from Bud Light's competition.
"Whether (corn syrup) is bad or not doesn't really matter," said Tim Calkins, clinical professor of marketing at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management. "The issue is, do people think it's bad."
In the Super Bowl ad, the medieval Bud Light kingdom mistakenly receives a giant barrel of corn syrup that its subjects then trek through treacherous lands to deliver to the kingdoms of Miller Lite and Coors Light ? because they use corn syrup in their beer, while Bud Light does not.
Anup Shah, vice president of the Miller family of brands at MillerCoors, was at the game in Atlanta when he started getting texts from friends and co-workers describing the ad. Though he had gotten wind that Bud Light might air an ad about ingredients, he said he was "shocked" that it tried to "disparage" his brands by name.
"I thought it was an act of desperation from Bud Light," Shah said. "It was trying to drive the connection between high-fructose corn syrup and corn syrup, which I think is misleading."
The response from Chicago-based MillerCoors was swift on social media, where it clarified that it does not use high-fructose corn syrup ? a type of sweetener that has been shown to have negative health effects ? and that its beers have fewer calories and carbohydrates than Bud Light.
On Tuesday MillerCoors ran a full-page ad in the New York Times declaring pride in its use of corn syrup, sourced from "America's heartland," and poking fun at Bud Light for targeting a non-issue.
"We'd like to thank our competitors for taking the time and money to point out this exciting fact to such a large, national audience not once, but twice," it read.
Corn syrup is one of many types of non-malt ingredients often used in beer to create alcohol without adding much flavor, said Ray Daniels, founder and director of the Chicago-based Cicerone Certification Program, which tests and certifies beer experts. When it or any other type of sugar gets fermented, it gets converted into alcohol and carbon dioxide, so "sugar added to beer does not mean sugar in the finished beer," he said.
Daniels said he was surprised to see Bud Light zero in on corn syrup as a differentiator.
"They are shaming by implication," Daniels said. "But it certainly is unclear what there is to be ashamed of."
Corn syrup, made up of glucose and fructose, is little different from table sugar, made of sucrose, from a health perspective, said Kristin Gustashaw, senior clinical dietician at Rush University Medical Center.
High-fructose corn syrup, which tends to be sweeter and cheaper, has a higher ratio of fructose and isn't processed as efficiently by the body, she said. Consumed in excess it can increase triglycerides, fatty liver, uric acid levels and make people less sensitive to insulin, she said.
But that's not the same as regular corn syrup, especially when used in beer fermentation, and Bud Light's ad was just a "marketing ploy" that diverted attention from the fact that beer overall isn't particularly nutritious, she said. Still, she expects it will drive patients to her office worried about whether they should switch beers.
"We shouldn't really care," Gustashaw said of the types of sugars used in beer fermentation. "How much beer we drink we should care more about."
AB InBev, which makes Bud Light, didn't respond to a request for a comment from the Tribune, but generally it has responded to the criticism by affirming its support of the corn industry. The National Corn Growers Association on Sunday tweeted that "America's corn farmers are disappointed in you" and Kevin Ross, first vice president of the group's Corn Board, posted a video of himself pouring cans of Bud Light down the sink.
The anti-corn syrup ad came as Big Beer has committed to greater transparency amid sliding sales of traditional brews. Bud Light, which is made with rice instead of corn, last month debuted new packaging that prominently displays can't-miss nutrition and ingredient information. Miller Lite has displayed nutritional information since 2014 and this month plans to launch a QR code on packaging where consumers can get more information about ingredients.
Despite the backlash, Calkins, of Kellogg, said Bud Light's corn syrup play was a "very smart strategy" that they wouldn't have invested in without plenty of research that showed people cared.
"The challenge in beer is to find a way to differentiate, and they found a very clear point of difference," he said. "You know it touched a nerve."

Texto completo: The New York Times on Saturday justified its new marketing slogan, “The truth is more important now than ever” with a deep dive into the mystery of President Trump’s perpetual tan. In that spirit, I wanted to explore my own curiosities about the cosmetic routines of some other high-profile political figures.

During the Democratic rebuttal to Trump’s Oval Office address on immigration last month, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif, appeared to struggle with some of her speech, slurring in some parts of her comments. Some conservatives online have made similar observations in the past, as when the Daily Wire wrote in January 2018 that Pelosi “appeared to be playing with her dentures,” during the State of the Union address.

I contacted Pelosi’s office to ask if she does in fact wear dentures. A press aide said she would pass along the query to the appropriate staff member but I’ve yet to hear back.

In March 2017, then-Fox News host Bill O’Reilly was made to apologize after he commented on the “James Brown wig” worn by Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif. The congresswoman seemed to confront the controversy on Twitter, writing, “I am a strong black woman. I cannot be intimidated, and I'm not going anywhere. #BlackWomenAtWork.”

She didn’t say, however, whether the dark, voluminous locks on her head were natural. So on Tuesday, I reached out to her communications director, Rykia Dorsey, for comment. I didn’t hear back from her, either.

Describing her morning routine, Democratic presidential contender Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., told New York magazine in August last year that in the morning, “Sometimes I swim if it’s not going to create an issue with my hair.”

The comment indicates a certain level of maintenance for the Harris hair, which perhaps doesn’t naturally have the silky bounce often on display in her televised appearances. I asked her office if she perms it with chemicals (some of which can cause damage to treated hair if it becomes wet), or whether she uses any other products to give it its luster. I’ll update this column if I hear back.

Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., is also running for the Democratic nomination and has spoken in the past about his affinity for “mani-pedis.” But what gives his skin that radiant hue? Is it a cream or cosmetic treatment provided by a professional?

I sent a text to Kristin Lynch, Booker’s press secretary, asking for his regimen, but haven’t heard back.

At 52 years old, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-Calif., is still a bombshell blonde, though the exact shade of her mane varies in photographs. Sometimes it’s platinum and in other photos, more yellow with what appears to be a stark white streak at the front. Does she dye it? And if so, is it completed at a salon or does she do it herself at home out of the box?

I posed these questions to her office, but did not hear back.

To be clear, I have interest in some Republicans, too.

Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., a frequent critic of the president, sports a hair part that fascinates in its geometric placement. It’s not really centered, not quite to the side, and often looks jagged instead of straight.

Does he use a comb or brush to create the part? Or does he finger style?

I requested comment on the hair from his spokesman, James Wegmann, but have not heard back.

Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, in December startled the Internet commentary class when he appeared in the Senate with a beard. The liberal Slate said it “looks great.” But a month later, after Cruz had apparently given more of a severe shape to the beard, Esquire magazine’s Ben Boskovich, a former fan of the beard, said it now looked “washed up.”

The lines of the facial hair near the jaw did seem to sharpen, as though edged by a razor, and it seemed that Cruz made the common mistake of cutting the beard too far from his Adam’s apple, creating an awkward chin strap-like effect.

I asked three of his press aides whether Cruz is maintaining the beard by visiting a professional or if he’s using an electric groomer of some type. I haven’t heard back.

James Comey: 'Zero chance' Hillary Clinton gets prosecuted for her emails

Texto completo: Former FBI Director James Comey said Monday there is "zero chance" Hillary Clinton will be prosecuted for her emails.

"There is zero chance, zero chance, on the facts in the Hillary Clinton case, that she would be prosecuted," Comey said during a town hall event in Sarasota, Fla. "You are out of your mind if you don't think the FBI wanted to make a case if we could. The facts weren't there. Period. Full stop."

As FBI director, Comey oversaw his agency's inquiry into the unauthorized email server Clinton used while serving as secretary of state.

In a stunning public admission in July 2016, Comey announced his agency would not recommend criminal charges against anyone involved with Clinton's private email network, even after finding that Clinton's team was "extremely careless" in handling classified emails.

Less than two weeks before the presidential election — in which Clinton was the Democratic nominee — Comey once again shook the political world when he announced the FBI was reopening its investigation into Clinton's email server. The FBI closed it again just days before it took place. This controversial move has prompted Clinton and her allies to blame Comey, in part, for contributing to her 2016 defeat.

Trump has long attacked Clinton for the email controversy. During the 2016 campaign the "Lock her up" became a mainstay at his rallies and during one of their debates Trump told Clinton she would "be in jail" if he was elected president.

In August, Trump accused the FBI of ignoring "tens of thousands of Crooked Hillary Emails, many of which are REALLY BAD." He also warned that at some point he "may have to get involved!”

A New York Times report from November said Trump earlier in the year went so far as to tell the White House counsel he wanted to direct the Justice Department to prosecute his political enemies, including Clinton and Comey. But Don McGahn, who was the White House lawyer at the time, told the president that he had no authority to order the prosecution of Clinton, and Comey and warned Trump that doing so could lead to his possible impeachment.

Comey was fired in Mary 2017 by Trump, prompting Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to appoint former FBI Director Robert Mueller as special counsel in charge of the federal Russian interference investigation.

At the event in Sarasota, Comey trashed his former boss, calling him "one of the worst listeners," according to Fox 13.

He also brought up his claim that Trump asked him to take a loyalty pledge — a conversation which Trump denies took place. “An effective leader never asks for loyalty,” Comey said to applause according to the Sarasota Herald-Tribune.

Comey, who has been on a book tour for his life memoir A Higher Loyalty, during which he has repeatedly condemned Trump, also lamented his status as a "semi-employed celebrity."

"I thought the easiest thing for me to do would be to be quiet. I don’t love my life as a semi-employed celebrity, but I would be a coward if I didn’t speak. I’m really worried about the impact this president has on our values that we all have in common," he said.

Relaxed abortion rules portend the dehumanization of us all

Texto completo: C.S. Lewis was only partly right when he wrote: The greatest evil ... is conceived and ordered (moved, seconded, carried and minuted) in clean, carpeted, warmed and well-lighted offices, by quiet men with white collars and cut fingernails and smooth-shaven cheeks who do not need to raise their voice.
Lewis, perhaps, couldn’t have envisioned the day when a law allowing abortion up to the moment of birth would receive a standing ovation, as occurred last month with New York’s passage of the absurdly named "Reproductive Health Act."
Upon signing the bill, which also permits some health care professionals who are not doctors to perform the abortions, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo ordered that One World Trade Center be illuminated in pink, hijacking the color associated with saving breast-cancer victims — and the birth of a baby girl.
What a weird, wicked world we live in.
Last Monday in Virginia, Del. Kathy Tran testified on behalf of a bill that would have simplified the process for having a late-term abortion. Currently, Virginia law requires three doctors’ approval for such a procedure. The bill, which was subsequently tabled, would’ve required only one’s.
This was hardly the stuff of "infanticide," a word that began tumbling from the lips of certain critics, but Gov. Ralph Northam wasn’t helpful. Two days before his yearbook scandal broke, he talked during a radio interview about making distressed newborns "comfortable" while the family decides whether to resuscitate.
Just maybe we’re not very good at talking about the unspeakable.
Meanwhile, lawmakers in Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Vermont and other blue states are busy hammering out their own legal concoctions, likely concerned that Roe v. Wade will be overturned by the now-predominantly conservative Supreme Court. I leave others to argue the validity of those concerns, but my sources in the pro-life movement, including several legal scholars, think upending the decision is unlikely given that, in 1992, the court not only reinforced Roe but actually made the ruling stronger.
Regardless, the pro-choice movement has been preparing for such a frontal assault on the few abortion restrictions left to states. In 1973, when Roe was issued, a baby’s viability was set at 24-28 weeks. Today, thanks to technology and our finer understanding of human development, viability occurs around 22 weeks.
In New York City, where about two in five pregnancies are terminated, there will no longer be any presumption of humanity for the baby at any stage of pregnancy, which goes far beyond abortion jurisprudence. Most Americans are fully against such extreme approaches to abortion. One survey puts the share who support abortion during the third trimester at just 13 percent.
Like many if not most Americans, I have been reasonably at ease with President Clinton’s 1996 call for making abortion "safe, legal and rare," but had hoped we’d seriously pursue that goal through better information and limit abortion to the first trimester. But the pro-choice side has resisted many attempts to educate. Activists have opposed laws requiring that pregnant women have the option of viewing a sonogram before their abortion. They’ve also thwarted attempts to make adoption resources available at abortion clinics.
What are they afraid of? That someone may change her mind?
While there are only four doctors in the U.S. that perform third-trimester abortions and, obviously, "no one gets an abortion on the delivery table," as New York Times columnist Michelle Goldberg put it, the codification of late-term abortion should be discomfiting.
It is obvious, meanwhile, that these pro-abortion legislators’ new efforts are aimed at undoing, one by one, the state-level "victories" of their pro-life counterparts — even, apparently, if it means putting women’s lives at greater risk by allowing non-doctors to perform abortions.
But more concerning than a possible increase in late-term abortions (now at fewer than 2 percent of all pregnancy terminations) is the clinical way we’ve come to view and discuss human life. When we use language to disguise reality — whether the developing human baby is a "clump of cells," a "fetus," or, even, a "product of termination" — we move ever-closer to the dehumanization of us all.

Don't let pessimism cloud good stock news

Texto completo: Welcome to the last in my series of columns on the year ahead. In my four earlier ones, I covered why December was lousy and why stocks are on the right side of a swift V-shaped recovery. U.S. stocks have climbed more than 10 percent since the market close on Christmas Eve. Accompanied by wild wiggles, the rest of 2019 should be similarly happy.
On Dec. 17, I explained how stocks' have averaged 34 percent before dividends in the 12 months after all of history's correction bottoms (meaning a drop of 10 to 19.99 percent in the Standard & Poor's 500 index).
Assuming Dec. 24 remains the bottom, this correction ended later in a calendar year than any correction or bear market ever. An average aftermath now would make 2019 simply stellar, and surprise almost everyone. That's bullish.
Maybe Dec. 24 wasn't the bottom. We can't know for sure. But there were abundant bottomish signals. Mutual fund outflows reached levels only associated with major market bottoms. December outflows matched March 2009, when the last bear market ended. U.S. stock market liquidity sank like a brick, also echoing prior lows.
Price-to-earnings ratios contracted last year – earnings soared while stocks fell. A simple secret: Basically every year valuations shrink, the next year they expand.
So unless earnings fall, stocks rise. Analysts expect 6.9 percent earnings growth in 2019. Earnings almost always exceed analysts' estimates. Expanding valuations on top of earnings growth would cause big positive stock returns
Good years follow bad years unless you have global recession or world war. We've never had two straight negative stock market years – except with the Great Depression, the two World Wars, the early 1970s debacle and the tech bubble. Otherwise, stocks were spring-loaded the next year.
And recession is unlikely. I showed you exactly why last week via the Leading Economic Index series – a great predictor for this.
Many misguided people still think the interest rate "yield curve" inverted, signaling that a downturn lurks. I explained on July 22 why that is wrong and how to view it correctly to see reality.
But, suppose it were inverted. So what?
History holds four examples of the yield curve inverting without a recession the next year. Stocks rose every time, averaging 16.6 percent that next year. Since inversion fears are now in the marketplace – that's big potential upside surprise, and bullish!
The government shutdown flooded folks with fear. Yet it shouldn't. The aftermath of shutdowns is also great, with U.S. stocks averaging 12.8 percent in the next 12 months.
Sure, shutdowns must end to have an aftermath. But shutdowns themselves aren't bearish. The prior 19 shutdowns occurred while markets were open. Stocks rose during 11, including 1995-96 – the longest shutdown before the current one.
Now people worry this one's length will cause problems. But U.S. stocks, a leading indicator, have risen over 8 percent since it began. They're telling you not to worry.
Everywhere I look, sentiment seeks negatives, ignoring positives. Did you know global lending and money supply are growing around 6 percent year-over-year? That the global purchasing managers' index is higher now than during most of 2016, a fine year for stocks? That world trade is growing nearly 4 percent year-over-year despite this supposed trade war? That global profit margins are too?
If you didn't know any of this, you aren't alone. Most good news goes unreported or gets couched as bad – a phenomenon I call the pessimism of disbelief. When it strikes, better times are ahead.

Texto completo: Success is amazingly common. What's scarce is success that doesn't fizzle to failure or fade within several generations. You want to succeed sustainably.
If you're anxious to avoid short-term failure, there's a cautionary tale in the legendary lottery curse. Folks win, then the curse promptly transitions their lives into train wrecks.
In the early TV era of the 1950s, this reversal of fortune was epitomized by the popular show "The Millionaire," in which a super "Richie" gave away a million dollars to normal folks who usually became miserable quickly.
Over time we have watched rock stars flame out on drugs. Or beautiful young women marry for money and become morose.
Examples of slower, but bigger fades dot America's corporate landscape, including failures like Sears Holdings' recent bankruptcy. Sears was America's pre-eminent retailer and sixth-largest stock 50 years ago.
Of the top 10 stocks back then, only Exxon survives as a leader. The others are hugely smaller or gone. They were, in order of size: IBM, AT&T, General Motors, Eastman Kodak, Exxon, Sears, Texaco, Xerox, GE and Gulf Oil. Four largely disappeared.
Even super-sized success stories from 20 years ago can fade fast: America Online (1999's 11th largest ), Lucent (#7) MCI World Com (#16) and Yahoo (#25). Other storied names can also collapse: Blockbuster, Digital Equipment, Helene Curtis, and Toys R Us.
Hence, you can't count on your employer, even if you work for the government. My father-in-law hated working for Uncle Sam. Post-Great Depression he did it solely for security. But since 1990, the total civilian federal headcount has shrunk 12 percent (including enterprise workers like in the Postal Service). It keeps wiggling downward.
Yet some names endure, becoming near-permanent icons like Coca-Cola, DowDupont and Merck. What makes them different? Simply, it's a culture that remains restless, striving to change, to be the best and to grow.
That's your goal! To endlessly build your future.
For that you need two truths: First, make sure your employer is like that. And if they aren't, move to one that is. How hard is your employer really striving to grow? How much effort and money do they invest each year into truly new growth oriented initiatives?
My father asked, "What are you doing your competitors aren't doing yet?" It was among the most brilliant lines I ever heard. It changed me. It speaks to putting yourself ahead of the curve or staying ahead. If your current employer isn't seriously striving for future growth, you should shift to one that is before it's too late.
The second truth: You must make yourself indispensable – which has two components. Once you're done with college and working, you need to be permanently learning. You can do it informally online. But keep building your human capital. Google endlessly about anything and everything that touches on what your firm does, and beyond the functions you perform there.
Then, at work, keep volunteering, for everything and anything. Raise your hand repeatedly. Make your boss and boss's boss know you are not about what you "can do," which is about your capacity, but what you "will do" which is above, beyond, and more than that sorry sap next to you. If your firm does shrink, you will be among the last 20 percent they let go, giving you time to maneuver to a more futuristic employer.
In our future, anyone who isn't eager is meager. Great attitude and activity will always equal success. Complacency now equals eventual failure. Sustainable success is only yours to build.

Texto completo: A documentary on PBS dissects the culture surrounding offensive memorabilia. And Michael Almereyda's reimagining of a pivotal social experiment lands on Hulu.
What's on TV
INDEPENDENT LENS: BLACK MEMORABILIA (2019) 10 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). In an interview with "Independent Lens," the director Chico Colvard said that he grew up "unconsciously consuming a steady diet" of racist black memorabilia. While the objects he mentions -- such as mechanical banks or kitchenware -- were created years ago, the tropes they perpetuated live on: Last month, a video of white students at a New York private school in blackface went viral, and old photos of a Florida state official in blackface were resurfaced by a local paper. In this documentary, Colvard explores where those objects and images stand in today's society. His research takes him to a Chinese factory that manufactures racist figurines; a flea market in North Carolina where vendors sell Confederate collectibles; and a neighborhood in Brooklyn where a black artist tries to reclaim minstrel-show themes.
MAN WITH A PLAN 8:30 p.m. on CBS. In this sitcom's Season 2 finale, Andi (Liza Snyder) proposed she and Adam (Matt LeBlanc) flip houses together to keep their family afloat. They take the leap, and in Season 3, they learn the ups and downs of working with a spouse. In this episode, Adam tries to make his office more welcoming for his new business partner.
ELVIS GOES THERE 10 p.m. on Epix. The film critic Elvis Mitchell, who formerly wrote for The New York Times, joins filmmakers and actors on trips to locations that inspired their work in this four-part documentary series. It opens with a visit to London with the actor and director Paul Feig, who says the city has heavily influenced his vision.
What's Streaming
EXPERIMENTER (2015) stream on Hulu or Netflix; rent on Amazon, iTunes, or Vudu; watch for free on YouTube. Peter Sarsgaard stars in this biographical drama about Stanley Milgram, a social psychologist who administered troubling experiments in the 1960s in which participants delivered what they believed to be electric shocks to strangers simply because they were ordered to. Writing in The Times, Manohla Dargis named the movie a Critic's Pick and called it a "nimble, low-frequency high."
TOGETHER on Acorn TV. If you gravitate toward romantic comedies with will-they-won't-they couples, this six-part British series is for you. Tom (Jonny Sweet) and Ellen (Cara Theobold), 20-somethings in London, hit it off immediately. But every step toward a relationship comes with a challenge -- like when Tom's parents reveal early on that he still lives with them.
END GAME (2018) on Netflix. The documentarians Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman ("The Celluloid Closet," "Paragraph 175") shine a spotlight on two medical facilities in San Francisco that are spearheading innovative methods for palliative care. This Oscar-nominated cinéma-vérité documentary goes into hospital rooms where patients confront the end of their lives with trepidation, acceptance and support. Another nominated short documentary, "Black Sheep," about a black man living among racists, is available on YouTube or Amazon.

Our View: Broaden the border debate to include immigration policy

Texto completo: Past the posturing and politics, the United States certainly must ensure the security of the southern border.
However, by turning what should be a full-throated debate on the country's immigration system and the best ways to patrol the border into a simplistic fight over a wall, President Donald Trump is doing our nation a disservice.
This dispute cannot be about whether the U.S. needs to "build a wall," as screaming crowds continue to shout, and Trump has promised. If the fight among Democrats in Congress, the GOP and the president over border security -- which Trump demands include $5.7 billion for a wall -- is about barriers, we all lose.
Democrats will fork over money for security and humanitarian aid, but do not want to give one dollar to build additional fences along the border. Trump is so determined to gain money for his wall that he shut down the federal government for a month.
Now, the nation is in the midst of a three-week negotiating period -- the government is up and running -- yet another shutdown is possible despite the human cost of the last one. Trump himself thinks negotiators are wasting time, and it's being speculated he will take the spotlight of his delayed State of the Union address on Tuesday to announce a national emergency on the border. That emergency, Trump believes, will allow him to build the wall.
Not so fast.
The national emergency on the southern border exists only as a figment of Trump's mind, either because he is divorced from reality or because he knows it riles up his base. So certain is Trump that fear of the "other" -- in this case immigrants from Mexico and Central America -- motivates his voters that he included the wall in his announcement for president. At that 2015 announcement, he famously said: "I will build a great, great wall on our southern border. And I will have Mexico pay for that wall."
The part about Mexico paying has been relegated to the dump heap. It's not going to happen. So, taxpayers are on the hook for a wall. Already, there are hundreds of miles of fencing along the 1,954-mile border between Mexico and the United States. Fences are concentrated in areas found to be popular with drug traffickers and people crossing illegally. Rather than focusing on fences, the debate needs to shift to what the United States can do to improve not just border security, but our entire immigration system.
Washington Post columnist Paul Waldman put it like this: "As immigration policy hangs over the ongoing conflict over whether the government is going to remain open, there's something missing from this discussion, something so fundamental that it's quite remarkable we all seem to have forgotten to even ask about it. ... What nobody asks is this: What kind of immigration system do we actually want?"
That discussion would include finding solutions for the 11 million people believed to be in the United States illegally. It would grant legal status to the Dreamers, the young adults brought here as children. It would reform the immigration system -- the Trump administration seeks to limit immigration and to restrict certain types of immigrants. We favor a fair system, easier to navigate, that allows all types of people in -- if legal immigration is possible, after all, fewer people will choose to enter illegally.
It's also essential to improve the conditions that cause people to seek asylum, and that means humanitarian aid in Central America and cooperating with Mexico on how best to handle refugees. It goes without saying that broad-based immigration reform would stop the policy of separating parents and children and would seek to reunite children in custody with their families.
Instead, we have a president determined to build a wall -- sometimes it's a fence, other times a barrier -- whether that is a smart use of taxpayer dollars or simply an attempt to score a political win. Additionally, Trump's policies aimed at keeping asylum seekers searching for a place to cross are directly impacting New Mexico. Here, asylum-seeking migrants are crossing in remote parts of the state that aren't equipped to handle them. That's because they no longer are being accepted at ports of entry.
Simon Romero and Caitlin Dickerson of the New York Times wrote last week about the increase in remote crossings, with Romero in Antelope Wells, N.M., where residents are feeling overwhelmed. That increase is directly related to U.S. policy, according to the article: "Prompting these trips to ever-more-remote border locations are not only the nearly 700 miles of border wall and fencing built since 2006, but the Trump administration's increasingly rigid immigration policies aimed at deterring the flow of migrant families, mostly from Central America, that have streamed in from Mexico since 2014."
A comprehensive examination of U.S. immigration policy is necessary to both secure the border, protect desperate refugees and ease worries of residents in border towns caught up in this manufactured crisis. Instead of that necessary conversation, we have a president ready to declare a national emergency -- an overreach of his powers that will end up in court. We don't need a wall. We need a better immigration policy, one that lives up to the promise of America while keeping our country safe.

Black history knowledge still lacking

Texto completo: The beginning of Black History Month is an appropriate time to assess the state of its inclusion in the public school curriculum.
African-American history is both popular and critically acclaimed. Books on African-American history routinely make the New York Times best-seller list and regularly win major book awards.
Thirteen states, including Illinois, have mandates or state laws requiring the teaching of black history. By these matrix, black history has been incorporated into the mainstream of U.S. society. Yet, knowledge of the African-American sociohistorical experience remains quite low.
President Gerald Ford's 1976 decree making the 50-year-old commemoration an official national observance perhaps best illustrates this contradiction. In his remarks, Ford thanked Carter G. Woodson for organizing the annual tribute to African-American accomplishments: "One hundred years ago," Dr. Woodson initiated what was then called Negro History Week in 1926.
Ironically, the president who declared Black History Month an official U.S. celebration was unfamiliar with its history. Unfortunately, Ford's lack of knowledge is still representative.
Unawareness of the black experience prevails because black history is not truly incorporated into the public school curriculum. While black history courses are regular elective courses in numerous school districts, only Philadelphia has a mandatory course. Moreover, few of the state mandates provide financial assistance for curriculum enactment and funds for enforcement.
In a real sense, black history remains marginal to the public school curriculum. Its continued marginalization accounts for students' scant knowledge of slavery. "Teaching Hard History: Slavery," a 2018 report by the Southern Poverty Law Center, found only 8 percent of U.S. high school seniors knew slavery was the "central cause" of the Civil War. Nearly half considered the Civil War a tax revolt. Less than a quarter (22 percent) understood the Constitution sanctioned enslavement and benefitted wealthy enslavers.
Further, the authors of "Teaching Hard History: Slavery" discovered the emphasis on "progress" undermined teachers' ability to confront uncomfortable and unresolved legacies of the past. "Progress" pushed public school educators to focus on feel-good stories. Thus, they emphasized whites' abolitionist activity and narratives of racial cooperation and reconciliation. Teachers disconnect slavery from its ideology, white supremacy. And more importantly, educators fail to explain slavery as a system of labor exploitation and its role in building the U.S.
The problem transcends the teaching of slavery and extends to the entirety of African-American history. Research into the State of African American History and Culture in K-12 Public Schools, a 2015 study of 525 elementary and secondary schools, reveals that only one to two lessons a year are dedicated to teaching black history.
Though enthusiastic about teaching black history, the National Museum of African American History and Culture (NAAHC) report found they "lack content knowledge, confidence, time and resources, and are concerned about students' maturity levels."
These problems derive from limitations in teacher certification and in-service programs. Teachers lack knowledge and confidence because few certification programs require coursework in black history. Lacking content knowledge, it's not surprising they evade the subject and offer simplistic content and celebratory interpretations when forced to engage it.
The emphasis on celebratory history often manifests as a focus on significant individuals. In African-American history, this approach is called contributionism. Not surprisingly, schools have succeeded in teaching students the names of famous black individuals.
Sam Wineburg and Chauncey Monte-Sano asked 2,000 high school juniors and seniors throughout the 50 states to list the 10 most famous personalities in U.S. history, "from Columbus to the present day," excluding presidents and their wives. Martin Luther King and Rosa Parks appeared on 67 and 60 percent of students' lists. Forty-four percent of students listed Harriett Tubman. Susan B. Anthony led white figures with 34 percent. Oprah Winfrey was selected by 22 percent of students, putting four African-Americans in the top 10.
Yet, as both "Teaching Hard History: Slavery" and Research into the State of African American History and Culture in K-12 Public Schools discuss, schools have been less successful in teaching complexity. This is especially true concerning interpretations extracted from the black experience, which diverge from and often contradict narratives constructed from U.S. history.
The master narrative of U.S. history presents the years 1800-1854 as a time of national progress, as a moment of democratization and the spread of liberty. During these years, the Louisiana Purchase doubled U.S. territory. The transition toward industrial capitalism and expansion of democratic rights made this period "progressive," for whites.
In contrast, Indian nations were removed, half of Mexico was seized and blacks were plunged into the "first nadir." The Cotton Kingdom brought with it the domestic slave trade, the systematic break up of families, the factory-like routinization of work and the imposition of a brutal discipline on the enslaved.
A complex and correct teaching of African-American history necessitates treating the black experience on its own terms. If we are to truly commemorate black history, we must overhaul teacher certification and in-service programs.
Teachers must be empowered with the knowledge, confidence and resources to introduce their students to a comprehensive and complicated understanding of the black experience. Such an approach would include analysis of the structural and ideological components of racial oppression and exploration of the repertories of African-American community building and resistance.

Texto completo: Today is the 34th day of 2019. There are 331 days left in the year.
Today's highlight in history: On Feb. 3, 1959, rock 'n' roll stars Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and J.P. "The Big Bopper" Richardson died in a small plane crash near Clear Lake, Iowa.
On this date:
In 1690, the first paper money in America was issued by the Massachusetts Bay Colony to finance a military expedition to Canada.
In 1811, American newspaper editor Horace Greeley was born in Amherst, N.H.
In 1913, the 16th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, providing for a federal income tax, was ratified.
In 1917, the United States broke off diplomatic relations with Germany, the same day an American cargo ship, the SS Housatonic, was sunk by a U-boat off Britain after the crew was allowed to board lifeboats.
In 1930, the chief justice of the United States, William Howard Taft, resigned for health reasons. (He died just over a month later.)
In 1943, during World War II, the U.S. transport ship SS Dorchester, which was carrying troops to Greenland, sank after being hit by a German torpedo in the Labrador Sea; of the more than 900 men aboard, only some 230 survived. Four Army chaplains on board gave away their life jackets to save others and went down with the ship.
In 1959, an American Airlines Lockheed Electra crashed into New York's East River, killing 65 of the 73 people on board.
In 1966, the Soviet probe Luna 9 became the first man-made object to make a soft landing on the moon.
In 1988, the U.S. House of Representatives handed President Ronald Reagan a major defeat, rejecting his request for $36.2 million in new aid to the Nicaraguan Contras by a vote of 219-211.
In 1994, the space shuttle Discovery lifted off, carrying Sergei Krikalev, the first Russian cosmonaut to fly aboard a U.S. spacecraft.
In 1995, Discovery blasted off with a woman, Air Force Lt. Col. Eileen Collins, in the pilot's seat for the first time in NASA history.
In 1998, Texas executed Karla Faye Tucker, 38, for the pickax killings of two people in 1983; she was the first woman executed in the United States since 1984. A U.S. Marine plane sliced through the cable of a ski gondola in Italy, causing the car to plunge hundreds of feet, killing all 20 people inside.
Ten years ago: Eric Holder became the first black U.S. attorney general as he was sworn in by Vice President Joe Biden. The White House announced that Tom Daschle had asked to be removed from consideration as health and human services secretary after acknowledging he failed to pay all his taxes.
Five years ago: U.S. stocks tumbled, pushing the Dow Jones industrial average down more than 320 points after reports of sluggish U.S growth added to investor worries about the global economy. Former Vice President Walter Mondale's wife, Joan, died in St. Paul, Minn., at age 83.
One year ago: The fantasy romance "The Shape of Water" added another key prize in the awards season, as Guillermo del Toro took top honors at the Directors Guild Awards. Linebacker Ray Lewis and receiver Terrell Owens were among eight people voted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. The New York Times reported an accusation from actress Uma Thurman that disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein had forced himself on her sexually years ago in a London hotel room; Weinstein acknowledged making an "awkward pass" but strongly denied any physical assault.
Caption: Space Shuttle Discovery launches in 2008 at Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The craft made two historic liftoffs on this date, in 1994 and 1995.

Resumen: President Donald Trump's clashes with Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats have become familiar. So have Trump's tortured attempts to retreat.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – When Dan Coats was tapped by President Donald Trump to be his intelligence director, some of the Indiana Republican's former Senate colleagues wondered if he was too nice for the job.
“I’m not sure likeability and affability are the qualities I want in this position,” Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, told Coats at his confirmation hearing. "You’re going to be reporting to a president who may or may not want to hear what you have to say. ”
That turned out to be an understatement.
"They are wrong!" Trump tweeted Wednesday, after Coats and other leaders of the intelligence services backed differing views of the president's on Iran and North Korea when testifying before Congress this week.
Trump backtracked Thursday, accusing the news media of incorrectly describing the testimony, after initially telling reporters that time will prove him right and his intelligence leaders wrong.
That's become a familiar pattern.
Here's a recap of the clashes between Trump and his director of national intelligence.
Trump sides with Putin
At a news conference in last July, Trump appeared to accept Russian President Vladimir Putin's denial of interference in the 2016 elections over what Coats and others had said are undisputed facts.
"My people came to me, Dan Coats came to me, some others, they said they think it's Russia," Trump said as he stood next to Putin at a joint news conference between the two leaders following their talks in Helsinki. "I have President Putin. He just said it's not Russia. I will say this, I don't see any reason why it would be. "
In response, Coats issued a statement saying the intelligence community has been "clear in our assessments of Russian meddling in the 2016 election and their ongoing, pervasive efforts to undermine our democracy. "
"We will continue to provide unvarnished and objective intelligence in support of our national security," Coats also said.
The next day, Trump said he had misspoken, and that he meant to say he saw no reason why it "wouldn't" be Russia that interfered.
Another reversal
The day after walking back those comments in July, Trump was asked by reporters whether Russia is still targeting the U. S.
"No," he said, again contradicting statements Coats had made.
After another public furor, the White House said Trump's response was misunderstood.
Spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said Trump was “saying ‘no’ to answering questions" from the reporters, not "no" to the question itself.
Coats' candid reaction
While some commentators urged Coats to resign to protect his honor and the honor of the intelligence community, he appeared unruffled.
"As long as I'm able to have the ability to seek the truth and speak the truth, I'm on board," Coats said when asked that week in July if he'd ever considered quitting.
But he couldn't keep his composure when, during the live interview with NBC's Andrea Mitchell at the Aspen Security Forum, news broke that Trump had invited Putin to Washington.
Coats grimaced.
"OK . . . ," he said, while laughing. "That's going to be special. "
Coats also said he had not known in advance of Trump's 2017 White House meeting with the Russian foreign minister and ambassador, at which Trump revealed highly classified information. The meeting, Coats said, was "probably not the best thing to do. "
Was Coats "Anonymous"?
Because of Coats' candor, he was immediately among those speculated to be the author of a September New York Times essay that offered blistering criticism of Trump. The anonymous writer, described by the Times as a "senior official in the Trump administration," described the president as erratic and amoral.
Coats called the speculation that his office penned the letter "patently false. "
"We did not," Coats said in a statement. "From the beginning of our tenure, we have insisted that the entire (intelligence community) remain focused on our mission to provide the president and policymakers with the best intelligence possible. "
Coats' increases transparency
In January, Coats issued publicly his agency's 2019 report on major threats, a departure from past years when the office generates both a public report and a separate classified version. The Washington Post described the change as "an effort by Coats to be more transparent in the face of sustained attacks from the president and his allies on the right against what they've taken to calling the Deep State. "
In the reports' introduction, Coats said he is fortunate to lead an intelligence community "composed of the best and brightest professionals. "
Contradicting Trump
Trump had a different description of that community Wednesday.
"The Intelligence people seem to be extremely passive and naive when it comes to the dangers of Iran," Trump tweeted. "Perhaps Intelligence should go back to school!"
While Trump defended his decision to withdraw the United States from the Iranian nuclear deal – in which the U. S. and allies eased sanctions on Tehran as it gave up the means to make nuclear weapons – the intelligence community said the country continues to live up to its end of the bargain.
"We do not believe Iran is currently undertaking activities we judge necessary to produce a nuclear device,” Coats told senators Tuesday.
Trump continues to plan a second summit meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un – date and location to be determined – and expresses confidence that Kim is committed to junking his nuclear weapons programs.
But Coats also testified Tuesday that North Korea is "unlikely to completely give up its nuclear weapons. "
In tweets, Trump said the U. S. relationship with North Korea is "the best it has ever been. " He said they have stopped nuclear testing, and claimed a "decent chance of Denuclearization. "
Blaming the media
Asked by reporters Thursday if he still has confidence in Coats and CIA Director Gina Haspel to give him good advice, Trump responded, "No, I disagree with certain things that they have said. "
"I think I'm right, but time will prove that," Trump added. "Time will prove me right, probably. "
But, in later remarks to reporters and in a tweet, Trump said there was no difference in views between him and his intelligence leaders.
"Just concluded a great meeting with my Intel team in the Oval Office who told me that what they said on Tuesday at the Senate Hearing was mischaracterized by the media," Trump tweeted. "We are all on the same page!"
What's next?
Hours after that tweet, the New York Times released excerpts from a Thursday interview with Trump in which he was asked about Coats.
"I’m happy with Dan Coats. I am," Trump responded, before adding: "That doesn’t mean . . . . "
Asked if that's a change, Trump remained cryptic.
"Well, no, everybody changes," he said. "You know, this business, other than me, everybody changes. "

Backlash after GCU nixes Shapiro speech

Texto completo: Grand Canyon University has declined to provide a venue for controversial right-wing speaker Ben Shapiro, saying his appearance on the Phoenix campus would be too divisive and run counter to the school's mission.
The decision has stirred a backlash from the youth organization Young America's Foundation at GCU, which supported his appearance.
On Friday, GCU, a private Christian university, released a statement regarding the decision after receiving criticism from students and others in the surrounding community.
"We believe in many of the things that Ben Shapiro speaks about and stands for, including his support for ideals that grow out of traditional Judeo-Christian values and his belief in a free market economy," the statement said.
"It was not our intent to disappoint or offend anyone. It was, rather, to use our position as a Christian university to bring unity to a community that sits amidst a country that is extremely divided and can't seem to find a path forward toward unity."
Shapiro describes himself as "a renowned conservative political pundit, syndicated columnist, lawyer, and New York Times bestselling author."
He is editor-in-chief of the news and opinion site the Daily Wire and host of the popular video podcast "The Ben Shapiro Show," according to his YouTube channel.
Shapiro is known for his highly controversial and conservative views regarding politics, abortion, gun ownership, race and the LGBT community.
GCU administrators told students in a meeting Thursday that allowing Shapiro on GCU's campus would not be good for the school in the long term, that Shapiro's approach instigates a divisive atmosphere and that GCU wants to maintain its culture of unity, love, respect and having all student voices on campus heard, according to a blog post by Young America's Foundation spokesman Spencer Brown.
Concerns over GCU's decision poured out across multiple social-media platforms.
Kelsey McKenzie, a sophomore at GCU, said that when she first heard about the school's decision, she felt extremely hurt and excluded.
"It honestly hurt me. That's my First Amendment, and GCU shouldn't be making me feel this way," McKenzie said. "You look at their mission statement and it says they're open to discussion, but how is everyone being included if someone isn't allowed to come."
McKenzie said her dad was so unhappy that he called the school and complained.
"I can truly see this decision affecting the GCU population. I feel like I don't have a voice if they don't reverse their decision," McKenzie said.
And it looks like others feel the same way.
People were so affected by the university's decision that they posted on social media that they were reconsidering attending the school.
In its statement, GCU acknowledged the negative response.
"We know that if we had made a different decision, we would have disappointed and offended others within the same community," the statement said.
This is not the first time that Shapiro has been involved in controversies surrounding college visits.
Several universities, including Gonzaga, California State University at Los Angeles and DePaul have also turned down Shapiro from speaking, citing safety issues as their main concerns.
Cal State received ire from students and faculty claiming Shapiro's remarks would promote "racist, classist, misogynist, sexist, homophobic" speech.
In 2017, Shapiro visited the University of California, Berkeley, where his visit drew protests from students.
Shapiro spoke, but the university closed part of the campus down as a security measure and nine protesters were arrested.
That visit famously led to a yearlong lawsuit between UC Berkeley and the Young America's Foundation over alleged First Amendment violations by Berkeley. The group prevailed.
"This represents so much more than someone coming to campus. Ben Shapiro coming won't be a negative experience. It just depends on college students being mature enough to have a positive conversation and debate with others if our viewpoints differ. And GCU students can do that," McKenzie said.

Texto completo: Actress Hedy Lamarr was the personification of glamor.
Born in 1914 in Austria, she was discovered for her beauty in her teens and went on to dazzle audiences from the silver screen for decades.
At 19, she raised eyebrows by doing what is believed to be one of the first nude sex scenes in a movie. The film was banned by Adolf Hitler, and became a widespread controversy.
People around the world were spellbound by the beautiful Hedy Lamarr; to some degree, she was the original Kardashian. Provocative and captivating, she simply couldn't be ignored.
The fascinating thing to me, however, was her incredible mind.
Lamarr was a talented inventor. Just after World War II, she was granted a patent for a frequency-guided torpedo that leveraged her groundbreaking invention of "frequency hopping." The technology that she invented became the basis for GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and other secure wireless communications. Scientists estimate that the value of that patent today would be worth over $30 billion.
Despite Lamarr's beauty and her brilliance, life was hard on her. Six marriages, six divorces.
Her talent for acting and invention didn't translate to business. She never managed to enjoy the compensation she deserved.
She struggled with depression, anxiety and the punishing toll of toxic relationships. Throughout her career, she was chided in the media, and she lived her final days as a recluse.
But somehow, she managed to stay positive and forge ahead even in her darkest moments. Before her death in 2000, she penned the following:
"People are unreasonable, illogical, and self-centered.
"Love them anyway.
"If you do good, people will accuse you of selfish motives.
"Do good anyway.
"The biggest people with the biggest ideas can be shot down by the smallest people with the smallest minds.
"Think big anyway.
"What you spend years building may be destroyed overnight.
"Build anyway.
"Give the world the best you have, and you'll be kicked in the teeth.
"Give the world the best you've got anyway."
What incredible words to live by.
Every one of us has a dream, and every one of us has 78 reasons why not to pursue it.
When we step off the beaten path, fear often sets in and it becomes easy to quit. Yet bowing to the critics and finger-pointers is not the stuff of legends. The ones who make history are the ones who forge ahead even when it gets tough.
They love, even when they may get hurt. They do the right thing instead of the easy thing. They think big even when the world tries to hold them back. They build and create, despite the discomfort along the way.
Let's follow the lead of the incredible Hedy Lamarr. Love anyway. Do good anyway. Think big anyway. Build anyway.
Do it anyway.

Drunk at Work
I work for a nonprofit that relies heavily on private sponsors. Our new boss loves to celebrate with wine or Champagne when any amount is donated -- and we constantly receive donations. Even for a TGIF, the boss decided to bring in drinks just because. As a person who is not a heavy drinker, it makes me feel a bit uncomfortable. How do I rectify this culture change of constantly drinking in the workplace?
-- Elmsford, N.Y.
Really though, aren't we all drinking in the workplace? Drinking the rancid Kool-Aid of corporate eco-terrorism and capitalist larceny, that is!
But alcohol-drinking, honestly, isn't that fun in the office. I do find it cute when people parade a bar cart around on Friday at 6 p.m. It's charming! Yet I find it way less cute at 5:45, and reprehensible before 5:15. (I just pack up and go home when people start drinking. But as you can tell, I'm the funnest person in the room.)
I wish I was a chill bro who believed that everyone should crack open a cold one after lunch. But there's no world in which it's appropriate for a nonprofit to have regular drinking in the office, unless it's a nonprofit devoted to housing for aging vintners and sommeliers.
Do you know who finds excuses to introduce alcohol into all life events? Yes. That's right. Your boss is an alcoholic.

What if Work Was Just a Job?
I'm about a year in at a new job that I'm very proud to have. I love the work I do, I'm happy enough with the pay and I feel respected. One big problem, though: I do not relate socially to anyone in my office. I've definitely tried -- I send the occasional joke over Gchat, I ask how people's weekends were when I run into them in the kitchen, all that, but I get nothing back. It permeates the office culture. It seems that no one here really socially interacts with each other.
I work long hours, and I'm a fairly extroverted person, so I'm thinking that the company culture just might not be right for me. I don't need much, but I do know the occasional banter/dish about my weekend would help me feel a lot happier. A lot of it has to do with a pretty significant age gap. However, the lack of social interaction makes me pine to leave the office, thus I feel burned-out often, and that burnout has led to me tending toward laziness sometimes. Is this enough for me to consider leaving an otherwise great gig?
-- New York City
I think you're having too many cascading experiences about this workplace, when instead you should be having cascading experiences of trauma over the fact that you are scouring the ocean bare of life with your daily existence. Sorry! Somewhere a plastic bag you once touched is choking the life from a dolphin!
I don't think you're burned out. I think you have a job, and you have a life, and perhaps they are meeting different needs, in some kind of "balance." A balance of work and life, if you will, to coin a phrase.
You should probably check to see if your co-workers are just socializing behind your back because they don't like you.

The Internet Is an Endless Succession of Farewells
This question concerns media, the internet and work. There's an album by The Promise Ring called "Nothing Feels Good." It's an emo record.
So I'm going to risk sentimentality here and say that there were places on the internet about 10 years ago that were exciting for me. These were lively communities based around art and experimental literature, variously called websites, magazines and blogs.
But I can no longer identify any exciting internet magazines; they all feel very antiseptic. This relates to work, because people read internet magazines at work, and because some people work for internet magazines. How did we get here? Pardon my emotion.
-- Minneapolis
I'm listening to "Nothing Feels Good" right now for the first time and I absolutely hate it!
How did we get to this place where "content" that solicits you to consume it feels invasive, manipulative or basic? It may not surprise you that the answer is mostly about money, but is also about people and forms growing up. Also, the exciting internet magazines you liked the best should have requested that you pay them $2 a month.
Oh well! Now they are dead because they didn't. Some of the eldest, like Suck.com, seem to even be completely obliterated. Their parts or people were absorbed by their betters and biggers. Many weird bloggers now work at major capitalist media institutions, it turns out. Also, many of them have gone all the way to the television, a.k.a. "the little screen." From Julie Klausner and Julieanne Smolinski to Megan Amram and Cord Jefferson and Emma Carmichael, and yes also Diablo Cody before them: Never forget, a number of the internet's most beautiful basket cases now make the fine television that you enjoy upon your streaming service of choice.
Now, otherwise, instead of reading, people gaze upon the many pictures of the duckfaces. Think about how mournful this generation will feel in a decade for what they will inevitably lose too, when the next crop of young people express themselves with -- electric shocks? Mutilation? Who knows.
Nostalgia, however, is a very rainbow-tinted set of glasses. I recently briefly got my hands on a collection of "7 Days," the fabled magazine edited by the legendary, just-retired Adam Moss that folded in 1990. It was fascinating and intriguing as a time capsule and a product. Also, lots of it was not really all that interesting.
Sooner or later, it's all destined for the bird cage. But all these publications that rose and fell, at least they gave some people some jobs for a while. Speaking of! If you've enjoyed your time at all here in this first three-month installment of Work Friend, please tip your server by subscribing to The New York Times.

Destiny can rise above demography

Texto completo: The two great literary bookends of President Donald Trump's half-term of grift and chaos have come from survivors of the most broken white communities that helped put him in office. They also show us the best way out of the basement of American despair.
How J.D. Vance, the author of "Hillbilly Elegy," and Tara Westover, who wrote "Educated," escaped physical and psychological horror is the dose of Charles Dickens that makes these two memoirs so memorable.
Vance was raised by grandparents from Kentucky in a declining steel town in southwest Ohio. His mother was a drug addict who married several times. It was doubtful he would finish high school. Now he's a venture capitalist who hobnobs with One Percenters in gilded hollows, and Ron Howard is making a movie of his life.
Westover, a self-taught writer of incandescent insight, came from a clan of survivalist end-timers in rural Idaho, was badly beaten by her brother and was nearly killed when forced to work at the family junkyard. Her parents didn't believe in birth certificates, school or safety regulations. She now has a Ph.D. in history, after stops at Harvard and Cambridge.
Both books have been sold in part as anthropological guides to a Trumpland that is terra incognita to most Americans.
On the surface, this is true. Vance's ragged Middletown, Ohio, went for Trump 2-to-1. And Franklin County, Idaho, where Westover grew up, gave Hillary Clinton just 7 percent of its vote. The people we meet in both places are poor, white, undereducated, violent and evangelical in the extreme.
But as much as these folks were all-in for the oft-bankrupt developer, Trump's presidency has been a kick in the teeth for them. The policies he has promoted - taking health care from the poor, trying to slash aid for people unable to afford college, gutting regulations that save lives in mills and scrapyards - have made life more hazardous in Trump-won ZIP codes.
Beyond that, the surprise takeaway from these books is that we have the tools at hand to ensure that demography is not destiny in Forgotten America. One common thread of both memoirs is distrust of institutions. And yet it was institutions - the military in Vance's case, college in Westover's life - that saved them.
That, and a handful of people who showed them enough love and an escape route from places where "family dysfunction" is too kind a euphemism.
Their cultures are toxic and intransigent. As Vance writes, "poverty is in the family tradition," as is "learned helplessness." 
He is scornful of government help programs. "I am a conservative," he writes in a new afterword, "one who doubts that the 1960s approach to welfare has made it easier for our country's poor children to achieve their dreams."
But it was a government hand up - the Marine Corps and federal aid to get through college - that sent Vance on his way.
Tara Westover's story is more harrowing. It's not just the dark cave of ignorance in which she was raised, in a family that enabled domestic abuse. Her father believed doctors were "minions of Satan" and public school was a plot of the Illuminati.
College was her lifeline. She taught herself enough to get into Brigham Young University. 
College is certainly no panacea for all 16 million whites living in poverty, among Trump's strongest backers. But it is for enough of them. And what Trump offered these people, in his proposed budget for last year, were proposals to cut education aid by $200 billion over the next decade. He would have made it harder for the poor to stay in college.

Venezuela plan needs skepticism

Texto completo: There's no doubt Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro is a terrible leader. Following in the steps of his predecessor Hugo Chavez, he is further destroying what's left of a once-prosperous oil state. His human rights record is a disaster.
But the Trump administration's effort to oust Maduro - it recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido as legitimate president last week - revives memories of past unhappy U.S. efforts at regime change. Think Libya, failed efforts in Syria, and Iraq, for starters.
In true Trumpian fashion there appears to be no Plan B should Maduro hang on, nor any strategy for coping with a failed state if he is deposed. Yet so far Trump's Venezuela venture has received bipartisan support in Congress. It should be getting much more skeptical scrutiny than it has received until now.
First, there is the matter of why we are involved in Venezuela regime change at this moment.
The rhetoric about human rights from the president and Vice President Pence clearly doesn't cut it; this is not a White House that cares about humanitarian causes. Maduro may be the first despot for whom Trump has expressed dislike.
When the Venezuela story broke last week, it looked like a move to distract from the government shutdown. I thought it might be a test run for the bigger Trump aim of squeezing Iran into regime change via sanctions.
Yet, as the New York Times has detailed, the effort to dislodge Maduro is mainly the result of a long-running push by Cuban-American Sen. Marco Rubio, R. Fla., to engage Trump on the issue. The underlying reason appears to be Cuba: Maduro, like Chavez, is closely aligned with Havana, which long profited from cheap Venezuelan oil. Ousting Maduro would hurt the Cuban regime.
It looks like Rubio, along with another Cuban-American - the National Security Council's senior director for Western Hemisphere affairs, Mauricio Claver-Carone - persuaded Trump this issue was a winner.
Perhaps this appeared to be the opportune moment: the situation was at boil, with huge anti-Maduro demonstrations on the streets of Caracas. The optics were good. "This is a civic revolution against a kleptocratic tyranny," says the University of Maryland's Vladimir Tismaneanu, an expert on popular revolts against dictators. The young, handsome Guaido - directly encouraged by Pence - declared himself the legitimate president.
As leader of Venezuela's National Assembly, Guaido had a plausible legal basis to take charge, since the last presidential elections were blatantly rigged. Moreover, Washington got many Latin countries to recognize Guaido, with EU nations poised to join if Maduro didn't schedule new elections.
Yet, good optics and good causes can't overcome the caveats that make U.S. intervention a huge gamble. So far the Venezuelan military is backing Maduro, and it, plus tens of thousands of armed militiamen, has all the guns. U.S. sanctions may deter Maduro from selling oil to the United States, but his strong backers China and Russia can take up the slack, while other countries will also buy more discounted oil.
Will the United States intervene militarily if Maduro hangs on? It looks unlikely (despite National Security Adviser John Bolton's efforts to hint that this option is open). At a time when Trump wants to pull all U.S. troops out of Syria, Afghanistan, and maybe even South Korea - damn the consequences - it's hard to imagine him invading another country.
That's a good thing, because, if the military sticks by Maduro, U.S. intervention would be a very bad idea.
So why are we getting into the regime change game again in Venezuela? That is the question that Americans should be asking right now.

Trump Jr.'s mystery calls in '16 weren't to his father; Investigators say business associates were on the line

Texto completo: For more than a year, congressional Democrats have pushed to unlock a mystery they said could reveal whether Donald Trump had advance knowledge of a meeting his eldest son had in the summer of 2016 with a Russian lawyer promising damaging material about Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
The key, they said, was to determine who was using blocked telephone numbers to speak to Donald Trump Jr. before and after the meeting in Trump Tower, suggesting he may have communicated with his father on a private line.
But Senate investigators have concluded the blocked calls were conversations between Trump Jr. and two longtime business associates: Howard Lorber, a real estate investor who has done business in Russia, and Brian France, the chief executive of NASCAR, according to two people familiar with the determination.
The findings were first reported by CNN and ABC News.
France did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
A spokesman for Lorber said Friday that the real estate magnate "does not recall conversations with Donald Trump Jr. in the summer of 2016," adding that Lorber never discussed "any Russian matters" with the president's son.
Lorber is a longtime friend of the elder Trump, and the two went to Moscow in 1996 to scout for a real estate deal that never materialized, according to people familiar with the visit. The trip helped spur Trump's interest in seeking other ways over the years to build a tower in Moscow.
President Trump has long denied he knew about the Trump Tower gathering in 2016, which was attended by Trump Jr., his brother-in-law Jared Kushner and Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. At the meeting, Trump Jr. was expecting a Russian lawyer linked to the Kremlin to share dirt on Clinton, he later told Congress, but she instead pressed him on a U.S. law levying sanctions on Russia for human rights abuses.
The president and his allies seized on conclusions by congressional investigators, saying the findings undercut Democratic efforts to raise questions about links between Trump and Russia's interference in the 2016 campaign.
"The big deal, very mysterious Don jr telephone calls, after the innocent Trump Tower meeting, that the media & Dems said were made to his father (me), were just conclusively found NOT to be made to me. ... Really sad," the president tweeted late Thursday.
"This Witch Hunt must end!" he added.
In his own tweet, Trump Jr. wrote: "More of the Democrat's #fakenews narrative disappearing before their eyes. I wonder how many more false leaks will pop now to keep their dreams alive???"
Trump Jr. told the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2017 that his father had no knowledge of the June 2016 meeting with the Russians.
Democrats, led by Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who now chairs the House intelligence committee, were skeptical of Trump Jr.'s account, noting that his first explanations of the meetings were misleading.
In a July 8, 2017, statement to The New York Times, Trump Jr., said meeting participants "primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children." The statement did not mention that he was promised damaging information about Clinton - or that Trump Jr. had responded enthusiastically to the offer.
"If it's what you say I love it," he wrote in an email to an associate who offered to set up the meeting.
Democrats raised questions about phone calls made by Trump Jr. on June 6, 2016, that they thought might show that Trump's son informed his father about the meeting in advance.
At 4:04 p.m. that day, phone records show, Emin Agalarov, a wealthy Russian who helped arrange the meeting, called Trump Jr.
Phone records show Trump Jr. called Agalarov at 4:31 p.m. Between those two calls, phone records show that Trump Jr. was connected with a blocked phone number.
Trump Jr. told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he did not remember whom he spoke with at that time, but others testified at the time that his father uses a blocked line.
Democratic members of the House intelligence committee pushed for information on the blocked numbers for more than a year. But House Republicans rebuffed efforts to subpoena the phone records, according to Schiff.
Schiff told MSNBC that he would continue his efforts to "find out who Don Jr. was talking to about that meeting at Trump Tower."
"Those conversations could have taken place over the phone, or they could have taken place by Don Jr. walking down the hall to talk to his dad," he added Thursday.

Challenge to President And His View of News

Texto completo: President Trump takes credit for popularizing the term "fake news."
But the consequences? Not his concern.
In lengthy and at times contradictory remarks on Thursday about the news media -- which he deemed "important" and "beautiful," but also "so bad" and "unfair" -- Mr. Trump called himself "a victim" of unfair coverage and declined to accept responsibility for a rise in threats against journalists since he took office.
"I do notice that people are declaring more and more fake news, where they go, 'Fake news!"' the president said during an Oval Office interview with The New York Times. "I even see it in other countries. I don't necessarily attribute that to me. I think I can attribute the term to me. I think I was the one that started using it, I would say."
In an unusual arrangement, the publisher of The Times, A. G. Sulzberger, joined two of the paper's White House correspondents in conducting Thursday's interview, and he took the lead in questioning the president about his attacks on the press.
[Read a transcript of the interview between the publisher and the president.]
When Mr. Sulzberger said foreign leaders were increasingly using the term "fake news" to justify suppressing independent scrutiny, Mr. Trump replied: "I don't like that. I mean I don't like that."
But, in a common pattern whenever the president speaks about the press, Mr. Trump quickly refocused on his personal grievances. "I do think it's very bad for a country when the news is not accurately portrayed," he said. "I really do. And I do believe I'm a victim of that, honestly."
Mr. Trump's attacks on American news organizations have been cited by press advocates for emboldening foreign autocrats who censor, threaten, jail and assault journalists in their countries.
Mr. Sulzberger, who sat opposite the Resolute Desk, along with the Times journalists Peter Baker and Maggie Haberman, repeatedly asked Mr. Trump whether he understood the global effects of his words.
"We're seeing leaders of journalistic organizations saying very directly that governments feel like there is a climate of impunity that's been created," the publisher said. "You know the United States and the occupants of your office historically have been the greatest defenders of the free press."
"And I think I am, too," Mr. Trump interjected. "I want to be. I want to be." He quickly added: "I guess the one thing I do feel, because you look at network coverage, it's so bad."
The interview arose from a dinner invitation extended by the president to Mr. Sulzberger, who assumed leadership of The Times a little more than a year ago, when he replaced his father, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr., in a generational changing of the guard. Instead of a dinner, the publisher requested an on-the-record session, with Times reporters included, and Mr. Trump agreed.
It was not the first time that the two men had debated Mr. Trump's remarks concerning the press.
In July, the publisher met with the president in the Oval Office for an off-the-record chat. Nine days later, Mr. Trump said on Twitter that he and Mr. Sulzberger had discussed "the vast amounts of Fake News being put out by the media & how that Fake News has morphed into phrase, 'Enemy of the People.' Sad!"
That same day, the publisher released a statement saying that the president had misrepresented their exchange. He called Mr. Trump's attacks on journalism "dangerous and harmful to our country."
On Thursday, the publisher urged Mr. Trump to reconsider his denigration of the press.
"The effects are not just being felt with the outlets who you feel are treating you unfairly," he said. "They're being felt all over the world, including folks who are literally putting their lives on the line to report the truth."
"I understand that," Mr. Trump replied before pivoting, once again, to complaints about how he has been covered.
"I don't mind a bad story if it's true, I really don't," the president said. "You know, we're all, like, big people. We understand what's happening. I've had bad stories, very bad stories where I thought it was true and I would never complain. But when you get really bad stories, where it's not true, then you sort of say, 'That's unfair."'
Mr. Trump has spent decades cajoling and needling the journalists who cover him. In the interview, he sidestepped the notion that his ascent to the world's most powerful pulpit had made his criticisms far more consequential than they were when he was a real estate developer and reality-television star.
At one point, Ms. Haberman asked Mr. Trump: "What do you see the role of a free press as? What do you think a free press does?"
Mr. Trump replied that it "describes and should describe accurately what's going on anywhere it's covering, whether it's a nation or a state or a game or whatever."
"And if it describes it accurately and fairly," he added, "it's a very, very important and beautiful thing."
What Mr. Trump considers fair, however, is almost always in line with what he considers flattering.
When Mr. Sulzberger noted that all presidents had complained about how they were depicted by the news media -- "tough coverage is part of occupying the most powerful seat on Earth," the publisher said -- Mr. Trump replied: "But I think I get it really bad. I mean, let's face it, this is at a level that nobody's ever had before."
The president said Fox News "treats me very well" and praised local television as "so great to me," but called NBC "terrible" and asserted that The Times "treats me so unbelievably terribly."
Mr. Sulzberger told Mr. Trump that his paper's responsibility was "to cover people and institutions of power, toughly, aggressively."
"It's never fun to be on the other side of that," Mr. Sulzberger added. "You have my commitment that as we do that toughly and aggressively, we will also do it fairly."
"I appreciate that," the president replied, before reminiscing about the highlights of his unlikely political rise.
"I ran, I won, and I'm really doing a good job," Mr. Trump said, lamenting that his surprise victory did not receive the praise he thought it deserved -- particularly from The Times, a publication that has loomed throughout his life as representing the establishment whose respect he has long sought.
"I came from Jamaica, Queens, Jamaica Estates, and I became president of the United States," Mr. Trump said. "I'm sort of entitled to a great story -- just one -- from my newspaper."

Ernie Sisto, a longtime New York Times staff photographer, took the iconic photograph of Jackie Robinson shown above on April 11, 1947, four days before Robinson's first major-league game. The markings on the back, left, note the many dates the image was considered or published by The New York Times.
As we digitize our photo library -- some six million images dating back more than 100 years -- we're publishing the pictures in a new archival storytelling project called Past Tense.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: In 1950, "The Jackie Robinson Story," a film version of Robinson's life, arrived in movie theaters. What stood out about the movie, aside from how quickly it was made, was that the actor portraying Jackie Robinson was Jackie Robinson himself.
What stood out even more, perhaps, was that Robinson, without acting experience, was able to hold his own on the screen while playing opposite Ruby Dee, who was portraying Jackie's wife, Rachel.
Here is how The New York Times' movie critic, Bosley Crowther, put it after viewing the film:
"What is surprising, however, in this new film, which came to the Astor last night, is the sincerity of the dramatization and the integrity of Mr. Robinson playing himself."
Robinson, Crowther added, "displays a calm assurance and composure that might be envied by many a Hollywood star."
Other critics, the baseball writers, weighed in a dozen years later when they voted him into the Hall of Fame in his first year on the ballot.
His election made Robinson the first African-American player to make it to Cooperstown. He was not a unanimous choice; indeed, he was named on only 124 of the 160 ballots cast, just four more than the number he needed for election.
But in those days, the writers could be stingy when it came time to vote. Joe DiMaggio, for instance, did not get enough votes for induction until his third year on the ballot. Ted Williams, perhaps the greatest hitter in the history of baseball, did go in on the first ballot, but it was not unanimous. He got 93.4 percent of the votes cast.
In that sense, then, it was enough that Robinson was in, and at his induction ceremony, with his mother, Mallee, and Branch Rickey in attendance, he thanked both of them and his wife, the writers who had elected him and "all of the people throughout this country" who had supported him as he broke the color barrier.
His initial Hall of Fame plaque made reference only to his exploits as a player. That changed in 2008, when a new plaque replaced the old one. Five years later, in 2013, a new film dramatization of Robinson's life, "42," was released. The Jackie Robinson story was still vital.

Yes, it's cold in the Midwest. That doesn't mean climate change isn't happening.

Texto completo: It's a common refrain from climate change skeptics -- It's cold out, it's snowing here, so climate change is a bunch of bunk. This erroneous thinking has been debunked by scientists for decades, but it persists. And now the man with the biggest microphone in America -- President Donald Trump -- is repeated the same false logic.
"In the beautiful Midwest, windchill temperatures are reaching minus 60 degrees, the coldest ever recorded. In coming days, expected to get even colder. People can't last outside even for minutes," the president tweeted on Monday. "What the hell is going on with Global Waming [sic]? Please come back fast, we need you!"
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, an agency the president oversees, responded with a tutorial on the difference between climate and weather. "Winter storms don't prove that climate warming isn't happening," it responded to Trump.
[Global carbon emissions reached a record high in 2018]
That's because climate and weather, though related, are not the same thing. Worldwide warming -- climate -- can make winter storms and cold snaps -- local weather -- worse.
The New York Times offered this simple explanation: "Climate refers to how the atmosphere acts over a long period of time, while weather describes what's happening on a much shorter time scale. The climate can be thought of, in a way, as the sum of long periods of weather.
"Or, to use an analogy Mr. Trump might appreciate, weather is how much money you have in your pocket today, whereas climate is your net worth. A billionaire who has forgotten his wallet one day is not poor, anymore than a poor person who lands a windfall of several hundred dollars is suddenly rich. What matters is what happens over the long term."
And, over the long term, it is clear that the Earth is getting warmer. To illustrate this, the Times cited data from the University of Maine's Climate Change Institute. Even with the current extreme cold temperatures in the midwestern United States, the average temperature in North America is warmer than the historical base temperature for Jan. 30, which is set from 1979 to 2000. The worldwide temperature for the day is also above the historical average.
Meanwhile, temperatures in Australia have exceeded 120 degree Fahrenheit, surpassing historical records.
Warming, especially in the Arctic, it turns out, is responsible for the current cold snap in the midwest, as well as the one there in 2014. Jacquelyn Gill, an assistant professor of paleoecology at the UMaine Climate Change Institute, explains why.
"The Arctic is warming faster than any other area on the planet, which is reducing the differences -- or, the gradient -- in temperature between the North Pole and more temperate latitudes, like here in Maine. As the gradient weakens -- Arctic and lower-latitude temperatures become more similar as the Arctic warms -- the jet stream gets weaker. It can get 'stuck' in a wavy position for days or weeks, pulling cold Arctic air down" to places like Michigan and Illinois.
"So [scientists] think these extreme cold events (weather) have a connection to the long-term warming (climate)," she wrote in an email to the BDN.
Here's what we need to be focusing on: Thirteen agencies within the Trump administration warned recently that climate change will have devastating consequences on the U.S. and the world.
The report's message is simple: Climate change is real and it poses a serious threat to Americans' health, finances and general well-being. The hurricanes and wildfires that are increasingly killing and displacing Americans will become more frequent and intense. Water shortages and heat waves, especially those that plague the western United States, will become more acute, causing crop failures and human deaths.
[Antarctica is losing ice 6 times faster today than in 1980s]
The report came on the heels of an analysis that warned that global leaders had only 12 years to dramatically cut carbon emissions or risk catastrophic, irreversible changes to the planet.
Without significant reductions in carbon emissions, from transportation, energy generation, manufacturing other sources, the planet will continue to warm. There will continue to be frigid cold snaps and major snow storms, but that doesn't mitigate the coming disaster that can only be addressed through significant policy changes.

Trump Organization Will Use System to Verify Workers' Documentation

Texto completo: The Trump Organization said late Tuesday that it was implementing a system to weed out undocumented immigrants who try to get jobs at its properties. The move followed reports in The New York Times last month that the president's company was employing people at its flagship golf club in New Jersey who are in the country illegally.
"We are actively engaged in uniforming this process across our properties and will institute E-verify at any property not currently utilizing this system," Eric Trump, an executive vice president of the company, said in a statement. "As a company we take this obligation very seriously and when faced with a situation in which an employee has presented false and fraudulent documentation, we will take appropriate action."
Thousands of employers have enrolled voluntarily in the government's E-Verify electronic system, which checks documents provided by new hires against Social Security Administration and Department of Homeland Security records. A mismatch suggests that the person is unauthorized to work.
All federal contractors must use E-Verify, and 22 states require at least some private and public employers to do so. The federal E-Verify database suggested that the Trump Organization did not use heightened employment document verification procedures at several of its properties, meaning that the chances of employing undocumented workers was high.
The New York Times reported in December that undocumented immigrants had been employed for years at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., as housekeepers, landscapers and kitchen staff.
They were kept on the payroll despite the fact that management was aware that they had used phony documents to secure employment, as is common among undocumented immigrants.
Victorina Morales, an undocumented immigrant from Guatemala, said that a manager at Bedminster helped her secure a new fake Social Security Number and legal permanent-residency card after telling her that those on file had expired.
Since the articles were published, about a dozen workers deemed ineligible to work in the United States because they lacked legal immigration status have been terminated at the Bedminster club, according to people familiar with the matter.
Another dozen were fired at the Trump National Golf Club in Westchester earlier this month, a development first reported by the Washington Post.
"I must say, for me personally, this whole thing is truly heartbreaking," Mr. Trump said in the statement on Tuesday. "Our employees are like family but when presented with fake documents, an employer has little choice."
He said that hiring undocumented immigrants was not a problem unique to the Trump Organization, and that it "demonstrates that our immigration system is severely broken and needs to be fixed immediately."
The Trump Organization said last month that it would immediately terminate those who were not authorized to work in the United States. But for several weeks it failed to respond to questions about what measures it was taking to rectify the situation.
President Trump has made border security and protecting jobs for Americans cornerstones of his presidency, from the border wall he has pledged to build -- it recently resulted in the partial government shutdown -- to the workplace raids and payroll audits that his administration has carried out.
Mr. Trump launched his bid for the G.O.P. presidential nomination in June 2015, declaring that the United States had become a "dumping ground for everybody else's problems." Mexico was "sending people" to commit crimes and bring drugs. "They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people," he said.
In a speech in Arizona shortly after, he deemed illegal immigration "a major, major problem in this country," vowing to erect a wall along the southwest border.
In August 2015, Mr. Trump told The Times that his companies employed only people with legal work papers.
When the Trump International Hotel opened for business in Washington, the president boasted that he had used E-Verify to ensure that only those legally entitled to work were hired.
"We didn't have one illegal immigrant on the job," Mr. Trump said then.
About 11 million undocumented immigrants live in the United States and about eight million of them are in the labor force, according to the Pew Research Center, a nonpartisan think tank. It is an open secret that many businesses, especially in the service sector, employ them.
To deter illegal hiring, Immigration and Customs Enforcement conducts audits of businesses, having slapped tens of millions of dollars in administrative and criminal penalties on those found to employ undocumented workers since the early 2000s. These inspections have intensified under the Trump administration.
From Oct. 1, 2017, through July 20, 2018, ICE opened 6,093 work-site investigations and made 675 criminal and 984 administrative work-site-related arrests, several times more than in the entire 2017 fiscal year from Oct. 1, 2016 to Sept. 30, 2017.
Employers who use E-Verify contend that they struggle to attract enough workers to perform menial, physically onerous jobs. The vast majority of businesses simply require applicants to fill out a federal form, the I-9, and present identification and Social Security card, which they assume are genuine.

Texto completo: Despite the recent settlement of the Los Angeles teachers strike, mostly in the teacher union’s favor, the deal largely ignores the shaky financial realities of the school district. While the union crows about its apparent victory, the potential fiscal disaster should make teachers consider leaving the union, not rallying around it.
In addition to a 6 percent raise for teachers, the settlement deal includes more staff at schools and a cap on class sizes. Yet, the district’s finances mean that the deal is built on quicksand.
As the New York Times pointed out, “the deal essentially punted on the question of how the district would come up with the $403 million to pay for the additional staff members.”
Further, the district can only afford the deal if it can pass a local parcel tax in 2020 and receive increased state funding from Sacramento.
These glaring financial questions clash with the district’s current bottom line.
For example, state law requires the district to maintain a minimum 1 percent budget reserve, and the district has a structural deficit, spending more than it takes in.
That structural deficit will soon end up causing the district to dip below the state-mandated 1 percent minimum.
Los Angeles County Office of Education superintendent Debra Duardo recently told the education group Speak Up, “it’s gotten to the point where [the district] can’t show us that they can maintain a 1 percent reserve in their third year out.”
The County estimates that by 2021-22, “the district will be bankrupt.”
Duardo points out, “Especially at a district as large as LAUSD, if they were to go insolvent, then they would be in really big trouble.”
What kind of trouble? For teachers, here is the chilling warning.
The district, says Duardo, “would actually run out of the cash they need to pay their teachers and all of their salaries.”
Duardo explains that a budget reserve is a one-time pot of cash, and “that’s not money you [will] have [again in the future].”
In response to a question about the district giving in to the union’s demands, Duardo is clear about the ramifications: “The law is set up where if they were to show us in their budget that they don’t have enough money to maintain that reserve, and even go further into the negative — which would concern us that they may be at risk of becoming insolvent — then the next step would be for us to assign a fiscal advisor.”
The kicker: “And a fiscal advisor has stay-and-rescind authority, which means that if there are decisions being made that put the district at risk of becoming insolvent, then we could override decisions that the board is making.”
The union claims that the district is not deficit spending, but Duardo points to the simple fiscal fact that the district’s reserve is plunging, so if there were no deficit spending “we wouldn’t see this reserve dwindling down to below 1 percent.”
The new settlement deal, therefore, may be a Pyrrhic victory for teachers that could cause harm to them and their students.
Instead of blindly following their union, teachers should consider taking advantage of their new rights under the Supreme Court’s Janus decision, which held that public employees cannot be forced to pay dues or fees to unions.
Justice Samuel Alito, who authored the Janus majority opinion, wrote that it is an unconstitutional infringement on the rights of public employees to require them “to provide financial support for a union that ‘takes many positions during collective bargaining that have powerful political and civic consequences.’”
L.A. teachers should make use of their Janus rights and walk away from the union, not walk with it over a cliff.

The Associated Press
KABUL, Afghanistan - Negotiators for the U.S. and Taliban insurgents have reached "agreements in principle" on key issues for a peace deal that would end 17 years of war in Afghanistan, the top U.S. envoy said Monday.
The statement by U.S. envoy Zalmay Khalilzad followed six days of talks last week with the Taliban in Qatar, where he urged the Islamic insurgent group to enter into direct negotiations with the government of Afghan President Ashraf Ghani.
Ghani on Monday assured Afghans that their rights will not be compromised in the name of peace with the Taliban, who have been staging near-daily attacks against Afghan forces, causing scores of casualties every week. Their offensive has not let up despite the severe Afghan winter and the insurgents now hold sway over nearly half of the country.
Khalilzad said in an interview with The New York Times that an agreement in principle was reached with the Taliban on the framework of a peace deal "which still has to be fleshed out" that will see the insurgents commit to guaranteeing that Afghan territory is not used as a "platform for international terrorist groups or individuals."
He said the deal could lead to a full pullout of U.S. troops in return for a cease-fire and Taliban talks with the Afghan government.
In his statement released by the U.S. Embassy, Khalilzad said, "We made progress on vital issues in our discussions and agreed to agreements in principle on a couple of very important issues.
"There is a lot more work to be done before we can say we have succeeded in our efforts but I believe for the first time I can say that we have made significant progress," he said.
Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan said he has been briefed on the talks and described them as encouraging, but he also told reporters that the department has not been directed to prepare for a full withdrawal from Afghanistan.
Speaking before a meeting at the Pentagon, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said any discussion about the withdrawal of NATO forces from Afghanistan would be premature. He said Khalilzad had briefed NATO allies on the talks weeks ago.
"We are in Afghanistan to create the conditions for a peaceful negotiated solution," Stoltenberg said. "We will not stay longer than necessary, but we will not leave before we have a situation that enables us to leave or reduce the number of troops without jeopardizing the main goal of our presence and that is to prevent Afghanistan from becoming a safe haven for international terrorists once again."
He added that he believes it's too soon to speculate on withdrawal because "what we have to do now is to support the efforts to try to find a peaceful solution. We strongly support those efforts."
Ghani sought to assure Afghans that no deals would be made without Kabul's awareness and full participation.
"Our commitment is to provide peace and to prevent any possible disaster," Ghani said in an address to the nation. "There are values that are not disputable, such as national unity, national sovereignty and territorial integrity."
Ghani's office said he and Khalilzad met late Sunday in Kabul to discuss details from the talks.
Khalilzad's statement emphasized the inclusion of the Afghan government in the talks.
"There is a false narrative that Afghans are not included. That is not true. The Afghan voice is there," he said. "We are working together to get to a comprehensive cease-fire. We are working with the Afghan government, with international partners, to find implementing mechanisms to reach these goals."
Khalilzad has met with the Taliban on a number of occasions in recent months in the latest bid to end America's longest war. The U.S. invaded Afghanistan after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to topple the Taliban, who were harboring Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida.
The statement from Ghani's office also claimed that the Taliban demanded from Khalilzad the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Afghanistan, but that there was also no agreement on that issue.
The statement added that Khalilzad has no authority to discuss issues such as a future Afghan administration but that his goal is to facilitate an intra-Afghan dialogue, meaning direct talks between the Taliban and Kabul.
Khalilzad had tweeted Saturday about progress in the talks in Qatar, where the insurgents have a political office, saying: "Meetings here were more productive than they have been in the past."
"We made significant progress on vital issues," he tweeted, without offering details.
Abdul Hakim Mujahid, a former Taliban official and currently a member of the High Peace Council, an independent body of clerics and respected Afghan figures, said he believes the Qatar talks resulted in a "good understanding between both sides" but that more discussions are needed in the coming weeks or months.
"Afghanistan's problem is not so simple that it can be solved in a day, week or month, it needs more time and more discussions," Mujahid told The Associated Press.
The Taliban have in the past refused to negotiate directly with Kabul - a standing that does not appear to have changed. They have maintained that they are prepared to talk with U.S. officials only and only about the pullout of foreign forces from Afghanistan.
Afghan political analyst Waheed Muzhda says he believes that Khalilzad and the Taliban have reached agreement on both the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan and a cease-fire deal, but that neither side is prepared to say so at this point.
"But peace talks are not possible unless both sides first agree on a cease-fire," Muzhda said.
In Monday's address to the nation, Ghani also stressed that U.S. and other foreign forces are in Afghanistan because they are needed here and that if there is to be any downsizing or pullout, the Kabul government will have to play a role in the talks.
Ghani also reiterated his call on the Taliban to engage "in direct talks with the Afghan government."

'I fired Flynn. It’s over': Trump thought firing solved 'Russia thing,' Christie writes

Resumen: "This Russia thing is all over now, because I fired Flynn," Trump said, according to Christie, who laughed in response to the president's remark.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – In his new memoir, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie says President Donald Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner believed that firing former national security adviser Michael Flynn would resolve the "Russia thing," according to a New York Times report on an advance copy of the book.
Christie's book, "Let Me Finish: Trump, the Kushners, Bannon, New Jersey and the Power of In-Your-Face Politics," is scheduled to hit bookstores Tuesday.
According to the Times, one scene in the book describes a lunch Christie had with Trump and Kushner on Feb. 14, 2017, the day after Flynn was fired, for lying about his contacts with then-Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak.
"This Russia thing is all over now, because I fired Flynn," Trump said, according to Christie, who wrote that he laughed in response to the president's remark.
"What do you mean? Flynn met with the Russians. That was the problem. I fired Flynn. It’s over," Trump replied in Christie's telling.
"That’s right, firing Flynn ends the whole Russia thing," Kushner added. Christie said Kushner called him "crazy" when he said they would still be talking about Russia a year from then.
"What I was trying to do was help them and say, 'Listen, you guys need to get ready for a war,'" Christie explained Monday on "Good Morning America. " He said it "turned out I undersold it. "

The former New Jersey governor said he never saw any evidence of the Trump campaign conspiring with Russians to sway the election. He believed the team was too disorganized to have "run a Tom Clancy operation," the Times reported.
Christie said he always opposed the appointment of Flynn as national security adviser.
"Flynn was a train wreck from beginning to end," Christie said in the book, according to the Times. As an example, he pointed to one debate prep session where Flynn suggested Trump begin to support abortion rights to rob Hillary Clinton of the issue.
When the president asked Christie why he didn't like Flynn, he told the president, "because he's going to get you in trouble," Christie recounted Sunday on ABC's "This Week. "

Christie's book paints Trump as a great campaigner who was unprepared to lead and who did not always surround himself with the most qualified advisers, the Times reported.
"What I outline in the book though is, 'garbage in, garbage out,'" Christie said on "This Week. " He said "the problem for the president has been" that "the people he had around him, in the beginning, were just not suited to be there. "
Christie led Trump's transition team until he was fired three days after Trump's victory. He said people like Steve Bannon and Kushner got Trump "off to a really bad start" and "it drove me crazy because I knew we had a plan for him that would have gotten him off to a good start with good people. "
"When you have a White House where Omarosa Manigault is in the White House – I don't know what she was supposed to be doing, but that's not the kind of person when we put together the transition that we wanted to surround the president," Christie said. "The core of the book talks about the idea that this president was so ill-served by the decision made by Steve Bannon and Jared Kushner and Rick Dearborn to throw out all the work that was done by the transition. "
He said Bannon "physically fired" him but that Kushner was behind the decision.
"Steve said very clearly that this was, as he put it, 'The Kid,'" meaning Kushner, who fired him, according to Christie.
In the book, Christie claimed that Kushner wanted him off the team because as a U. S. attorney he had prosecuted his father on tax evasion charges, the Times reported.
"He tried to destroy my father," Kushner complained to Trump at one meeting, according to Christie's book.

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO -- Each week, technology reporters and columnists from The New York Times review the week's news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here.
Hi, I'm Sheera Frenkel, your friendly cybersecurity reporter.
I'm writing from a sunny and glorious San Francisco while the world's elite share deep thoughts in snowy Davos, Switzerland, at an annual gathering of the rich and powerful.
Executives from Facebook, Twitter, Google and Apple wined and dined with the elected officials and regulators who are responsible for holding their companies to account. A lot is at stake. The European Union is looking to enforce its new privacy regulations, and in the United States the Federal Trade Commission is expected to round out its investigation of Facebook within the next month or so.
Other countries are also exploring regulation. Our colleagues at Davos reported that on Wednesday leaders of Japan, South Africa, China and Germany issued a call for global oversight of the tech sector.
In the next year, important elections will be held in countries including India, Indonesia, Ukraine and Israel. Everyone will be watching to see whether social media is rife with false news and disinformation, and the tech companies will have a chance to show that they've changed for the better.
If the last week was any indication, things aren't looking great.
Everyone was reminded of the power of social media to divide when a video showing a confrontation in Washington between a group of high school students and a Native American protester went viral.
The minute-long video, which was first posted by a Twitter account called @2020fight, initially inspired outrage among liberal groups that believed the students were intimidating and mocking the protester.
But within two days, another version of the video, which showed the protester intentionally walking into the group of students, had appeared. Conservative groups took to Twitter to claim that the students, not the protester, were the victims. They called on celebrities and prominent journalists to apologize to the students, and a group of lawyers announced that it would sue popular figures who had tweeted defamatory statements about the incident.
Days later, people were still fighting about the video on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and the cable networks. The account that started it all -- along with many that helped amplify it -- remains anonymous.
My colleague Kate Conger and I reported Wednesday that lawmakers were asking Twitter for more information about the accounts. There is concern that the accounts that amplified the tweet were foreign (read: Russian) and looking to stir discord among Americans. Twitter said it was investigating. So far, it appears that at least the original poster, @2020fight, is American.
The account was suspended by Twitter. But what, at least under Twitter rules, did it do wrong? Many people on Twitter use fake names; many more use fake photos. Neither practice is explicitly against Twitter's rules, and in many ways the account used Twitter for exactly what the platform was designed to do -- to make something go viral.
There's a question of whether that is good for any of us, or whether, as my colleague Farhad Manjoo succinctly put it in his column this past week, the answer is to "Never Tweet."
■ Twitter wasn't the only company to have a bad week. French regulators announced that they had fined Google 50 million euros, or about $57 million, for not properly disclosing how it collected data about its users across its services. Adam Satariano wrote that it was the largest penalty of its kind levied by the European Union, which last year adopted a sweeping new data privacy law known as the General Data Protection Regulation.
■ In Australia, a sweeping new law gives local law enforcement authorities the power to compel tech companies like Apple to create tools, known as back doors, that would circumvent the encryption they built into their products.
My colleague Nellie Bowles reported that the law's impact could be felt globally. If Apple were to build a back door for iPhones, law enforcement in other countries, including the United States, could ask to use the same tool.
The debate about back doors to encryption has been raging for years. Tech companies argue that they encrypt devices to protect users. The police say they need access to devices, especially phones, to do their jobs.
■ In other news about our dystopian future, Cade Metz wrote about start-ups that are turning high-altitude surveillance into a lucrative business. Using cameras, sensors and inexpensive satellites, the companies are selling insights gleaned from those devices to hedge funds, banks and other market traders looking for an edge.
■ Karen Weise wrote about how Amazon is building a huge business out of knowing everything you buy. Amazon doesn't just know what you buy. It knows how often you buy it, where you ship it to and what you are most likely to buy next. Ads sold by Amazon are now a major part of its business, and it is quickly gaining ground on the industry leaders, Google and Facebook.
■ A couple of days later, Gizmodo's Kashmir Hill wrote an illuminating first-person account of her struggles to remove Amazon from her home. The article brought into sharp relief just how dominant Amazon is in our lives, and how hard it would be to live without the technology we have invited into our homes.

Stone says text exchanges cited in indictment were mischaracterized

Texto completo: Roger J. Stone Jr., a longtime adviser to President Trump, said on Sunday that he was “prepared to fight for my life" and prove his innocence in the case brought against him by the special counsel, Robert Mueller.
Stone, who was charged Friday with obstruction of justice, witness tampering, and making false statements, said on ABC News' “This Week" that text message exchanges that were cited in his indictment were being misrepresented.
“It has to be seen in context," Stone said of his exchanges with Randy Credico, a former associate and political gadfly. “It is a humorous exchange. They're taking things out of context to present them in a light that mischaracterizes their significance. I never told Mr. Credico to lie."
Stone told Credico in 2017 to “do a 'Frank Pentangeli"' when he appeared before the House Intelligence Committee investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election. The reference was to a character in “The Godfather: Part II" who ultimately avoids implicating another person in his own testimony before Congress.
Stone's legal team has said that other text exchanges reveal that he and Credico often had jocular back and forths, before and after the ones in question, that undercut the notion that Credico could have felt threatened.
Stone said he had forgotten about some exchanges with Credico when he told House investigators that they did not exist, a statement that was part of the indictment against him.
Stone also said that he never spoke with Trump about WikiLeaks, and that they did not discuss a pardon or the investigation into collusion with Russian officials.
According to the indictment, a top official from the Trump campaign dispatched him to get information from the group about the thousands of hacked Democratic e-mails that were damaging to Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign.
On Sunday, Stone did not rule out the possibility of speaking with Mueller's investigators.
New York Times
Most back Trump probes; many unsure of fairness
The American people have mixed feelings about investigating President Trump, with clear majorities wanting newly empowered Democrats to dig into his personal finances and foreign ties but most believing that Congress should not begin impeachment proceedings, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll.
The public's cautiousness extends to its expectations for the forthcoming report from special counsel Robert Mueller, who has been examining ties between Russia and Trump's 2016 campaign.
Half of Americans report they have "just some" confidence or none at all that the Mueller report will be fair and evenhanded, and 43 percent say they have at least a good amount of confidence in its fairness.
The survey was conducted Monday to Thursday, the day before Mueller's team unveiled criminal charges against longtime Trump friend Roger Stone, accusing the political operative of lying, obstruction, and witness tampering.
The poll results underscore the complex calculation ahead for Democrats and their new House leader, Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, as they balance calls from core supporters to aggressively investigate and possibly even impeach Trump against the potential political backlash from other voters.
The impeachment question has gained attention in the days since the Democrats' House majority was sworn in, with party leaders insisting they will wait to consider their options until after Mueller finishes his work and Trump declaring, "You can't impeach somebody that's doing a great job."
Six in 10 adults support the party using its congressional authority to obtain and release Trump's tax returns, the survey shows. Similar majorities support Democrats investigating suspected financial ties between Trump and foreign governments, the president's relationship and communications with Russian President Vladimir Putin, as well as possible collusion in the 2016 campaign.
And yet a 46 percent plurality suspect Democrats will "go too far" in their inquiries of Trump, while just over one-third think they will handle it about right.
Meanwhile, public support for impeachment has dropped in recent months, the poll shows.
Washington Post
Groups press lawmaker to seek Trump's tax returns
Liberal and Democratic-leaning advocacy groups are hoping to pressure US House Ways and Means Committee chairman Richard Neal to immediately begin the process of obtaining President Trump's personal and business tax returns.
The groups Tax March, Stand Up America, and Indivisible sent the Massachusetts congressman a letter urging him to immediately seek the documents. They also drafted a letter they say Neal could send to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and IRS Commissioner Charles P. Rettig to request Trump's returns.
The Democrat has said he plans to ask for Trump's tax returns, but also hoped Trump would release them voluntarily. Trump has refused to release his tax returns, breaking with standard practice.
Tax March executive director Maura Quint said the only solution is for Neal to request Trump's tax returns immediately.
Associated Press
Harris says the powerful seek to divide America
Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris said Sunday that those in power are trying to turn people against each other, which she says is "not our America."
Harris, a first-term US senator who announced her candidacy last Monday, rallied supporters outside City Hall in Oakland, her hometown and where she served as a prosecutor before becoming the state attorney general. The event was the formal kickoff for her campaign.
"We are here because the American Dream and our American democracy are under attack and on the line like never before," she said. "And we are here at this moment in time because we must answer a fundamental question: Who are we? Who are we as Americans? So, let's answer that question to the world and each other right here and right now. America, we are better than this."
Harris also said that racism, sexism, anti-Semitism, homophobia and transphobia are real in the United States.
The daughter of immigrants from Jamaica and India, Harris entered the race on Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Campaign aides say she has drawn inspiration from Shirley Chisholm, who in 1972 became the first black woman to run for president from a major party.

Texto completo: With our dinner outing canceled on a cold, snowy night, my wife and I snuggle up on the couch to watch "Rake," an Australian television series about a talented but self-destructive barrister. A scene between the lawyer and his former prostitute brings back college memories, and by the time the credits are rolling, my wife and I are sitting at the dining room table trying to remember how to do it.
No worries.
"The game is easy to learn, difficult to master," says Tim Mabee, 72, the Naperville man who heads up Pub Club, the state’s most successful and longest-running continuous backgammon group. "I’ve been playing about 30 years and competing for about 25."
Backgammon, a game in which two players roll dice in a race to move 15 checkers around the 24 points on the board, likely originated in Mesopotamia 5,000 years ago, according to "The Backgammon Book," published in 1970 at the beginning of the last great backgammon craze in the United States. Playing boards were found in King Tutankhamen’s tomb. Plato, Homer, Chaucer and Shakespeare referenced the game in their writings. Roman emperors Claudius and Nero played it. So did Thomas Jefferson.
Paul Magriel, a mathematics professor and author of "Backgammon," won major backgammon tournaments and wrote a weekly column on the game for The New York Times in the late 1970s, when Pub Club got its start. That’s also when my college roommate and I played backgammon for money, with quarters being the currency of choice for the Laundromat washing machines or a game of Space Invaders. Who plays backgammon these days?
"Can I call you right back? As it turns out, I’m in the middle of playing a game of backgammon," says Mabee, who generally plays four days a week, including the Pub Club tournaments, which start at 7 p.m. every Thursday at Crazy Pour, an upscale sports bar at 105 E. North Ave. in Villa Park. The group typically draws a couple dozen players, more than 30 some nights, both men and women, speaking Russian, Georgian, Spanish and English.
"There are so many different professions, languages, and socio-economic levels that we have in our little club right in the suburbs," says Mabee, who grew up in a home where diversity and social justice were important.
Backgammon is the great equalizer, he says. Even the club’s 2018 champion, David Rockwell, still lost nearly a third of the games he played.
"The dice introduce all sorts of vagaries," Mabee says. "Anybody can beat anybody."
That’s why the club plays seven-point matches, with each game counting for one point.
A cube allows players to double the points for a win if they think they have an advantage. Faced with a doubling, a player can resign and lose one point, or play on, and even double the points again if the prospects change.
"Playing one game against an average player, my skill would give me 55-percent chance of winning," Magriel once said. "An hour’s worth of games would make the odds two or three to one in my favor, and, if we played all day, my opponent wouldn’t stand a chance."
The Pub Club single elimination tourney usually lasts five or six rounds and winds up before midnight. A team of the top Pub Club players will be vying for their fourth straight state backgammon championship on March 3 in Bloomington against the five other Illinois clubs — Chicago Bar Point Club of Skokie; the Bloomington-Normal Backgammon Club; the Peoria Backgammon Club; the Sangamon Valley Backgammon Association of Springfield; and the Winnetka Backgammon Club.
"It’s not clear why it’s such a big deal, but this is one of those ‘Stanley Cup’ trophies where all the names go on the trophy," says Mabee, who didn’t make the cut as a player this year for the first time since 2006. Often missing games to help run the club, Mabee says his status as the all-time points leader for the club could fall as soon as next month.
In his younger days, Mabee loved poker. "I play very badly," Mabee says, explaining how opponents could tell if he had a good hand. "There’s no bluffing in backgammon."
Artificial neural networks, the technology used to help computers learn, turned computers into chess masters years ago, but only recently got a handle on the game of backgammon. "It has certainly improved play. It’s one of the reasons I’m a has-been," says Mabee, who once finished second in the American Backgammon Tour and also owns a 1-0 record against Magriel. "What I like best is the subtlety of the strategy. You always have to have a plan B."
There is a $10 fee to play in the weekly tournaments, although Mabee picks up that cost for first-time players, and players are encouraged to bring a board. For more information about Pub Club, visit pubclubchicago.com, and for more information on the game, visit the U.S. Backgammon Federation website at usbgf.org.
The Chicago Open, May 23-27 at the Holiday Inn & Suites Chicago O’Hare in Rosemont, draws most of the top U.S. players, as well as an international roster that includes Akiko Yazawa, who is considered by many to be the world champion, Mabee says.
Mabee’s wife, Linda, doesn’t play. Neither does one daughter, Elizabeth Uribe of Downers Grove. But daughter Joanna Lein of Tulsa, Oklahoma, heads her state’s only backgammon club.
"We’re a friendly group," Mabee says of backgammon regulars. "It’s a great game for someone with a Zen attitude because stuff happens. One of the most common expressions, especially after losing, is, ‘That’s backgammon.’"

Don't let pessimism cloud good stock news

Texto completo: Welcome to the last in my series of columns on the year ahead. In my four earlier ones, I covered why December was lousy and why stocks are on the right side of a swift V-shaped recovery. U.S. stocks have climbed more than 10 percent since the market close on Christmas Eve.
On Dec. 17, I explained how stocks' have averaged 34 percent before dividends in the 12 months after all of history's correction bottoms (meaning a drop of 10 to 19.99 percent in the Standard & Poor's 500 index).
Assuming Dec. 24 remains the bottom, this correction ended later in a calendar year than any correction or bear market ever. An average aftermath now would make 2019 simply stellar.
Maybe Dec. 24 wasn't the bottom. But there were abundant bottomish signals. Mutual fund outflows reached levels only associated with major market bottoms. December outflows matched March 2009, when the last bear market ended. U.S. stock market liquidity sank like a brick, also echoing prior lows.
Price-to-earnings ratios contracted last year – earnings soared while stocks fell. A simple secret: Basically every year valuations shrink, the next year they expand.
So unless earnings fall, stocks rise. Analysts expect 6.9 percent earnings growth in 2019. Earnings almost always exceed analysts' estimates. Expanding valuations on top of earnings growth would cause big positive stock returns
Good years follow bad years unless you have global recession or world war. We've never had two straight negative stock market years – except with the Great Depression, the two World Wars, the early 1970s debacle and the tech bubble. Otherwise, stocks were spring-loaded the next year.
And recession is unlikely. Many misguided people still think the interest rate "yield curve" inverted, signaling that a downturn lurks. I explained on July 22 why that is wrong and how to view it correctly to see reality.
But, suppose it were inverted. So what?
History holds four examples of the yield curve inverting without a recession the next year. Stocks rose every time, averaging 16.6 percent that next year.
The government shutdown flooded folks with fear. Yet it shouldn't. The aftermath of shutdowns is also great, with U.S. stocks averaging 12.8 percent in the next 12 months.
Sure, shutdowns must end to have an aftermath. But shutdowns themselves aren't bearish. The prior 19 shutdowns occurred while markets were open. Stocks rose during 11, including 1995-96 – the longest shutdown before the current one.
Everywhere I look, sentiment seeks negatives, ignoring positives. Did you know global lending and money supply are growing around 6 percent year-over-year? That the global purchasing managers' index is higher now than during most of 2016, a fine year for stocks? That world trade is growing nearly 4 percent year-over-year despite this supposed trade war? That global profit margins are too?
If you didn't know any of this, you aren't alone. Most good news goes unreported or gets couched as bad – a phenomenon I call the pessimism of disbelief. When it strikes, better times are ahead.

Texto completo: "Let me tell you how it all started," Ron Stallworth told a crowd of more than 700 people in Iowa City's Englert Theatre on Wednesday night.
What unfolded that night was Stallworth, a retired black officer of the Colorado Springs Police Department, telling the unbelievable story of how he became a member of the Klu Klux Klan in the 1970s, how he stopped cross burnings and how he was close to becoming a local leader for the white supremacist group.
"This sounds like a movie, doesn't it?" Stallworth asked as he stood on the Englert stage just a day after the movie "BlackKKlansman," based off his memoir, received six Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay. The movie was directed by trailblazing filmmaker Spike Lee and stars John David Washington as Stallworth and Adam Driver as his partner in the investigation.
"I bet you thought you'd get John David Washington up here. But you got me," Stallworth said.
Stallworth's lecture was a part of the University of Iowa Lecture Committee's spring lineup of speakers. With an audience filled with students, locals and many more, Stallworth illustrated the connections between the hate and racism he confronted as a an undercover cop in the 1970s and what he sees today.
The former cop was direct when asked by an audience member about how to combat white supremacy today.
"You vote that idiot out of the White House," he said , referring to President Donald Trump.
"You vote that idiot congressman out of Congress, Iowa," he added about Iowa 4th District Rep. Steve King, who recently told the New York Times "white nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?"
"Why has it just become an issue for those good people who voted for him now? He's been saying these things for years, unless those people actually believe what he says," Stallworth said.
Before he took questions from the audience, Stallworth spent the majority of the lecture explaining the wild but true story of how he became a member of the Klu Klux Klan as an undercover cop.
It started in 1978 when Stallworth was hired as the first black officer for the Colorado Springs Police Department. As an undercover officer, he was looking through the newspaper to see if there was anything of interest. He saw a recruitment ad for the KKK in town. He sent them a letter and absentmindedly used his real name, "not one of my two undercover names. I had a brain cramp that day," Stallworth said.
The next week he got a call from the KKK asking why he wanted to join. After he spewed a series of racial slurs aimed at black people, they asked him to meet the current KKK members.
"Obviously, because God blessed me with this beautiful ebony skin, I couldn't meet them," Stallworth said to a round of thunderous applause from the crowd. What he did was recruit a white officer that would be his white avatar and pose as him in face-to-face meetings.
He had to get approval from leadership first. A sergeant initially denied the request because, as Stallworth said, he thought the white officer didn't "sound like a black guy."
"I asked him what does a black guy sound like," Stallworth said, and the sergeant answered with silence. Other officers at the department told him that the white officer wouldn't be "shuckin' and jivin'" like a black person would.
Stallworth was coming face-to-face with racism within his own department, so he took the matter up with the chief himself.
"When you see that you're out to do something you know is right, that it's the right path, do it. Don't even let authority stop you," Stallworth said.
The chief gave him approval, and a white officer to pose as him, and the investigation was underway. For seven-and-a-half months, Stallworth would have full conversations over the phone with everyone from local KKK members to David Duke, then the Grand Wizard, the preeminent leader of the KKK.
"If he was up here instead of me, I guarantee you'd like him," Stallworth said, calling Duke slick, smart and nice. "Until he started talking about race."
Though Stallworth called them "not the brightest bulbs in the shed," what they discovered was alarming. The KKK had plans to bomb the town's two gay bars. Its membership was made up of a few soldiers from nearby Fort Carson, so they had the means to do such a thing.
One day, he was summoned by the FBI to the Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Base, an installation literally built under a mountain in Colorado. High ranking officials looked at his investigation and discovered two KKK members were higher-ups at North American Aerospace Defense Command, NORAD, and that they had top security positions. Stallworth was told later that day the two men were removed from their positions in Colorado and sent to work at a base near the North Pole.
The investigation was shut down by the chief of police when the KKK members asked Stallworth to be their chapter leader. The chief told him to destroy all the documents about the investigation, but Stallworth ignored his command and kept the files. In 2014, after he retired, he wrote the memoir about his interactions with the KKK.
After the lecture, Stallworth took questions from the audience. One attendee asked about the movie. He detailed young screenwriters Charlie Wachtel ad David Rabinowitz calling him out of the blue to ask if anyone was making his memoir into the movie. He gave them approval to do so, but he had control over what would be in the script. Five drafts later, the script was finished. Soon, Lee would come on-board to give the movie the director's infamous political flair.
"These [writers,] hopefully in February, will win their first Academy Award," Stallworth said.
Stallworth saved possibly the the most unbelievable moment of his investigation, and one of the craziest moments in the movie, for near the end of his event.
When Duke himself visited town, Stallworth was picked to be Duke's bodyguard since the Grand Wizard had received death threats. Though he was worried that Duke may recognize his voice, the chief said no one else was available.
So he did his job, shook hands with Duke and protected him throughout his visit to town. The day came to a crescendo when the cop asked for a photo with Duke and the Colorado leader of the KKK. They agreed, so Stallworth handed a camera to the undercover cop posing as a KKK member. Right before the photo was snapped, Stallworth put his arms around both white supremacists.
Duke was furious, and demanded the photo be destroyed. Stallworth told him if the Grand Wizard touched him, he'd be arrested for assaulting a police officer. Duke sulked away and started spouting his white supremacist rhetoric.
"I was David Duke's worst nightmare," Stallworth said to the crowd. "I was a n----- with a badge and a gun and I have the authority to kick his ass." The crowd cheered wildly and the Black Klansman himself smiled.

What does fallout from LA teachers strike mean for the future of charter schools?

Texto completo: On paper, the six-day strike teachers strike that disrupted learning at 900 public schools across Los Angeles was a fight about orthodox demands like lower class sizes, higher pay and more support staff from nurses to librarians and counselors.
But a core issue and perhaps the most divisive barely touched the bargaining table: the future of the city’s 224 charter schools.
Education policy experts contend that although United Teachers Los Angeles – the union that represents the teachers in L.A. Unified – wins regarding charter schools at the strike’s conclusion may be largely symbolic, the strike has sparked a broader conversation happening across Southern California on charters that will likely make its way to Sacramento and stands to impact the direction of public school districts across the state.
Public education is essentially a two-sector system codified into state law in 1992 – the traditional, centrally managed school district and charter schools independent from a central school board.
As enrollment in the Los Angeles school district declined for 15 years, charter schools grew into a full-fledged industry educating more than 112,000 students and posing tough competition for traditional public schools.
Angeleno enrollment in charters, which are publicly funded but privately managed, reportedly drains $600 million a year from the Los Angeles Unified School District, which is tasked with serving around half a million students. While the schools do undergo a rigorous approval process complimented by hundreds of pages of paperwork, they operate free from many regulations and all but a few are nonunion.
To clear up any confusion about district-affiliated versus independent charters, a district-affiliated charter is a hybrid. The word “charter” in its name reflects a status the school adopted to secure more outside sources of revenue but it operates within the confines of the district.
During the strike
In the months leading up to and during the six-day walkout, UTLA President Alex Caputo-Pearl frequently decried “the unregulated growth of charter schools” to the press and his own membership.
“That doesn’t mean all charter schools are bad,” he repeated in his characteristic baritone, rather what began as a well-intentioned experiment now undermines traditional public schooling as more charter schools backed by billionaires and neglect the neediest students.
Charter school advocates call the union’s messaging on charters during the strike a blatant mischaracterization.
“I’d really like Alex Caputo-Pearl to come to the schools I run,” said Gloria Romero, the executive director of Scholarship Prep Charter School in Santa Ana and a former California state senator who while representing the San Gabriel Valley and East Los Angeles served as chairwoman of the Senate Education Committee.
“We’re closing the achievement gap for children who are English language learners and special education, if anything. There are some great schools in L.A. Unified but there are too many pockets where schools are chronically underperforming.”
John Rogers, director of the UCLA’s Institute for Democracy, Education, and Access, warned of sometimes superficial narratives surrounding charter schools.
“I think there are a number of somewhat simplistic analyses that don’t capture the full picture,” he said. “Many charter schools enroll large numbers of low-income students and students of color and we shouldn’t forget that fact.”
That said, charter advocates have in recent years poured millions into political campaigns, including in Los Angeles, where billionaire and charter supporter Eli Broad spent almost $10 million in 2017 along with allies in an effort that won a majority on the LAUSD Board of Education.
The charter sector, according to Rogers, is “a mix of some amazing educators who have worked within district bureaucracies and got frustrated and wanted in their words more freedom, some wealthy people who wanted to do good and felt like their money wasn’t going to be spent well in the district, and then some with ties to right wing think tanks and organizations who are deeply committed to undercutting the power of unions as kind of a bulwark of the democratic party.”
He added that it is rare for charters to admit students with the most substantial special needs, but that’s mostly backed up only by anecdotal evidence.
In the agreement
The main appearance of charter schools in the 40-page agreement reached between UTLA and LAUSD this Tuesday is a provision calling for more community input in cases of potential co-location, when a charter school moves into either occupied or un-occupied space on the campus of a traditional public school.
The still-temporary deal must be ratified by the School Board in a meeting slated for Jan. 29.
“The district has to inform us in December about any schools that are targeted for co-location,” said Caputo-Pearl on KPCC’s AirTalk Wednesday. “That gives time for respectful notice to parents … and certainly parents can ask questions and teachers can push back.”
As a side-bargain, UTLA also said the school board agreed to vote this month on a resolution that calls for Gov. Newsom to enact a cap on new charter schools at LAUSD while the state further studies the issue. If approved, the resolution would be a call for more state action on public charter schools.
Yet “it remains to be seen” whether the measures become more than a symbolic win for the union, said author of a book on California politics and New York Times opinion writer Miriam Pawel.
One out of every three independent charter schools in Los Angeles is co-located. While the arrangements are mutually beneficial, many complain of discord as entirely separate schools attempt to share everything from libraries to cafeterias and playgrounds.
“Co-location seemed to be a significant step for the union potentially. But the district doesn’t have has much leeway, so I think those are issues that will have to be addressed at the state level, and there’s definitely some interest in addressing it in Sacramento.”
Looking ahead
What all parties appear to agree on is that the teachers strike drew attention from the Inland Empire to L.A. to the befallen state of traditional public education in the second-largest school system in the nation, but that the future of charters can only be determined in halls of the state capital.
“The strike opened the conversation about how the broader public can begin to develop rules and regulations through the legislative process,” said Rogers, “purposeful planning of how we bring on new charter schools, how we reauthorize charter schools, how we think about the location of charter schools.”
And charter leaders like Gloria Romero are prepared to make a case.
“I look forward to sitting at that table testifying before former colleagues and new folks to say hey forget about the campaign contributions that you got from CTA (California Teachers Association) and let’s think about what this means in terms of student achievement,” she said.
“The fact that charters are thought to be so dangerous, that’s a product of their success and that’s what I hope a fair hearing in Sacramento would find.”

Texto completo: If Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., were a conservative, all anyone would be talking about is how uninformed she is. She would be facing trick questions from reporters designed to expose her lack of knowledge, and brutal sketches on "Saturday Night Live" mocking her intelligence and fitness for office. Instead, SNL fawns over her, while CBS's "Late Show" host Stephen Colbert -far from making jokes at her expense -eats ice cream with her and asks how many "f -- s" she gives about her critics.
Boy, it's good to be a socialist.
It's not that there is a lack of material. This week, for example, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez declared that "the world is going to end in 12 years if we don't address climate change." She has said that $21 trillion in "Pentagon accounting errors" could pay for most of her massive $32 trillion Medicare-for-all plan -as if there were $21 trillion in unspent tax dollars sitting around in a Pentagon vault. She opined that "just last year we gave the military a $700 billion dollar budget increase, which they didn't even ask for" -unaware, apparently, that the entire Pentagon budget is $716 billion. She wrongly claimed that Immigration and Customs Enforcement "is required to fill 34,000 beds with detainees every single night and that number has only been increasing since 2009" -when ICE is required only to have that number of beds available and that number has remained flat. She has declared that "unemployment is low because everyone has two jobs" -which is flat untrue. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are only 6 million to 7 million Americans with two jobs and 148 million with just one.
Those are examples of ignorance. But apparently she is also dishonest. This week, she told Mr. Colbert that she has not been able to open a district office yet to handle constituent casework because of the federal government shutdown. "There's a lot of things we can't do as freshman members," she said. "We can't properly set up our district offices. We can't get laptops delivered. We can't start doing the work that we were elected here to do. . It takes the green stuff. And those workers are furloughed." That's wrong. Last September, Congress passed the 2019 Legislative Branch Appropriations bill, which funds congressional salaries and offices for the coming year. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez knows this because, unlike furloughed workers, she is getting paid. The New York Times reports that the three other first-term members from New York have managed to open offices in their districts. A more likely explanation is that Ms. Ocasio-Cortez is spending her time building her national media profile instead of taking care of the constituents who sent her to Washington in the first place.
So where are the articles bemoaning "The incredible, thuggish stupidity of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez"? Where are the journalists trying to trip her up with questions like "Do you agree with the Bush Doctrine?" to see if she knows what it is? Nowhere to be found. To their credit, the fact-checkers have been on the case. PolitiFact gave her unemployment claim a "Pants on Fire" rating, and she is rapidly accumulating a large cache of Post Pinnochios -so much so that she claims to be the victim of "false equivalency + bias." Give me a break. She told CBS's "60 Minutes" that "being morally right" is more important than "being precisely, factually ... correct." Apparently, facts matter less as long as you support Big Government.
But facts are crucial, especially when you are proposing the largest increase in government spending in human history. Vox recently added up the cost of all her proposals -from Medicare-for-all, to free college, guaranteed jobs and the "Green New Deal." The price tag was $42.5 trillion over the next decade -more than twice the current national debt. Sorry, you can't pay for that through Pentagon accounting errors.
It is a tremendous testament to America that someone who was working as a bartender in a Mexican restaurant a year ago can throw their hat into the ring, unseat a 10-term member of Congress and be elected to the House of Representatives. It's what makes this such an exceptional nation. And it is obvious that she has political talent. But that doesn't excuse her from the responsibilities as a legislator to learn the facts and serve her constituents. Even Whoopi Goldberg, an Ocasio-Cortez supporter, warned her on "The View," "I would encourage you to sit still for a minute and learn the job."
That's good advice. Once people decide you are ignorant, it's hard to recover -just ask Sarah Palin or Dan Quayle. Of course, they were conservatives, so the standards are different.

Texto completo: Facebook is reportedly working to make messages across Facebook Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp work together, a strategy that the social network says could improve privacy but also keep users within its ecosystem of applications.
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is overseeing the move to create an underlying platform to integrate the company's messaging systems, The New York Times reported Friday, citing four people involved in the project.
Thousands of employees are at work on the strategy, which is in its early stages, the Times reported, but is expected to be completed by the end of 2019 or in early 2020.
All three apps will have end-to-end encryption to prevent outsiders from reading messages. Upon completion, Facebook users could send an encrypted message to someone on Instagram or WhatsApp and vice versa, sources told the Times.
Those apps all have separate messaging systems currently. Integrating them could keep users within Facebook's ecosystem – it paid $19 billion for WhatsApp in 2014 and $1 billion for Instagram in 2012. That integration would not only increase user activity within Facebook's applications, but also give the company potential revenue generating opportunities through increased ad sales and new services, sources told the Times.

More: Ex-Sears CEO Eddie Lampert orchestrated 'scheme' to 'steal' Sears, creditors allege
Such synergy could connect billions of users and, perhaps, impact competitors such as Apple and Google. Facebook has about 1. 5 billion daily active users, while WhatsApp, the world’s most popular messaging app, has 1. 5 billion users. About 500 million use Instagram daily; 800 million use it at least once a month.
“We want to build the best messaging experiences we can; and people want messaging to be fast, simple, reliable and private," Facebook said in a statement to USA TODAY. "We're working on making more of our messaging products end-to-end encrypted and considering ways to make it easier to reach friends and family across networks. As you would expect, there is a lot of discussion and debate as we begin the long process of figuring out all the details of how this will work. ”
But users input different information to use the apps – personal information such as name, age, relationship status, work history are used on Facebook and to a lesser extent, Instagram, while a cell phone number is used for WhatsApp.
Facebook's ability to compile a more robust user profile across the three messaging services could raise concerns. The company continues to face criticism over the Cambridge Analytica scandal, involving a U. K. political firm and exposure of personal data of an estimated 87 million Americans to manipulation for political purposes during the 2016 election.
Facebook in November 2018 also said it had removed 85 accounts on Instagram and 30 on Facebook that the company feared were linked to Russian operatives and were covertly orchestrating online activity on the eve of the U. S. midterm elections.
WhatsApp has had issues, too. The assailant in March 2017's London terror attacks that killed four and wounded dozens more reportedly used WhatsApp. And last week, WhatsApp said it would limit the number of recipients in forwarded messages to five, down from 20. That came after India experienced violence last summer after viral hoax messages resulted in more than a dozen lynchings, CNN reported.
WhatsApp said it decided to move forward after a six-month test of the five-recipient limit in India. Facebook had been testing the five-forwarding limit in the country after it experienced violence last summer after viral hoax messages resulted in more than a dozen lynchings, CNN reported.
When Facebook acquired WhatsApp and Instagram, Zuckerberg said those companies would remain independent.
In recent months, the co-founders of those apps have departed as concerns over the Cambridge Analytica scandal shook consumer confidence in Facebook.
WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton, who left the company last year to start a foundation, urged people to delete their Facebook accounts in March 2018 over privacy concerns and gave an push to the #DeleteFacebook movement. WhatsApp CEO and co-founder Jan Koum left a month later.
Instagram's co-founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger resigned in September 2018 and the sources told the Times that internal concerns about Facebook's growing designs led to their departures. WhatsApp employees have also raised concerns about the plan on internal message boards and during a staff meeting last month, the Times reported.
The move could put too much messaging power in the hands of one company, suggests Peter Singer, co-author of "LikeWar: The Weaponization of Social Media. " While an integration would help Facebook align its policies, it could suggest "monopoly concerns," he said in a post on Twitter on Friday.
Most users wouldn't "think twice about" the integration of Facebook's trio of apps, says Forrester senior analyst Jessica Liu. But the encryption of messaging is a double-edged sword. The development "is both good and bad: Good for privacy-minded users," she said in an analyst note sent to USA TODAY. "Bad for perpetuating bad (and untraceable) actors/activity on these messenger apps. "
Facebook's plan to integrate messaging across the three services could lead to additional scrutiny from lawmakers, which last year called Zuckerberg and other executives from Twitter and Google to testify before Congress.
“We have heard a lot from Facebook about how it is committed to changing course and protecting its users’ information, but the company repeatedly has ignored its promises," said Sen. Edward Markey , D-Massachusetts, in a statement Friday. "Now that Facebook plans to integrate its messaging services, we need more than mere assurances from the company that this move will not come at the expense of users’ data privacy and security. We cannot allow platform integration to become privacy disintegration. ”

Is gumbo dead? A New York Times article says so

Texto completo: Cajuns might take issue with a Jan. 8 article in the New York Times that explores how gumbo has evolved on restaurant menus in New Orleans.
The story's headline is controversial enough on its own:
"Gumbo, the classic New Orleans dish, is dead. Long live gumbo."
Those in Cajun Country would argue that gumbo is alive and well, thank you very much, and it does not belong to New Orleans. Gumbo is the go-to meal in Acadiana when the temperature dips below 80 degrees, and the staple dish isn't just found in home kitchens. It's still readily available at just about every restaurant that serves local cuisine.
But Brett Anderson's reporting in the New York Times is insightful if you can get beyond the eye-catching headline.
His article argues that gumbo is not the fixture in New Orleans restaurants that it once was — that new chefs at new restaurants are catering to new residents who settled in the Crescent City after Hurricane Katrina.
"The chefs who have stuck by the dish are using the moment to stretch its boundaries by adding ingredients that defy tradition, bringing it fresh relevance," Anderson wrote.
"Many of the innovations reflect global influences on New Orleans cooking, particularly from South and Southeast Asia. This time of year, with the cooler weather and the start of the Mardi Gras season, may be the best time to sample them — and to appreciate gumbo's long and continuing evolution."
Some of the innovative gumbos mentioned in the article include:
a curried Indian gumbo with ginger, turmeric and cilantro at Saffron NOLA
an Asian seafood gumbo with lime leaf, fermented black beans and black cardamom at Maypop
a black-eyed pea and pork gumbo with braised collard greens at Cochon
a modern gumbo with tamarind paste, potato chips, Worcestershire sauce and leeks at Turkey and the Wolf
a smoked chicken and Thai curry gumbo at Marjie's Grill
an oyster gravy/gumbo with grated mirliton squash, jasmine rice and fried jerk-spiced oysters at Bywater American Bistro
Although my gut instinct is to declare that these dishes are not gumbo — as some sources in the story also point out — I cannot help but think back to gumbo's humble roots.
Historically, gumbo was a dish of resourcefulness made with whatever ingredients were available.
Its origins can be traced back to the late 1700s in south Louisiana.
Gumbo, as most of us know it, did not exist.
The earliest gumbos did not start with the famed phrase "first you make a roux" that many modern-day area cooks use. Instead, either the African okra — brought to the area by slaves — or the Native American Choctaw filé powder — derived from sassafras leaves — were used to thicken gumbo.
The most primitive gumbos were not served over rice, either. They were typically served over cornmeal mush.
So who's to say that these New Orleans gumbos aren't actually gumbos?
Leah Chase, a 96-year-old chef and co-owner of the Creole restaurant Dooky Chase's in New Orleans, said it best when she learned about the Indian gumbo at Saffron NOLA.
"I would never dream of putting curry in my gumbo," she told Anderson for the New York Times article. But after thinking about it for a moment, her tone softened. "That's their version of gumbo," she said. "That's good."
Those in Cajun Country would argue that gumbo is alive and well, thank you very much, and it does not belong to New Orleans.

Film Screening to Commemorate Holocaust Victims

Texto completo: Headnote LOCAL
THE INTERNATIONAL Day of Commemoration in Memory of the Victims of the Holocaust on Jan. 27 will offer a variety of choices for Philadelphians who want to observe the day through engaging, thoughtful programs.
Gratz College is partnering with the Anti-Defamation League of Philadelphia, the Holocaust Awareness Museum and Education Center, the Jewish Community Relations Council of the Jewish Federation of Greater Philadelphia and the Philadelphia Holocaust Remembrance Foundation to screen Who Will Write Our History, a documentary described as "vital" by The New York Times.
The movie is being shown across the globe that day - from Poland to Zimbabwe to Melrose Park.
Who Will Write Our History is the story of a group of journalists and academics trapped inside the Warsaw Ghetto who sought to record the lives of the 450,000 Jews around them as a way to fight back against the Nazis. Among them was Emanuel Rigelbaum, a historian who helped found the Institute for Jewish Research (Yivo), and Rachel Auerbach, a writer who would later go on to work for Yad VaShem, collecting Holocaust testimony and assisting the prosecution during the trial of Adolf Eichmann.
During the war, they were part of a group code-named Oyneg Shabes that lead the charge to collect and create tens of thousands of documents, complete with drawings of daily ghetto life, maps of Treblinka, official Nazi documents posted throughout the city, photos and more. Interspersed with re-enactments, the movie features voiceovers from Joan Allen and Adrien Brody as Auerbach and Rigelbaum, respectively.
"The goal here is to bring the past to life while balancing against the high standards for veracity in a documentary," director Roberta Grossman said. "To achieve this goal, we blended archival and dramatic footage, pulling from the tools of dramatic feature storytelling. While fully aware of the complexity of these techniques, I reached for these visual tools because Who Will Write Our History tells the story of a place that no longer exists [the Warsaw Ghetto], about people who are long dead, and about a period of history captured primarily in black-andwhite film and mostly by Nazi propaganda photographers and cameramen. I want people not simply to learn from the film, but to be engaged and deeply moved.

"In 1999, three document collections from Poland were included in UNESCO's Memory of the World Register: the masterpieces of Chopin, the scientific works of Copernicus and the Oyneg Shabes Archive," she continued. "It is my hope that Who Will Write Our History will change that in the way that only a film can do, by making the story accessible to millions of people around the world."
"We are very pleased to work with our partners and colleagues to present this important event to the community," said Mindy Blechman, coordinator of Holocaust and Genocide Studies at Gratz College.
Josey Fisher, director of the Gratz College Holocaust Oral History Archive, will open the event with a discussion of the archive and its significance in Holocaust studies. Following the film, attendees are welcome to stay for a Facebook Live discussion with executive producer Nancy Spielberg, Grossman and Samuel Kassow, the historian who wrote the book that Who Will Write Our History is based on and who also appears in the film.
The educational program runs from 12:30 to 4 p.m., and the movie will screen at 1 p.m. Tickets are $10-15.
The movie will also be shown at the University of Pennsylvania Hillel at 6 p.m. Tickets are $10. The Ritz Five, at 214 Walnut St., will screen the movie at 1:50 p.m.
At Ohev Shalom of Bucks County, the Jewish War Veterans Post No. 697 will host a remembrance event from noon to 4 p.m. The program will feature Daniel Goldsmith, who survived the Holocaust as a child in Belgium with the help of Catholic institutions. Tickets are $7, and those interested in attending should call 215-322-9595 to reserve their seats.
The Rowan Center for Holocaust & Genocide Studies at Rowan University will commemorate Holocaust remembrance on Jan. 24 at 5 p.m. at the Student Center Patio.
On Jan. 28, Owls for Israel will host John Spitzer, a Holocaust survivor for dinner and a discussion. Spitzer survived the Holocaust in southern Hungary, where he was a forced laborer for the Nazis. The talk will be at 1441 W. Norris St., from 7:30 to 10 p.m.
On Jan. 29, JCRC will host a program for high school students to discuss the universal lessons of the Holocaust through small group discussions with survivors. This event requires preregistration, and will take place at Gratz College from 8:30 a.m. until 1:30 p.m. *

Restaurateur Recoups Fyre Festival Losses

Texto completo: A Bahamian restaurant owner who lost a fortune as a result of the Fyre Festival debacle has recouped nearly all of her losses after a GoFundMe campaign raised more than $177,000.
The owner, MaryAnn Rolle, 55, was featured in the Netflix documentary "Fyre: The Greatest Party That Never Happened," one of two documentaries released this month that chronicle the 2017 music festival disaster, which left attendees stranded without food or drinking water and sleeping on beaches in makeshift tents. The other new film is Hulu's "Fyre Fraud," which also takes a critical look at the festival and its organizers.

Well-heeled festivalgoers were cheated out of tickets costing hundreds or thousands of dollars, and local islanders were not paid for their services in building the infrastructure for the festival on Great Exuma in the Bahamas. In the Netflix documentary, Ms. Rolle explains that she spent $50,000 of her savings and received no compensation from festival organizers. In May 2017, she told The New York Times that she was owed $134,000 by festival organizers. She said her credit had been ruined.

Ms. Rolle catered 1,000 meals per day from her Exuma Point Beach Bar and Grill in April 2017, delivering food to Coco Plum Beach and Rokers Point, where the festival's main events were scheduled to take place, according to the GoFundMe campaign, which Ms. Rolle and her husband started. Festival organizers visited her restaurant and stayed at the Exuma Point Beach Resort.

"Lots of people I know weren't paid," Ms. Rolle said in an interview on Tuesday. After the festival, she added, "we couldn't find the organizers. No one answered their phones. Nothing was done for us, not until now."
The festival was scheduled for two weekends starting in late April 2017 and was promoted by the rapper Ja Rule. It was hyped by some of Instagram's best known influencers, including the models Kendall Jenner and Bella Hadid. Ultimately the event was canceled. The festival's organizer, Billy McFarland, was sued and charged with defrauding investors. In October, the entrepreneur was sentenced to six years in federal prison.
The festival's promotional videos displayed the Bahamas' white sandy beaches and featured models in bikinis lounging on sailboats and swimming along the island's azure shore. But when festivalgoers arrived on Great Exuma -- the organizers' last-minute choice -- the staff was woefully unprepared. Headliner bands like Blink-182 had canceled. Monsoon-like rains had soaked the tents where people were supposed to camp. Some guests, who had been promised meals by star chefs, were served sliced cheese on bread.
The campaign was Ms. Rolle's last appeal for help because she, like other island business owners and workers who provided services to festival organizers, was left empty-handed. GoFundMe verified the campaign and Ms. Rolle posted a thank-you note on Facebook. In her interview, she offered this advice: "Be mindful of strangers."
She said she had participated in the Netflix documentary because she wanted to tell the world what happened to her island community. "People have responded well," she said. "What a wonderful world we live in where people are so generous."
Her beachfront restaurant is on the northern end of Great Exuma, where Ms. Rolle and her husband, Elvis, serve an island buffet with fresh fish, ribs, Bahamian macaroni and cheese and what she described as Mr. Rolle's favorite "punch cocktail."
This week, Ja Rule posted an apology to Ms. Rolle on Instagram, writing, "MaryAnne Rolle we've never met but I'm devastated that something that was meant to be amazing, turn out to be such a disaster and hurt so many ppl." Ms. Rolle said she did not know if he had donated money to her campaign.

Texto completo: As a teen growing up in Provo, Brian Wimmer knew winter was coming when Warren Miller brought his latest ski movie on tour.
“It was like Christmas morning when the Warren Miller movie came, because it meant skiing was just around the corner,” said Wimmer, whose career has ranged from actor to film-festival creator to activities ambassador for Robert Redford’s Sundance ski resort. “It got you all amped up … to go skiing.”
Miller’s long career as “the Pied Piper of skiing,” beating the drum for winter sports and helping the industry grow, is chronicled in the new documentary “Ski Bum: The Warren Miller Story.” The movie will be shown Friday as the opening-night film of the 2019 Slamdance Film Festival.
Slamdance, the scruffy kid brother of the larger Sundance Film Festival, runs through Thursday, Jan. 31, at the Treasure Mountain Inn, 255 Main St., Park City.
“Slamdance is a perfect fit” for a movie about Miller, said the movie’s director, Patrick Creadon. “His entire life was filmmaking, and most of it he did himself, with a camera in his hand.”
Slamdance co-founder Peter Baxter agreed. “There are two major roles Warren Miller played in his life: a driving force in the development of skiing throughout the world, and a founding pioneer of independent cinema,” Baxter said. "One of them is recognized and the other is not.”
Creadon’s first documentary, “Wordplay,” about the making of The New York Times crossword puzzle, premiered at the 2006 Sundance Film Festival. He conducted the last on-camera interview with Miller in May 2017. Miller died Jan. 24, 2018, at age 93.
“He really had a sense that this was kind of his last chance to sit down and tell some stories he hadn’t told before,” Creadon said. “Warren was pretty old-school and kept his cards pretty close to his chest for a long time. It was important for him to let his loved ones know what he felt.”
That gave Creadon a chance to get beyond a surface portrait of Miller, who made his reputation as a one-man band for ski films — shooting, editing, narrating (usually live) and self-distributing a new movie every year, capturing the world of skiing both for snow junkies and people living vicariously. He released his first movie, “Deep and Light,” in 1950 and cranked out a new movie once a year until 2004 — a run of 55 films. (His son Kurt took over the company in the late 1980s, and Miller left the company that bears his name after 2004.)
“His movies are playful and funny, and they get you really excited to get out and hit the mountains,” Creadon said. “Warren really made it look easy with what he did. What our film does, for the first time, is to pull back the curtain and see how hard it was.”
The documentary covers Miller’s distant relationship with his alcoholic father and his vagabond days touring the few ski resorts that existed in the 1940s. It delves into how he accused his mother and sister, who ran Miller’s film production company in the early days, of embezzling some $100,000 from him. It details how life on the road, making movies, led to the end of his second marriage and left him estranged from his three children for years.
“The most challenging thing with this film was not so much talking about the professional side of his life. It was talking about the personal side,” Creadon said. “He made a lot of sacrifices to have the career that he had, and his children really paid a high price for that.”
Miller, Creadon said, “wasn’t a bad guy. He was kind and warm, and he loved to do fun things with his family. The source of some of the pain within his own family comes solely from the fact that they wanted to be with him more.”
Besides interviewing Miller, Creadon gathers a Who’s Who of the skiing world, including extreme skiers Scot Schmidt and brothers Dan and John Egan, Olympic skier Jonny Moseley, and Miller’s collaborators, such as the ski cameraman Greg Stump.
Wimmer — who worked at Robert Redford’s Sundance resort as a kid “so I could get lift tickets” — falls into that category. As an actor (best known for the TV series “China Beach”) and filmmaker, Wimmer used his Hollywood connections to help launch X-Dance, a film festival highlighting extreme sports. X-Dance started in Park City in 2001, one of the alternative festivals that used to crowd Main Street in the shadow of Sundance and Slamdance. It moved to Salt Lake City in 2008 and disbanded after the 2012 event.
Miller was an enthusiastic backer of X-Dance, Wimmer said. “He was one of our guest judges. He was so energetic about it. He would watch these films and give his critique. … He was kind of a coach to us.”
Creadon was determined to make a movie that would have appeal beyond the ski fans who flock to Warren Miller movies every fall. “I think there’s a bigger audience for this film,” Creadon said, calling Miller “an American filmmaker and an American artist who was incredibly entrepreneurial, and very creative.”
Wimmer is looking forward to the premiere at Slamdance, where many of the movie’s interview subjects will be in attendance.
“It was a lifelong goal to be in a Warren Miller film,” Wimmer said. “I am now. I’m in a film about Warren Miller.”

Trump threats to quit NATO spur Maine lawmakers to defend 70-year-old alliance

Texto completo: A day after the U.S. House voted overwhelmingly for a measure aimed at making it difficult for a president to quit NATO, U.S. Sen. Susan Collins declared her support for the proposal.
Collins, a Maine Republican, is part of a bipartisan group that introduced a resolution this month to prohibit a president from withdrawing from NATO without first securing approval from the Senate.
“Over the past seven decades, NATO has proven to be the world’s most successful military alliance and a major force for peace, stability, and prosperity. It is critical that we reaffirm the United States’ commitment to this vital pillar of our national security,” Collins said Wednesday in a prepared statement.
Collins told her colleagues that supporting the measure “would be a strong statement of support for this important alliance that serves the strategic interests of the United States.”
Both of Maine’s U.S. House members — Democrats Chellie Pingree and Jared Golden — were among the 357 lawmakers who supported a proposal Tuesday to bar the use of federal funds by a president to withdraw from the treaty that has locked the U.S. to Canada and European allies since 1949 in common defense.
The Senate resolution requires the president to win two-thirds support from the Senate to suspend, terminate or withdraw from NATO. It also prohibits funding any effort to do so and grants congressional counsel permission to challenge a president in court if he tries to sidestep the provision.
U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat, said in a prepared statement that Trump’s “repeated threats to withdraw from NATO are dangerous.”
“Our NATO allies have fought alongside our troops since World War II, yet President Trump disparages these nations and cozies up to our adversaries,” he said. “At a time of increased Russian aggression and global threats, our alliance with NATO is more important than ever to ensure the safety of the American people.”
Collins and Kaine were joined by Republicans Cory Gardner of Colorado, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Marco Rubio of Florida along with Democrats Jack Reed of Rhode Island, Chris Coons of Delaware and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut.
The New York Times reported recently that senior administration officials said that several times over the course of 2018, Mr. Trump privately said he wanted to withdraw from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.”
In public, the president has griped on a number of occasions that European nations are failing to spend what he considers their fair share of the cost of the mutual defense required by the NATO treaty.
A bill with the same provisions was introduced last year after a July summit that included Trump and other NATO leaders let to fears the president might try to quit the organization. It was championed by Kaine and the late U.S. Sen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican.

'American Son' Play To Become Netflix Film

Texto completo: On Monday, Kerry Washington announced on "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon" that her Broadway play, "American Son," will be adapted by Netflix. She is set to reprise her role as Kendra, the concerned mother of a son who may be in great danger.
The rest of the cast, including Ms. Washington's co-star, Steven Pasquale, who plays Kendra's estranged husband, Scott, will also return for the adaptation.
In the interview with Mr. Fallon, Ms. Washington said: "We're not just filming the play. We're adapting it to kind of be this movie-play hybrid event."
Kenny Leon, who directed the Broadway production, will also direct the Netflix adaptation and act as a producer.
The play, written by Christopher Demos-Brown, is set in a South Florida police station, where the couple played by Ms. Washington and Mr. Pasquale try to get to the bottom of what happened to their missing son.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
In his review, Jesse Green, who named the production a New York Times Critic's Pick, wrote: "It barely feels like a play at all. With its unrelentingly high tension on every level -- maternal, marital, societal -- it's more like a slice of a nightmare."
The production for the Netflix adaptation will begin in February after the show wraps up its Broadway engagement at the Booth Theater on Sunday. No release date for the project has been announced, but when Mr. Fallon asked whether it would be released "sometime this year," Ms. Washington said yes.
She also said she is pleased that the play will now have a larger audience, since, in her experience, it has been effective at starting discussions about issues like racism and police brutality: "It feels exciting that more people than just the ones in New York or just the people who have flown in to see it, that now everybody is going to get to have this conversation."

Chief Justice John Roberts right to push back against Trump, defend judiciary

Texto completo: In November, a federal judge in San Francisco struck down President Trump’s attempt to limit asylum-seekers to legal points of entry. Trump complained about the action of “an Obama Judge.”
Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts criticized Trump, saying America does not have “Obama judges or Trump judges . . . What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.”
In December, a federal judge in Texas struck down the Affordable Care Act (“Obamacare”). The judge had been appointed by President George W. Bush. Sen. Christopher Murphy, D-Connecticut, said that “Republicans just blew up our health care system.” Press comments have portrayed the judge’s ruling as political and characterized the Fifth Circuit (comprised of Southern states), which will hear any appeal, that way as well.
Will Chief Justice Roberts be even-handed now and criticize those calling the federal court decision in Texas the act of Republicans? Perhaps he regrets having entered this forum in the first place. Roberts has challenged Trump in a sport at which Trump excels. When federal District Judge Derrick Watson in Hawaii ruled against the Trump travel ban (called the “Muslim ban” by its detractors), Trump was fulsome in criticizing the judge as political because President Obama had appointed him. Trump called the San Diego judge hearing the case against Trump University biased because the Indiana-born Judge’s parents were from Mexico — making at least two offensive leaps that a judge who was the son of Mexican immigrants would be prejudiced against Trump due to Trump’s comments on Mexicans, and that the prejudice would be so great it would affect the judge’s impartiality in a matter totally unrelated to Mexico or immigration.
Federal judges are called to make decisions based on the law, not their own policy preferences. President Trump and Senator Murphy have done much harm in blurring that distinction.
This is not to say federal judges are identical. Litigants choose courts to file suits where they have the best chance of winning. Trump noted the “Obama Judge” was in San Francisco, within the liberal-leaning 9th Circuit that often rules against him. After the Obamacare ruling, the New York Times observed that “conservative lawyers are known to choose [the federal court in Texas] to file cases.” Neither practice is improper, so long as the court decision itself is based on nonpolitical grounds.
When Trump opponents win at the trial court level, they then try to get the court to apply its ruling to the entire country. That’s what the federal judge in San Francisco did, blocking Trump’s asylum policy nationwide. The federal judge in Texas has not yet given national application to his order striking down Obamacare. If he does, expect Democratic politicians who praised the San Francisco judge’s nationwide order to be outraged by the Texas judge doing the same thing, and expect Trump to praise the judge’s wisdom.
The judiciary interprets laws; it has no power to make laws. Judges are fairly criticized when their legal interpretation seems to create new law that Congress or state legislatures never intended. But Murphy and Trump labeling judges based on which president appointed them goes far beyond fair criticism. This kind of attack, if repeated often enough, will eventually impede the vital function courts perform in our constitutional scheme. A calumny often repeated sometimes sticks. When the law compels a politically unpopular outcome in a case, Americans should hope the judge ignores the political and does what’s right. That’s especially important to those who care deeply about civil liberties. I doubt the Bill of Rights’ protections for criminals would be approved in a popular referendum today. Segregated schools were the result of popular majority votes. America loses something precious if the third branch, fearful of being labeled political, begins to act in a political way.
Tom Campbell is a professor of law and professor of economics at Chapman University. He served five terms in Congress, including on the Judiciary Committee and the Joint Economic Committee. He was also California Director of Finance. In 2016, he left the Republican Party and is now an independent.

Texto completo: I can't be the only one left scratching his head by William Barr's performance before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
President Donald Trump's nominee for attorney general told the senators: "I don't believe that Mr. Mueller would be involved in a witch hunt." Yet that is the epitaph under which Trump would love to bury the investigation headed by special counsel Robert Mueller. And that wasn't an isolated attempt of Barr sounding like he was buttering up Democratic members of the committee.
Time and time again, Barr's answers to the senators' questions were 180 degrees out of sync with Trump's tweets and applause lines in his stump speeches.
Barr said that former Attorney General Jeff Sessions "probably did the right thing" in recusing himself from the probe of possible Russian intervention in the 2016 presidential election. Sessions was a member of Trump's campaign team, but for Trump, that was no excuse. Before Sessions took the hint and resigned, he was subjected to months of abuse. Trump called him "weak," "beleaguered," "mixed up" and "confused."
Barr said the Russia investigation should be completed. Trump thinks it never should have begun.
Barr told the senators that he and Mueller have been friends for 30 years, and that he had greeted Mueller's special counsel appointment as "good news." Trump has called Mueller "a conflicted prosecutor gone rogue."
That dissonance brought to mind something I'd observed while sitting next to my kid-brother lawyer when he'd try a case. Bob would draw a line down the middle of a piece of legal-size paper. On one side he'd note the points his witnesses made while testifying. On the other side, he'd list the points the opposing counsel's witnesses made.
In his final summery before the case went to a jury, Bob would underscore his witnesses's testimony and pooh-pooh what the other lawyer's witnesses said.
That's what lawyers do: They support a client's view of a dispute.
But Trump's lawyer undercut him before a panel of U.S. senators. Technically the attorney general is not the president's lawyer but the nation's. That's not how Trump sees it. During his feud with Sessions he complained: "I don't have an attorney general."
Could he have been blindsided by Barr? Not likely. Barr was frank about his friendship with Mueller when Trump was wooing Barr for his legal team, some months ago. Their wives are in a Bible study group.
Trump didn't hire Barr then. Why is he now Trump's nominee for attorney general?
Maybe it's because what seems to make Barr a strange choice is, in fact, why he's a perfect fit for an endgame Trump could be toying with.
Up to now, friends and foes have assumed that while a Democrat-controlled House of Representatives might impeach Trump, the Senate wouldn't convict him. But that scenario was written when the evidence of his potentially impeachable offensive was sketchy.
Now there's a daily drip of leaks about the cards Mueller may be holding. The New York Times reported that even before Mueller's appointment, the FBI was concerned that Trump might be acting on behalf of a foreign power. The Washington Post wrote that Trump went to lengths to keep his tete-a-tetes with Vladimir Putin secret. He confiscated an interpreter's notes.
Perhaps Trump is less confident now that his supporters will keep the Senate in his corner. Instead of rolling the dice, might he revive Vice President Spiro Agnew's strategy? Confronted by the FBI with evidence of financial hijinks, Agnew cut a deal: He resigned his office, and the feds didn't prosecute him.
Of course, thinking that he will follow Agnew's lead requires the assumption that Trump can carefully weigh his options. He is prone to impetuous decisions. But there are those around him with a vested interest in leading Trump down the path of rationalism.
Donald Trump Jr. and Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, are increasingly vulnerable as it becomes evident that their 2016 Trump Tower meeting with Russian emissaries wasn't just about adoption policies.
That problem would be solved by a deluxe version of Agnew's deal: Trump resigns in return for immunity from prosecution for him and them.
But who would negotiate with Mueller? Generally it's someone's lawyer. But Rudy Giuliani's public pronouncements tend to be untenable or incoherent. His goofy idea of letting the White House edit Mueller's report didn't make it out of the starting gate.
Barr, on the other hand, is a buddy of Mueller's. They could meet, show each other photos of grandkids and amicably work out a deal that both sides can live with.
If you don't think Trump is ready to cop a plea, tell me this: Why did he nominate an attorney general who, at the first possible opportunity, threw the president of the United States smack dab under the bus?

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- President Trump boasted recently that he has been "FAR tougher" on Russia than other American presidents. But while the Trump administration has cracked down on Russian diplomats, government officials and oligarchs, Mr. Trump himself largely has taken a far more generous stance toward Moscow.
The contradiction has taken on new meaning in light of several recent reports, including one on an F.B.I. counterintelligence investigation that was opened in 2017 into whether Mr. Trump had secretly acted on Russia's behalf -- one facet of the Justice Department's investigation into Moscow's interference in the 2016 presidential election.
Here are five key ways in which Mr. Trump has been at odds with his own administration over Russia in the past year.
Pulling troops out of Syria and Afghanistan
Mr. Trump's go-it-alone decision in December to pull 2,000 American troops from Syria set up a dramatic clash with top officials in his administration and prompted protest resignations by Jim Mattis, the defense secretary, and Brett McGurk, the special presidential envoy to the coalition fighting the Islamic State.
Just weeks later, the White House national security adviser, John R. Bolton, directly contradicted Mr. Trump's proposed timeline, putting conditions on the withdrawal of forces and suggesting a significant delay.
The president's order also drew concern and criticism from some of Mr. Trump's supporters, including Senator Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican, who met with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey over the weekend and called for a slower withdrawal to avoid setting off a broader war.
Also in December, Mr. Trump announced the removal of 7,000 troops from Afghanistan, an abrupt decision that stunned American and Afghan officials.
A mild response to Russia's seizing of Ukrainian ships
When Russian forces took 24 Ukrainian sailors captive late last year, senior officials in the Trump administration gave the president options for responding. They included new sanctions or increasing NATO's naval presence in the Black Sea. But Mr. Trump has not yet taken action, even as administration officials insist options are still being considered and as Europe coordinates a response.
In November, responding to the standoff, Mr. Trump canceled a meeting in Argentina with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia at a forum of the Group of 20 industrialized economies. At a dinner on the sidelines of the meeting, however, Mr. Trump told Mr. Putin that a resolution was needed. Yet he has sought to blame both sides in the conflict, saying merely that he did not "like what is happening."
Russia has extended the detention of the sailors and demanded a trial on charges of border violations.
Reluctantly imposing expulsions and sanctions
Privately, Mr. Trump was irritated by his administration's response to the 2018 poisoning of a former Russian spy living in England that the British authorities have said was carried out by Russian agents. He was initially upset that 60 Russian diplomats and intelligence officers were expelled from the United States in response to the attack, given that European nations were not expelling the same number.
Later, Mr. Trump opted against new sanctions against Russia for its support of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria after a chemical attack near Damascus that killed more than 40 people. Mr. Trump believed the sanctions, which had been announced by Nikki R. Haley, then the United Nations ambassador, were unnecessary in light of a missile strike against Syrian targets.
And when the Trump administration began imposing a series of sanctions against Russian individuals and organizations in retaliation for cyberattacks and interference in the 2016 election, the president appeared out of line with his own cabinet.
In July, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo overstated the Trump administration's push for the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, which the president signed into law in 2017 after it passed the Senate with a veto-proof majority. Mr. Trump approved it only hesitantly, first attempting to weaken it and criticizing it as "seriously flawed."
Deflecting accusations of interference in the 2016 and 2018 elections
During a news conference in July in Helsinki, Finland, Mr. Trump said he believed Mr. Putin's denials of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. His comments -- with Mr. Putin at his side -- generated a sharp backlash from Mr. Trump's aides and congressional allies.
Those tensions flared again this month after The Washington Post and others reported that Mr. Trump attempted to hide notes from one of his meetings with Mr. Putin in 2017 from his own advisers.
Since then, the president has largely stopped expressing public confidence in Mr. Putin. Yet Mr. Trump has continued to downplay Russia's election interference, even as the investigation led by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has repeatedly showed how extensive it was.
In October, the Justice Department brought its first charges against Russia for interfering in the 2018 midterm elections, releasing a joint statement from several of Mr. Trump's top cabinet officials decrying the attempts. Mr. Trump, however, was mostly silent on the indictment, and instead sought to paint himself as a protector of elections while also blaming the Obama administration for keeping quiet about election meddling during the 2016 presidential campaign.
Defense of the NATO alliance
Senior administration officials have told The New York Times that Mr. Trump has privately, and repeatedly, said he wanted to withdraw from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which would buttress Mr. Putin's eagerness to weaken the group.
Mr. Trump, countering the formal position of his administration, has railed against NATO. He has said that the alliance was "going out of business," and that its member nations were not paying their fair share of costs. After visiting NATO headquarters in Brussels in July, Mr. Trump claimed inaccurately that NATO spending was increasing "because of me," misrepresenting how the alliance functions.
Other administration officials, particularly in the military, are continuing to strengthen ties with NATO allies. Over the weekend, the United States Navy sent an American destroyer to the Black Sea, a move that Russia quickly denounced.

Graham says slow Syria withdrawal
ANKARA — After lengthy meetings with the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Senator Lindsey Graham called on Saturday for a slower, smarter withdrawal of US troops from Syria to avoid setting off a broader war and a nightmare for Turkey. Graham, a South Carolina Republican, has a long familiarity with Turkey and its place in the NATO alliance, and he said he was on a mission to ensure that the US withdrawal announced by President Trump in December did not cause greater damage that would be against US interests in the long run. “I can understand the desire to withdraw, but withdrawal without a plan is chaos," he told a news briefing in Ankara, the Turkish capital. “It would be Iraq on steroids," he warned, in a reference to how the Islamic State group gained power after the withdrawal of US forces from the country in 2011. Graham's trip to Turkey came after an aborted visit by the White House national security adviser, John Bolton, who left the country without meeting with Erdogan. (New York Times)
FRANCE
Yellow vest protests reach 10th weekend
PARIS — Thousands of yellow vest protesters rallied in several French cities for a 10th consecutive weekend on Saturday, despite a national debate launched this week by President Emmanuel Macron aimed at assuaging their anger. In Paris, protesters answered a call from a prominent and provocative protester promoting a march starting at the Invalides monument in Paris, home to Napoleon's tomb, to remember the 10 people killed in protest-related traffic accidents and hundreds injured since the movement kicked off Nov. 17. Police have been criticized by protesters for the use of rubber projectiles that have left dozens injured. Paris deployed 5,000 police around the capital, notably around government buildings and the Champs-Elysees, stage of recent violence. (AP)
BOLIVIA
Two-bus collision kills at least 22
LA PAZ — Police in Bolivia say a head-on highway collision between two buses has killed at least 22 people and injured 37 others. The accident occurred Saturday on the road to Challapata, a town about 155 miles from the main city of La Paz. Challapata Mayor Martin Feliciano said the death toll may rise. A police report said that the accident was due to excessive speed and one of the buses may have driven into the oncoming lane. (AP)
Australia
Man charged in murder of student
MELBOURNE — Authorities in Australia have charged a 20-year-old man with the rape and murder of Aiia Maasarwe, an Israeli exchange student who was attacked on a Melbourne street last week. The man, Codey Herrmann, of the Melbourne suburb of Greensborough, was arrested Friday afternoon and was charged in the Melbourne Magistrates' Court on Saturday. He was being held without bail and was scheduled to appear in court again Monday. The police allege that Herrmann, who has been described by local news media as an aspiring rapper, killed Maasarwe, 21, just after midnight Wednesday. She had been returning from a night out with friends and was speaking via FaceTime to her sister, who was overseas, on the short walk from a public transportation stop to her home when the attack occurred, the police said.

Facts Matter: Group distributes fake edition of Washington Post -BYLN- By Bob Oswald

Texto completo: Facts Matter: Group distributes fake edition of Washington Post The banner headline, "Unpresidented," was splashed across the front page of a fake newspaper made to look like The Washington Post, according to the real Washington Post.
The print paper, handed out Wednesday in Washington, D.C., but carrying the date May 1, 2019, had a lead story claiming President Donald Trump had written a resignation letter on a napkin, left it in the Oval Office and had taken off for Yalta, a resort city on the Crimean Peninsula. His departure was prompted by massive women-led protests across the country.
The fake newspaper and accompanying website were produced by a group called the Yes Men, described as a "trickster activist collective," the Post said.
A statement released by The Washington Post said, "There are fake print editions of The Washington Post being distributed around downtown D.C., and we are aware of a website attempting to mimic The Post’s. They are not Post products, and we are looking into this."
Jacques Servin, one of the founders of Yes Men, told the Post the newspaper was meant to provide ideas for the "grass-roots movement" to support the impeachment of Trump. "The idea was a newspaper from the future and how we got there — like a road map for activists," he said.
Servin said the fake digital site and 25,000 copies of the print paper cost the group nearly $40,000, offset by $36,000 raised from the organization’s mailing list, the Post said.
Yes Men, which Servin said practices "clowny activism," created a fake copy of The New York Times in 2008, following the election of President Barack Obama, according to the Post.
Former first mother-in-law not receiving pension A story making the internet rounds claims Barack Obama’s mother-in-law will receive a $160,000 lifetime government pension for the time she spent taking care of granddaughters Malia and Sasha.
The story is false, according to The Associated Press. Michelle’s mother, Marian Robinson, would not qualify for benefits because she was never employed by the federal government.
The article was originally published by satirical website The Boston Tribune, AP reported on Jan. 14, 2017. The story said "First Grandma" Robinson would collect the pension for being a "full-time/in-home caregiver" to the Obama children.
According to the story, Robinson qualified under the Civil Service Retirement Act, but that plan was replaced in 1987 by the Federal Employees Retirement System, AP said. And both plans require employment by the federal government.
Robinson moved into the White House with her daughter and son-in-law in 2009 and often cared for the children, AP said. She previously worked as a bank secretary and stay-at-home mother in Chicago.
The story was picked up by other websites and portrayed as credible, AP said.
Mislabeled border wall photo has been around for years An image posted on Facebook shows a large barricade and claims it is a border fence built by Mexico on the country’s border with Guatemala in order "to keep out freeloaders."
"Shouldn’t the United States have the same right as Mexico to protect its border?" the post asks.
The photo is actually a fence along Israel’s border with Egypt, according to global news agency AFP. The picture was taken on Feb. 15, 2012, by AFP photographer Ahmad Gharabli, showing Egyptian border guards watching as Israeli guards supervised construction of the barrier.
The recent post has been shared more than 1,900 times since December, AFP said. However, the same meme has been making the rounds on social media sites dating back to 2016.
Images of border fences are often used out of context on social media, according to the News Literacy Project, which featured the meme in the latest edition of its newsletter, The Sift.
Steering wheel bumps not meant for blind drivers A meme circulating this month on social media appears to be posted by users who just discovered small dots on a car’s steering wheel are to aid visually impaired drivers.
The post shows an image of a steering wheel with raised dots, accompanied by the caption, "Just realised (sic) that these little bumps on the steering wheel are in Braille so that blind drivers have no trouble finding the horn to alert other drivers when necessary."
The fake meme is an old joke that has been online for years, according to Snopes.com.
The raised dots in the photo do not resemble any letters or words in the Braille alphabet, Snopes said, let alone spell out the word "horn."

Texto completo: Early in my political activism, I sat down with national talk show host and Iowa conservative icon Steve Deace to discuss avenues of cooperation for conservatives and libertarians.
As part of the Ron Paul brigade that had recently sacked the establishment and taken the reins of the Iowa GOP, I was concerned that there was broad hesitance about working with us, in large part due to some of the smaller but more extreme elements within the liberty coalition: the conspiracy theorists, drug rights enthusiasts, and naive peaceniks.
Though few in number and well-intentioned, these folks drew an undue share of attention, and threatened the credibility many of us had worked hard to maintain within the ranks of the Liberty Movement. And most important at the moment, many of them harbored active hostility toward members of the more traditional conservative crowd.
Steve advised that libertarians needed to have a "Sister Souljah moment" — something I had never heard of before. It turned out to be a 1990s reference I had missed during the Clinton administration, when Bill publicly rebuked a racially divisive rap artist so named, and set a strong precedent for what would — and would not — be allowed of activists on his team.
Basically, when it comes to protecting the integrity of a cause, sometimes examples have to be made.
But now, just a few years later, the broader GOP is itself badly in need of a Sister Souljah moment, brought on in part by Iowa's own Rep. Steve King.
King, whose controversial interview with the New York Times drew unprecedented condemnation from state and national conservative leaders, has broken the cardinal rule of grassroots politicking: Never hang your base out to dry.
King's defenders, myself included, have long tried to give him the benefit of the doubt. Consequently, we are now left with only two options. Either King is an honest-to-God racist, or he simply lacks the judgment to avoid the land mines on what is arguably the single most persistent point of attack for the left.
Neither is acceptable to conservatives.
I haven't always been a fan of King. His hostility toward Ron Paul in 2012 left a bad taste in the mouth of many of us, and his frequent willingness to play nice with the Iowa establishment often left would-be reformers outgunned.
Still, King earned my respect as someone who stuck to his guns and demonstrated resilience in the face of critical onslaughts.
Courage and fortitude are great traits. Unfortunately, they also make it difficult to admit you're wrong and change course.
I can't judge King's heart. I can't say whether his remarks were taken out of context, as he claims.
What I can say is that I'm tired of cleaning up these messes. I'm tired of having to explain away seemingly racist remarks rather than engaging in real policy discussions. I'm sick of having to distance myself from Republicans who can't stay far enough away from Charlottesville.
The small but growing segment of "race realists" within the GOP with whom conservative activists often spar has been emboldened by King's rhetoric.
King has long been a strong voice for traditional conservatives, but is it really too much to ask for a conservative stalwart who also doesn't conflate culture with race?
Isn't it possible there's a courageous conservative who can embrace American nationalism while still inviting legal immigrants from everywhere to join in that nationalism?
Can't we find someone who can make the case for freedom, capitalism, limited government, and an America-first foreign policy without questioning the offensiveness of white supremacy?
Those of us who have condemned identity politics and defended King from charges of racism must, for the sake of consistency, draw a hard line now. That's why right-wing champions like Ben Shapiro have unloaded both barrels on King.
There must be a Sister Souljah moment.
But this doesn't have to be the end of King's story. He still holds the pen, and the final page is yet to be written.
If King is indeed a racist, then the only honorable course of action is to resign and rethink his life and world view.
If he's just careless and has utterly failed to use discernment around controversial issues, then he needs to take a double dose of humility and start with a real apology.
Not an apology for taking the wrong phone call or failing to record his interview, but for hanging his supporters and defenders out to dry, and for emboldening real racists with his statements. He can reverse course on his rhetoric in the time he has left in the House. He can draw sharper distinctions between loving one's culture and nation, and treating immigrants as a threat to them. He can vocally reject the nonsensical alt-right notions of "race realism" and "genetic heritage," and rebuke those elements within his own party.
And finally, he can use his knowledge, experience, influence, and network to invest in the next generation of conservatives — to let go of his on-again, off-again romance with Iowa's Republican establishment and go all-in on arming conservatives to fight the good fight when he leaves office.
Regardless of how he proceeds, the primary concern of Iowa conservatives should no longer be how King writes the last pages in his political book, but how we write the next page in ours.

Texto completo: Brickyard Hollow Brewing Company may be only 7 months old, but it is already at a crossroads. I mean that in both a literal and figurative sense.
Geographically, the brewery and upscale pub sits on a divot of land that the village of Yarmouth built up from paper-mill ash more than a century ago. The town's plan was to build schools and a library on the new flat stretch of ground, using the erstwhile indentation to unite the town's disparate communities: wealthy shipbuilders and sea-captains on one side, laborers and farmers on the other.
"In the 1850s, the two groups didn't get along that well, so the town leaders filled in Brickyard Hollow. We loved that idea and the name reflects our goal, too: that we want to bring the community together," co-owner Brad Moll said. "You can even see it on the photo mural on our wall that shows a winter carnival from then. It was a chance to bring the whole community together, and our building is sitting right in the middle of that."
To be fair, he doesn't mean the existing structure itself, which isn't anywhere near that old. Once a 7-Eleven, then a laundromat, the building started out boxy and nondescript, but Moll and co-owner Frank Grondin tore out everything from the foundation slab to the gabled roof, replacing them with modern updates like poured concrete flooring, exposed brick walls and twiggy, abstract light fixtures with exposed Edison bulbs. They built a 40-seat patio extension to bring the total capacity of the restaurant close to 100 in the warmer months. It's a stylish makeover - you'd never guess Slurpees were for sale here, once upon a time.
In their place, you'll find eight or nine house-brewed beers on draft, plus a few local favorites to round out the pub's dozen taps. Both the Brickyard Hollow Blonde ($3.50 for 8 ounces), a medium-bodied, hoppy ale with some spice and citrus on the finish, and the malty, dry-hopped IPA "Three" ($5 for 8 ounces), are excellent, demonstrating the high caliber of what's bubbling in the four enormous fermentation tanks at the rear of the building.
What's perhaps less impressive is the feast-or-famine quality of the service. When my guests and I arrived, the host/server looked at us quickly, then turned away with an indifferent shrug, calling back to her colleague in staccato tones: "Hey. Customers. Seat 'em."
Fortunately, the server who snapped to attention also stuck around for the rest of our meal. She, it turned out, was warm and knowledgeable about drinks - steering one of us to the fruity, tequila-based La Sal cocktail ($11) when she heard we were in the mood for something refreshing and tart - as well as the menu.
No easy feat, when you consider the sweeping scope of dishes on offer at Brickyard Hollow. According to chef and kitchen manager Don Rankin, the menu is "global-style fusion, with a little Asian flair, Mexican flair. It just reaches across a variety of tastes," he said.
Frequently, menus characterized by more breadth than depth wind up being disappointments. It's hard enough to master one country's traditions, let alone half a dozen of them. But by and large, Brickyard Hollow acquits itself pretty well, despite getting a little impressionistic with its perspective on the cuisines themselves.
The (sort of) Italian-inspired Modena salad ($9 large), a sharable plate of balsamic-vinaigrette-dressed mixed lettuce greens, bacon, red onions, and chiffonaded strips of fresh basil felt like a savory new twist on salad, thanks in part to the addition of decidedly non-Italian elements like smoked Gouda, and salted, smokehouse almonds.
Technicolor pink, char-grilled strips of "Chinese" pork loin steeped in a Saigon-cinnamon-forward, Asian-inspired marinade ($9) were just as approximate in their cultural fidelity. But boy, were they tender and gorgeously grill-marked. Ignore the ramekin of bottled Thai sweet chili sauce, though; it's a complete non sequitur.
The cross-cultural experiment derails from time to time, as with the tough, underseasoned jerk chicken sandwich ($13). Here, strips of dark meat are dry-rubbed with Nutmeg Spice Company's Jamaican jerk seasoning, then grilled in batches twice a week on the outdoor grill. Chicken cooked in advance rarely stays moist, and this dish is no exception. Also stale: the dry, dusty-tasting Mexican churros ($6), fried from dough bought from Izzy's Cheesecake in Portland and served with a dense vanilla ice cream so unexceptional that not even Rankin could remember where it was from.
Our neighbors to the north get the most faithful global-plates treatment in the form of an above-average version of bacon poutine ($10), made with crispy, battered fries (the same distributor-sourced fries Brickyard Hollow uses as an accompaniment for all its sandwiches), beef gravy (from concentrate) and barely melted Pineland Farms cheese curds.
Which brings me to the other critical junction where Brickyard Hollow finds itself.
I asked Rankin about the pre-prepared components in so many of the restaurant's dishes and got a response I've heard elsewhere, more than once, at kitchens where I was struck by the unfulfilled potential of the menu. "We're not big enough to roast large bones and make our own demi-glaces," he said. "It's a small kitchen."
And so far, the food is decent, even with mixed-provenance dishes like the satisfying and well-cooked BH burger ($13) that incorporates a few locally sourced ingredients like Pineland Farms ground beef sitting cheek-by-jowl with corporate ones, like bottled barbecue sauce and vacuum-packed fried onions.
But there are signs here and there that Brickyard Hollow could be better than it is - perhaps a lot better.
Take the Key lime scallops ($21): six plump, Harbor Fish Market scallops, seared caramel-brown top and bottom, yet still wobbly and pudding-like inside, with an effervescent tartness from creamy lime vinaigrette and penetrating bite from chopped scallions. They are as good as any scallops I've had in southern Maine.
Even the composed salad they're served on is thoughtfully put together, with pea shoots, roasted red peppers, pepitas, and more of that Key lime dressing. You may also notice a theme here - nothing on this plate comes out of a can or a box, and it's a stunner of a dish.
Perhaps now, before summer seduces back its swarms of visitors, is the time for the business to consider what kind of restaurant should service its standout brewery. Sticking with the status quo of boxed ingredients is an inglorious, but easy option. The other route will admittedly require some work, but just like the historic location of Brickyard Hollow itself, it is already halfway there.

HUNDREDS TAKE TO STREETS FOR WOMEN'S MARCH

Texto completo: Despite near-freezing temperatures, a crowd of several hundred took part Saturday in the third annual Women's March Washington-Pittsburgh, calling for change in the current state of American politics and an end to societal injustices that target women and minorities.
The demonstrators' ranks stretched nearly three blocks as they moved through Downtown - from Grant Street, along Fifth Avenue to Market Square -raising their voices and carrying signs decrying hate and urging an end to political divisions.
With chants that included "Love, not hate, makes America great," the crowd, escorted by Pittsburgh motorcycle police, proceeded with a large, green inflated Lady Liberty brandishing her gold torch.
Protesters spoke of, and carried signs that illustrated, issues from reproductive rights and the environment to pay inequity and sexual harassment.
President Donald Trump and his policies were a theme in some of the signs, and in a giant inflatable "Trump Chicken."
Among those waiting for the march to start were Marie Engberg, 50, of the North Side, her daughter Ella, 14, and two friends. Ms. Engberg mentioned several reasons she wanted to be there, then summed it up this way:
"As a country," she said, "I know we can do better."
The noontime march followed an 11 a.m. rally outside the City-County Building on Grant Street. There, participants heard local politicians and activists speak through a bullhorn.
One of them, Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald, alluded to Pittsburgh's resilience in the aftermath of October's mass shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Squirrel Hill. He tied it to a larger message about tolerance in a region still hurting from the anti-Semitic rampage that killed 11 and wounded six during a worship service.
"Bigotry and hatred are not welcome here," Mr. Fitzgerald said. "Discrimination because of where you worship - what part of the world your ancestors were born in, the color of your skin, your gender or who you love - are not welcome here."
Nationally, Saturday's march had generated tensions. Tamika Mallory, co-president of Women's March, the group that has planned the March in Washington, came under fire for ties to Louis Farrakhan, leader of the Nation of Islam, who has been chastised for anti-Semitic speeches. The Women's March issued a series of statements denouncing anti-Semitism and apologized for its delayed response to the controversy.
In Washington, D.C., the Women's March was a more modest affair than in past years as an estimated 100,000 protesters packed several blocks around Freedom Plaza, just east of the White House, to hold a daylong rally.
Organizers submitted a permit application estimating up to 500,000 participants even though it was widely expected that the turnout would be smaller.
The original march in 2017, the day after Mr. Trump's inauguration, flooded the city with pink-hatted protesters. The exact size of the turnout remains subject to a politically charged debate, but it's generally regarded as the largest Washington protest since the Vietnam War era.
Saturday's Pittsburgh demonstration was made up of a multiracial group of women and men of all ages, ranging from mothers pushing toddlers in strollers to college students and senior citizens. One woman with a child carried a sign bearing the familiar expression, "Love your neighbor - no exceptions."
The mood was a mix of spirited festivity and serious concern about the direction of the nation. Black Lives Matter protesters shared space with those focused on gender equality and protection for immigrants, including one marcher with a sign that implored the country to "build bridges not walls."
Upon reaching Market Square, school-age and adult activists and others spoke. Among them was Michelle Kenney, the mother of Antwon Rose II, a teenager who was killed by an East Pittsburgh police officer in a shooting last summer.
People keep telling her how strong she has been, and although that's gratifying, "the truth is, none of that came from me," she said.
"It came from my mother.
"I watched her go to work in U.S. Steel when being a female wasn't popular," she said.
After her mother was laid off from the mill, Ms. Kenney remembers her being "classy as she could be, standing in the free cheese and butter line to support her kids. I've watched my mom bounce back a thousand times."
She added, "If we want the people standing next to us and the generation behind us to be better, then we got to do better."
In New York and Philadelphia, similar events were being held - one backed by local organizers and the other backed by affiliates of the national group.

Minnetonka schools condemn teen's Nazi posting

Texto completo: The Minnetonka school district is hoping to transform an "outrageous act" into a teachable moment after an image depicting two high school students doing a Nazi salute and clutching a sign with references to Adolf Hitler created a firestorm on social media.
Widely condemned as anti-Semitic, the post prompted multiple notes home to parents from school administrators.
"While I do not know whether it was an intentionally hateful message or was created out of ignorance, be assured the students will be disciplined for their actions," Superintendent Dennis Peterson wrote in an e-mail Friday denouncing the post.
"The larger issue is that we, as a community, must do an even better job of educating students about Hitler and the Holocaust," he wrote. "While we do units on this in middle school, and we have had several Holocaust survivors speak at MHS, it has apparently not been enough to prevent yesterday's incident."
The e-mails did not state what the offensive message said but assured parents that it had been removed. Data privacy laws prevent school administrators from identifying the students involved or revealing any punishment they may face.
The photo, which was posted to a private Instagram account, shows a teenage girl and boy doing a Nazi salute as they clasp an apparent invitation to the school's annual Valentine's Day dance, called Sweethearts.
"Sweethearts would be a Hit(ler) w/you, and I could Nazi myself going w/anybody else. Be Mein? Yes or Nein," the poster reads.
The girl posted the photo with the caption: "Also I would like to state I am not anti-Semitic in any way, I hate all races equally."
If the message was meant as a joke, many weren't laughing.
"I'm steaming," said Wendy Rosenthal, whose daughter is a ninth-grader at Minnetonka High. "They can't claim they didn't know that this was offensive."
Rabbi Tzvi Kupfer, adviser to the school's Jewish Student Union (JSU), said he was appalled after being alerted to the post by his students Thursday night.
"They said they just don't feel safe going to school anymore," said Kupfer, adding that their sense of security had been cracked. "This is not something that should be joked about."
Minnetonka Principal Jeff Erickson reached out to JSU leaders and plans to meet with them next week to discuss their concerns. But Kupfer is calling for additional Holocaust education and has offered himself as a resource to the district.
Last spring, the Jewish Community Relations Council of Minnesota and the Dakotas organized a school assembly for students to hear from local Holocaust survivor Judith Meisel. After the incident, they offered to provide continued guidance.
"Somewhere, somehow there was a disconnect," Kupfer said. "Obviously it's not talked about enough. This kind of thing reminds us … we need to do more."
Jewish groups have become increasingly alarmed about the lack of Holocaust knowledge among young adults. A 2018 New York Times survey found that two-thirds of American millennials do not know what Auschwitz was.
The student involved, who deleted her original account, issued an apology on a new, private Instagram page. "I apologize for my stupid mistake," she wrote in her bio. "There was no intent to offend anyone."
A longer post elaborated: "I also realize how awful it is to make light in anyway of the horrors of hitler and the holocaust. It was stupid on my part and I feel bad about it. I would take it back if I could. I hope you all understand and forgive me."

Texto completo: By the age of 30, Irin Carmon had already carved out a name for herself, graduating magna cum laude from Harvard, winning a major journalism award, reporting for MSNBC on women’s issues and earning reputation as a top television pundit.
Then along came an invitation to co-author “Notorious RBG” — the best-selling biography of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg — and into her already remarkable life entered the petite legend whose story brought her to tears and whose generosity gave her the wedding of her dreams.
Ginsburg, in her trademark black robe, pearl collar and hair pulled back in a bun, not only officiated at her wedding in September 2017 but stuck around for the reception.
“She is lovely,” Carmon said. “She loves weddings.”
Carmon, 35, spoke Thursday at Planned Parenthood’s 28th annual Tradition of Choice luncheon at the Kravis Center. The book, which spent three
months on The New York Times’ best-sellers list, has not only brought her fame and speaking gigs but also a trove of amusing anecdotes.
At her first interview, she showed Ginsburg photos of her fan’s tattoos of her with the trademark crown of rapper Notorious B.I.G. Rather than quote Ginsburg’s response, Carmon showed a photo of Ginsburg’s puzzled and somewhat disgusted reaction.
“That’s real, that’s real,” Carmon told the audience. “Although she is flattered by the attention, she is still someone’s grandmother and she said, at least when my granddaughter got a nose ring she could take that out.”
Carmon wrote the book with Shana Knizhnik, a civil rights attorney who created the Notorious R.B.G. Tumblr that transformed Ginsburg into a cultural icon.
“We didn’t know what we would find when we teamed up to do the book but what we found was even more incredible, her commitment to civil liberties, hard work, humor and fascinating life — more than we could have ever imagined,” Carmon said. At times her research brought her to tears, especially Ginsburg’s mother’s death to cancer the day before she graduated from high school, then, in 2010, the death of her husband, Martin Ginsburg.
It was what she learned about the Ginsburgs’ 55-year marriage that prompted Carmon and her then fiance to write to Ginsburg, asking her to marry them.
“We told her how much her example of what a marriage could be meant to us, what a model her relationship with Marty — a love partnership and a professional partnership — what it meant for us and we wanted to build a relationship like they had,” Carmon said. “She wrote back really fast. Just said ‘mazel tov.’”
Carmon explained to Ginsburg that the couple had planned to marry in Brooklyn but would be willing to come to the high court with just their immediate families if that would be easier for her.
“She just said, ‘I have jurisdiction in Brooklyn. I will come to Brooklyn,’” Carmon said. “So, it was her and seven U.S. marshals.”
Ginsburg agreed to let Carmon’s brother walk her down the aisle, then agreed to stay for dinner and the toasts. The couple posted photos on Instagram under the hashtag #ifiwerearichmon.
Ginsburg, now 85, co-founded the ACLU’s Women’s Rights Project in 1972 and went on to argue six gender discrimination cases before the Supreme Court between 1973 and 1976, winning five. President Bill Clinton appointed her to the Supreme Court in 1993, where her landmark opinions and forceful dissents continued to shape gender policy, voting rights and social justice issues.
Carmon, long-interested in feminist politics, said Ginsburg had been an inspiration for years. She first saw her speak at Yale in 2012, when Carmon was a fellow at the Program for the Study of Reproductive Justice at the law school, and made a point to see her speak every chance she had after that. Carmon has never shied away from advocating for women’s rights and investigating injustice and earned a reputation as an outspoken pundit. Before “Notorious RBG” became a best-seller, she broke the story of eight women who accused longtime television host Charlie Rose of unwanted sexual advances.
Today, her research, writing and personal relationship with Ginsburg has elevated her status and made her an authority on women’s issues. Although she is encouraged by the #MeToo movement and the record number of women in Congress, “the state level is where the action is happening,” Carmon said.
“Ultimately, the states have always been ground zero for determining whether a person will have access to reproductive heath care,” Carmon said. Despite recent progress on the national level, she is keenly aware that states, such as Florida, remain under the control of conservative, anti-abortion governors and legislatures. “It’s a wake-up call from anybody who thinks that these rights can be taken for granted.”
Carmon will speak at two other Planned Parenthood events in Florida in the coming months. She is now a senior correspondent for New York magazine and a CNN contributor.

Shutdown not a ‘crisis’

Texto completo: This government shutdown is now longer than any in history. The media keep using the word "crisis."
"Shutdown sows chaos, confusion and anxiety!" says The Washington Post. "Pain spreads widely."
The New York Times headlined, it's all "just too much!"
But wait. Looking around America, I see people going about their business -- families eating in restaurants, employees going to work, children playing in playgrounds, etc. I have to ask: Where's the crisis?
Pundits talk as if government is the most important part of America, but it isn't.
We need some government, limited government. But most of life, the best of life, goes on without government, many of the best parts in spite of government.
Of course, the shutdown is a big deal to the 800,000 people who aren't being paid. They will get paid. Government workers always do -- after shutdowns.
But there are lessons to be learned.
During a shutdown when Barack Obama was president, government officials were so eager to make a point by inconveniencing people that they even stopped visitors from entering public parks.
Trump's administration isn't doing that, so PBS found a new crisis: "Trash cans spilling ... (P)ark services can't clean up the mess until Congress and the president reach a spending deal," reported "NewsHour."
But volunteers appeared to pick up some of the trash.
Given a chance, private citizens often step in to do things government says only government can do.
The Washington Post ran a front-page headline about farmers "reeling ... because they aren't receiving government support checks."
But why do farmers even get "support checks"?
One justification is "saving family farms." But the money goes to big farms.
Government doesn't need to "guarantee the food supply," another justification for subsidies. Most fruit and vegetable farmers get no subsidies, yet there are no shortages of peaches, plums, green beans, etc.
Subsidies are a scam created by politicians who get money from wheat, cotton, corn and soybean agribusinesses. Those farmers should suck it up and live without subsidies, too.
During shutdowns, government tells "nonessential workers" not to come to work. But if they're nonessential, then why do we pay 400,000 of them?
The New York Times shrieks, "Shutdown Curtails FDA Food Inspections!"
Only if you read on do you learn that meat and poultry inspection is done by the Department of Agriculture. They're still working. And the FDA is restarting some inspections as well.
More important, meat is usually safe not because of government -- but because of competition.
Food sellers worry about their reputations. They know they'll get bad publicity if they poison people (think Chipotle), so they take many more safety measures than government requires.
While pundits and politicians act as if everything needs government intervention, the opposite is true.
Even security work is done better by the private sector. At San Francisco's airport, security lines move faster. Passengers told me, "The screeners are nicer!" The TSA even acknowledged that the screeners are better at finding contraband. That's because San Francisco (Kansas City, Seattle and a dozen smaller airports) privatized the screening process. Private companies are responsible for security.
Private contractors are better because they must compete. Perform badly, and they get fired.
But government never fires itself.
Government workers shout, "We are essential!" But I say: "Give me a break. Most of you are not."

Texto completo: Mary Oliver, the Pulitzer Prize-winning poet whose rapturous odes to nature and animal life brought her critical acclaim and popular affection, has died. She was 83.
Bill Reichblum, Oliver's literary executor, said she died Thursday at her home in Hobe Sound, Fla.
The cause of death was lymphoma.
"Thank you, Mary Oliver, for giving so many of us words to live by," Hillary Clinton wrote in a tweet.
Ava DuVernay quoted from Oliver's poem "Praying" and fans online shared their favorite lines.
Author of more than 15 poetry and essay collections, Oliver (photo, in 1992) wrote brief, direct pieces that sang of her worship of the outdoors and disdain for greed, despoilment and other human crimes. One of her favorite adjectives was "perfect," and rarely did she apply it to people.
Her muses were owls and butterflies, frogs and geese, the changes of the seasons, the sun and the stars.
"In my outward appearance and life habits I hardly change - there's never been a day that my friends haven't been able to say, and at a distance, 'There's Oliver, still standing around in the weeds. There she is, still scribbling in her notebook,'" Oliver wrote in "Long Life," a book of essays published in 2004. "But, at the center: I am shaking; I am flashing like tinsel."
Like her hero Walt Whitman, whom she would call the brother she never had, Oliver didn't only observe mushrooms growing in a rainstorm or an owl calling from a black branch; she longed to know and become one with what she saw.
Her poetry books included "White Pine," "West Wind" and the anthology "Devotions," which came out in 2017. She won the Pulitzer in 1984 for "American Primitive" and the National Book Award in 1992 for "New and Selected Poems." In 1998, she received the Lannan Literary Award for lifetime achievement.
Her fans ranged from fellow poets Stanley Kunitz and Rita Dove to former First Ladies Clinton and Laura Bush. "Although few poets have fewer human beings in their poems than Mary Oliver, it is ironic that few poets also go so far to help us forward," Stephen Dobyns wrote of her in The New York Times.
Oliver was a native of Maple Heights in suburban Cleveland, and endured what she called a "dysfunctional" family in part by writing poems and building huts of sticks and grass in the nearby woods.
Edna St. Vincent Millay was an early influence and, while in high school, Oliver wrote to the late poet's sister, Norma, asking if she could visit Millay's house in upstate Austerlitz. Norma Millay agreed and Oliver ended up spending several years there, organizing the poet's papers.
While in Austerlitz, she also met the photographer Molly Malone Cook - and the two were partners until Cook's death, in 2005. Much of Oliver's work was dedicated to Cook.

Texto completo: Dear Readers: Back in the day the first thing I’d read when I opened my Daily Herald was Jim O’Donnell’s media column. I found him to be bright and articulate with a vocabulary shared by few. I knew someday I’d enjoy working with him if given the chance.
O’Donnell, with his decades of connections, knows the Chicago sports scene, so what better than to have him complement our lineup of knowledgeable, familiar experts: Dietz, Gregor, McGraw, Miles and Rozner.
O’Donnell returns today to the Friday Sports pages of The Daily Herald with a sports media column. I’m confident you’ll enjoy his eye for detail, insight, great reporting and occasional feather-ruffling.
In addition to previous work here, the award-winning O’Donnell has written for Frank Deford’s National Sports Daily, the Sun-Times, the Tribune and The New York Times. He also worked on two best-selling books authorized by Michael Jordan, and while a freelance radio writer he worked with Steve Dahl and Garry Meier.
He’s back with us. Once you read his column, you’ll want to keep reading him.

Keaton explored in documentary at the DIA

Texto completo: One of the most acclaimed start of the silent film era — or any film era, actually — is the subject of a loving documentary hitting the Detroit Film Theatre at the Detroit Institute of Arts this weekend and next.
"The Great Buster" chronicles the artistic life of influential filmmaker, comedian and actor Buster Keaton. Keaton, who spent childhood summers in Muskegon, had a lengthy Hollywood career but is best known for his work during the silent era — behind the scenes and on the screen — in '20s comedies like "The General" and "Steamboat Bill, Jr." In 1999, the American Film Institute slotted him as the No. 21 male actor in its list of the 50 greatest screen legends of all time.
The documentary was directed by filmmaker and cinema historian Peter Bogdanovich, and features remastered footage from many of Keaton's greatest films, along with contemporary interviewers with modern-day admirers, including Mel Brooks, Quentin Tarantino, Werner Herzog and Johnny Knoxville. While the movie hits on his career beginnings on the vaudeville circuit and touches on later-life struggles, it puts special emphasis on his 1920s output, which established him as one of cinema's most-revered actor-filmmakers.
A New York Times review called "The Great Buster" "a celebration and also an invitation to some of the purest, strangest laughter the screen has to offer," while the Boston Globe described it as "a solid primer on what made Keaton not just one of the most important — and funniest — comedians in the history of the movies but also one of its most visionary directors."
The film's screenings are being co-presented by Freep Film Festival as part of its monthly screening series. In addition to the documentary, the Detroit Film Theatre is also showing restored versions of two Keaton classics, "Sherlock Jr." and "Seven Chances," at 4 p.m. Saturday.

Digital First $1.4B Gannett value too low, cost-cutting hopes likely unrealistic: Analysts

Resumen: Alden Global Capital may view Gannett as a company it can prune like it has other media companies, but Gannett already runs lean, analysts say.

Texto completo: A hedge fund-backed chain that is aiming for a hostile takeover of Gannett, which owns USA TODAY and 109 local media properties, placed too low of a value on the company and is betting on a level of cost cutting that may be unrealistic, analysts said.
Michael Kupinski, director of research at Noble Capital Markets in Boca Raton, Florida, said most newspapers, after years of staff reductions across the industry, "are running pretty lean. "
He predicted that Gannett's board will decline the offer.
MNG Enterprises, which also operates as Digital First Media, is proposing to buy Gannett for $12 a share, or about $1. 36 billion. That would be a 23 percent premium above Friday's closing price of $9. 75 a share. Gannett (GCI) shares on Monday closed up 21 percent, or $2. 07, at $11. 82.
MNG, majority owned by hedge fund Alden Global Capital, owns about 200 publications, including newspapers such as The Denver Post, The Mercury News of San Jose, California, the Los Angeles Daily News and the Boston Herald. The company has also gained a reputation for deep cost cuts and extensive layoffs in newsrooms.
A plan to prune Gannett for additional return on investment may be faulty, Kupinski said.
“I guess this particular firm is notorious for going in and slashing costs," he said. "I really don’t view Gannett as being one of the companies that has bloated staffing or anything like that. There might be an opportunity to consolidate maybe some facilities but they were moving along that direction anyway. ”
Paul Caminiti, a spokesperson for MNG, said it "has extensive operational experience and a successful track record in the newspaper industry, enabling us to run newspapers profitability and sustainable so that they can continue to serve their local communities. ”
Subsequent bidders could surpass the MNG/Digital First offer because "it would be below what I would expect the company to achieve," Kupinski said. "We have a $15 price target" on Gannett stock.
Huber Research analysts Douglas Arthur and Craig Huber, in a note to clients Monday, said any offer for Gannett should be at least $14 a share.
The two analysts described the takeover attempt as "opportunistic given the stock was battered during the market’s December sell-off and the CEO as well as head of digital sales have both announced they are leaving (CEO is retiring). Our bottom line is that the proposed price is not high enough. "
Gannett CEO Robert Dickey announced his retirement in December. Sharon Rowlands, who led USA TODAY Network Marketing Solutions, is leaving the company to become CEO of web. com.
MNG/Digital First said in its letter to Gannett’s board of directors that it had approached board members and management "on multiple occasions about a potential strategic combination. Despite our overtures, Gannett has not meaningfully engaged with us. ”
Gannett said in an email to employees late Sunday after The Wall Street Journal published a story about MNG/Digital First's plans, "To date there has been no communication to Gannett regarding a proposal. "
In a subsequent email to employees Monday morning, Gannett confirmed "receipt of an unsolicited proposal" from MNG/Digital First for $12 a share.
Making an unsolicited bid would be an unusual strategy and one that would not only be more costly, but would be less likely to be effective, said Morton Pierce, a mergers and acquisitions lawyer with the firm of White & Case in New York City.
“If I approach you and punch you in the mouth and then say, ‘Let’s be friends,’ it’s less likely to work than if I just come up and talk to you,” Pierce said.
This first bid may not be the last and shareholders could be wooed, he said.
“If someone’s paying you cash, whether they’re the nicest people in the world or the worst SOBs, their cash is the same,” Pierce said.
Since MNG/Digital First is privately held, financial details are hard to collect. But the chain achieved a 17 percent operating margin for fiscal 2017, the highest among publishing chains, said Ken Doctor, an analyst who writes about the media business on his website, Newsonomics. com.
Other major publishers such as The New York Times Co. and Gannett posted margins of less than 10 percent, according to Doctor. He said company financials obtained confidentially found that much of Digital First's profit was driven by its Colorado newspapers and its Bay Area News Group.
Two months ago, Gannett reduced its full-year 2018 revenue forecast after digital advertising and marketing services revenue growth slowed, resulting in a 4 percent dip in total operating revenue for the third quarter. The company revised its full-year revenue forecast to a range of $2. 9 billion to $2. 94 billion, compared to the previous range of $2. 95 billion to $3 billion. Wall Street analysts now expect Gannett to post full year-revenue of $2. 9 billion, down 6. 5 percent from $3. 1 billion a year ago, according to analysts polled by S&P Global Market Intelligence.
Declining print circulation and advertising revenue have led newspaper groups to seek protection through consolidation. Gannett itself has bolstered its size in 2016 by adding the Journal Media Group. Its 15 media properties included the Journal Sentinel in Milwaukee and The Commercial Appeal in Memphis, Tennessee. Gannett also acquired the North Jersey Media Group, including The Record in Bergen County.
"Alden has a controversial reputation in the newspaper business and is known for aggressively slashing staff (media sources refer to the strategy as strip-mining), selling off real estate and otherwise attempting to seemingly run papers until the very last iota of cash flow has been squeezed from it," the Huber Research analysts wrote. "We believe, while Underweight, (Gannett) is on the right path with its digital growth push and legacy cost cuts. "

Texto completo: Ahead of Saturday's Women's March in San Jose, activists will stage a protest today outside the San Jose Improv, where disgraced comedian Louis C.K. is scheduled to perform tonight and Thursday.
Organizers of the San Jose Women's March and the Enough is Enough Voter Project, a national political action committee aimed at targeting politicians who condone violence against women, will demonstrate outside venue starting at 7:30 p.m.
They have denounced the San Jose Improv for booking the 51-year-old comedian, given his admission in November 2017 that he sexually harassed multiple women by masturbating in front of them. C.K. was responding to allegations in the New York Times made by five women who worked with him.
More recently, C.K. made jokes at a stand-up performance that mocked teen survivors of the Parkland, Florida, mass shooting, as well as young people who identify as transgender.
"Santa Clara County recently voted in a landslide to recall Judge (Aaron) Persky because we believe that sexual violence and harassment is very serious," said Stanford Law professor Michele Dauber, the founder and chair of Enough is Enough. "The Improv should not give a serial sexual harasser a platform in our community to make light of the harm he caused to his victims."
The statement from Enough is Enough noted that other venues have canceled C.K.'s shows due to outrage over "his shocking and disgusting actions. ... But now the Improv has booked C.K. in San Jose, despite the fact that he is an admitted sexual harasser."
San Jose Improv on Tuesday indicated that it has no plans to cancel C.K.'s shows, with a spokesperson for the Improv Comedy Clubs saying the franchise stands by the comedian's right to perform, while respecting critics' right to protest.
"We see comedy as the final frontier and we don't censor artists," according to a statement. "We want them to perform without scrutiny. We trust that our audiences can decide for themselves what their limits are. We understand that not everyone will agree with our decision and we respect their right to protest. We also respect Louis C.K.'s right to perform."
Details about the protest were posted on Facebook. A Change.org petition also was launched Tuesday to denounce San Jose Improv for booking C.K.
"Tell the owners of San Jose Improv that you oppose the booking of Louis CK and are immediately calling for the cancellation of his shows," the petition said. "As customers and/or residents of San Jose we need to express to the owners that the decision to book Louis CK is not something we stand behind."
Monday, San Jose Improv announced that the C.K. would be trying out some "new material" that's "XXX adults only" at his two scheduled performances.
But the announcement also raised questions about whether C.K.'s "new" material would include the jokes that enraged many last month. Leaked audio of a set he performed at a Long Island club showed him mocking students who survived the Feb. 14, 2018, mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. The violence left 17 people dead and some of the survivors have become nationally known advocates for gun control.
"They testify in front of Congress, these kids," the Emmy winner joked at the Governor's Comedy Club in Levittown, N.Y., on Dec. 16, according to reports. "You're not interesting because you went to a high school where kids were shot."
He then asked, "Why does that mean I have to listen to you?"
C.K. also delivered a few lines ripping political correctness among young people and adopted a stereotypical lisp to excoriate new attitudes and language regarding gender identity.
"They tell you what to call them," C.K. said. "You should address me as they them because I identify as gender neutral...'"
Some comedians and former fans have said the 51-year-old comedian has come off as excessively defensive and angry in his comeback performances, or point out he's not doing what he successfully did in the past: leavening his more abrasive and edgy jokes with moments of empathy, self-deprecation or self-reflection.
The Daily Beast's Kevin Fallon and other writers have been more harsh in their criticism, with Fallon writing that the Parkland and transgender jokes were "just plain disgusting" and accused C.K. of "pandering to the alt-right."
But C.K. has his defenders. Ricky Gervais tweeted that it's wrong to say there are certain subjects that are out of bounds for comedy. Others have said it was unethical for audience members to secretly record C.K.'s set when he was likely in the process of trying out new material and would discard jokes that didn't go over well.
"Leave Louis C.K. alone," said another famous defender, longtime friend Janeane Garofalo, in a recent podcast.
While appearing on Bust Magazine's "Poptarts" pop culture podcast, Garofalo said C.K.'s critics should at least consider his family's feelings.
"He's been my friend and I stand by that he's been my friend since 1985, and I think he has suffered," she said. "And when he performs at the Comedy Cellar and people get all irate, if nothing else, care about his daughters. If nothing else if you can find no compassion for him, which I think you should think about how his daughters, who hear all of this stuff, feel. Why don't you leave him alone for them if you're so women-empowering?"
Garofalo said C.K. has "paid heavily, heavily, and his family has paid heavily."
On its website, promoting the "special event" shows tonight and Thursday night, the San Jose Improv did not mention C.K.'s sexual misconduct scandal or his recent controversial performances. The venue touted his Peabody Award-winning shows "Louie" and "Horace and Pete" and hailed him as a "six-time Emmy Award winner" and "the first comedian to sell out Madison Square Garden three times for the same tour."
The shows were sold out as of Monday night, but fans can sign up for a waiting list.

Elizabeth Warren asks for ethics inquiry into Mick Mulvaney

Texto completo: Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who is exploring a 2020 run for president, has asked ethics lawyers to look into President Trump's chief of staff.

In a letter sent Tuesday, Warren said acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, who is also the director of the Office of Management and Budget, may have broken federal law when he reportedly spoke with senior officials at the University of South Carolina about becoming president of the school.

“Under the Stop Trading On Congressional Knowledge Act (STOCK), Mr. Mulvaney ‘may not directly negotiate or have any agreement of future employment’ with an outside entity unless he discloses the negotiations with the relevant agency's ethics office,” Warren wrote in the letter Tuesday, addressed to Sonya White, designated agency ethics official at the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, and Mark Paoletta, general counsel and designated agency ethics official at the Office of Management and Budget.

“Mr. Mulvaney is one of the top officials in the Trump Administration,” Warren wrote. “His compliance with the STOCK Act is crucial to protecting American taxpayer and maintaining public confidence in the integrity of the federal government.”

Warren argued that the STOCK Act was particularly relevant given that a New York Times last week said Mulvaney engaged in discussions about becoming the University of South Carolina’s next president while he was still acting director of the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau and is still interested in the position. She noted that the OMB is involved with setting the president’s budget and that in fiscal 2018-2019, the University of South Carolina is receiving $200 million in federal contracts and grants.

Similarly, she noted that Mulvaney’s role at the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, a position that he held until December, “monitors financial products and credit card marketing agreements issued in conjunction with universities and alumni associations — including the University of South Carolina Alumni Association.”

Warren requested information on whether Mulvaney adhered to all requirements outlined in the STOCK Act during any negotiations, if the ethics officials were aware of the negotiations, and whether Mulvaney has recused himself from matters concerning the University of South Carolina.

Warren, who announced in December she was launching an exploratory committee for a 2020 presidential run, requested a response from the ethics officials by Jan. 29.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Washington Examiner .

White House spokesperson Hogan Gidley told the New York Times last week that Mulvaney was not interested in pursuing the position at the University of South Carolina anymore and is “focused on faithfully executing the job the president has asked him to do, and as such he is not interested in any other positions.”

Warren and Mulvaney previously clashed last year when the senator pressed him on whether he defied the Hatch Act by attending a “closed-door event in New York City” where Republican Party officials and donors gathered.

The Elizabeth Warren-Mick Mulvaney blood feud continues

Autor: Wegmann, Philip. 

Información de publicación: Washington Examiner ; Washington, D.C. [Washington, D.C]. 15 Jan 2019.

Texto completo: Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., wants the scalp of acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. Warren just accused Mulvaney of betraying the public trust and violating the law for personal advancement.

She has asked ethics officials to investigate whether Mulvaney lobbied for a job as president of the University of South Carolina while he oversaw both the Office of Personnel and Management and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

Everyone in Washington, D.C. is looking for their next job. No one, however, is supposed to be leveraging a government job into a private position.

As the Daily Beast was first to report, Warren wrote that Mulvaney may have violated the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act which was “designed to stop officials from using their positions to benefit potential employers in order to increase the likelihood of obtaining post-government employment.”

Warren may have gotten the best of Mulvaney on this one. He hasn’t commented publicly so far.

The New York Times reported last month that Mulvaney had reached out to the school to explore the possibility of landing the job. And according to public copies of his schedule, Mulvaney met with the current president of the university, Harris Pastides, and the university’s lobbyist, Steven Beckham.

This is concerning, Warren argues, for two reasons.

First, as OMB director, Mulvaney “is responsible for producing the President's budget” and “the University of South Carolina is receiving nearly $200 million in federal grants and contracts.” Second, as acting director of CFPB, Mulvaney oversaw financial products “issued in conjunction with universities and alumni associations — including the University of South Carolina Alumni Association.”

These are serious allegations that must be addressed. At the same time, this has as much to do with revenge as much as it does with good government. Warren has had it in for Mulvaney from the moment he kidnapped her baby, the CFPB.

Warren was the chief architect of that bureau, a behemoth beholden to no one but itself. Wound up by Congress and left to its own devices, the CFPB can legislate, execute, and adjudicate its own policies. It is the embodiment of the administrative state, and it runs contrary to the central premise of representative government.

The last time Warren and Mulvaney fought face to face, it was less of a standard committee hearing and more of a cage match. He hates the CFPB because it is unaccountable to the people it governs, and he made sure to throw it in her face by denying that as its head he was answerable to her.

That back-and-forth came in April. It was vicious. Since then, the unmistakable animosity has undoubtedly bled into the current charges. The stakes are higher this time, as Warren also has a political motivation to take out the White House chief.

Mulvaney is perhaps the last conservative ideologue still standing in the administration. He was hell-bent against big government while a member of the House Freedom Caucus, and he now plays the conservative Darth Vader in progressive nightmares.

If Warren knocks him out now, its a huge feather in the cap of her presidential campaign.

Trump repeatedly said in private he wanted US to leave NATO: Report

Texto completo: President Trump on multiple occasions last year talked in private about his desire to withdraw the U.S. from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, according to a new report.

Senior administration officials told the New York Times that they were initially unsure if Trump was sincere when he first tossed out the suggestion in 2017. But since then Trump brought up the idea repeatedly to his national security advisers, including around the time of the NATO summit last July when he was questioning the usefulness of the alliance.

At the time the president was frustrated with European allies he said needed to step up their defense spending. He stirred controversy when he suggested he could "probably" withdraw the U.S. without congressional approval, but ultimately said it was "unnecessary" after allies agreed to more contribute more.

Still, the report of Trump broaching a withdrawal on numbers occasions has struck a nerve among national security officials worried that such a move would doom the alliance and please Russia, particularly in the aftermath of two bombshell reports from the New York Times and Washington Post. The first reported the FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation into Trump after he fired FBI Director James Comey in May 2017 and the latter reported the president sought to keep details of his meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin a secret.

Michèle Flournoy, an undersecretary of defense during the Obama administration, said pulling out from the alliance “would be one of the most damaging things that any president could do to U.S. interests.”

“It would destroy 70-plus years of painstaking work across multiple administrations, Republican and Democratic, to create perhaps the most powerful and advantageous alliance in history,” Flournoy told the Times. “And it would be the wildest success that Vladimir Putin could dream of.”

Asked to comment on the report, a White House official cited Trump’s statements from July 2018 where he said the U.S.’s dedication to NATO is “very strong” but otherwise refused to provide further comment to the Times.

In the event that Trump did try to pull the U.S. out of NATO, the decision would face bipartisan opposition in Congress.

“It’s alarming that the president continues to falsely assert that NATO does not contribute to the overall safety of the United States or the international community,” Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., told the Times. “The Senate knows better and stands ready to defend NATO.”

Last year, Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., said any move by Trump to withdraw from the NATO alliance would spark unified opposition from Congress that would be historically unprecedented.

“There would be nothing more unifying that any president whether it’s Trump or pick one of the 20 people planning on running in 2020, if they were to actually seriously withdraw from NATO I think it would create a unifying event unlike anything you’ve seen in U.S. history in terms of actions that we can take,” Tillis, a leading member of the Senate’s NATO Observer Group and a member of the Armed Services Committee, said at a Washington think tank.

Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler, R-Battle Ground, right, poses with, from left, her husband Dan Beutler, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and the Beutlers' children Abigail and Ethan during a ceremonial swearing-in Jan. 3 during the opening session of the 116th Congress on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C
Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler, R-Battle Ground, and her husband, Dan Beutler, announced earlier this month that they are expecting their third child.
“Dan and I are excited to share that Abigail and Ethan will welcome a new baby sister near the end of May,” Herrera Beutler wrote in a Facebook post. “Each child is a gift and we are grateful to the Lord for blessing us with a third kiddo. It will enhance our family immeasurably, which I keep reminding myself when I find it harder and harder to tie my shoes each day.”
Herrera Beutler's first-born, Abigail, drew national attention for being the first known survivor of Potter syndrome, a congenital disease that causes an absence of amniotic fluid in utero, stunting kidney and lung development. Abigail was born without her kidneys; she received one of her father's kidneys when she was 2½.
Maternal health and access to health care, specifically for children with complex medical conditions, have since been a focal point for Herrera Beutler's legislative efforts. Her bill known as the Preventing Maternal Deaths Act, for example, was signed into law Dec. 21. The bill supports maternal mortality review committees tasked with examining pregnancy-related deaths and identifying opportunities for preventing said deaths.
Herrera Beutler just started her fifth term this month, where she's serving as the only Republican congresswoman of color.
She was also recently photographed by The New York Times for a project focused on women in Congress.
“To truly represent the American people, Congress needs more women and moms,” she said to The New York Times. “I'm expecting my third baby since I was elected to serve, and it is a privilege to offer my unique perspective as we shape policy for all American families.”
A spokeswoman for the congresswoman said she expects to remain in touch with her staff and constituents to make sure they're receiving assistance.

Rep. Steve King removed from committees after remarks

Texto completo: Iowa Republican Rep. Steve King was removed from his House committees Monday in the wake of comments he made last week about white nationalism and white supremacy.
"Leader McCarthy's decision to remove me from committees is a political decision that ignores the truth," King said in a statement Monday night.
House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy of California said Sunday he would take action after King told the New York Times: "White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?"
Many Republicans have spoken out against King's remarks, including Iowa Sens. Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst. Both had previously campaigned with King.
The decision to remove King from the judiciary, agriculture and small business committees metes out a punishment for the Kiron representative that is highly unusual but that McCarthy said is warranted.
McCarthy's office said the House Republican Steering Committee agreed to not seat King on any House committees when it issues its recommendations to assign members to committees.
"Steve's remarks are beneath the dignity of the party of Lincoln and the United States of America," McCarthy said in a statement. "His comments call into question whether he will treat all Americans equally, without regard for race and ethnicity. House Republicans are clear: We are all in this together, as fellow citizens equal before God and the law. As Congressman King's fellow citizens, let us hope and pray earnestly that this action will lead to greater reflection and ultimately change on his part."
Reports said the Republican Steering Committee unanimously decided to remove King from his committees.
"Ultimately, I told him 'You have to do what you have to do and I will do what I have to do,'" King said in a statement, apparently about his discussions with McCarthy. "I will continue to point out the truth and work with all the vigor that I have to represent 4th District Iowans for at least the next two years."
Iowans in the 4th District are used to drama around King.
Since he started representing Iowa in 2003, the conservative has faced criticism from national political figures and Iowans alike. Before the 2018 election, he faced denouncements after the Washington Post reported he met with a far-right Austrian group founded by a former Nazi SS officer following a trip funded by a Holocaust remembrance group.
But King still won the midterm election.
"My head is bloodied but unbowed," he said election night. "If they think this is going to intimidate me, they are going to find out otherwise."
Sioux Center conservative Jacob Hall said people in the district know King.
"There aren't many people left who don't have their minds made up about him," Hall said. "Barring him actually doing something, not just him saying something controversial, people aren't going to change their minds."
If you've met King, Hall said, you know that he's not a racist. But the Sioux Center Republican said he understands why there's been such backlash from national conservatives over last week's comment.
"This latest comment is the hardest one to kind of write off if you've never interacted with Steve King before," Hall said. "If you ever talk to Steve King, you understand he just kind of speaks off the cuff, he doesn't always finish one thought before starting the next thought some of the time. You can't always explain that to people."
Many 4th District voters have had conversations with King and spoken to him — which means they are less likely to be swayed by national coverage from the New York Times on King, he said.
But northwest Iowa may be ready for a different conservative to represent their district. In 2018, King won against Democrat J.D. Scholten by just over 3 percent — the closest margin he faced in years. In comparison, Gov. Kim Reynolds outperformed King by between 10.8 to 28.7 percent in 4th District counties.
State Sen. Randy Feenstra, who helped lead an effort last year to approve massive tax cuts in Iowa, said last week he'll seek the GOP nomination for King's seat. Bret Richards, an Irwin native, also announced he was joining the race.

Trump denies ever working for Russia, blasts probe

Texto completo: The Associated Press
WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump on Monday denied he ever worked for Russia against U.S. interests, addressing an extraordinary question that has haunted his presidency and shows no sign of going away.
Speaking from the South Lawn, Trump issued a flat denial: "I never worked for Russia." He blasted former FBI and Justice Department officials and repeated his claim that the investigation into his ties to Moscow is a hoax.
Trump raised eyebrows over the weekend when he didn't directly answer the Russia question in an interview with Fox News host Jeanine Pirro, a personal friend.
He was asked about a New York Times report that law enforcement officials began investigating, in 2017, whether Trump had been working on behalf of Russia against U.S. interests.
Trump said the question was "insulting," but did not directly deny it.
Monday's clear denial demonstrated the unprecedented pressure Trump faces as the special counsel's Russia investigation shows possible signs of wrapping up. After two years in office, the president is still being questioned about whether he was compromised by Russian intelligence agencies and he is still struggling to answer clearly.
White House aides expressed regret over the weekend that the president did not more clearly and forcefully deny being a Russian agent on Saturday when asked by the usually friendly Fox News host, according to three White House aides and Republicans close to the White House. The three spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss private conversations.
When Pirro asked if he had ever worked for Russia, Trump said it was "the most insulting thing I've ever been asked."
"I think it's the most insulting article I've ever had written, and if you read the article you'll see that they found absolutely nothing," he said.
Trump went on to assert that no president has taken a harder stance against Russia than he has.
"If you ask the folks in Russia, I've been tougher on Russia than anybody else, any other ... probably any other president, period, but certainly the last three or four presidents," he said.
On Monday, Trump also defended his decision to fire FBI Director James Comey, a move that has drawn Mueller's scrutiny. Trump called the Russia probe "a whole big fat hoax."
Special counsel Robert Mueller is looking into Russian election interference and whether Trump's campaign coordinated with the Russians. He also is investigating possible obstruction of justice by Trump.

GOP should decry racism, no matter who is showing it

Texto completo: What happens when immense bigotry gets lodged in a small mind? Rep. Steve King, Republican of Iowa, is what happens.
In a recent interview with The New York Times, King asked, "White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?" It is a question that could only be posed by a bigot. And because it was a rhetorical question, King was assuming that all the rest of us — all right-thinking people — are bigots as well. Shouldn’t the tie between whiteness and civilization be obvious?
As a reminder, white nationalism and supremacy — the ideology shared by Jefferson Davis, Bull Connor and, evidently, Steve King — became offensive because of centuries of stolen labor, murder and cruel abuse; because of a bloody war that one side conducted on behalf of slavery; because of repeating waves of anti-immigrant prejudice, alarmism and discrimination; because of routine lynchings and the stinging viciousness of segregation; because of the assumption that robbed, exploited and oppressed people somehow deserve social challenges resulting from robbery, exploitation and oppression.
For King, this was not a slip of the tongue, but the development of a theme. "We can’t restore our civilization with somebody else’s babies," King has argued. Those babies eventually grow up to be, in King’s words, migrant kids with "calves the size of cantaloupes because they’re hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert." This is threatening because "diversity is not our strength." In fact, it is "cultural suicide by demographic transformation." And King blames all of this on a conspiracy led by one, Semitic force: George Soros, whose money "floats in in such a way you can’t see the flow."
King has pioneered a politics of resentment for demographic change and animus for outsiders. He feeds ethnic stereotypes and conspiracy theories. He issues apocalyptic warnings: "Europe is waking up. ... Will America ... in time?" And his local supporters dismiss criticism of King as "a personality thing."
Many elected Republicans in Washington have been forthright in their criticism of King after his latest offense. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy called King’s remarks "reckless" and "wrong." Rep. Liz Cheney, of Wyoming, said King’s argument was "abhorrent and racist." To Sen. Joni Ernst, of Iowa, it was "offensive and racist." To Rep. Justin Amash, of Michigan, it was "an embrace of racism."
McCarthy has (vaguely) promised that disciplinary "action will be taken." If King is not at least censured, it will mean the House has no standards at all. And this, unfortunately, would be no surprise at all.
In their criticism of King, you get the sense that Republicans are actually relieved to be in the position of attacking racism for a change, instead of being forced to defend it from the president. They seem to be signaling that they are not really the bigots that they appear to be. Republicans seem desperate to explain that they are normal and moral, in spite of all the evidence. Attacking King reveals some sense of shame at what they have become.
Yet, in the end, Republican critics of King manage to look worse rather than better. If racism is the problem, then President Donald Trump is a worse offender. And their relative silence on Trump is a sign of hypocrisy and weakness.
Take the last days before the 2018 midterm elections. Trump closed his campaign for Republicans with a hysterical warning that brown people were invading the country. He initially suggested they should be shot. He added that he "wouldn’t be surprised" if Soros was funding the migrant caravan. This is clearly what he regards as his strongest political argument — the racist promotion of animus against outsiders, tied to pernicious conspiracy theories.
Trump feeds ethnic stereotypes of migrants as "rapists" and "murderers." He makes apocalyptic warnings that Democratic control would "turn America into Venezuela" and "totally open borders." And his supporters dismiss criticism against him as a personality thing.
Add to this Trump’s attribution of Kenyan citizenship to Barack Obama. And his sympathy for the "very fine people" attending a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville. And his attacks on African-American athletes and other figures. And his pardoning of former Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, known for racial profiling, terror raids and cruel punishment of inmates. And his attempts at a Muslim ban. And his contempt for "(expletive) countries." And ... a list far longer than I can include.
By any standard, Trump says things that are reckless, wrong, abhorrent, offensive and racist. And until Republicans can state this reality with the same clarity and intensity that they now criticize King, they will be cowards in a time crying for bravery.

7 things to watch at Senate confirmation hearing for Trump's AG pick

Resumen: William Barr's position on Robert Mueller's investigation is one of several things to watch for at his Senate hearing to become attorney general

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – The Senate Judiciary Committee will hear Tuesday from William Barr, President Donald Trump’s nominee to become attorney general. Here are seven things to watch for at the hearing:
1. Mueller investigation
Barr wrote a memo in June about Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller pursuing a possible obstruction of justice charge against Trump, arguing the probe was “fatally misconceived. ”
Senate Democrats plan to press Barr on whether he will support the Mueller probe.
“I want to make sure that (Barr) is not going to take the position that he should just protect Trump at all costs,” Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, told USA TODAY. “I want to hear from him that the attorney general’s office is an independent entity. ”
Barr said in a copy of his testimony released Monday that Mueller should be allowed to complete his work. Barr said the memo was written about a narrow obstruction-of-justice statute rather than about the special counsel's authority more broadly.
“I can assure you that, where judgments are to be made by me, I will make those judgments based solely on the law and will let no personal, political, or other improper interests influence my decision,” Barr said.

2. Trump and Russia
The FBI began not just a criminal investigation before Trump fired former FBI Director James Comey in May 2017, but a counterintelligence probe, according to a report in The New York Times.
Sen. Christopher Coons, D-Del. , said the report suggests there may have been more concerns that sparked the Mueller investigation than were publicly known at the time. Coons told reporters Monday he will focus during on whether Barr “will stand up for the rule of law and the appropriate independence of the Department of Justice.
Trump has repeatedly criticized the Mueller probe as a "witch hunt" and denied colluding with Russia to win the election.
“I never worked for Russia,” Trump said Monday. "Not only did I never work for Russia, I think it's a disgrace that you even asked that question because it's a whole big, fat hoax. "
3. Executive power
Barr, who was attorney general from November 1991 to January 1993 and earlier served as deputy attorney general and headed the Office of Legal Counsel, holds an expansive view of the president’s executive power.
In the legal counsel job, Barr wrote opinions that justified the FBI arresting fugitives overseas and the invasion of Panama and arrest of dictator Manuel Noriega. As deputy attorney general, Barr told former President George H. W. Bush he had the authority to attack Iraq without congressional approval.
Barr could face an early test of executive authority if he is confirmed because Trump has threatened to proclaim a national emergency to shift funding from other departments to build the wall along the southern border.
“I think it’s important to know what kind of judgment the attorney general nominee might provide for the president on the scope of his power," Coons said.
Sen. John Kennedy, R-La. , said he was sure Barr would be asked "about his opinion about the relationship between Justice and the other parts of the executive branch, including but not limited to the office of the presidency. "
4. Partisan clashes
The hearing comes amid significant turnover in Trump's Cabinet, with acting secretaries at the Justice, Defense, Interior departments, along with White House chief of staff and head of the Environmental Protection Agency.
The Justice Department has a role in developing administration policy over a variety of hot-button issues, including immigration and voting rights.
Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said several Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee are running for president and "have demonstrated that they will treat almost anything like a political circus. " Cruz himself is a former 2016 presidential candidate.
Coons said tensions linger from the confirmation hearing for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, which he called "one of the most divisive and charged hearings" during his eight years in the Senate. But Barr helped himself by releasing a statement that answered questions and addressed concerns, Coons said.
“It is my hope that everyone will conduct themselves in appropriate, professional ways," Coons said.
5. Criminal justice policy
Lawmakers are expected to press Barr on a criminal-justice overhaul, which in part would give judges more discretion in sentencing. His predecessor, Jeff Sessions, had been an advocate of harsh punishment, directing prosecutors to seek the toughest charges possible.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn. , said she wants to ask about department initiatives such as criminal-justice overhaul, immigration, human trafficking and opioids.
In his prepared testimony, Barr said the crime rate has fallen substantially since he last last served as attorney general in 1992, when his priority was to target violent offenders and gangs. Barr said the First Step Act, the name for the overhaul legislation, recognizes the progress made and he said he would diligently implement it.
"I believe we must keep up the pressure on chronic, violent criminals," Barr said. "We cannot allow the progress we have made to be reversed. "
6. Immigration
Barr will testify during a partial shutdown of the federal government – at more than three weeks, the longest in history. Trump and congressional Democrats are at a stalemate over immigration policy, with the president insisting on $5. 7 billion for construction of a wall along the southern border.
Barr said in his prepared testimony that immigration has been a huge benefit, but that the country couldn't accommodate many millions of people who would come from poorer countries if there were no restrictions.
"In short, in order to ensure that our immigration system works properly, we must secure our nation's borders, and we must ensure that our laws allow us to process, hold and remove those who unlawfully enter," Barr said.
7. Justice Dept. morale problems
Barr could face questions about sagging morale at the Department of Justice, which has been a target of Trump’s criticism for the past two years.
Trump fired his first attorney general, Jeff Sessions, the day after the midterm election in November after sharply criticizing him for recusing himself from the Mueller investigation. Trump has also blasted FBI repeatedly for corrupt and incompetent leadership and investigators.
Barr said in his prepared remarks that he would protect the department's integrity.
"Above all else, if confirmed, I will work diligently to protect the professionalism and integrity of the department as an institution, and I will strive to leave it, and the nation, a stronger and better place," Barr said.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump is denying he ever worked for Russia, answering a question he declined to directly address over the weekend.
Speaking from the South Lawn on Monday before departing the White House for New Orleans, Trump calls former FBI and Justice Department officials "known scoundrels" and "dirty cops." He was reacting to a New York Times report that law enforcement officials began investigating, in 2017, whether Trump had been working on behalf of Russia against U.S. interests.
Trump told reporters: "I never worked for Russia." Trump didn't directly answer the question in a Saturday Fox News interview.
Trump is defending his decision to fire FBI Director James Comey, a move that has drawn the scrutiny of special counsel Robert Mueller.

Alexander: Still an uphill battle for Chargers in L.A.

Texto completo: PROVIDENCE, R.I. — On the field, as long as you discount Sunday’s boat race against the Patriots, the 2018 season was an unqualified success for the Chargers. A 12-4 regular season, one playoff win, and a core of young, talented players suggest a bright future.
On the streets and in the boardrooms and living rooms of L.A., do people care?
The overnight TV ratings for Sunday’s Divisional Round playoff game in Foxborough were down slightly nationally (19.2), despite huge numbers in the Boston market. In L.A., the game drew a 17.2 rating. In San Diego it drew a 29.7, underlining the fact that it remains the home of the only group of football fans who still truly care about this franchise.
(I mean, hating is caring, right?)
This is, as we have been constantly told, a long-term play for the Chargers in Los Angeles. Playing in the recently renamed 28,000-seat soccer stadium in Carson was meant to transition the franchise into the market while building an audience and selling seat licenses for their tenancy in the stadium that Rams owner Stan Kroenke is building in Inglewood.
We are now two years into this adventure and there’s no going back. Dean Spanos told the New York Times last week, “There’s no doubt we are the Los Angeles Chargers. Los Angeles is our home.”
They’ve sold some seat licenses for the StanleyDome, shrewdly offering them for as little as $100 with the idea of ultimately positioning themselves as the people’s team.
Anecdotal evidence, though, suggests few people are buying it. How often do you see people wearing Chargers gear in public, for instance, compared to the number of people wearing Rams gear?
L.A. is an incredibly competitive sports market, and it takes time to create a niche. The Chargers had the misfortune of coming in a year after the Rams and their pre-existing history and legacy in L.A. They may still be digging out from the 0-4 start in their inaugural L.A. season, in terms of public perception.
Yes, winning does matter. But the Chargers’ success came the same season that the Rams were just a little bit hotter. And with the Chargers done, guess who has the L.A. football stage all to itself this week?
Whether the Spanos family likes it or not, this is still perceived in many quarters as a franchise that belongs to, and in, San Diego. Even now, two years in, the Lyft driver in Baltimore, the radio/podcast commentator in Cleveland, the occasional referee announcing a penalty and observers throughout the country still refer to the team as “San Diego.”
(Then again, during the wild card game in Baltimore last week referee Clete Blakeman slipped and declared that “San Francisco is charged with its first timeout” after an unsuccessful Chargers challenge. Yeah, we know, all those California teams are interchangeable.)
Consider this, going back to TV ratings: For much of the season, the Chargers’ L.A. ratings were in single digits and significantly trailed those in its former home. The Baltimore game last Sunday drew an 18.0 rating and 43 share in Los Angeles, a significant improvement … but in San Diego, split between those who still love the team and those who despise Spanos, the game drew a 30.7 rating and 60 share. Sunday against the Patriots was pretty much more of the same.
The ratings figure is deceptive, of course, because of the difference between a point in No. 29 market San Diego (10,028 homes, as measured by Nielsen) and No. 2 L.A. (53,186). Translated, 914,799 households in L.A. had the Patriots-Chargers game on, compared to 297,832 in San Diego.
Numbers can be crunched. Passion is harder to measure.
The San Diego Union-Tribune sent a reporter to New England this past weekend. San Diego TV people show up at home games and midweek availability in Costa Mesa. And there seems to be a constant debate in San Diego over how much that city’s media should pay attention to the city’s former team. Meanwhile, in L.A. it is one team among many and simply fighting for attention.
That shouldn’t be surprising at all. When this team played in San Diego, I had always maintained that with its low national profile, the only people who really, really cared about the Chargers resided in San Diego County, plus parts of Orange and Riverside counties. Even now, I’m convinced that the majority of those who are Charger fans are holdovers from the San Diego era.
The guy in the middle of all of this? Philip Rivers, who is still a San Diego resident and commutes to practices in Costa Mesa in a chauffeured SUV that has been converted into a rolling film room.
“San Diego will always be special for me and for many of us,” the quarterback said last week. “I’m not out and about very much this time of year, but I think … I don’t know the best way to say it. You hope that some of those fans can be happy and excited for the team they cheered for. And I know many others may not.
“And, you know, that’s a hard decision and position to be in. But certainly, you know, the people I run into have always been very supportive.”
Meanwhile, we know it’s a long-term project in a tough market. But at some point the audience size has to grow significantly, right?

Chris Christie: Trump should 'embrace' New York Times report on counterintelligence investigation

Texto completo: Chris Christie, the former Republican New Jersey governor and 2016 Trump campaign surrogate, on Sunday offered President Trump some advice: Don't push back on the New York Times.

The New York Times reported last week that Trump was secretly investigated by the FBI after he fired FBI Director James Comey in May 2017 on the suspicion that the president may have been working for Russia. In response to news of the bureau's counterintelligence investigation, which was wrapped into special counsel Robert Mueller's federal Russia inquiry, Trump's top spokeswoman Sarah Sanders called the report "absurd."

Christie offered an alternative way to react.

"On the New York Times story, I would say this. If I were the president, I'd embrace the story because it backs up his narrative. His narrative is that FBI agents were acting in a rogue manner, overstepping the normal course of business because they had something against him," Christie said on ABC News' "This Week" program. "So if I were him, I wouldn't be tweeting about the 'Failing New York Times,' and how bad the story is, and how insulted he is to be accused of that. I'd go the opposite tack and say, 'Wait a second, this is what I've been saying all along, the FBI under Jim Comey was out of control.'"

Trump did send out a tweet storm following the Times report, calling the outlet the "Failing New York Times," but he also pointed out that the report helps make his case that "corrupt former leaders of the FBI, almost all fired or forced to leave the agency for some very bad reasons, opened up an investigation on me, for no reason & with no proof, after I fired Lyin’ James Comey, a total sleaze!"

Christie also said Sunday that skittish Democrats had no reason to fear William Barr, Trump's pick to become the next leader of the Justice Department, ahead of Barr's Senate confirmation hearings.

"I think what they are going to find about Bill Barr is Bill Barr is a standard-issue, Washington, D.C., inside lawyer, and what that means is he's going to oversee Bob Mueller and let Bob Mueller come to the conclusion he needs to come to and let him issue his report publicly, and he won't do anything different in my view," he told "This Week."

Barr, who has been openly critical of Mueller's Russia probe, is set to face the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday and Wednesday.

For a diverse new generation, poetry is a 'growth industry'

Texto completo: People are clicking on poetry on Twitter. They're listening to poems on podcasts. They're buying poetry collections on Amazon.
But on Monday night in St. Paul, they were hearing poetry in person. A diverse, mostly 20-something crowd snapped and purred as friends and strangers read their verses from Park Square Theatre's lower stage during Button Poetry's monthly slam poetry competition.
Many were drawn here by YouTube. (Button's YouTube channel boasts more than a million followers.) By Instagram. By the changing world of poetry.
"We're seeing astronomical growth," said Sam Van Cook, who founded Button, a Minneapolis-based company that straddles poetry's in-person and online worlds. "Friends who work in book sales … we joke that for the first time in any of our lives, poetry is a growth industry."
More people -- especially young people -- are reading and buying poetry. About 12 percent of adults read poetry in the past year, a bump of 5 percentage points over 2012 and a 15-year high, according to a new survey by the National Endowment for the Arts. Sales of poetry books have swelled over that time, according to NPD BookScan, which tracks book sales in the U.S., "making it one of the fastest growing categories in publishing."
Social media are driving the trend. Among the top 20 bestselling poetry authors in 2017 were a dozen so-called "Instapoets," who attract readers by sharing short, photogenic verse on Instagram and Twitter. Their queen is Rupi Kaur, an Indian-born Canadian poet who boasts 3.4 million Instagram followers, sells out theaters and claps back at her detractors.
But poets published by traditional presses and praised by critics use those platforms, too, sharing one another's work and changing the notion of a poet as an old white dude. Minnesotans Danez Smith and Hieu Minh Nguyen are among those sharing new and "b-side" poems on Twitter, letting their thousands of followers in on whom they're crushing on, poetry-wise and otherwise.
"There's a myth around who a poet can be -- or who can be a poet," Nguyen said by phone. "People are seeing that those archetypes, those barriers, aren't true."
'Poetry tells the truth'
As the slate of bards becomes more diverse, so do their audiences. Some of the biggest gains in that NEA Survey of Public Participation in the Arts, released last year, came from people of color. About 15 percent of African-Americans reported reading poetry, up from 7 percent in 2012. Some 13 percent of Asian-Americans had read poetry in the past year, compared with 5 percent in 2012.
Minnesota-based Vietnamese-American poet Bao Phi compared it to the shift in Hollywood, where "we've seen that representation can actually pay out huge dividends."
For decades, many marginalized people have hustled to diversify the slate of poets performing and publishing, especially by connecting with students and young people, said Phi, who crafted his reputation as a spoken word artist in the 1990s. Performance-based poetry finally shed some of the form's chauvinism. Spoken word artists broke through the glass ceiling of publishing. (Phi didn't publish his first poetry collection, "S´ng I Sing," until 2011.)
"This didn't happen overnight," Phi said. "All that work adds up to what we're seeing now."
In these poets' hands, the form is well suited to take on big, knotty topics and complex, collective grief, editors argue.
Erika Stevens, poetry editor at large for the Minneapolis-based nonprofit Coffee House Press, pointed to "Indecency," by Justin Phillip Reed, which tackles white supremacy with intimate, sometimes confrontational poems. Last year, that collection, published by Coffee House, won the National Book Award in poetry, showing "how far the institutions have come in terms of what they recognize as innovative and groundbreaking and worthy of award attention," Stevens said.
U.S. poet laureate Tracy K. Smith recently wrote in the New York Times about why "political poetry is hot again," arguing that poetry "has become a means of owning up to the complexity of our problems."
Stevens said, "I don't know if you can divorce the current movement in poetry from the current politics in our country. Poetry tells the truth -- in very specific and unflinching ways.
"And now more than ever, we have a need for the truth."
'A little less magnificent'
As a theater kid at Central High School in St. Paul, Nguyen fell in love with poetry as he was performing it. He and his friends did spoken word at slams starting his freshman year. "It wasn't like I was the weird kid reading poetry books alone at lunch," Nguyen said by phone recently. "Poetry has never been this … lone venture. I wasn't strange or different for reading or liking poetry."
(Novels came later, he said. "I was able to scam my way through grade school without reading a single book. Poetry taught me how to read.")
So he appreciates that the literature industry, which "treats poetry as if nobody reads it," is now acknowledging its popularity. The internet and social media allow would-be fans to explore poetry beyond what they were taught in high school, he said, to encounter storytelling "they actually resonate with."
Poets and readers have debated the success of Kaur, who turned a viral Instagram post into bestselling books, a tour and, now, printed canvases. A recent poem, paired with a pen drawing, nabbed more than 200,000 likes: "i am water/soft enough/to offer life/tough enough/ to drown it away."
Whether Kaur's hugely popular poetry is "for me or not is not the question," said Van Cook, of Button Poetry. "But I can tell you, if I talk to people about poetry at a wedding or a coffee shop, people -- especially young women, women of color -- she's one of the first names on their lips." Those young women recognize themselves in her work and find solace in her books, he said.
Van Cook founded Button because he believes poetry is "most vibrant read aloud, and read by someone who loves it." Its YouTube videos of readings by well- and lesser known poets often amass tens of thousands of views.
Composers talk about how film took classical music, which was being relegated to the sidelines, and gave it a new, more prominent home, he said. "People are going to look back and talk about social media that way for poetry," Van Cook predicted. "What poetry needed was to be a little less magnificent."
At "Button Poetry Live" on Monday night, a few newbies and some spoken word veterans took the stage, reading from iPhones and journals and memory. Many of their poems grappled with tough topics: micro-aggressions, breakups, coming out. Then, the special guest took the stage: poet, performer and podcast host Franny Choi. For one poem, titled @fannychoir for her Twitter handle, she took racist, misogynistic tweets and Google-translated them into other languages and then back again, to English.
In short, she garbled their words and made them hers.
"Mrs. Great Anime Pornography, the fruit of the field," she began with a smirk.
Outside the theater, three friends in their 20s perused Choi's chapbooks, selling for $12 and $15. They started attending Button's live events after hearing about them from a friend, finding them to be an inexpensive, fulfilling way to spend a night together.
"It's thought-provoking," said Katie Snell, 26, of Minneapolis. "I cried." Snell owns "Milk and Honey," a book of Kaur's poetry, she said. But that wasn't her introduction to the form.
Years back, she said, she came across a book of sonnets at a used-book store and brought it home.

Texto completo: As a percentage of its population, Iowa sent more troops to fight in the Civil War than any other state. Iowans fought on the side of the Union against the Confederate South. Abraham Lincoln, the president of the United States and the commander in chief of Union forces, was the first Republican president.
So it seems odd (to me, at least) that a Republican congressman from Iowa would display a Confederate flag on his desk. But that's what Rep. Steve King did as recently as 2016. (He removed it only after it was revealed that a cop killer had waved a Confederate flag at an Iowa high school football game.)
I'm not one of those people who think everyone who displays a Confederate flag is necessarily a racist or a bigot. But I usually reserve the benefit of the doubt for actual Southerners who are nodding to tradition or nostalgia.
If there's one thing King has not earned it's the benefit of the doubt. Even accounting for an IQ that seems to be in conflict with the idea that white people are superior, the man understands what he's up to.
In an interview with the New York Times published Thursday, King asked: "White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization - how did that language become offensive? Why did I sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our history and our civilization?"
The obvious answer is because he needed an education - and still does.
Contrary to the prattle of white nationalists and supremacists (and, interestingly, various left-wing theorists and black nationalists such as Louis Farrakhan), Western civilization is not synonymous with whiteness. Many of the people King would count as white today were not considered white by various giants of American white nationalism and white supremacy. Czechs, Hungarians, Poles, Italians, Greeks et al. weren't "whites" at the beginning of the 20th century, when the Steve Kings of that era were terrified of non-white immigrants.
Among the best ideas and ideals of Western, Christian and, most importantly, American civilization is that we are supposed to judge people on their individual merits, not keep score based on their ancestry.
This vision was central to the creation of the Republican Party, which is why it's so dismaying that Rep. King calls himself one.

Texto completo: "He was a Crooked Cop who is being totally protected
by his best friend, Bob Mueller, & the 13 Angry Democrats..."
President Donald Trump, on James Comey
President Donald Trump, in response to reports that the FBI began an investigation of him last year to find out whether he had a clandestine agenda to help Russia, said Saturday that former FBI Director James Comey and other "losers" at the bureau "tried to do a number on your President."
He called Comey a "total sleaze" and "crooked cop." The president also took swipes at special counsel Robert Mueller and T he New York Times, which broke the story Friday night. "My firing of James Comey was a great day for America," he tweeted.
Comey responded Saturday morning in a tweet that quoted President Franklin D. Roosevelt: "I ask you to judge me by the enemies I have made."
The newspaper said the decision to investigate Trump himself was an aggressive move by FBI officials confronting the chaotic aftermath of the firing of Comey and enduring the president's verbal assaults on the Russia investigation as a "witch hunt."
CNN reported that counterintelligence agents were investigating why Trump was acting in ways that seemed to benefit Russia.
Both news organizations said Trump's firing of Comey was a major factor prompting the FBI to take action.
Although the report was published Friday night and prompted a sharp response from White House press secretary Sarah Sanders, Trump did not weigh in until 7:05 a.m Saturday.
"Wow, just learned in the Failing New York Times that the corrupt former leaders of the FBI, almost all fired or forced to leave the agency for some very bad reasons, opened up an investigation on me, for no reason & with no proof, after I fired Lyin' James Comey, a total sleaze!
In a series of tweets, he said the FBI was in "complete turmoil" at the time because of Comey's "poor leadership" and his handling of an investigation of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.
"My firing of James Comey was a great day for America," Trump tweeted. "He was a Crooked Cop who is being totally protected by his best friend, Bob Mueller, & the 13 Angry Democrats..."
He singled out several FBI agents in his five-part tweetstorm.
"Lyin' James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter S and his lover, agent Lisa Page, & more, all disgraced and/or fired and caught in the act. These are just some of the losers that tried to do a number on your President," he tweeted. "Part of the Witch Hunt. Remember the 'insurance policy?' This is it!"
Trump was referring to charges that some FBI agents, among them McCabe, Peter Strzok and Page, a colleague Strzok was intimately involved with, were part of a conspiracy to undermine the president.
Addressing the Russia aspect of the Times report, Trump said he had been "FAR tougher on Russia than Obama, Bush or Clinton. Maybe tougher than any other President."
He repeated his long-held contention that "getting along with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing."
Sanders said in her statement Friday night that Comey was fired for just cause and that Trump has never favored Russia.
"This is absurd. James Comey was fired because he's a disgraced partisan hack, and his Deputy Andrew McCabe, who was in charge at the time, is a known liar fired by the FBI. Unlike President Obama, who let Russia and other foreign adversaries push America around, President Trump has actually been tough on Russia."
The obstruction probe was an idea the FBI had previously considered, but it didn't start until Comey was fired, CNN reported. The justification went beyond Trump's firing of Comey, CNN said, according to its sources, and included the president's conversation with Comey in the Oval Office asking him to drop the investigation into his former national security adviser Michael Flynn.
Trump insisted last year that he didn't fire Comey because of the Russia investigation, despite video and documentary evidence to the contrary, including an interview with NBC News.
"I was going to fire Comey knowing there was no good time to do it," he told NBC anchor Lester Holt. "And in fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself — I said, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story. It's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should've won."
"Not that it matters but I never fired James Comey because of Russia!" Trump tweeted shortly after the firing. "The Corrupt Mainstream Media loves to keep pushing that narrative, but they know it is not true!"
The FBI director's firing is central to an obstruction of justice investigation being conducted by Mueller, who is also looking into Russian attempts to influence the 2016 election ito help Trump.
"He was a Crooked Cop who is being totally protected
by his best friend, Bob Mueller, & the 13 Angry Democrats..."

Texto completo: Global warming isn't only cooking our atmosphere, it's also heating up the oceans.
The world's seas were the warmest on record in 2018, scientists announced last week. Also, ocean temperatures are rising faster than previously thought, a new paper said.
Specifically, they're warming as much as 40 percent faster than an estimate from a United Nations panel just five years ago.
"If you want to see where global warming is happening, look in our oceans," paper co-author Zeke Hausfather said in a statement. "Ocean heating is a very important indicator of climate change, and we have robust evidence that it is warming more rapidly than we thought," said Hausfather, a climate scientist with Carbon Brief, a British-based website that covers climate science news.
He also said that while 2018 was the fourth-warmest year on record in the atmosphere, it was the warmest year on record in the oceans, as was 2017 and 2016 before that. In fact, Hausfather told Reuters, records for ocean warming have been broken almost yearly since 2000.
Overall, while we're rightly concerned about what climate change is doing to our atmosphere, ocean heating is critical because an estimated 93 percent of all heat trapped by greenhouse gases settles in the world's oceans.
Global warming is caused by humanity's burning of fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal, which release greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane into the earth's atmosphere and oceans.
"Global warming is here, and has major consequences already. There is no doubt, none!" the paper's authors wrote.
The analysis also shows that trends in ocean heat content match those predicted by top computer models.
Laure Zanna, an associate professor of climate physics at the University of Oxford who was not involved in the study, told The New York Times that the research was "a very nice summary of what we know of the ocean and how far the new estimates have come together."
The unusual warmth in the seas is harming marine life and coral reefs. It's also contributing to rising sea levels around the world as ice melts near Antarctica and Greenland.
The research was published Thursday in a "Perspectives" paper in the peer-reviewed journal Science.

Gun deaths soar to record 'American carnage'

Texto completo: When President Donald Trump invoked the term "American carnage" in his inaugural address, he wasn't referring to gun violence, but the label undeniably fits: Record numbers of Americans are killing themselves or each other with firearms.
During the first year of Trump's presidency, guns were used to kill 39,773 Americans, the greatest number of such deaths since the government began tracking them in 1979, according to a recent report from federal health officials. Suicides made up more than half the total.
A United States awash in firearms, approximately one for every resident, continues to lead the world in gun-related homicides at a rate four to 16 times higher than any other advanced nation.
Two of the five worst mass shootings in recent U.S. history occurred in 2017, including in Las Vegas where a gunman barricaded in a high-rise hotel slaughtered 58 people at a music concert below. Mass killings kept happening last year: at a high school in Parkland, Florida; another school in Santa Fe, Texas; a synagogue in Pittsburgh; and a bar in Thousand Oaks, California. Then, of course, there was the daily toll of less-publicized shootings and self-inflicted fatalities.
Even with Democrats taking power in the House, relying on Congress to do anything about this growing national health crisis seems a distant dream, particularly given the power of the national gun lobby and continued Republican control of the Senate and White House.
The good news is that after the Parkland shooting, more than half the states enacted new restrictions on firearms. Absent new federal gun-control legislation, here are three ideas to staunch the killing:
More states could follow Massachusetts' lead and require an identification card to purchase rifles or shotguns and a license to buy handguns. The restrictions go further than federal background checks. Applicants pay a $100 fee and are photographed, fingerprinted and interviewed, and they take a gun safety course. Licensing extends to private sales, negating the so-called gun-show loophole. Finally, police can deny a handgun license to an applicant deemed a public threat.
It's surely no coincidence that Massachusetts boasts the lowest gun-death rate in the nation at 3.4 per 100,000.
Financial institutions could alert authorities to highly unusual credit card activity related to purchasing guns and ammunition. A New York Times analysis of 13 mass shootings during the past decade revealed that in at least eight cases, killers racked up thousands of dollars on credit cards buying firearms and ammo, often where they couldn't otherwise have afforded the arsenal.
Slightly more than half of suicides in America are committed with a firearm. More states could adopt "red flag" laws that allow families, often in voluntary cooperation with the relative who is suicidal, to obtain a temporary court order for seizing that person's firearm for a limited period of time until the crisis passes. The order would also prevent that person from purchasing a gun during the same period. Thirteen states have such laws.
Despite the disconnect between the majority of Americans who want sensible gun control and a Congress that does nothing about it, headway is possible through the states and by pressuring commercial businesses such as banks. American carnage doesn't have to be a tragedy without end.

Texto completo: ‘I can relate,” vowed Donald Trump early last week when he went on television to address the loss of income being involuntarily suffered by likely millions of American workers and their families when the government shutdown entered its third week.

“I'm sure that the people on the receiving end will make adjustments. They always do,” he added. “Many of those people who won't be receiving a paycheck ... agree 100 percent with what I'm doing.”
On Friday, as I write, Trump added reassurances to federal employees that “it's for a good cause” and they should “hang in.”
But, interestingly, what the Washington Post calls Trump's “go-to arsenal of bluster, falsehoods, threats and theatrics” isn't working. The shutdown is now beginning its fourth week, the longest such government shutdown in American history. And for our president to say he “relates” is just so much poppycock. Either our president is delusional – or he's lying through his teeth.
I opt for the latter.
Donald Trump doesn't – and can't possibly – “relate” to working people who are now going without paychecks. Who will apparently, thanks to him, continue to be without them in the immediate future.
And I seriously doubt his contention that many of those payless, struggling Americans agree with whatever he thinks he's doing. Not when the choice is between the president's obsession with an ill-defined “wall” on our southern border and their paychecks.
A wall, let us remember, Trump now demands that American taxpayers pay for, despite his repeated campaign pledges that any wall would be wholly paid for by Mexico. And to build that wall he has decided to hold hostage innocent Americans who have nothing whatsoever to do with that wall.
Apparently Trump – as he has never ceased reminding us during and since his presidential campaign – is a billionaire and as such need not be consistent. “Part of the beauty of me is that I'm very rich,” he repeatedly bragged during his campaign.
He doesn't really understand or care about the struggles of others because he is a man who has never known want – not even for a nanosecond, much less for a day – in his life.
He's the son of wealth, his path paved by the largesse of his doting real estate developer father, Fred Trump, who in his lifetime – as the New York Times last year documented in an exhaustively researched exploration of Trump's career – contributed today's equivalent of at least $413 million to son Donald's often failing businesses.
The younger Trump has been on a glide path since the day he was born. A man notable for his lack of empathy, he cannot possibly “relate” to those with little or nothing.
As I write this, about 800,000 federal employees are without paychecks. More than half are still working, albeit without pay, and the rest are at home and scrambling to figure out how they can pick up quick cash while they wait – hope – to go back to work.
They, at least, may be paid when, eventually, the government reopens.
Hundreds of thousands more people – contractors, cleaners, small-business owners and local merchants who aren't federal employees but whose jobs depend on an open, functioning government – are also going payless. And most of those people will never be compensated for this gratuitously cruel closure.
But Trump – the man who started this whole mess, the president who bragged that he “relates” – doesn't care.
He told us so on Dec. 21, when he sat down with congressional Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, who wanted to forestall a government shutdown over illegal immigration.
“I am proud to shut down the government for border security, Chuck,” Trump told them. “I will take the mantle. I will be the one to shut it down. I'm not going to blame you for it.”
Now, of course, he does not want to “take the mantle” for the shutdown. And he does want to blame the Democrats.
But he made it evident then, in December, that he was eager for a shutdown, perhaps to divert attention from his other cascading woes, from the anticipated report of Special Counsel Robert Mueller to the unraveling of international alliances that responsible leaders of this country have carefully built and maintained over the last 70 years.
Now, we are told by the man occupying our Oval Office, he'd happily let this pernicious shutdown continue “for months or even years.”
The next casualty of the impasse? According to the Department of Agriculture, the availability of food stamps in the near future is in doubt. More than 39 million people, most women and children, depend on food stamps to eat.
The protracted shutdown ensures that more and more people will find themselves choosing between food and shelter. Promises won't pay mortgages or rent, despite what Trump says.
A week ago in the White House Rose Garden Trump assured reporters that “as a landlord” he knows landlords view people with hardships with sympathy. “When you see their problems, their difficulties out there, landlords work with the people,” he said.
Again, blather and nonsense. Both Trump and his father were notorious for their determination, using dubious tax schemes and shadow corporations, to soak their tenants for every penny, as the New York Times investigation amply proved.
Now Trump talks of declaring a rare national emergency to build his wall with taxpayer money and without congressional approval. And so the impasse continues ...
Meanwhile, according to the Washington Post, an official Coast Guard support group offered a tip sheet suggesting that Coast Guard families who found themselves short of funds during the shutdown could consider holding garage sales, baby-sitting, dog-walking or serving as “mystery shoppers.”
Bankruptcy, it suggested, is only a “last option.”
Cheerfully, it said, families can “stay in charge by getting a clear understanding of what's happening.”
Well, at least that's reassuring.

Texto completo: By my third visit to a new client's house, her health had started to visibly plummet. "The cancer doesn't give me much time," she'd drop into our conversation, her shoulders slumping. No response ever felt right, so I mirrored her sage nods, agreeing with her in a grievous way. Yet her shirts were still starched.
I'd been working as a maid for six months by then, scrambling to support myself and my daughter, Mia, who was about to turn 3. My schedule was sparse, but varied, and one I'd accepted gratefully after handing out countless résumés in the small Skagit Valley farming community where we lived, north of Seattle.
The job paid $9 an hour, and the service I worked for required us to get down on our knees and scrub toilets by hand. No toilet brushes, just powdered cleaner, gloves and a rag. This was not the work I had envisioned myself doing at age 32. I had plans to drift off to college, maybe become a writer. But it was work I could do, that I could be paid to do, that let me fill the gas tank, barely pay our $550-a-month rent, and survive off the $200 or so a month in food stamps we received to pay for our groceries.
Usually my clients weren't home while I was working. But I liked it when they were, and when they made eye contact. That made me feel as though I wasn't some ghost drifting into their lives to polish them up and make them perfect before going home to the small studio apartment I could barely afford to keep.
This new client's house was so clean by the time I arrived that I was confused about why she paid to have me work there. Sometimes, after I finished cleaning the kitchen, she made me lunch, insisting that I sit with her at the dining room table. We'd tell stories about our children while we ate tuna sandwiches on white bread, cut into triangles, with carrot sticks on the side. She served instant coffee that we'd sip out of teacups, with cream and sugar packets, and a silver spoon for stirring. It felt like tea parties I'd pretended to have with my grandma when I was a child, and I told her so. She smiled, then waved her hand to brush it off. "It's good to use the fancy teacups while you still can," she said.
Her house was, compared with my others, easy. I wiped down the counters, cupboards and floor; dusted and vacuumed; and cleaned the half-bathroom downstairs. Despite her illness, she insisted on doing the one upstairs herself.
One afternoon, we got to talking and she motioned for me to follow her upstairs, past the mechanical seat she used on her "bad days," as she called them. I hadn't been upstairs, except once or twice to vacuum the stairs. When she opened the door to the guest bedroom, light flooded into the hallway.
Dozens of shoe boxes, plastic containers and rubber bins lined the walls. There were more containers balanced in stacks on top of the bed. She sighed.
"I've been trying to sort things into piles of what goes where," she said. "Because of the cancer." I nodded and looked at everything she had been doing. "Most of the things for my son are in the garage -- the tools and all of that. But my nieces and nephews and their children will want a lot of this." I admired her as she pointed to the piles, telling me what would be given to whom. In my time working as a maid, I'd seen various decluttering projects -- garages parceled out in preparation for yard sales or downsizing. But this wasn't the same kind of project. This was an afterlife project.
I'm not sure whether this woman knew how much time she had left to live, but if she did, she never told me. She hired me to do extra work, beyond what she had contracted with the cleaning service, during July. That was how Mia and I survived some unexpected moving expenses and a $300 car repair that would otherwise have sent me spiraling. I picked her weeds, sorted piles and deep-cleaned areas of her house to save her family from having to do it all after her death.
She couldn't have known how much I needed the additional income and that by hiring me to help end her life she gave me a way to survive mine. My work schedule was so unpredictable that I couldn't apply for a second job, even though I badly needed more income. I had to scramble for ways to supplement it on my own.
After I did extra work for the woman who was ill, I started asking a few other clients if they needed some, too, noticing unkempt areas of their house or yards that weren't on my list. Some offered to pay me for additional work during those months, and there was steady interest in an ad that I'd posted on Craigslist:
I work 25 hours a week as a professional cleaner, but it's not enough to pay the bills.
Most of the other housecleaning ads seemed to be husband-and-wife teams who had trucks for clearing out clutter to take to the dump. A few were full-fledged businesses: licensed and insured, and with employees to juggle bigger jobs. I didn't think my ad would stand out, but I got a half-dozen calls every time I posted a new variation.
One woman hired me to clean out her rental property before the next tenant moved in. The apartment was grimy but not horrible, and during the walk-through she admitted that she'd never hired a cleaner before. She wanted me to clean out the oven and fridge but not the blinds. I tried to estimate how long it would take me, but I had come to the walk-through with Mia balanced on my hip, and it was hard to get a good look at the space.
"Four or five hours?" I guessed.
"Oh, I just figured I'd give you a hundred dollars," she said as we stood in the hallway. Then she handed me a wad of cash. I looked at her for a second, unsure of what to do. It was more than I had been paid for any individual cleaning job. She motioned for me to take the money. "I liked your ad," she said. "I remember what it's like, to struggle when you have someone who depends on you." She looked at Mia, who, growing timid from the eye contact, pressed her head into my shoulder.
"Thank you," I said, trying to suppress the feeling that I was getting away with something. "You won't be disappointed."
After I strapped Mia into her car seat, I sat behind the wheel, staring at the dashboard. I'm doing it, I thought to myself. I'm really doing it! I turned around to look at my daughter. It had been a long time since she'd had a special dinner. "Do you want a Happy Meal?" I asked. The wad of cash bulged in my pocket. Pride swelled in my chest. Mia's face lit up, and she threw up her arms. "Yay!" she yelled from the back seat. I laughed, blinking back a few tears, and yelled out for joy, too.

This Fiasco Really Took A Village

Texto completo: In a famous medical study, two doctors traced a chain of errors that brought the wrong patient, a "Mrs. Morris," to an operating room for an invasive heart procedure that she did not want, did not need and that no one had actually ordered for her.
It turned out that 17 separate mistakes were made before anyone realized that the wrong woman was on the table. Thankfully, Mrs. Morris was not harmed. The doctors said it was an "organizational accident," meaning that one person could not have done it alone. Sticking tubes into the wrong person's heart required mess-ups by many people.
One day, Mrs. Morris may be joined in the great case studies of near blunders by New York's L train fiasco. This one took a team of people, too.
Right after the New Year, Gov. Andrew Cuomo made the startling announcement that New York City's L subway line, whose East River tunnel was damaged by Hurricane Sandy in 2012, could remain in service while fixes were carried out.
Talk about whipsaw changes. In April, the line was to stop serving Manhattan for 15 months so the repairs could be made in the river tunnel. Its users had spent two years planning alternative routes and, in some cases, finding new places to live. They are just a fraction of the city's subway riders, up to 300,000 people a day. But that's more than the ridership of most mass transit systems in the country.
Losing L service for more than a year was a big, disruptive deal. But there was no way around it -- or so the public had been told, over and over.
Now, it seems almost certain, that was a mistake. A team of academic engineers brought in by the governor last month devised a suite of repairs that they say would return the tunnel to a long-term safe condition with minimal closings. The academics collaborated with the government and consulting engineers who had come up with the original plan.
Their approach has been criticized in general terms by two former officials of the agency who had roles in the first plan, saying that the new one would be neither as safe nor as built to last as the original. They have identified no specific risks, and when you drill into the details, it is hard to see where the latest plan falls short.
Jerry Jannetti is a senior vice president at WSP, the consulting firm that has worked on the project since 2013 for New York City Transit, which operates the city's subways as part of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. If Mr. Jannetti personally owned and operated the tunnel, would he prefer his firm's original plan, or the one that emerged last month?
"I would choose the way we are moving forward now," Mr. Jannetti said.
Which leads us to the next question: If the planned new repairs would be as safe and durable without requiring closing the line, why didn't anyone think of them before? Shouldn't someone downstream of the governor have thought to bring in outside experts for a fresh look, given the disruptive stakes?
Some people are skeptical about this new plan, in fact, precisely because it was driven by Governor Cuomo. That's good. Without skepticism, society collapses. But this entire episode illustrates a failure to be skeptical. And it shows us the risks of ignoring what it means to fail, at scale, in a booming city that grows every month. It didn't have to be the governor asking for a better way. But no one else did.
Until then, the new array of repairs had not been considered by the in-house engineers at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the WSP consultants or others involved in the project. Andy Byford, the president of New York City Transit, said he was conducting an independent review of the plan and would not sign on unless he was convinced of its safety and durability. That said, he is enthusiastic about its prospects. "I own the risk," Mr. Byford said. "I am the president, the accountable person. This is my job."
Anyone on the M.T.A. board could have demanded alternatives. Mr. Cuomo appoints six of the 14 voting members, and by force of personality, he has driven a number of projects, including this one -- at the last minute -- and pushing construction of the Second Avenue line.
You can find representatives of eight other public officials on the authority's board, including the mayor of New York. Even more power is held by a virtually unknown committee of four, any one of whom can veto the entire capital budget. On this committee are the speaker of the State Assembly, the State Senate majority leader, the mayor and the governor.
Typically, that awesome power has not been used for actual oversight -- asking questions! -- but for horse trading. So one legislator hinted at a veto if political cronies were not given state judgeships. And in an infamous episode, an Assembly speaker, Sheldon N. Silver, demanded that a pet project be funded to a satisfactorily boondoggle-ish level, pointedly mentioning that he would soon be looking at the capital budget.
"I will expect to see the Fulton Street Transit Center fully funded, complete and at a scale that at least resembles what was repeatedly promised," Mr. Silver wrote in 2008. He got his way. The price for fixing that one station hit $1.4 billion, more than the entire annual budget of the Chicago transit system at the time.
There are legislative oversight committees for mass transit in the City Council, the State Senate and the State Assembly. No one asked the fundamental question about finding another way.
The price of all these people being in charge is that no one owns the work.
In all walks of life -- engineering, politics, transportation -- there is a fine line between the earned wisdom of experience and the toxic self-regard of a credentialed rut. (That goes for journalism, too. For most of the time the L train shutdown was in the air, I was writing a column in the New York section of The Times. No one stopped me from asking questions. I just didn't.)
The L train's East River tunnel -- "still pretty darned good at 100 years old," Mr. Jannetti said -- was built under the supervision of the master engineer Clifford Holland starting in 1916. It was part of the surge of transit construction during the first decades of the 20th century that shaped modern New York into the nation's largest city.
New York's mass transit system stopped expanding in 1940, and it has even shrunk since then. The city's population has grown by about 1.5 million since 1990 and may only be choked off by frail transportation. The M.T.A. has proved itself one of the world's most effective garrotes.
The agency was created a half-century ago to build, among other things, the Second Avenue subway (still unfinished) and a new tunnel for the Long Island Rail Road into Grand Central (the tunnel was finished in 1989 but the connection into Grand Central is years away). In 2002, the chairman of the agency announced a series of streamlining reforms. Today, there are about 10,000 more employees and less actual service. The Regional Plan Association proposed dismantling pieces of the agency. Maybe it should go into the portfolio of the governor or the mayor. To some one, at least -- not everyone.
Mrs. Morris landed on an operating table for a procedure that she didn't want or need, and that no one had ordered for her. New York City wound up being prepped for a different kind of surgery that it surely did not want or need. This organizational accident took a lot more than 17 errors.

Texto completo: After the initial shock of my dad's death wore off, I found myself glued to Google. I Googled how long it takes for a body to decompose (you don't want to know). I Googled the symptoms of grief (depression, loss of appetite, insomnia). I even Googled how many people get killed by falling coconuts each year. (I read somewhere that it's 150 worldwide, but that could be an urban legend.) I don't know why I Googled that. My dad's death wasn't coconut related.
Then I Googled which movies to watch when you grieve.
I have always found movies comforting. I have spent my life hunkering down with them: They've gotten me through breakups, awkward phases and most of my pregnancy. Movies are a perfect container for feelings. Which is probably why I started making them in the first place.
When I looked up what movies to watch when you grieve, a very long list of mainstream movies came up: "Rocky," "Steel Magnolias," "Marley and Me," "Gravity." But I didn't want to watch a movie set in space, and I definitely didn't want to watch a movie where a dog dies. I'm pretty sure that's what happens in "Marley and Me."
I decided I needed to make my own movie about grief. I called my mom to tell her the news.
"I'm making a movie about Dad dying," I said.
"Like a revenge movie?"
"No," I said.
My father died of a stroke. How could I possibly make a revenge movie about that? Someone would have to play the stroke. Which, once I thought about it, wasn't a terrible idea. Curious about whom I might cast as the stroke, I asked my mom.
My mom thought about it for a moment and then said: "Idris Elba. I love Idris Elba."
"You don't think Idris Elba is too sexy?" I asked.
"He is sexy," she said. Then she paused for a very long time. "But not too sexy. He's smart, too," she added. And then she said, "And gorgeous."
It was settled, then. If I were to make a revenge movie about my dad's death, Idris Elba would play the sexy, smart, gorgeous stroke that I had to pursue to set things right. It was starting to sound like a Liam Neeson vehicle. Maybe I could get Liam Neeson to play me.
The longer I thought about this idea, the less it appealed. The logistics alone. How would I, on a microbudget, coordinate with this A-list talent?
I called my mom again.
"I'm not making a revenge movie. I want to make a movie about my feelings."
"Oh," she said. "Hmm."
Feelings have never been my mom's thing. She'd rather clean the bathroom than talk about feelings. When my dad died and the coroner came, I could see two rooms from where I stood; One was the bedroom, where my dad lay dead, the other was the family room, where my mom tidied. My nephew Jacob pulled out his phone and read the mourner's Kaddish while we watched the coroner put a toe tag on my dad and wheel him out on a cart. As they did that, my mom straightened pictures on the wall and moved a coffee table a few feet to the right.
I stood by the front door and waited for the elevator to come to take my dad away. When he was gone, my mom asked if we could help her clean up the bedroom. We said yes, of course. But, I said, first we need to have a drink and a chat about our feelings. It's what my dad would have done.
When I was a kid, it was my dad who'd sit up with me in the middle of the night to talk. According to my dad, who was a psychotherapist, feelings were complicated and sometimes they were elliptical, meaning they didn't always make sense.
Five months after my dad died, I started shooting the movie. I decided I'd use old footage that I had of him interwoven with new footage of me grieving in myriad ways. I was grieving at a dinner party, in the woods, in a loft, in a pickup truck, in bed. My mom was in the movie, too. I felt good when I was shooting. Productive! Like my grief was useful.
At one point I lay splat on the kitchen floor moaning, while I instructed my mom to cut mushrooms. From the cold kitchen floor, I directed my mom to do less.
"Do less?" she asked. "If I do any less, I'll be dead."
"Let me see what that looks like," I said.
So she did. She hung over the kitchen counter like a wilting plant, barely alert, chopping mushrooms. I turned to look up at her. "Perfect," I said.
Eight months after my dad died, I finished shooting my movie. I spent the next few months editing it with my husband. At times, he would just want a night off from editing, but the nights off were harder for me. Working on it, reviewing the footage, tweaking things -- that's what made me feel good. As if somehow making this movie would get me my dad back.
It's not the way everyone would mourn. But in making the movie, which I called "Senior Escort Service," I figured out how to keep my dad in my life almost every day that first year. I also figured out how to say goodbye.
On the one-year anniversary of his death, I showed the movie to my mom. She laughed at all of her parts and teared up a few times. When it was over she said, "It's cute!"
"Cute?" I said. "You laughed! You cried! What more would you want from a movie?"
"A little Idris wouldn't have hurt."

Texto completo: Newly re-elected Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., didn't say he's running for governor. He didn't deny it either, but he did take a crack at the incumbent.
Longtime West Virginia MetroNews talk radio host Hoppy Kercheval set the rumor mill ablaze with a column Friday morning, citing unnamed sources, titled "Manchin considering running for governor ... again."
Later Friday, Manchin said he had not read the column and did not directly answer a question of whether he's going to run for governor.
"The state of West Virginia deserves and needs a full-time governor, he said in response. "I've held that position, I know what it takes, you've got to live it, you've got to eat it, you've got to breathe it. And you don't have a surrogate doing it for you. That's all I'm saying. And what I'm seeing now is not right.
Sitting GOP Gov. Jim Justice is currently facing legal action in Kanawha County Circuit Court filed by a Democratic member of the House of Delegates alleging he is violating the state constitution by living at his Lewisburg home. The filing, in general, paints Justice as a no-show governor.
Bray Cary, senior adviser to the governor and a board member of natural gas driller EQT, is known to have increasing influence in the office. In jest, Justice referred to Cary as "my oldest son at his State of the State address Wednesday.
Manchin, when asked if he was referring to Justice and Cary, offered a cryptic response.
"I think people are smart enough in West Virginia to put two and two together, he said.
Manchin was elected governor in 2004 and re-elected in 2008.
As a U.S. Senator, he backed Justice as some of his close aides worked on the then-Democrat's gubernatorial campaign.
The relationship eventually soured. Justice switched to the Republican Party in 2017; he fired Gayle Manchin, the senator's wife, from her post as the secretary of the Department of Education and the Arts; and he endorsed Attorney General Patrick Morrisey in his failed Senate bid against Manchin.
In a September 2018 interview, Manchin said supporting Justice's campaign was the biggest "mistake of his political career. However, after the interview, he clarified to say it was the greatest "disappointment of his career.
"I feel very bad for the people I asked to support Jim; I did not know the lack of character, or the political character that he is, he said. "I knew Jim as a person before, who we had a great relationship with. I didn't know being a politician could change a human being as much as it has changed him.
Manchin's remarks came in the midst of a federal government shutdown that is likely to break the record for the longest one of all time. The senator returned to his home state Friday to meet with constituents directly affected by that shutdown.
Although he won re-election just a few months ago after a bruising campaign, he reportedly waffled on whether to run in the first place, telling The New York Times that "this place sucks in reference to Washington, D.C.
Thus far, both Justice and Democratic community organizer Stephen Smith have publicly announced plans to run.

LAUSD teachers went on strike in 1989. But are the stakes higher in 2019?

Texto completo: Whether they were stuck in an auditorium or playing long-term hooky, many a school kid old enough to remember the 1989 Los Angeles teachers strike recalls the period as nine days of good old-fashioned lawlessness.
Quoted in a New York Times article at the time, LAPD Lieut. Frank Valdez expressed his concern about “little predators” roaming LA’s downtown streets. “The problem kids are not going to go to school and it’s going to create problems all over, not just on campus,” he said during the strike.
Jamie Todd Rubin, an 11th-grader at Cleveland High School at the time, wistfully remembers weekday ventures to the beach, Valley bowling alleys and movie theatres while his teachers fought for better pay as his personal “golden age.”
Triumphantly, he recalled that “teachers ended up getting what they were looking for too.” In many respects, they did.
By all accounts, teachers succeeded in gleaning higher wages, more administrative control and greater stature for their union from the Los Angeles Unified School District after thousands walked off the job in the spring of 1989.
It was the second teachers strike since the founding of United Teachers Los Angeles in 1970, ushering angst into the city and turmoil to the nation’s second largest school system.
In 1989, the major win for teachers after the walkout that lasted nine days was getting school-based management and shared decision-making into a contract. Around 80 percent of members participated in the strike, and half of LAUSD K-12 students stayed home.
Read full LA Unified School District coverage here
As an army of 30,000 teachers stand ready to form new picket lines on Monday, their demands ring markedly familiar: higher pay, relief from ballooning class sizes, and more nurses, librarians and counselors trained to address the medical and psychological needs of today’s students.
Has much really changed?
Former UTLA President John Perez, who was on the picket lines both as a teacher in 1970, said it this way:
“To be perfectly honest, very little has changed. In 1970 we felt disrespected. In 1989 we felt disrespected. And in 2018 teachers feel disrespected.”
Undercurrents of teacher empowerment were also at the crux of the 1970 strike, UTLA’s first, when around half of the young union’s members went off the job for nearly five weeks.
Then, as now, district officials threatened that acceding to their calls for salary increases would spell financial ruin.
Parallels between ’89 and today run as deep as rhetorical strategy, like the union’s relentless critiques of LA Unified Superintendent Austin Beutner.
“Oh yeah it was a big war in ’89 and the union made superintendent [Leonard] Britton the bad guy,” Perez said. Picketing teachers wore buttons with his face over a lemon, or with a slash over his face. “We called him Lenny the lemon.”
Some have argued all this recurrence is evidence that the lasting effects of earlier strikes have been mixed at best, and that securing lasting public funding for education has proven elusive over the decades.
Former LAUSD elementary school teacher Michael Romo lamented the lack of progress since 1989.
“Back in my day we had nurses, smaller class sizes and maybe even better stocked libraries,” said Romo, director of the California Teachers Association in Burbank and Glendale.
He went on strike in 1989, his first year of bilingual teaching at Norwood Street Elementary School. “For 30 years to come back to the same issue, it’s like we’ve made no progress.”
Of course, things do change in 30 years. Along with overarching economic differences and a friendlier face in the governor’s mansion, a key factor in this looming walkout that appears to have been absent from previous strikes is competing visions for the future of public education.
UCLA Professor John Rogers, director of the university’s Institute for Democracy, Education, and Access, interpreted the current impasse between the district and the union as a reflection of opposite reactions LAUSD’s current financial and enrollment woes.
“The district is thinking about how they can contain costs and deal with a growing charter school sector by devolving the district over time as a portfolio of schools,” he said. “While teachers think the way forward is to more broadly improve the quality of its own educational program, only sometimes acknowledging how much spending that requires.”
The emergence of charter schools in Los Angeles, which are privately managed but publicly funded, have been central to the standoff between district and union leadership.
Perez seems to think this is uncharted territory, particularly what he said was superintendent Beutner’s goals to break up and “privatize” the a time-honored and democratic institution like L.A. Unified.
“The existential threat to public education as we know it is real. That wasn’t there in 1989,” he said. The district’s financial woes this time around also have some experts worried about a state takeover.
“My understanding is after the strike it will appear to be a win for teachers and then the layoffs will come soon after,” said UCLA Professor of Education at the Graduate School of Education and Information Studies Pedro Noguera.
Noting LA County’s recent appointment of a fiscal team to the district, he said “That’s my fear, that they’re at risk of being taken over.”
Carmen Romero, special education teacher at South Gate High School, remembers those long days in auditoriums, in the gym and on the football field as a 10th-grader at Bell High School during the 1989 strike.
“We didn’t feel valued as students,” she said about the nine days of boredom. More of a rule-follower, she was on campus every day of the strike.
“But it made me appreciate school more, and feel like I deserve things like desks and respect.” Now that she’s gearing up to get on the picket line as a teacher, “It’s the same feeling.”

A man usually tells you to walk, not a woman, because of frequency not sexism

Texto completo: Q. Where I live they have been changing the crosswalk buttons to these fancy new ones that beep, flash and talk to you. Why are all of the voices men’s voices? Isn’t this the age of equality?
– Patrick Shane, North Tustin
A. Patrick lives in unincorporated county territory, near the city of Tustin. After getting some specifics on the traffic signals, he and Honk agreed the city would be best to ask, as at least some of these new-school devices are in Tustin.
Krys Saldivar , the manager of the Tustin’s Public Works Department, said the city is upgrading all of its pedestrian push buttons tied to traffic signals, with about 40 percent having these newer devices.
“Those who are blind will be able to hear where they are crossing and when to cross, and those who are deaf will feel the vibration when it is safe to cross,” she told Honk in an email. “The first ones that have been installed in the city were actually programmed by the manufacturer.”
That would be Polara, a Texas-based company.
Its president, John McGaffey , said if a city asks, Polara can provide a female voice; it has done so before. But it generally uses a male voice.
“In controlled studies using … accessible pedestrian signals, the majority of the visually impaired participants said they were able to hear a male voice better because it has greater low-range frequencies (under 800 Hz), which people can tend to hear, even with some hearing loss. We also try to keep the voice consistent so the messages sound similar, no matter where you are in the United States.”
Q. My license expires on my birthday in June. Should I go ahead and make an appointment with the Department of Motor Vehicles now because of the crowded DMV offices, with the popularity of the REAL ID? Or should I wait until they send me a notice? It’s very confusing! Thank you!
– Linda Wells, Mission Viejo
A. DMV officials and Honk readers have told the wise one, that would be Honk, that wait times have gone way down since the mess in the summer.
Still, appointments are the way to go if you must go into an office to renew your license (Typically every 15 years until you hit age 70, then every five years).
“She can make an appointment before she receives her renewal notice,” Marty Greenstein , a DMV spokesman up in Sacramento, said via email. “In fact, that’s something we encourage. If you know your license is going to expire in a few months, go ahead and make your appointment. We started sending out renewal notices 90 days in advance this summer (up from 60) to give people more time.”
The DMV takes appointments for several months out. Linda noticed that the two DMV offices near her home were completely booked. What about that?
“Appointment availability can change on a daily basis as offices perform daily assessments, or spots open when an appointment is canceled,” Greenstein said.
So keep trying, Linda.
But don’t go too early to a DMV office to renew, or you will be required to take what used to be called a “written” test and is now a “knowledge” test (it is usually done on a touchscreen these days) even if you weren’t scheduled for one. The DMV reasons that if you renew real early, then you are shortening up the time it has to monitor your track record out there on the roads, so the test is meant to ensure you are a safe motorist.
“In instances when a knowledge test is not required, coming in at any time during that 90-day window before your license expires should not trigger that requirement,” Greenstein added.
Honkin’ cool: A dad didn’t want his daughter to be alone on Christmas, so Hal Vaughan took six flights over three days to be with her. Pierce Vaughan is a rookie flight attendant for Delta Air Lines, and Dad shadowed her, able to jump on standby for free, a perk of his daughter’s job. A passenger heard about the journey, put it on Facebook and the cute story went viral. The trip: New Orleans; Detroit; Fort Myers, Fla.; Detroit; Hartford, Conn.; Atlanta; and back to New Orleans (Source: The New York Times).

Texto completo: SHOW TUNE - KSDK reporter Dana Dean officially has moved into the hosting chair for Channel 5's "Show Me St. Louis" segment.
Dean joined KSDK in 2008 and was a reporter on the 10 a.m. feature show until 2011, when she moved to reporting for the morning newscasts. She came back to the show in 2015.
Dean takes the wheel from Heidi Glaus. (For more on Glaus, just keep on reading.) Meteorologist Anthony Slaughter will team with Dean temporarily as a co-host, a station press release said.
Just last week, Dean's husband, Ryan Dean, moved off the air to take over as the station's broadcast managing editor.
WAVELENGTHS - Best way to get rid of a rumor is to make it a fact:
Former KSDK reporter Heidi Glaus will join KTRS (550 AM) as the co-host on Guy Phillips' afternoon show. Glaus will start as a regular beginning Monday, Phillips said.
Chatter about Glaus began early this week after Glaus filled in a couple of shifts for KMOV (Channel 4) reporter Laura Hettiger, who stepped down from the role she held for seven months.
Glaus, who has not worked in radio since her college days, said she looked forward to "having more time to tell stories."
"St. Louis has so many incredible treasures and (after 22 years in the media) I'm still finding new places," she said.
A New Madrid, Mo., native, Glaus had been at KSDK since starting in 1996 as a college intern.
Along with two separate stints on "Show Me St. Louis," her last one starting in 2014, Glaus worked as a features reporter at the station.
BAR TABS - Glendale Mayor Richard J. Magee has had his law license placed on probation for one year.
A Missouri Supreme Court disciplinary committee found that Magee failed to provide competent representation by allowing his client's case to be dismissed twice; conducted no formal discovery for more than two years; and failed to keep his client reasonably informed.
The complaint was filed by Kelvin Richardson, a former St. Louis County employee who retained Magee in 2015 to represent him in a civil rights lawsuit.
The court put Magee's license on probation in December. Conditions include Magee filing quarterly reports with a monitor and work with a mentor on improving case management.
Magee is in his sixth term as Glendale mayor. He was first elected in 2005 after serving 10 years as an alderman. From 2008 until 2012, he was chairman of the St. Louis County Republican Central Committee.
VISION THING - The St. Louis Visionary Awards have released the names of its 2018 winners. They are:

Texto completo: Picture this: As the deadly Camp Fire was ravaging Butte County and leveling the town of Paradise, some California legislators were meeting in Hawaii with officials from various industries, including utility company executives who hope Sacramento shields them from billions in potential liability from increasingly costly wildfires.
Doesn't that just about set your hair on fire?
Now ponder this: Though not all events that bring together lawmakers and corporate and other special interests have the spectacularly bad timing and optics as last fall's $8,000-per-person California Independent Voter Project retreat in Maui, all of them are perfectly legal.
We'll go ahead and say it: This stinks.
Of course, corporate interests and others who hope to make their case to state government have the right to their say. We all do.
That's the nature of our system. Junkets like these, however, distort the process.
A New York Times article earlier this month on the retreat suggests that anyone canattend the annual CIVP event — for a price.
"What would be wrong with elected officials and business discussing issues?" Voter Project chief Dan Howle told the Times, also pointing out that the conference rules prohibit lobbying or discussion of specific legislation. "If the public wants to go, the public can pay a fee."
Got that, John Q. Public? Just send along your own fat check for a ticket — oh, and make sure you get the OK from the boss for the time off — and you'll surely score a good seat. Bring your "fat pants" to make sure you enjoy the poolside buffet and open bar.
One other thing: To put more punch into your personal pitch "on the issues," John, bring along that checkbook that'll prove you can compete with the millions some of your dinner partners are going to spend on lobbying and campaign donations down the road to further bend the ear of "your representative."
Folks, this sick joke is on you.
Assembling "captive" audiences of influential lawmakers in a far-off Polynesian paradise or some "Where Eagles Dare" mountain ski lodge and regaling them with one-sided explorations of issues they'll be acting on is neither democratic nor necessary. These tilt the playing field far beyond anything resembling fair.
The people's business should be done where the people can take part. These types of junkets have too much potential to simply be the jet-set version of the sinister "smoke-filled room" where decisions are made. They should be relegated to the past.
The supremely cynical pragmatist might suggest lawmakers "need" this type of quality time with such power players so they can be "educated" on how to fix hot messes like Pacific Gas & Electric. PG&E, which seemed to be in the clear from potential billions in liability from then-record 2017 wildfires, is now teetering on bankruptcy thanks to the now-record Camp Fire, which left 86 dead and additional billions in damage.
Our society can't surrender to that level of cynicism.
For now, we'll reserve judgment on potential legislative solutions – which currently range from extending the recently enacted 2017 "lifeline" to also cover 2018 fires to a potential breakup of PG&E. Lawmakers definitely have their work cut out for them, but they need to get it done without undue influence from Mai Tais and kalua pork.
(For the record, PG&E decided to not send its executives to CIVP this year, but did not request refund of its sponsorship funds. The other two investor-owned utilities, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric, did have executives in Maui.)
The nonprofit progressive advocacy group Consumer Watchdog on Wednesday, in response to the New York Times piece, called on the Legislature to require lawmakers to disclose – in real time on public websites – specific information about the educational "seminars" and trips they attend when they accept an invitation and information about the lobbyists attending as well.
We'll be watching to see how our own lawmakers handle such travel "opportunities." Voters across the Golden State should keep a sharp eye on their own representatives and remember to take it into account at election time.

House GOP unlikely to censure Steve King for issuing support for white nationalism, supremacy

Texto completo: Rep. Steve King said Friday that he doesn’t expect blowback from Republican leaders in Washington or Iowa for issuing support for white nationalism and white supremacy in a New York Times interview — comments the congressman insists were taken out of context.

King, an Iowa Republican, said he initiated a conversation with House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., to discuss the matter and update leadership on how he planned to handle the controversy. King has been in hot water before for using racially-charged rhetoric. But this latest episode smacked of outright racism and generated a rare rebuke from House GOP leaders.

King said none of his colleagues in leadership sought him out demanding an explanation. Nor, he said, has any punishment — the loss of committee assignments or otherwise — been threatened. A senior Republican aide in the House said no action is planned. The hope is that statements of condemnation from House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., and others are enough to neuter the outspoken King.

“Nobody talked to me about it. I did talk to Mr. Scalise; I initiated that conversation a little earlier today, I wanted to let him know what I was going to do — just that I’d give a floor speech,” King told a small group of reporters as he exited the House chamber after those remarks. “I didn’t get any advice to the contrary.”

However, Scalise spokeswoman Lauren Fine offered a slightly different version of events. She confirmed that King approached the whip on the House floor during Friday morning votes to discuss the matter. But Fine said the idea for an apology delivered via a House floor speech came from Scalise.

“During votes Steve King approached the Whip about his remarks, and the Whip expressed to him that his comments were offensive and that ideology should be rejected. The Whip suggested he apologize on the House floor, which King did,” Fine said in an email.

Meanwhile, King said no Republican leader in Iowa has called him to complain or criticize, either at the county level in the Fourth Congressional District he represents or at the state level. The Iowa GOP chairman, Jeff Kaufman, has not responded to requests for comment from the Washington Examiner .

King on Friday afternoon delivered a floor speech defending his record on race and immigration. King is attempting to put behind him only the latest in a string of controversies sparked by his habitual use of rhetoric that many Republicans and Democrats believe are indications of deep-seeded racism. King’s views on immigration policy are similar to President Trump’s.

But in a fresh interview with The New York Times, King crossed the line, offering overt support for concepts that neither Trump nor the most ardent mainstream critics of immigration, legal or illegal, have embraced. “White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?” King said.

In his second day of trying to clean up the political mess these remarks created, King on the House floor claimed that he was not expressing support for white nationalism or white supremacy, but rather discussing “how those words got plugged into our dialogue, not when the words became offense … It’s how did that offensive language get injected into our political dialogue.”

King also read verbatim the statement that he released on Thursday, which said in part: “Today the New York Times is suggesting that I’m an advocate for white nationalism and white supremacy. I want to make one thing abundantly clear, I reject those labels and the evil ideology that they define.”

Asked if he regretted the remarks, King urged reporters to review his his floor speech. “That stands, that’s why I did it that way. It’s all in the Congressional Record now, so please be comfortable and refer to that,” the congressman said. “I wanted it delivered that way, we’ve got enough confusion.” King described himself as an “American nationalist.”

King, who won a close race for re-election in 2018, already faces at least one credible challenger in the 2020 Republican primary. The National Republican Congressional Committee said it would not work against King in that race, but also made clear that it would not intervene on his behalf, as it sometimes does for incumbents.

In general, Republicans weren’t in a hurry to discuss the matter. One Republican congressman expressed “surprise” at how little internal discussion about the matter there was before the House left Washington for the weekend. Another House Republican declined to comment, saying he had not talked to King or read the New York Times story.

“Until I know more about it I’m not going to comment,” said the normally talkative Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla.

Alphabet Sued Over Exit Deal for Accused Executive

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO -- A shareholder lawsuit says the board of directors of Google's parent company, Alphabet, played an "active and direct role" in approving a $90 million exit package for Andy Rubin, a senior executive, even though an investigation into a sexual harassment claim against him was deemed credible.
The lawsuit, filed on Thursday in California Superior Court, said minutes from board meetings showed that the directors had agreed to ask for Mr. Rubin's resignation while approving the sizable separation agreement to "keep the matter quiet." The minutes were redacted in the court filing.
In October, The New York Times reported that Google had paid the exit package after a female employee accused Mr. Rubin of coercing her into performing oral sex on him. At the time, it was not clear how much the board had known about the allegations or the company's decision to pay Mr. Rubin.
"The directors' wrongful conduct allowed the illegal conduct to proliferate and continue," the lawsuit said. "As such, members of Alphabet's board were knowing and direct enablers of the sexual harassment and discrimination."
Gina Scigliano, an Alphabet spokeswoman, declined to comment on the lawsuit.
News of payouts to Mr. Rubin and other executives accused of wrongdoing, along with the continued employment of male executives who had acted inappropriately with women at Google, led to an employee walkout in November.
Google agreed to stop forced arbitration for employees in cases of sexual harassment, but did not give in to other demands, including employee representation on the board.
The suit, brought by James Martin, an Alphabet investor, said Alphabet's current board directors and other current and former senior executives had breached their fiduciary duties by covering up the harassment claims. Mr. Martin's lawyers declined to identify what he did for a living, but said he was not an Alphabet employee.
The lawsuit is seeking damages as well as improved oversight of sexual harassment, the end of nondisclosure agreements for current and former employees, and improvements to corporate governance.
The suit asked that the company change its shareholder voting structure, which provides Alphabet's co-founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, with the majority of voting shares even though they do not hold the majority of shares.
The lawsuit named 12 current and former directors of Alphabet, including Mr. Page, Alphabet's chief executive, and Sundar Pichai, Google's chief executive. Other defendants include Laszlo Bock, Google's former head of people operations, and David Drummond, Alphabet's chief legal counsel, who had an extramarital relationship with a subordinate during his early years at Google and had a child with her. The lawsuit said Mr. Drummond had been involved in the investigation of Mr. Rubin.
Ann Ravel, a lawyer for Mr. Martin, said: "Boards have an obligation to deal with issues like this in a straightforward, open way. And they have a public obligation to let the public know about what they've done, and that didn't happen in this case."
The lawsuit also named Mr. Rubin and Amit Singhal, a search executive who also received an exit package after claims of sexual harassment. The lawyers said they wanted the money that Mr. Rubin and Mr. Singhal had received from the company returned to shareholders.
The attorneys for Mr. Martin said they had obtained the board minutes because he is a shareholder but agreed to a confidentiality agreement. They said they would seek to have the minutes unsealed.
Organizers of the employee walkout welcomed the lawsuit. "We have all the evidence we need that Google's leadership does not have our best interests at heart," they said in a statement.
Alphabet's board is the target of another shareholder lawsuit, filed on Wednesday in California Superior Court in San Mateo. The Northern California Pipe Trades Pension Plan and a pension fund for a local Teamsters group claim a breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment and corporate waste.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

EPA official, disabled rights advocate led effort to show FDR in wheelchair

Texto completo: Michael R. Deland, a hard-charging EPA official who spearheaded the effort to clean up Boston Harbor in the 1980s and who later led a campaign to include a depiction of Franklin D. Roosevelt in his wheelchair at the 32nd president's memorial in Washington, died Jan. 8 at a hospital in Wareham, Mass. He was 77.
He had complications from pneumonia, said his wife, Jane Deland.
A lawyer and ardent champion of the environment, Mr. Deland later became a nationally recognized advocate for people with disabilities such as himself.
He became the New England regional director of the Environmental Protection Agency in 1983, adopting an approach that sometimes seemed at odds with the pro-business policies of the administration of President Ronald Reagan. Mr. Deland challenged polluters, local governments and the Army Corps of Engineers as he directed cleanup efforts throughout the Northeast.
"In addition to being the premier figure on the environment in government," Douglas Foy, director of the Conservation Law Foundation, told the Boston Globe in 1988, "I believe he is far and away the best regional administrator at EPA nationwide and the best we've ever had in New England. He definitely is in a class by himself."
Mr. Deland blocked an attempt to build a cargo terminal on sensitive wetlands on an island off the Maine coast. He fought the Rhode Island governor and business leaders who wanted to build a reservoir that would have flooded thousands of acres of forests and wetlands.
He overruled the Army Corps of Engineers, which had granted permission to developers to build a mall on 32 acres of wetlands in Massachusetts. When the developers said they would create an artificial wetlands nearby, Mr. Deland rejected the idea.
"In the past," he told the New York Times in 1985, "if you had a project with a wetlands implication you moved the project. Under this interpretation you move the wetlands. In my view, nature has a rather remarkable track record in creating wetlands and developers do not."
Mr. Deland's precedent-setting decision required that developers seek out alternative sites rather than destroy wetlands. The principle was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1989.
Mr. Deland won perhaps his greatest environmental victory in 1988, when the Commonwealth of Massachusetts agreed to pay civil fines of $425,000 and to contribute $2 million to fund various cleanup projects in Boston Harbor.
When Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, the 1988 Democratic nominee for president, staged a ribbon-cutting ceremony to commemorate the harbor restoration, Mr. Deland punctured the buoyant mood by noting that Dukakis had fought the EPA for six years. He pronounced the prolonged legal battle "the most expensive public policy mistake in the history of New England."
Mr. Deland scoffed at criticism that the settlement was designed to damage Dukakis's political fortunes.
"I feel strongly that the protection of our environment is too important," he said at the time. "It transcends partisan politics and neither I nor this regional office should have any role in this campaign."
Rumored to be a leading candidate for EPA director after George H.W. Bush was elected president in 1988, Mr. Deland was instead nominated to lead the White House Council on Environmental Quality. He was Bush's top in-house adviser on the environment and coordinated policies among various agencies.
In his first year in the job, Mr. Deland warned of the dangers of global warming, noting that "we've simply got to ratchet back" the country's reliance on fossil fuels. On the whole, however, his environmental record in the Bush administration came under attack by onetime allies, who accused him of turning away from ideals he had previously espoused.
When Bush lost the 1992 presidential election to Bill Clinton, Mr. Deland became an executive with American Flywheel Systems, a company developing alternative energy sources.
Michael Reeves Deland was born Dec. 13, 1941, in Boston. His father was a prominent lawyer, and his mother supported various environmental and philanthropic efforts.
He graduated from Harvard in 1963, then served two years in the Navy before receiving his law degree from Boston College in 1969. He was an assistant to the president of the University of Massachusetts before joining the EPA's legal team in 1971. He worked for an environmental consulting firm in Boston from 1976 to 1983.
He was chairman and chief executive of the National Organization on Disability until retiring in 2007, when he moved from Washington to Marion, Mass.
A competitive sailor for much of his life, Mr. Deland won national championships with his wife and a small crew while racing Shields class sailboats in 1980 and 1987.
Survivors include his wife of 45 years, the former Jane Slocum of Marion; a son, Michael Stanton Deland of Malibu, Calif.; twin daughters Melissa Reeves Deland of West Roxbury, Mass., and Holly Louise Deland of Santa Monica, Calif.; a brother; a sister; and three granddaughters.
Beginning in the 1960s, Mr. Deland had difficulties with walking and mobility. He used crutches at first before switching to a wheelchair in the 1980s, when he was an EPA official.
"To fulfill the demands of that job, I had to be mobile," he told the Boston College Law School magazine in 1998. "So I accepted being in the wheelchair, but that also meant that I lost strength faster in the muscles of my legs."
The source of his progressive disability was not diagnosed until the 1980s, when a cyst was found in his spinal cord.
In 1995, Mr. Deland was named board chairman of the National Organization on Disability and became a major fundraiser for the advocacy group. He soon learned that a memorial to Roosevelt, then under construction near the Mall, was designed to include three sculptures - but none of the president in a wheelchair.
"It's a blatant historical distortion," Mr. Deland said in 1996. "For the 49 million Americans who have disabilities, there is no greater role model than FDR. It would be unconscionable if schoolchildren were to go through that memorial and not know that he led the nation from a wheelchair."
Mr. Deland rallied support from several former presidents, leading historians and eight of Roosevelt's grandchildren. He threatened to lead a protest when the memorial was dedicated in 1997. Finally, a life-size statue showing the four-term president seated in a wheelchair was unveiled in 2001.
Mr. Deland was present to observe what he called his "most lasting achievement."

Texto completo: The trouble with a government shutdown is that in the end, everyone loses.
Workers lose pay. Essential functions of government fall short -- whether making sure people receive assistance, food inspections are done, security checks at airports are thorough, national parks are protected and so many others. Citizens lose faith in their leaders. And so it goes, until a deal is struck and the dysfunction at the heart of our system of government resumes.
That's especially true now as President Donald Trump demands billions for a wall and Democrats promise to block him. This isn't a "both sides won't budge" situation, either. The Democrats just won a House majority in part because they beat back Trump's nativist, anti-immigrant message. To now fund a wall -- the purpose of which is mostly symbolic rather than functional -- would be a fundamental betrayal of voters.
Democrats are right to rebut the ugly message that Trump spews when he discusses the southern border, as he did Tuesday night in a prime-time address from the Oval Office (complete with fundraising appeals before and after).
Consistent on so little, the president began his presidential campaign by calling Mexicans rapists and drug dealers. Then, demeaning the Oval Office, he recited a litany of crimes committed by people here illegally, making it clear that he believes immigrants from the south desire to hurt the good citizens of the nation. That, despite clear statistics that show undocumented immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than native-born citizens.
There were other falsehoods in the nine-minute address. Trump said the wall is needed to keep out illegal drugs; most drugs come through official ports of entry, not along the border between entry points. As we have pointed out before, too, illegal immigration is hardly a crisis, despite Trump's claims. Border crossings are at their lowest point in decades. The humanitarian crisis Trump said he is addressing has been caused by his administration's wrongheaded policies. That's what Democrats must keep pointing out.
They have to emphasize, too, that Trump never said Congress would have to appropriate money to build more barriers along the border. Mexico was supposed to pay for the wall. Not U.S. taxpayers. Voters showed decisively in November they don't want billions of taxpayer dollars invested in steel and concrete. Trump's claim in his address that the new trade agreement with Mexico would pay for the wall was debunked. Another falsehood.
However, there needs to be a way to strike a deal so that the shutdown can be put behind us. Judging from the address and from a breakdown in talks Wednesday, a solution might not emerge soon.
This is wrong.
Government workers are at risk of not being able to pay mortgages, rent, utilities, buy medicine or purchase groceries. People who need services, including members of tribal nations across the New Mexico, will have to go without the longer this mess stretches out.
How, then, to find a way to a solution?
Here's one idea from the widow of former Sen. John McCain. Cindy McCain, in a tweet on Wednesday, said: "Why don't we just repair the wall we have?"
Barriers along the border, in certain places, are nothing new. Democrats have authorized dollars for repairs and will continue to do so, especially if it means the government can reopen. A fence along the entire border makes no sense -- the terrain will not support it in many places, for one thing -- but spending more to fortify what exists might be one way to get to the other side of gridlock.
Trump is going to the border Thursday, and Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham plans her own visit Friday. Let's hope Trump listens to a wide variety of views, not just hand-picked people who echo his prejudice.
Most people along the border know that building a wall is not the answer to problems they might have. They also know the border is not in crisis, except a self-inflicted one. They need to be heard. As one resident of Columbus, N.M., told the New York Times: "Enough about the wall already. We have other problems here that need fixing."
Meanwhile, the partial government shutdown is hurting the entire nation. If a deal is possible, ending the stalemate before too much damage is done will take courage -- from Republican senators with the guts to tell the president and party leaders that enough is enough. The GOP must end the deadlock. Sooner, not later.

TOM STEYER WON'T RUN FOR PRESIDENT IN 2020

Texto completo: San Francisco Democratic megadonor Tom Steyer won't run for president in 2020 and will instead invest $40 million more in his campaign to impeach President Trump, his political organization said Wednesday.
The billionaire environmental activist and former hedge fund chief, who had mulled a presidential bid and went as far in recent weeks as conducting polling and choosing campaign staff, announced his decision at an anti-climactic speech in Des Moines, shortly after the New York Times reported his plans.
"Most people come to Iowa around this time to announce a campaign for president," Steyer said. "But I am proud to be here to announce that I will do whatever it takes, for as long as it takes, to remove a president."
Steyer has already invested millions of dollars over the last year and a half in his ad campaign calling for impeachment, making the case in slickly produced commercials that usually featured him talking into the camera. He also was one of the party's top donors during the 2018 midterms, backing Congressional candidates and funding voter outreach efforts that helped Democrats retake the House.
More recently, he's visited other early primary states to campaign against Trump's policies. His political organization also posted job listings for "state directors."
His organization said Steyer will continue airing national TV ads in 2019 and also target organizing efforts in the districts of House Democratic committee chairs, including Southern California Reps. Maxine Waters and Adam Schiff. He'll also hold an "impeachment summit" with supporters in D.C. this month.
Steyer barely made a blip in the early polls of the 2020 Democratic primary, which could have a vast field of more than 20 contenders. But his considerable fortune with a net worth pegged by Forbes at about $1.6 billion would have made him an important player if he had decided to invest heavily in his own presidential bid.
Still, a Steyer run may not have appealed to Democratic activists focused on getting big money out of politics. In a clear shot at Steyer and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who's also considering a bid, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts argued this month that voters should reject "billionaires" funding their own campaigns. And the qualifications for the party's primary debates are expected to include measures of grassroots fundraising.
Steyer's decision ends only his latest political will-he-or-won't-he act: he previously mulled bids for U.S. Senate and California governor in 2016 and 2018 before deciding not to run for either.
Other potential California contenders for the White House include Sen. Kamala Harris, who's embarking a national book tour this week, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti and East Bay congressman Eric Swalwell.
Sue Caro, a California Republican Party vice-chair in Oakland, said Steyer spending big on an impeachment campaign amounted to a waste of his money. "As long as the Republicans are in charge of the Senate, it's not going to happen," Caro said.
But she acknowledged that Steyer's millions had been effective in boosting Democrats during 2018 congressional races, when "he really creamed us in Orange County."
"I wish he could decide to go retire on some island," she said.

Texto completo: Guess who's getting fired?
You.
Don't panic. You're not fired now and no future firings have been announced, and what do I know, anyway? But deep down in one of the hidden and vacant areas of your brain, the thought has surfaced.
Your head is headed for the chopping block.
It could have been a sly, sideways look from your manager that gave away the game, or the strange response of the IT person when you asked for a software upgrade.
"I don't think we need to upgrade you," the IT nerd responded. "It's not like you're going to be using that computer for much longer."
(Do you suppose the IT person said this because the company is about to surprise you with an expensive new computer? I think not.)
For what it's worth, you should know that you are not the only person seeing a layoff in their future. Or so I learned in a scary article on the subject by Whitson Gordon in The New York Times.
"What to Do When You Think You're About to Get Fired" is the title of this horror story. If you think you already know all the clues that lead to a final and fatal visit to HR, Gordon provides a plethora of job-ending predictors you might not have noticed. Yet.
Fortunately, he also provides advice about what to do while waiting for the ax to fall.
"Get direct feedback" is the recommendation for those cockeyed optimists who still cling to the idea that they're being paranoid when it comes to their employment mortality.
"Come up with a go-to question you ask with some frequency," Gordon suggests. This will "put your manager on the spot." My suggestion for a question is simple: "Are you going to fire me?" As for frequency, I would think seven or eight times a day should be sufficient.
If your manager's response is not straightforward, Gordon continues, "you'll have to read between the lines." This should be easy. If your manager blinks or coughs or -- heaven forbid -- smiles, you can be sure that your goose is cooked. Ditto, your career.
Workplace expert Alison Green points out that if you are fired, then "you'll be asked to leave right away." One critical aspect of getting the bum's rush is that while you may be able to pack up personal items, like the voodoo doll you made of your manager, you will be locked out of your computer.
If you had valuable information on your computer, like compromising photos of the CFO in their Princess Celestia costume, or a statement from the CEO's Cayman Island Christmas club account, a lockout could mean trouble. Of course, the true tragedy of being denied access to your work computer is that you won't be able to finish "Red Redemption 2" after putting in 3,000 hours of play since you were hired.
If you do determine that a firing is in the offing, there are certain tasks to put on your to-do list.
Put aside money to get you through the time when you won't be getting a paycheck -- $500,00 or $600,000 should do it. You should also take care of your health needs before your company insurance goes bye-bye. This is the perfect time to get that heart transplant you've been wanting. Ask your manager to donate their heart. They certainly don't use it.
If you do receive the call of doom from HR, and all your weeping and begging doesn't change their minds, you want to "agree on a story about why you left." You may have to negotiate, since you want the company to say that you were too talented and worked too hard, while they will want to point out that in the company's workflow pipeline you are a useless, worthless, clueless clog.
Green also advises that you don't wait until you are fired to start your job search. Instead, "as soon as you start being worried, start the job search." Since you started being worried the day you were hired, your Rolodex should be full of companies to contact. If no one wants to scoop you up, call your mother. She thinks you're terrific.
Finally, you are warned to keep what's left of your mind firmly focused on the future.
As author Kim Scott says, "The road to insanity in these situations is obsessing about injustice."
This may be true, but you don't have worry about it.
You've been down that road long, long ago.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversees the special counsel investigation into the 2016 election, is expected to leave his post in a matter of weeks, a person familiar with the matter said Wednesday.
The move is timed to the anticipated confirmation of William Barr, who was nominated by President Donald Trump to succeed ousted Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
The person familiar with the transition said Rosenstein is leaving on his own terms.
Senate confirmation hearings for Barr are scheduled to start Jan. 15, and a vote could follow in the coming weeks.
Rosenstein's expected departure would come after a tumultuous 20 months, in which he has often been placed at odds with the administration he works for and Trump himself.
Since his appointment of Robert Mueller to lead the Justice Department's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election, Rosenstein has been the target of unrelenting criticism from Trump, who has derided the inquiry as a witch hunt.
During that time, Rosenstein has been seen as a key shield for Mueller as Trump and some Republican lawmakers have openly mulled removing both Rosenstein and Mueller.
Rosenstein's appointment of Mueller was prompted by Sessions' recusal from the inquiry because of his work for the Trump campaign. The recusal ultimately led to Sessions' firing following the November midterm elections.
If confirmed, Barr would assume management of the Mueller investigation, widely believed to be in its final stages. Rosenstein has continued to help oversee the inquiry since the November appointment of acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, the interim replacement for Sessions.
Barr, meanwhile, was on Capitol Hill Wednesday, meeting with lawmakers in advance of next week's hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Barr was attorney general from 1991-93 during George H.W. Bush administration.
Asked about Rosenstein's status, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Wednesday that the deputy attorney general had long planned to serve two years. He was confirmed by the Senate in April 2017.
"I know (Rosenstein) has a great deal of respect for the new nominee for attorney general, Mr. Barr," Sanders said on Fox News. "And I think they have a great relationship.
"I haven't spoken to the deputy attorney general myself, so I'll leave any announcement for him or the president to make when they want to do that. But certainly I don't think there's any willingness by the president or White House to push him out. My guess is that he is making room for the new attorney general to build a team he wants around him."
Rosenstein had considered resigning from his post as recently as September in the wake of a New York Times report indicating that the deputy attorney general had suggested invoking the 25th Amendment last year to remove Trump.
Rosenstein has strongly denied the report, which indicated that he suggested recording Trump's conversations in hopes of triggering the president's removal from office.
Democrats expressed deep concern Wednesday about Rosenstein's pending departure. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the development only "heightens the stakes" for Barr's looming confirmation hearing.

My guess is that he is making room for the new attorney general to build a team he wants around him."
Rosenstein had considered resigning from his post as recently as September in the wake of a New York Times report indicating that the deputy attorney general had suggested invoking the 25th Amendment last year to remove Trump.
Rosenstein has strongly denied the report, which indicated that he suggested recording Trump's conversations in hopes of triggering the president's removal from office.
Democrats expressed deep concern Wednesday about Rosenstein's pending departure. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the development only "heightens the stakes" for Barr's looming confirmation hearing.

Texto completo: Depending on who you talk to, dieting is life-changing, terrible for you, optimistic, misguided, will keep you alive or put you in an early grave. Then there's all that lingo that comes with mastering the biological theories behind dieting, like ketosis and alkaline and lectin — phrases that make you feel like you're in a science class rather than just trying to shed a few pounds or live a healthier life. Have no fear, because we've got a simplified guide for you about the trendiest diets going into the new year — that self-conscious time when everyone's re-evaluating their lifestyle. With each diet description is a rating of its effectiveness, done by U.S. News and World Report in August. We've included their findings, based on input from a panel of health experts, on weight loss and healthiness for each diet. While doing this study they took into account the diet being "relatively easy to follow, nutritious, safe, effective for weight loss and protective against diabetes and heart disease." Without further ado, here are the diet trends you're likely to see referenced in celebrity Instagram captions in 2019:
Ketogenic Perhaps the biggest fad that's riding its wave of popularity right into 2019 is the Ketogenic, or "Keto," diet. Celebs like Kourtney Kardashian, Al Roker and Vinny Guadagnino (who affectionately went by the nickname "Keto Guido" on the new seasons of "Jersey Shore") have popularized the diet.
Ketogenic diets are low on carbs and high on fat, which puts the body in a state of ketosis. Ketosis is a metabolic state that happens when your body doesn't have enough carbohydrates for your cells to burn for energy. So instead, it burns fat.
The Keto diet is very effective at slimming your waistline, but does cause huge changes to your body that are not always positive. U.S. News & World Report says that changing the way your body is fueled from carbs to fat can lead to leg cramps, dehydration, brain fog, dizziness and more.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.8/5 Weight Loss | 1.6/5 Healthy
Paleo The philosophy of this diet is in the name. The Paleo diet encourages people to eat foods that would have been available to our Paleolithic ancestors. In case you need to brush up on your high school science, the Paleolithic era started 2.5 million years ago.
Basically, with this diet you're looking at meals that could either be hunted or gathered — lean meats, fish, vegetables, nuts and seeds. And, because farming hadn't been developed yet in the Paleolithic era, Paleo dieters are expected to cut out foods that became popularized through farming like dairy products, legumes and grains, as well. Those who follow the Paleo diet believe that modern eating habits don't suit our prehistoric genetic makeup, so we should return to Stone Age-approved meals.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.5/5 Weight Loss | 2.5/5 Healthy
Alkaline Diet Acid is the enemy of the Alkaline diet. The thought behind this diet is to cut out foods that cause your body to produce acid – including meat, wheat, refined sugar, processed foods, dairy, eggs, canned food, packaged snacks, caffeine and alcohol. You may be thinking: what else is there to eat?
The Alkaline diet approves of most fruits and vegetables, nuts, legumes, soybeans and tofu. These are foods that are alkaline — in other words have a pH value of 7, which is neutral, or above. Foods with a pH value below 7 are acidic, and therefore a no-go.
That said, there is no solid science to support that regulating the pH values of your food will change the overall pH balance of your body. It will do that naturally.
However, in general, eating a lot of fruits and veggies and avoiding processed foods will make you lose weight.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.1/5 Weight Loss | 2.9/5 Healthy
Whole30 A popular diet that spurred a New York Times bestselling book, Whole30 encourages people to eat foods with as few ingredients as possible, and all those ingredients should be substances you know and can pronounce. A head of broccoli? Go for it. A piece of candy made with things like glycerin, citric acid, potassium sorbate, red 40 and soy lecithin? Not so much.
The program's website claims that if you completely avoid foods such as alcohol, anything with added sugar, legumes, dairy and more, for 30 days, you will "eliminate cravings, restore a healthy metabolism, heal the digestive tract, reduce systemic inflammation, and discover how these foods are truly impacting how you look, how you feel, and your quality of life." This program also advocates not stepping on a scale, to make the diet more about health than weight loss.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.3/5 on Weight Loss | 2.4/5 on Healthy
Mediterranean The Mediterranean diet advocates heart-healthy foods typically eaten in the Mediterranean. The diet guides people to eat plenty of plants and foods low on "bad" cholesterol, such as legumes, nuts, wheat, fruits and veggies. For example, in this diet, you replace butter with healthy fats like olive oil, salt with herbs and spices, and red meat with fish and poultry. Plus, it encourages a glass of red wine every now and then.
U.S. News & World Report: 3.0/5 on Weight loss | 4.8/5 on Healthy
Flexitarian Think of the Flexitarian diet as vegetarian with a lot of cheat days. The term applies to people who typically eat meatless but occasionally incorporate meat or fish into their diet. New York Times columnist Mark Bittman (who also wrote "VB6: Eat Vegan Before 6:00") has a big role in popularizing this diet. Bittman, as his book title suggests, advocates eating vegan before 6 p.m. An easier way to ease into this diet is by doing a few meatless days a week, says Dawn Jackson Blatner, the author of "The Flexitarian Diet" and a registered dietitian, until you reach five meatless days a week.
U.S. News & World Report: 3.3/5 on Weight loss | 4.6/5 on Healthy
Lectin-free We can trace the popularity of this diet back to Kelly Clarkson's praise of "The Plant Paradox Cookbook" by Dr. Steve Gundry. She said this book helped her achieve her recent weight loss. Gundry has a long, science-fiction-esque explanation about why plants high in lectins (a kind of protein) like beans, legumes and whole grains are bad for you. An extraordinarily simplified version of his theory is that lectins in the plants cause confusion in the immune system and inflammation.
It's true lectins can be toxic in some cases, but much of Gundry's research is based on inconsistent evidence.

Texto completo: Some fear exit of No. 2 DOJ official would upend special counsel probe
Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein has told people close to him that he expects to leave the Justice Department if a new attorney general is confirmed, though there are no concrete plans in place or a timeline for him to do so, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to disclose details of sensitive conversations.
Rosenstein has been the No. 2 Justice Department official since April 2017, his tenure defined by his appointment of Robert S. Mueller III to lead the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and the attacks he incurred from President Trump for doing so. Incensed by Mueller's work, Trump periodically toyed with the idea of ousting his deputy attorney general, though Rosenstein managed to avoid the ax time after time.
Rosenstein's expected departure - whenever it occurs - will probably spark fears about the future of the Mueller probe, though even now Rosenstein is not technically in charge of it. Rosenstein appointed Mueller to investigate whether the president's campaign had coordinated with the Kremlin because then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from the matter. Special counsels, though, normally answer to the attorney general, so when Sessions was forced out in November, supervision fell to Matthew G. Whitaker, whom Trump chose to serve as acting attorney general.
Whitaker, who had been publicly critical of the Mueller probe, resisted recusal from the start, and Justice Department officials recently made it known that he had rejected the advice of ethics officials to step aside. That left him nominally in charge, though Rosenstein seemed to maintain his regular involvement, and Whitaker has not taken any steps that have become public to impede Mueller's work as some feared he might.
People familiar with the investigation say that Rosenstein works as the hands-on supervisor of the Mueller probe, and that Whitaker has largely stayed out of the particulars of that work, though he has been notified on at least one occasion when a significant court hearing was about to occur.
A person familiar with the matter said Rosenstein is not being forced out but instead that he always saw the deputy attorney general job as one that would probably last two years. The person said Rosenstein will probably stay on until after William P. Barr, a former attorney general whom Trump nominated to take the job again, takes office, assuming he's confirmed by the Senate.
A hearing on Barr's confirmation is scheduled for next week, and lawmakers could vote on the nomination in early February.
Barr met Wednesday with a number of Senate Republicans, including incoming Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), who said Barr assured him he "is committed to allowing Mr. Mueller to finish" the investigation.
Sen. Dianne Feinstein (Calif.), the Judiciary Committee's top Democrat, is scheduled to speak with Barr on Thursday, according to her spokeswoman. But other Democrats on the panel have complained that Barr is refusing to meet with them due to the ongoing government shutdown.
Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn), a member of the committee, said the administration cited the "truncated schedule" as the reason Barr would not be available. An aide to another Democratic senator on the Judiciary Committee confirmed that the senator was similarly denied a meeting, with the administration citing the shutdown.
Kerri Kupec, a Justice Department spokeswoman, noted that Barr is meeting with both Democrats and Republicans "despite the holidays, reduced DOJ staff and resources due to the partial government shutdown, and the compressed timeline to prepare for the upcoming hearing."
Rosenstein has told people he would stay on board to ensure a "smooth transition," a person familiar with the matter said. Another factor that could complicate Rosenstein's departure is the timing of any report from Mueller about his findings.
The expectation that Rosenstein would depart was first reported by ABC News.
In some ways, Rosenstein's departure is unsurprising. Barr has told people he would like to select his own deputy attorney general - which is normal for the Justice Department's top leaders. The deputy attorney general is like a chief operating officer, managing much of the department's day-to-day activities and mediating disputes between its many sprawling parts.
In the Trump administration, though, Rosenstein had taken on a unique importance because of his central role in the Russia investigation, and the fear among Democrats that removing him could lead to catastrophic consequences for Mueller - particularly given the public statements made by both Whitaker and Barr about Mueller's work.
As a television pundit in 2017, Whitaker suggested an acting attorney general could starve the Mueller probe of funding so "his investigation grinds to almost a halt."
Barr, for his part, has written an op-ed defending Trump, and sent a long memo to Rosenstein last year excoriating what he viewed as Mueller's "fatally misconceived" approach to investigating the president for possible obstruction of justice.
Barr's op-ed and the memo have become a sticking point for Senate Democrats, who question whether he will be truly impartial in overseeing the Mueller investigation, and some Democrats have pressed for him to recuse himself.
Rosenstein's job security has frequently been in doubt, as the president who appointed him constantly attacked him privately and publicly. Speculation that he could be fired or resign reached a fever pitch in September, following revelations that in May 2017, shortly after the firing of FBI Director James B. Comey, Rosenstein had suggested senior law enforcement officials might secretly record the president.
That explosive suggestion - which Rosenstein's defenders insist was never serious, but more of a sarcastic comment - came amid tense conversations with then-acting FBI director Andrew McCabe, according to people familiar with the discussions. Immediately after Comey was fired, the FBI had opened an obstruction of justice investigation into Trump. Tensions were high between McCabe and Rosenstein over Rosenstein's support of Comey's firing and how to proceed with the politically explosive task of investigating the president, these people said. At one point, the two had an angry confrontation in which each argued that the other should be recused from the Trump investigation, these people said.
After the New York Times reported on Rosenstein's suggestion of secretly recording the president, it seemed Rosenstein would be ousted. The news outlet Axios reported that he had "verbally resigned," though that would turn out not to be true. Instead, Rosenstein talked with Trump and stayed in his job - the president apparently having been mollified by whatever Rosenstein told him.
White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Wednesday that Rosenstein "had always planned to stay around two years" and that he would like to help with the new attorney general's transition.
"He's done a great job," she said.

Texto completo: The new year is off to a roaring start with new snow and new hopes for success and happiness. In Taos, the arts and entertainment scene is at a slight lull, but that doesn't mean there's a lot to keep you feet dancing and eyes beholding. Here's a sample of what's going on. For more, of course, check out the print edition of Tempo inside The Taos News on sale bright and early Thursday morning.
Free ‘Aladdin’ screening at KTAOS
The KTAOS Solar Cinema is showing the 1992 Disney animated hit movie “Aladdin,” featuring the voices of Robin Williams, Scott Weinger, Linda Larkin, Jonathan Freeman and Gilbert Gottfried. “We will show a movie projected in the pavilion on the giant screen, for free,” an announcement reads. Plus, the venue will offer one free kid’s meal with purchase of an adult meal.
The screening will begin at 6 p.m. Friday (Jan. 11) at the KTAOS Solar Center, 9 State Road 150, north of El Prado. Happy hour is from 3-6 p.m. The screening is sponsored by Video Casa of Taos.
“When street rat Aladdin frees a genie from a lamp, he finds his wishes granted. However, he soon finds that the evil has other plans for the lamp — and for Princess Jasmine. But can Aladdin save Princess Jasmine and his love for her after she sees that he isn’t quite what he appears to be?” reads a synopsis of the film.
Children are welcome to bring pillows, sleeping bags and snugglies to get cozy and enjoy the movie. “Great kid’s menu to suit everyone’s taste!

Texto completo: NEW YORK - 5G E? 5G Plus? 5G Ultrawideband? Will the real 5G please stand up?
AT&T has drawn ridicule by relabeling the network used by some of its phones as "5G E to signal that the next-generation wireless network is here. Problem is, phones capable of connecting to 5G aren't coming for another few months, and a national 5G network won't be deployed until 2020 or 2021.
But Verizon, which complained Tuesday about AT&T's move, did something similar when it launched a residential wireless service with the 5G moniker using its own proprietary technology. Although there are now industry standards specifying exactly what 5G networks must meet, dubbed "5G NR, there are still some grey areas, particularly when it comes to marketing. Carriers are using all tools at their disposal as they race to try to convince consumers they'll be "first with 5G.
A new generation of wireless network comes along every several years, so the stakes are high for carriers to establish their dominance. When it's fully deployed, the "5G network is expected to give mobile users faster speeds for video, self-driving cars and connected devices at home as demand for these ramps up.
IDC analyst Jason Leigh said labeling 5G is a "battle between marketers and engineers, as they try to balance hype and reality.
There's a history of carriers being murky about network claims. AT&T, T-Mobile and Sprint started calling an enhanced 3G network 4G in the early 2010s. There's more pushback this time because people are now more aware of what a next-generation network can do.
AT&T said in December that it would offer a "5G Evolution service to some of its newest Android phones in 400 markets. The "5G Evolution service is essentially the existing 4G network with some added features that can boost speeds, technology similar to what Verizon and T-Mobile have also rolled out under different names. That's separate from the standards-based 5G network that AT&T and others are building.
Bob O'Donnell from Technalysis Research said AT&T's "5G E network may be slightly faster than the current 4G service but it is more like "4.5G than "5G.
"It's not really 5G, and it's very confusing to people, he said. "I'm not very sure what the logic was to be honest.
On Tuesday, Verizon launched a marketing offensive pushing back on the "5G E label with full-page ads in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and elsewhere.
"The potential to over-hype and under-deliver on the 5G promise is a temptation that the wireless industry must resist, Verizon chief technology officer Kyle Malady wrote in the ad. Malady also said Verizon wouldn't "call our 4G network a 5G network if customers don't experience a performance or capability upgrade that only 5G can deliver.
Still, Verizon itself rolled out a 5G wireless broadband service in four cities in October using its own proprietary technology rather than industry-based standards. This residential service is meant to compete with cable rather than offer cellular connectivity outside the home. Verizon plans to update the equipment once standards-based devices are available, but there's no timeline for that.
Verizon spokesman Kevin King said comparing Verizon's 5G service to AT&T's move is a mistake because Verizon has been clear that it wasn't using standards-compliant equipment right away.
T-Mobile CEO John Legere, meanwhile, tweeted a tongue-in-cheek video showing T-Mobile's LTE network symbol on a phone replaced with a piece of tape reading "9G.
AT&T declined to comment about the pushback.
While there aren't any legal ramifications in calling AT&T's latest network 5G E, there's a risk in alienating customers, said Leigh, the IDC analyst.
"They're entitled to call their product whatever they want, Leigh said. "Ultimately they'll have to deal with any confusion from a customer perspective.

LEAGUE LAUNCHES PROBE INTO MCCAW SIGNING, RELEASE

Texto completo: OAKLAND >> The NBA has launched a formal review into Cleveland signing former Warriors guard Patrick McCaw to a two-year, $6 million deal and subsequently waiving him before his contract would become guaranteed, sources confirmed to Bay Area News Group. The New York Times first reported the news.
The NBA immediately had suspicions that McCaw and the Cavaliers reached an agreement to waive him so he could become an unrestricted free agent, sources said. McCaw's representatives say that is not the case. Cleveland may have found the terms enticing so they could evaluate a young wing player without any risk. The Cavaliers then waived McCaw on Sunday to sign free-agent guard Cameron Payne to a 10-day contract.
McCaw cleared waivers and is now an unrestricted free agent. He averaged 4.0 points in 128 regular-season appearances with the Warriors in the 2016-17 and 2017-18 seasons. He scored five points in the three appearances with the Cavaliers.
The NBA plans to interview various parties to determine the situation. The Warriors declined to comment on the incident and if they asked the league to investigate.
Under the terms of the league's Collective Bargaining Agreement, the NBA forbids teams and players to make any "unauthorized agreements" that involve making any deals "express or implied, oral or written, or promises, undertakings, representations, commitments, inducements, assurances of intent, or understandings of any kind" that are "concerning any future Renegotiation, Extension, or other amendment of an existing Player Contract."
The Cavaliers could face punishments if the NBA finds any wrongdoing. Fines could range anywhere between $3 million to $6 million as well as the loss of first-round draft picks. The Warriors would not receive anything in return, per terms of the NBA's labor deal. But if the NBA voided McCaw's contract, he could become a restricted free agent again. That would give the Warriors an asset in a potential trade since they would have the ability to match any offer McCaw receives.
The Warriors declined to match McCaw's offer sheet he signed nearly seven months after rejecting the team's $1.7 million qualifying offer and two-year, $5.2 million deal, which included a non-guaranteed deal his second year. They wanted to keep Alfonzo McKinnie as well as keep their 15th roster spot open.
 The PGA Tour has pulled the plug on a proposed new tournament hosted by Stephen Curry because of negotiations with potential title sponsor Workday Inc., and changes to the golf course, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.
Members at Lake Merced, which hosts an LPGA Tour stop in May, had approved spending more than $3.6 million on upgrades. But time was running short, with the tournament scheduled for eight months away and not even a tournament director hired.
The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Texto completo: Are doctors responsible for obesity? What about dentists, are they responsible for cavities? And why aren't the police responsible for crime?
But you tell me, the teacher is responsible for learning. I say, baloney.
I am a teacher and a good one. My wife and I combined have nearly a half-century of teaching experience — small schools, big schools, inner-city schools and rural schools. So I know what I am talking about.
Teachers are a lot of things. We are all those nice words like caring, dedicated, passionate, resourceful, etc, etc. But we are also professionals, and I expect to be treated like one.
So here is my beef with you: Just because you went to school and sat through years of lessons, does not make you knowledgeable about what we do, just as eating at a restaurant does not make you an expert on cooking.
You point your finger at me and tell me to do my job and make your kid learn. Did you spend time with them before preschool reading or did you hand them your phone to shut them up.
Did you count numbers in your house and help them color what they saw in nature?
Once they finally got into preschool did you continue reading with them each night?
Jason McCutcheon, Douglas
An open letter to Arizona's new United States senators Senators Martha McSally and Kyrsten Sinema, I would like to ask you where you stand on border security and the government shutdown?
You have been in Washington for a week now and all we hear is crickets from your Senate offices on these issues.
If ever there was a time for reaching across the aisle to develop solutions it is now. After all, you do represent one of the four states that make up the southern border and have many citizens that are affected by the shutdown.
I would think you might have some concerns. It's time for you to work together, stand up and be heard, present the facts of the state of the southern border as you know them, and push the Senate to work to find a solution instead of sitting back and watching the world go by.
David Brooks has an op-ed in the New York Times on the current state of the government that both of you should read and absorb. In the case of Ms Sinema, you were elected to get things done. For Ms. McSally, Sen. McCain must be rolling over in his grave.
John LeMoine, Phoenix
It is wrong and unethical to back Donald Trump's corrupt behavior I do not support a wall. Even if we do get a wall the government will still need to fund surveillance, technology and officers to patrol the area. An investment in technology and resources would be more practical.
That being said, my family is suffering a great deal from this shutdown just as we have from shutdowns in the past. We are real people with real bills to pay. We have three children, a mortgage and two car payments.
We cannot afford to be without pay. The president is flat out wrong to continue this shutdown. This is abuse of power and abuse of his people. It is wrong and unethical to support his corrupt behavior.

Texto completo: New Stage Theatre, Mississippi's professional theatre located in Jackson, Mississippi, announces its winter class schedule. The class session begins Jan. 12 and runs through Feb. 26th. New classes are available for first-graders through adults. To register for classes, please contact Education Director Sharon Miles at (601) 948-3533 ext. 232 or smiles@newstagetheatre.com.
For our first-grade through third-grade students, our Story Theatre series presents Sneetches by Dr. Seuss. The Sneetches live on the beach and there is a line drawn in the sand: Star Bellies on one side, Plain Bellies on the other. Star-bellied Sneetches are part of the "popular crowd", while plain-bellied Sneetches are shunned. Will the arrival of Sylvester McMonkey McBean and his "fix it machine" help or harm this divided community? This is the story of Dr. Seuss' powerful parable about the surface things that divide us, it will take a courageous friendship between an unlikely pair of Sneetches to find the answers. Students will be guided through the building blocks of theatre technique by building a script from scratch. We will work on character development, acting technique, and storytelling to create a showcase of an original script. This class takes place Saturdays, lasting six weeks total, from Jan. 12 to Feb. 23. Class is from 9: a.m. to 10:30 a.m. The cost of this class is $150.
For our students in fourth-grade, fifth-grade and sixth-grade, our Story Theatre series presents R.J. Palacio's Wonder. August Pullman was born with a facial difference that, up until now, has prevented him from going to a mainstream school. Starting 5th grade at Beecher Prep, he wants nothing more than to be treated as an ordinary kid—but his new classmates can't get past Auggie's extraordinary face. Wonder, now a New York Times bestseller, begins from Auggie's point of view, but soon switches to include his classmates, his sister, her boyfriend, and others. These perspectives converge in a portrait of one community's struggle with empathy, compassion, and acceptance. Students will be guided through the building blocks of theatre technique by building a script from scratch. We will work on character development, acting technique, and storytelling to create a showcase of an original script. This class takes place Saturdays, lasting six weeks total, from January 12 – February 23. Class is from 10:45 am to 12:15 pm. The cost of this class is $150.
We will continue our Monday Night Live! at New Stage series for adults. This is a new program designed to enhance our artistic community by providing quality acting classes for adults taught by local professionals. Included in this series we will offer Advanced Acting with John Maxwell and Voice Over 101 with Keri Grayson Horn. The series takes place Monday nights starting Jan. 21 and ending Feb. 26th.
Advanced Acting with John Maxwell will be from Jan. 2 to Feb. 26 at 6:30 pm to 8:30 pm. This class is $200. This class is designed for actors with some stage experience. Actors should prepare a one-minute monologue for the first session on Jan. 21. Through monologues and some scene work, this class will explore the challenges for every actor in "growing through a role" rather than "finding a role".
It will encourage and nurture the communication skills of an actor rather than the performance skills of an actor. There will be some home-work and possible scene-work with a partner outside of class. Come with the desire to work and learn through collaboration with the instructor.
Voice Over 101 with Keri Grayson Horn will be from Feb. 4 to Feb. 25, at 5:30 p.m. to 7: p.m. This class is $150. This class is designed for anyone interested in learning about the Voice Over industry. Learn vocal techniques, warm-up exercises, microphone etiquette, how to approach the copy (your script), different avenues of Voice Over to explore, where (and where NOT) to go after jobs, and so much more. Then, you'll step up to the mic and try out what you've learned.
New Stage's Youth Acting Troupe will begin again on Jan. 26 for youth ages 12 to 18. This class is $100 per month or $400 per semester. YAT meets once a week on Saturdays from 10:00 am to 12:00 pm. Students will learn about acting through exercises and show rehearsals. This semester they will focus on scene work and a Shakespeare in the Park performance. No audition is necessary to join YAT. Auditions may occur for various projects. There will be an informational meeting on Jan. 12 at 10: a.m.
The education department at New Stage Theatre strives to equip people interested in theatre with the opportunity to develop and strengthen their acting skills, in a professional environment, taught by educated and experienced theatre veterans.
For more information, or to reserve a spot in one of the theatre's exciting acting classes, please contact Education Director Sharon Miles at 601.948.3533 ext. 232, or smiles@newstagetheatre.com.

Texto completo: Depending on who you talk to, dieting is life-changing, terrible for you, optimistic, misguided, will keep you alive or put you in an early grave.
Then there's all that lingo that comes with mastering the biological theories behind dieting, like ketosis and alkaline and lectin — phrases that make you feel like you're in a science class rather than just trying to shed a few pounds or live a healthier life.
Have no fear, because we've got a simplified guide for you about the trendiest diets going into the new year — that self-conscious time when everyone's reevaluating their lifestyle.
With each diet description is a rating of its effectiveness, done by U.S. News and World Report in August of 2018. We've included their findings, based on input from a panel of health experts, on weight loss and healthiness for each diet. While doing this study they took into account the diet being "relatively easy to follow, nutritious, safe, effective for weight loss and protective against diabetes and heart disease."
Without further ado, here are the diet trends you're likely to see referenced in celebrity Instagram captions in 2019.
Ketogenic Perhaps the biggest fad that's riding its wave of popularity right into 2019 is the Ketogenic, or "Keto," diet. Celebs like Kourtney Kardashian, Al Roker and Vinny Guadagnino (who affectionately went by the nickname "Keto Guido" on the new seasons of "Jersey Shore") have popularized the diet. Ketogenic diets are low on carbs and high on fat, which puts the body in a state of ketosis. Ketosis is a metabolic state that happens when your body doesn't have enough carbohydrates for your cells to burn for energy. So, instead, it burns fat. The Keto diet is very effective at slimming your waistline, but does cause huge changes to your body that aren't always positive. U.S. News & World Report says that changing the way your body is fueled from carbs to fat can lead to leg cramps, dehydration, brain fog, dizziness and more.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.8/5 Weight Loss | 1.6/5 Healthy
Paleo The philosophy of this diet is in the name. The Paleo diet encourages people to eat foods that would have been available to our Paleolithic ancestors. In case you need to brush up on your high school science, the Paleolithic era started 2.5 million years ago. Basically, with this diet you're looking at meals that could either be hunted or gathered — lean meats, fish, vegetables, nuts and seeds. And, because farming hadn't been developed yet in the Paleolithic era, Paleo dieters are expected to cut out foods that became popularized through farming like dairy products, legumes and grains, as well. Those who follow the Paleo diet believe that modern eating habits don't suit our prehistoric genetic makeup, so we should return to Stone Age-approved meals.

Alkaline Diet Acid is the enemy of the Alkaline diet. The thought behind this diet is to cut out foods that cause your body to produce acid – including meat, wheat, refined sugar, processed foods, dairy, eggs, canned food, packaged snacks, caffeine and alcohol. You may be thinking: what else is there to eat? The Alkaline diet approves of most fruits and vegetables, nuts, legumes, soybeans and tofu. These are foods that are alkaline — in other words have a pH value of 7, which is neutral, or above. Foods with a pH value below 7 are acidic, and therefore a no-go. That said, there is no solid science to support that regulating the pH values of your food will change the overall pH balance of your body. It will do that naturally. However, in general, eating a lot of fruits and veggies and avoiding processed foods will make you lose weight.

Whole30 A popular diet that spurred a New York Times bestselling book, Whole30 encourages people to eat foods with as few ingredients as possible, and all those ingredients should be substances you know and can pronounce. A head of broccoli? Go for it.
A piece of candy made with things like glycerin, citric acid, potassium sorbate, red 40 and soy lecithin? Not so much. The program's website claims that if you completely avoid foods such as alcohol, anything with added sugar, legumes, dairy and more, for 30 days, you will "eliminate cravings, restore a healthy metabolism, heal the digestive tract, reduce systemic inflammation, and discover how these foods are truly impacting how you look, how you feel, and your quality of life."

Mediterranean The Mediterranean diet advocates heart-healthy foods that are typically eaten in the Mediterranean. The diet guides people to eat plenty of plants and foods that are low on "bad" cholesterol, such as legumes, nuts, wheat, fruits and veggies.
For example, in this diet, you replace butter with healthy fats like olive oil, salt with herbs and spices, and red meat with fish and poultry. Plus, it totally encourages a glass of red wine every now and then. In essence, you're not avoiding fats and carbs, you're just choosing the healthier versions.

Flexitarian Think of the Flexitarian diet as vegetarian with a lot of cheat days. The term applies to people who typically eat meatless but occasionally incorporate meat or fish into their diet. New York Times columnist Mark Bittman (who also wrote "VB6: Eat Vegan Before 6:00") has a big role in popularizing this diet. Bittman, as his book title suggests, advocates eating vegan before 6 p.m. An easier way to ease into this diet is by doing a few meatless days a week, says Dawn Jackson Blatner, the author of "The Flexitarian Diet" and a registered dietitian, until you reach the top tier, which is five meatless days a week.
U.S. News & World Report: 3.3/5 on Weight loss | 4.6/5 on Healthy
Lectin-free We can trace the popularity of this diet back to Kelly Clarkson's praise of "The Plant Paradox Cookbook" by Dr. Steve Gundry. She said this book helped her achieve her recent weight loss. Gundry has a long, science-fiction-esque explanation about why plants high in lectins (a kind of protein) like beans, legumes and whole grains are bad for you. An extraordinarily simplified version of his theory is that lectins in the plants cause confusion in the immune system and inflammation. An extraordinarily dramatized version of his theory is that plants are waging war against us so we don't eat them and we're too dumb to adjust our diets.

Texto completo: URBANA -- About 22 military veterans commit suicide every day.
Marine Sgt. Mike Sandone, 40, is a physical fitness expert with a Marine background who cares about veterans who have taken their own lives.
One of those lost was Sandone's friend, who took his life a few days ago.
Sandone said he has now lost 28 of his combat friends to suicide, and he is trying to raise money for a charity, Mission 22.
His fundraising goal of $2,400 was met early on for the 24/24 Freedom Challenge.
Last week, Sandone completed 24 "CrossFit hero workouts" in 24 hours, and the total that he will donate to Mission 22 is now more than $4,000.
Mission 22 provides treatment programs to veterans for PTSD, traumatic brain injuries and other issues they might be facing.
It organizes events and builds memorials to create social impact and awareness for these issues.
A 1996 graduate of Urbana High School, where he was on the football team, Sandone went to college for a while, but decided on an effort in the Marines for "discipline and adventure."
He was selected as a machine gunner.
Sandone's first overseas deployment was after the USS Cole was bombed in Aden in 2000 while it was being refueled, leaving a gaping hole in its side.
In the bombing, 17 American sailors were killed and 39 were injured.
"My machine gun position was right above the hole," Sandone said.
After he came home in 2002, Sandone was then sent to Failaka Island, off the coast of Kuwait City.
Jihadists ambushed Marines on a training exercise on Failaka Island. A Marine was killed by the attackers, who then lost their own lives.
According to The New York Times, that helped lead to a decision to increase the scope of military activities in the region.
"It seemed likely we were going into Iraq," Sandone said.
And they did, after a stay at Camp Pendleton.
There were many gunfights in Baghdad, Sandone said, calling it "terrifying and exhilarating."
Sandone led a company of machine gunners. His own weapon was an M-240 he always carried. At about 26 pounds, lifting it helped prepare him for CrossFit.
Sandone also served in Sadr City, aka Saddam City, a stronghold of the Iraqi Communist Party.
The Marine received a mixed welcome there -- friendly at times, the victim of potshots others.
There was always a unit out past the safety wire, Sandone said, and as squad leader he often led a team of six into danger.
"I didn't lose any of my men," he said.
The Marines were relieved, sent to southern Iraq, then home.
It was time for Sandone to move on from the Marines -- he'd stayed on past his original assignment as a "stop-loss" serviceman.
After a little more education, he "chose money or school" and worked in sales before getting into the gym business. (He works at Plastipak).
One gym failed. "I learned there to keep the overhead down," he said.
Sandone, who is heavily muscled, said CrossFit changed his workout from running and weight work to a larger group of exercises.
"I wasn't physically fit before," he said. "I look a certain way because I work out and eat right," mostly plant food.
He has a wife and two children.

Texto completo: The weapons used by the man who carried out the mass shooting in Las Vegas in 2017 may soon be sold to raise money for the families who lost loved ones in the event.

The gunman, Stephen Paddock, left behind 50 guns and 40 firearm components, including scopes and rifle cases, that a special administrator, appointed by a state court judge, determined is worth about $62,340, according to the New York Times.

Many of those firearms and components were found in the hotel room where Paddock was positioned when he shot down at the outdoor concert, killing 58. The rest were found at his two homes in Nevada.

“The money that would come from selling the guns is not a huge amount, but it would help to make a difference in people's lives,” said Alice Denton, the lawyer for the special administrator in the estate case.

She also suggested destroying the guns and other equipment.

“Destroying the guns would send more of a symbolic message to the world that weapons like these should not be sold at any price if death or harm to innocent people cannot be prevented.,” Denton said.

Denton is responsible for distributing Paddock’s almost $1.4 million estate to the families of the 58 people who were killed in the shooting.

The Las Vegas FBI field office declined to comment on if the weapons would be returned to Paddock’s estate.

When Paddock died without a will, Paddock’s heir, his mother, gave his assets to the estates of those killed in the mass shooting.

Democratic operatives used second bogus Facebook account against Roy Moore

Texto completo: Progressive Democrats used a second bogus Facebook page to wage a campaign of disinformation against former Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore in the run-up to 2018 midterm election, the New York Times reported Monday.

Weeks after revealing a Facebook page and Twitter campaign that sought to portray Moore's campaign as supported by Russian bots, the Times reported that out-of-state donors funded an effort called "Project Birmingham," which created a Facebook page that called for a statewide ban on alcohol.

The "Dry Alabama" page and an associated Twitter account expressed support for Moore against Democrat Doug Jones. The tactics, the Times noted, were similar to those carried out by Russian operatives seeking to influence the 2016 presidential election, and the goal was to pull business-minded Republicans away from Moore.

The Democratic operatives, posing as prohibitionists, also compared allegations of sexual misconduct thrown at Moore to the risks of alcohol consumption. Two of the operatives defended the "false flag" campaign.

“If you don’t do it, you’re fighting with one hand tied behind your back,” consultant Matt Osborne told the Times. “You have a moral imperative to do this — to do whatever it takes.”

The Times said it could not find evidence that Jones knew about the projects, and Jones has called for a federal investigation.

Beth Becker, a social media professional who handled Facebook ad spending for the Dry Alabama page told the Times a nondisclosure agreement prohibited her from saying much about the project.

"I don't think anything this group did crossed any lines," she said.

The group Investing in Us put $100,000 toward the Dry Alabama campaign and the first-reported campaign, respectively, according to the Times.

Osborne claimed Dry Alabama content was viewed 4.6 million times on Facebook and that videos published to the page were watched 430,000 times.

Jones, a Democrat, narrowly won the U.S. Senate seat in the deeply red state.

Are crosswords killing America?

Texto completo: A spectre is haunting the United States — the spectre of crosswords.
This seemingly innocent pastime is spreading like kudzu throughout the American media world. About a year ago, the lordly New Yorker magazine launched a weekly crossword, with clues that only a Bard graduate could love, e.g., “Field for Kristeva and Barthes." Answer: semiotics.
Not to be outdone, the venerable Atlantic magazine riposted with a daily crossword offering by Caleb Madison, the enfant terrible of Crossworld, who smuggled the phrase “Go Commando" into a New York Times puzzle last year. (Clue: “Leave one's drawers in the drawer, say.")
Coming online next week: Inkubator, a Concord, N.H., bimonthly crossword subscription by women (and “women-aligned") constructors. Inkubator follows two 2018 puzzle debuts, Patti Varol's Women of Letters crossword package, and Queer Qrosswords, a donor-supported package of 22 LGBT-themed puzzles. (QQ just announced a second package.)
Just a few days ago, the Times, which I call “the culinary-crossword conglomerate," in tribute to its successful monetization of puzzles and cooking content, published a Sunday supplement containing four — count 'em, four — crosswords. The section featured a cruciverbalist Big Gulp, a 90 x 90 grid, as opposed to the Times's daily 15 x 15 grid, assembled by Boston's Own Brendan Emmett Quigley, once credited with “making the New York Times crossword hip."
One could argue that the florescence of crosswords is a good thing. But is it? In a memorable anti-“puzzle people" screed, Slate's Ron Rosenbaum decried the “self-congratulatory assumption . . . that their addiction to the useless habit somehow proves they are smarter or more literate than the rest of us. Need I suggest that those who spend time doing crossword puzzles uselessly filling empty boxes (a metaphor for some emptiness in their lives?) — could be doing something else that involves words and letters? It's called reading ."
Puzzle fan and decorated actor John Lithgow agrees. Appearing on the Jimmy Fallon show after co-constructing a Times crossword with Quigley, Lithgow admitted, “You're always a little embarrassed to even confess that you do them because it's such a pointless waste of time. . . . What a waste of life!"
Are crosswords killing America? Let's do the math. It took me about an hour to finish one quadrant of Quigley's 90 x 90 puzzle, thus four hours had I finished. (This leaves out the countless hours I would have spent solving, or failing to solve, the puzzle's “meta" puzzle, which I ignored.) The Times prints about one million Sunday papers — this puzzle was print-only — and let's guesstimate that 1 in 10 readers figures among Rosenbaum's reviled “puzzle people."
So, rounding for time wasted on the meta-puzzle, that is 500,000 person-hours, or about 275 person-years, of wasted productivity for the American economy. On just one puzzle! Now think about the collective time sumps of daily puzzles in every major American newspaper — the mind boggles.
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, US productivity is half of what it was after World War II, and — MAGA-jabber notwithstanding — has become completely stagnant. Now we know why – crossword mania!
Invited to comment on the Crossword Crisis, the Times's puzzle editor Will Shortz waxed lighthearted: “As a crossword editor, I basically play all day, and I'd like to bring that same sense of playfulness to as many other people as possible. The public consequences be damned!"
And you ask why I fear for the Republic.
Forget about crosswords killing America – crosswords are killing me! Clue: “Relatives of kingfishers;" nine letters. I'll never solve this.
And so dies the American dream, one tiny, unfilled square at a time.

Family focus in budget plans; Newsom is set to propose new spending on early education and an expansion of paid parental leave.

Texto completo: California's new governor, who must send his first state budget plan to the Legislature this week, has already signaled a significant new focus on programs to help families and children from infancy to college.
Gov. Gavin Newsom campaigned on a platform that included a number of child-focused efforts aimed at helping lower-income families. The price tag for the initial efforts is expected to approach $2 billion -- a cost paid out of an unrestricted tax revenue windfall that could be one of the largest in state history.
Newsom might also seek help for families through new subsidies paid by California employers. He is expected to propose a dramatic expansion of paid parental leave -- from six weeks to six months -- according to an internal document provided by a source close to the Newsom transition team, first reported on Sunday by the New York Times.

The document doesn't offer a full explanation for how the program will be funded, saying instead that the budget will set "a goal of ensuring that all newborns and newly adopted babies can be cared for by a parent or a close family member for the first six months." Employers across the state are currently assessed a payroll tax that helps offer a subsidy to parents who temporarily leave their job to care for a newborn.
Newsom's plan, according to the document, would pay for some of the new costs by shrinking the mandated cash reserve of the state fund that administers the program, allowing more of the money to be paid in benefits. The increase in paid leave would not all happen at once but instead be phased in over several years.
A task force to help implement the expanded care plan is also envisioned, according to the document. It would determine whether two parents could split the six months of paid leave and whether an extended family member could be enlisted to help care for the child of a single parent over the six-month period.
The incoming administration's focus on young children will also include $1.8 billion in new spending on early childhood education programs, with a focus on training childcare workers and pushing for more California schools to offer full-day kindergarten. Those costs, according to an overview memo obtained by the Los Angeles Times, are considered a one-time expense while leaving the long-term costs of the effort to be determined later.
More community college students would get free tuition under a third initiative expected in the new governor's budget plan. Newsom will propose spending $40 million to offer a second year of tuition-free college to California students, according to an outline provided by a transition official, first reported by Politico. Students are already eligible for a single year of paid tuition under a plan agreed to by Gov. Jerry Brown and lawmakers in 2017.
Newsom, who was to be sworn in Monday, embraced the idea of free community college during the 2018 campaign as part of a broader focus on additional investments in higher education.
"Education is an economic development strategy," Newsom said at a higher education forum last spring. "We need to significantly increase the investment from the general fund of this state on higher education. There's no greater higher return on investment."
Whether the proposal would be targeted to students based on a family's financial need is unclear. Many low-income students are already eligible for fee waivers at community colleges. The governor must submit his full state budget plan to lawmakers no later than Thursday.

Texto completo: Tom Thibodeau, the Minnesota Timberwolves' coach and president, was abruptly fired on Sunday night -- after a 22-point victory.
Following a 108-86 rout at home against the LeBron James-less Los Angeles Lakers, Minnesota announced that it had ousted Thibodeau with two and a half seasons left on his five-year contract, and less than two months removed from the trade of the longtime Thibodeau favorite Jimmy Butler to the Philadelphia 76ers.
Ryan Saunders, son of the former Timberwolves coach Flip Saunders, was elevated to interim coach with the Wolves at 19-21 -- two games behind the eighth-seeded Lakers in the Western Conference. Saunders, 32, will be the N.B.A.'s youngest coach.
Thibodeau is the third N.B.A. coach to be fired this season, joining Fred Hoiberg of the Chicago Bulls and Tyronn Lue of the Cleveland Cavaliers.
It was widely presumed that Thibodeau would be in trouble at season's end if he failed to secure a playoff berth after the headline-making deterioration of Minnesota's relationship with Butler since the end of last season.
The timing of this change, though, suggests that the Timberwolves felt a need to create two prime vacancies before Hoiberg finds a new job.
The New York Times reported in December that the Wolves would probably be the only N.B.A. team to consider hiring Hoiberg to coach after his unsuccessful stint in Chicago, because of Hoiberg's close relationship with the Timberwolves' owner, Glen Taylor.
With Hoiberg also expected to be a serious candidate for U.C.L.A.'s coaching vacancy, Minnesota can now contend for his services.
ESPN reported Sunday night that the Wolves, though, are determined to keep the coaching and personnel roles separate in the future, meaning Hoiberg -- or anyone else they hire -- would have to choose one or the other.
Thibodeau's dismissal leaves San Antonio's Gregg Popovich as the only coach in the 30-team N.B.A. who also holds personnel power as team president. But even Popovich does not operate in that manner, delegating virtually all of his personnel power to the team president, R. C. Buford.
The Timberwolves ended a 13-year playoff drought last season by posting a 47-35 record, with Butler and the young center Karl-Anthony Towns emerging as All-Stars.
Butler, however, rebuffed Minnesota's offer of a contract extension in July in the first hint of his discontent. He ultimately asked for a trade days before the start of training camp in September -- despite a long association with Thibodeau dating to their days in Chicago.
Butler maintained that he had made his desire to leave Minnesota in free agency clear to the Wolves for months. But Thibodeau and his general manager, Scott Layden, did not begin to seek trades for Butler until training camp was underway and ultimately dealt him to Philadelphia on Nov. 12 for a package headlined by Dario Saric and Robert Covington. The team was 4-9 at the time.
"I said let's let it go and see how things worked and I think now, we've gone up through halfway through the season and I don't think we're where we thought we would be or where we think we should be," Taylor told The Minneapolis Star-Tribune.
"I'm just looking at the results. The results are that I don't think we should've lost against Phoenix or Detroit or New Orleans or Atlanta. Maybe one of those games. We just lost against a bunch of teams that we're a better team."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: Sick days among Transportation Security Administration employees have increased since a partial government shutdown beginning Dec. 22 left TSA personnel working without pay, the agency announced Friday.
An increase in call-outs — workers who say they are too sick to work their shifts — started over the holidays and has grown, but the phenomenon is causing a "minimal impact" on the security screening process at airports, the agency says in a tweet.
"Security effectiveness will not be compromised and performance standards will not change ... To date, however, screening wait times remain well within TSA standards," the statement said.
The information was released as a response to a CNN report saying mass TSA worker call-outs had affected four major airports. The New York Times also reported on the call-outs.
Of the 2.2 million passengers screened by the agency Thursday, 99.8 percent waited less than 30 minutes, according to the TSA statement.
As the shutdown enters its third week, tens of thousands of TSA agents are among federal employees who are working without pay.
President Donald Trump and lawmakers emerged Friday afternoon from their latest round of talks at the White House only to indicate that an agreement to end the partial shutdown could be a long way off. The shutdown occurred over Trump's demand for $5.6 billion to help pay for a border wall.

Powell: Fed 'will be patient' as it mulls more rate hikes, boosting stocks

Texto completo: Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Friday the central bank “will be patient” as it weighs future interest rate hikes in light of low inflation, adding that policymakers will also take into account recent stock market volatility.
Powell seemed to deliberately convey a more cautious approach to rate hikes this year than he did during a news conference last month after the Fed raised rates for a fourth time in 2018.
"With muted inflation readings that we've seen coming in, we will be patient as we watch to see how the economy evolves,” Powell said in a discussion with former Fed chairs Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke at the American Economic Association and Allied Social Science Association's annual meeting in Atlanta. The talk was moderated by New York Times reporter Neil Irwin.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, already up about 400 points after a booming jobs report, leaped another 400 points by early afternoon following Powell’s remarks.
Powell also said he would not resign if asked to do so by President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly criticized Powell for lifting rates and crimping the faster economic growth Trump has promised. Trump has reportedly discussed the possibility of firing Powell, news that further intensified a market sell-off last month.
A president can dismiss a Fed board member only “for cause,” and it’s unclear if he can remove a Fed chief who could continue to serve on the board. Experts, however, have said such a move would roil markets and jeopardize the Fed’s independence.
While Fed officials have been providing a generally upbeat view of the economy, Powell noted the market has plunged from its early fall peak because of fears of slowing global growth and the Trump administration’s trade fight with China, among other factors.
“We're listening carefully to that, and we’re going to be taking that downside risk into account” as Fed policymakers decide whether to raise interest rates, Powell said Friday.
He seemed to compare the Fed's flexible approach to early 2016, when the central bank forecast four rate hikes that year but wound up hiking just once amid a market sell-off, economic troubles abroad and a drop in oil prices.
"Powell’s message was unmistakable, in our opinion," says economist Michael Feroli of JPMorgan Chase.
Powell also said the Fed would be willing to pause its campaign to shrink the $3. 5 trillion portfolio of bonds that it purchased during and after the Great Recession to lower long-term interest rates – presumably if the economy weakened significantly.
“We said we’d be prepared to adjust” the plan “as appropriate to achieve our” objectives of solid economic growth and stable inflation, Powell said. “We wouldn’t hesitate to change it. ”
By contrast, at his December news conference, Powell reiterated the Fed’s view that the balance sheet reduction was on autopilot and the Fed was relying on its benchmark short-term interest rate to tweak the economy’s temperature. His remarks further fueled investor concerns that Powell and the Fed were blithely moving forward with a campaign to tap the brakes on the economy despite scant evidence of inflation, market turbulence, slowing global growth and forecasts for weakening activity in the U. S.
Fed officials instead focused on the economy’s recent performance, which has reflected healthy growth and unemployment that has dropped below 4 percent.
Last month, Fed policymakers forecast two rate hikes in 2019, down from its previous estimate of three, but fed fund futures markets were pricing in just one move. Lately, markets have expected none.
The stock market punished the Fed by plummeting further after Powell's December news conference, hurting consumer and business confidence and raising the prospect that the dimmer outlook could itself hurt the economy.
On Friday, Powell seemed to be acknowledging that he and other Fed officials got the message, and markets responded in kind.
"When we get conflicting signals, policy is very much about risk management," Powell said.

Texto completo: It's a warm and sunny day in Southern California. The players are lined up waiting for the disc to fly!
Yes, this a Frisbee, but since Frisbee is a toy that was trademarked by Wham-O in 1957, we'll stick with "disc." For the same reason, the sport is Ultimate, not Ultimate Frisbee. Got it?
The players streak down the field and set their positions. The disc starts to move.
A player on offense goes deep, looking to score. The disc is thrown her way.
But a defender is closing in.
They both jump in the air, reaching, reaching ... It's a goal!
The crowd responds -- encouragement from some, heckling from others. ThunderStix boom as one man plays his harmonica triumphantly.
This is the 50th anniversary of the U.S.A. Ultimate national championships, set in San Diego last October. New and familiar teams have come to play from all over the country.
At the start of every game, captains meet to flip the disc to determine opening possession.
They test the direction of the wind and then offense or defense lines are called. Game on!
They catch ...
they block ...
they jump ...
they bid.
The fans love it all. Notably, the small New York crowd made its presence known during the men's final between New York PoNY and San Francisco Revolver, filling the stadium with cheers.
Inevitably, fouls occur. In what U.S.A. Ultimate refers to as the "spirit of the game," the contests are self-officiated. If a player feels he or she is fouled, the action stops and the players meet to discuss. There are no officials, but "observers" help settle disputes and reach a consensus so play can resume.
Despite the best intentions, there are still controversies.
Still, the spirit of the game prevails throughout the fierce competition. Sportsmanship is respected, and it is not unusual to see players recognize and respect their opponents' effort and hustle. High-fives and spirit circles are familiar sights.
Ultimate is a small but growing sport. With an ethos of good sportsmanship, which was on display at the national championships, it should continue to grow for another 50 years.

Texto completo: Depending on who you talk to, dieting is life-changing, terrible for you, optimistic, misguided, will keep you alive or put you in an early grave.
Then there's all that lingo that comes with mastering the biological theories behind dieting, like ketosis and alkaline and lectin — phrases that make you feel like you're in a science class rather than just trying to shed a few pounds or live a healthier life.
Have no fear, because we've got a simplified guide for you about the trendiest diets of the new year — that self-conscious time when everyone's re-evaluating their lifestyle.
U.S. News and World Report has released its annual rankings of the Best Diets for 2019, revealing the Mediterranean diet was the best overall choice.
Each diet description below is a rating of its effectiveness, based on U.S. News and World Report rankings. We've included their findings, based on input from a panel of health experts, on weight loss and healthiness for each diet. While doing this study they took into account the diet being "relatively easy to follow, nutritious, safe, effective for weight loss and protective against diabetes and heart disease."
Here are the diet trends you're likely to see referenced in celebrity Instagram captions this year.
Ketogenic Perhaps the biggest fad that's riding its wave of popularity right into 2019 is the Ketogenic, or "Keto," diet. Celebs like Kourtney Kardashian, Al Roker and Vinny Guadagnino (who affectionately went by the nickname "Keto Guido" on the new seasons of "Jersey Shore") have popularized the diet. Ketogenic diets are low on carbs and high on fat, which puts the body in a state of ketosis. Ketosis is a metabolic state that happens when your body doesn't have enough carbohydrates for your cells to burn for energy. So, instead, it burns fat. The Keto diet is very effective at slimming your waistline, but does cause huge changes to your body that aren't always positive. U.S. News & World Report says that changing the way your body is fueled from carbs to fat can lead to leg cramps, dehydration, brain fog, dizziness and more.
U.S. News & World Report: 3.1/5 Weight Loss | 1.5/5 Healthy
Paleo The philosophy of this diet is in the name. The Paleo diet encourages people to eat foods that would have been available to our Paleolithic ancestors. In case you need to brush up on your high school science, the Paleolithic era started 2.5 million years ago. Basically, with this diet you're looking at meals that could either be hunted or gathered — lean meats, fish, vegetables, nuts and seeds. And, because farming hadn't been developed yet in the Paleolithic era, Paleo dieters are expected to cut out foods that became popularized through farming like dairy products, legumes and grains, as well. Those who follow the Paleo diet believe that modern eating habits don't suit our prehistoric genetic makeup, so we should return to Stone Age-approved meals.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.5/5 Weight Loss | 2.7/5 Healthy
Alkaline Diet Acid is the enemy of the Alkaline diet. The thought behind this diet is to cut out foods that cause your body to produce acid – including meat, wheat, refined sugar, processed foods, dairy, eggs, canned food, packaged snacks, caffeine and alcohol. You may be thinking: what else is there to eat? The Alkaline diet approves of most fruits and vegetables, nuts, legumes, soybeans and tofu. These are foods that are alkaline — in other words have a pH value of 7, which is neutral, or above. Foods with a pH value below 7 are acidic, and therefore a no-go. That said, there is no solid science to support that regulating the pH values of your food will change the overall pH balance of your body. It will do that naturally. However, in general, eating a lot of fruits and veggies and avoiding processed foods will make you lose weight.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.1/5 Weight Loss | 3.0/5 Healthy
Whole30 A popular diet that spurred a New York Times bestselling book, Whole30 encourages people to eat foods with as few ingredients as possible, and all those ingredients should be substances you know and can pronounce. The program's website claims that if you completely avoid foods such as alcohol, anything with added sugar, legumes, dairy and more, for 30 days, you will "eliminate cravings, restore a healthy metabolism, heal the digestive tract, reduce systemic inflammation, and discover how these foods are truly impacting how you look, how you feel, and your quality of life." This program also advocates not stepping on a scale, to make the diet more about health than weight loss.
U.S. News & World Report: 2.4/5 on Weight Loss | 2.4/5 on Healthy
Mediterranean The Mediterranean diet advocates heart-healthy foods that are typically eaten in the Mediterranean. The diet guides people to eat plenty of plants and foods that are low on "bad" cholesterol, such as legumes, nuts, wheat, fruits and veggies. For example, in this diet, you replace butter with healthy fats like olive oil, salt with herbs and spices, and red meat with fish and poultry. Plus, it totally encourages a glass of red wine every now and then. In essence, you're not avoiding fats and carbs, you're just choosing the healthier versions.
U.S. News & World Report: 3.0/5 on Weight loss | 4.9/5 on Healthy
A healthy diet doesn't require a complete life change. Instead, make smarter choices more often when shopping, cooking and eating.

Texto completo: A new year is a good reason to try something different. Here at Lester Public Library and in the other five libraries of the Manitowoc-Calumet Library System (MCLS), we are implementing a new community-wide reading program — MCLS Reads. We are proposing that our entire two-county library system, six communities in all, read the same book. We've chosen a book that has a great deal of local relevance, and we hope to inspire some interesting community discussions.
The title we have selected is "The Death and Life of the Great Lakes," by Dan Egan. Egan likes to say he may be the only journalist in America whose beat is the Great Lakes. A daily reporter for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Egan reports on everything from invasive species to oil spills to algae blooms. Much of that work — reported for the paper over the course of a decade — made itself into "The Death and Life of the Great Lakes."
Egan's book is a New York Times best-seller and, according to reviewer Robert Moor, the book "Nimbly splices together history, science, reporting and personal experiences into a taut and cautiously hopeful narrative. ... Egan's book is bursting with life (and yes, death)."
The Great Lakes hold 20 percent of the world's fresh water supply and the threats to it are real and urgent; Egan deftly portrays an ecological catastrophe happening right before our eyes, blending the epic story of the lakes with an examination of the perils they face and the ways we can restore and preserve them.
We'd like to invite all of you to try something new with us this year. Stop by the library, pick up a copy of the book (don't worry, we have LOTS of copies), and give it a read. We hope you'll learn something new and interesting and maybe have a greater appreciation for the lake we see daily and mostly take for granted. Then, join us for one of the community discussions that will be held in Two Rivers and Manitowoc (or Brillion, Chilton, Kiel or New Holstein) as we talk about the book.
We are hoping the experience will generate ideas and create discourse, giving us an opportunity learn new things and meet new people, and we'd like to invite everyone to be a part of that journey.
I will be hosting LPL's first community discussion on Egan's book at the Lester Public Library at 6:30 p.m. March 5. The following week, at 6 p.m. March 13, Dr. Titus Seilheimer, the fisheries outreach specialist for the University of Wisconsin Sea Grant Institute, will kick off our Scholar for Life Series. His lecture will build on the stories in Dan Egan's book and dig deeper into the issues affecting us today and into the future. While we're hoping you'll have read the book, we invite you to attend either or both events, even if you haven't started or finished the book yet. We think you'll find the discussions fascinating and enlightening.
Each library will be hosting a variety of different events surrounding this book and topic. Please check your library's event calendar to see what's going on locally or check out the MCLS Reads Facebook for a complete listing. We've got some fun things planned, so stay tuned.
Start your new year off with something new. Participate in the first-ever MCLS Reads, and let's discover together!

TRUMP'S TERRIBLE TAX CUT MOST AMERICANS WILL BE WORSE OFF THANKS TO THE PRESIDENT'S ONLY MAJOR LEGISLATIVE ACCOMPLISHMENT

Texto completo: The 2017 tax cut has received pretty bad press, and rightly so. Its proponents made big promises about soaring investment and wages, and also assured everyone that it would pay for itself; none of that has happened.
Yet coverage actually hasn't been negative enough. The story you mostly read runs something like this: The tax cut has caused corporations to bring some money home, but they've used it for stock buybacks rather than to raise wages, and the boost to growth has been modest. That doesn't sound great, but it's still better than the reality: No money has, in fact, been brought home, and the tax cut has probably reduced national income. Indeed, at least 90 percent of Americans will end up poorer thanks to that cut.
Let me explain each point in turn.
First, when people say that U.S. corporations have "brought money home" they're referring to dividends overseas subsidiaries have paid to their parent corporations. These did indeed surge briefly in 2018, as the tax law made it advantageous to transfer some assets from the books of those subsidiaries to the home companies; these transactions also showed up as a reduction in the measured stake of the parents in the subsidiaries, i.e., as negative direct investment.
But these transactions are simply rearrangements of companies' books for tax purposes; they don't necessarily correspond to anything real. Suppose that Multinational Megacorp USA decides to have its subsidiary, Multinational Mega Ireland, transfer some assets to the home company. This will produce the kind of simultaneous and opposite movement in dividends and direct investment. But the company's overall balance sheet - which always included the assets of MM Ireland - hasn't changed at all. No real resources have been transferred; MM USA has neither gained nor lost the ability to invest here.
If you want to know whether investable funds are really being transferred to the U.S., you need to look at the overall balance on financial account - or, what should be the same (and is more accurately measured), the inverse of the balance on current account. On this score, basically nothing has happened.
So the tax cut induced some accounting maneuvers but did nothing to promote capital flows to America.
The tax cut did, however, have one important international effect: We're now paying more money to foreigners.
Bear in mind that the one clear, overwhelming result of the tax cut is a big break for corporations: Federal tax receipts on corporate income have plunged.
The key point to realize is that, in today's globalized corporate system, a lot of any country's corporate sector, our own very much included, is actually owned by foreigners, either directly, because corporations here are foreign subsidiaries, or indirectly, because foreigners own American stocks. Indeed, roughly a third of U.S. corporate profits basically flow to foreign nationals - which means that a third of the tax cut flowed abroad, rather than staying at home. This probably outweighs any positive effect on GDP growth. So the tax cut probably made America poorer, not richer.
And it certainly made most Americans poorer. While two-thirds of the corporate tax cut may have gone to U.S. residents, 84 percent of stocks are held by the wealthiest 10 percent of the population. Everyone else will see hardly any benefit.
Meanwhile, since the tax cut isn't paying for itself, it will eventually have to be paid for some other way - either by raising other taxes or by cutting spending on programs people value. The cost of these hikes or cuts will be much less concentrated on the top 10 percent than the benefit of the original tax cut. So it's a near-certainty that the vast majority of Americans will be worse off thanks to President Donald Trump's only major legislative success.
As I said, even the mainly negative reporting doesn't convey how bad a deal this whole thing is turning out to be.

Experts ponder scope of Shanahan's interim role

Texto completo: The Trump administration's contention that acting defense secretary Patrick Shanahan can stay in his new role "indefinitely" without being nominated as the permanent Pentagon chief could face constitutional challenges, according to legal experts, who were split on whether those protests would go anywhere.
Shanahan took over the job Tuesday following the resignation of Jim Mattis, and he has held the role of deputy defense secretary since July 2017. A U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter, said Friday that Shanahan could serve in an acting capacity indefinitely at Trump's discretion.
Trump claimed in late December that "everybody and his uncle" and "everybody and his aunt" has interest in becoming defense secretary. He added that Shanahan "could be there for a long time" but did not say whether he meant in an acting capacity.
Other possible candidates floated in White House discussions include Jim Webb, who served as secretary of the Navy and an assistant secretary of defense under the Reagan administration before swapping parties and serving one term as a Democratic senator from Virginia. Three people familiar with the administration's reasoning, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the situation, confirmed the discussions had taken place. The New York Times first reported the administration was considering Webb.
Webb, who launched a bid for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2015, shares Trump's disdain for lengthy military interventions abroad and served in Vietnam as a Marine officer, earning a Navy Cross.
However, in a tweet on Friday, Trump denied Webb is being considered. "I'm sure he is a fine man, but I don't know Jim, and never met him. Patrick Shanahan, who is Acting Secretary of Defense, is doing a great job!"
Speculation about Shanahan's future comes as the Pentagon attempts to project an air of normalcy following the departure of Mattis, a widely respected retired Marine general. In his Dec. 20 resignation letter, Mattis offered to stay in office through Feb. 28 to ensure a smooth transition, but Trump abruptly installed Shanahan three days later.
The administration's determination that Shanahan could hold the job on a temporary basis in perpetuity is likely based, in part, on the Goldwater-Nichols Act, which outlines the principles for civilian control of the military.
Arnold L. Punaro, a retired two-star Marine general who assisted in the act's creation, said there is no limit under the law on how long a confirmed deputy defense secretary can stay in the role.
However, the law's framers never intended to have someone carry out those duties indefinitely, he said.
Still, Shanahan's indefinite stay could face legal challenges.
Stephen I. Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law, said there is no legal dispute over whether Shanahan can serve as acting defense secretary for a short period because he was already confirmed as deputy defense secretary.
"The harder question is whether the Constitution allows him to serve in that role indefinitely," Vladeck said. "The longer he continues to hold that position, the more likely that someone will seek to litigate that issue in court."
A challenge, Vladeck said, could come under the appointments clause of the Constitution, which states that the president shall nominate Cabinet officials "by and with the advice and consent of the Senate."
Legal expert Anne Joseph O'Connell of Stanford Law School agreed that there was no time limit on a deputy secretary serving as an acting secretary, "but the Constitution may impose some limits on acting in the very top jobs." She said no legal decisions directly address the point but that she believes the courts will allow acting officials only on a temporary basis.
Martin S. Lederman, a visiting associate professor at Georgetown University Law Center, said Trump should nominate a new defense secretary as soon as possible. However, he said it would not violate the appointments clause to leave Shanahan in place because the Senate had already confirmed him as deputy defense secretary.
The situation is not the same with the attorney general, Lederman said. Trump's decision to fire Jeff Sessions and appoint former federal prosecutor Matthew G. Whitaker in an acting role without a confirmation hearing for any post "truly is a legal problem."
In that case, Trump bypassed Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein to do so.
Under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, Shanahan can carry out defense secretary duties for 210 days, said Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University Law School. That limit can be extended if Trump nominates someone else to hold the job permanently.
The greatest obstacle for those who would seek to prevent Shanahan from holding the job temporarily for a sustained period is timing, Turley said.
Trump will probably have a nominee within 210 days, and any litigation would probably take longer to address, he said.
"There is roughly two years left to the administration," Turley said. "Critics are running out of runway for such challenges as we get into 2019."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - If Republicans have a lick of sense, they are alarmed by a recent sign of intelligent life in the other party. The sign is the election by Democrats in the House of Representatives of Illinois Rep. Cheri Bustos as chairwoman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. In November she won a fourth term by 24 percentage points, the largest margin of any Democrat running in a district Donald Trump carried in 2016. Her task as chairwoman, which is to cement the Democrats' House majority in 2020, involves this arithmetic:
In this new Congress, 31 Democrats will represent districts Trump carried. In 2018, 40 Democrats flipped districts from red to blue - 41, if the Democrat wins the North Carolina race clouded by allegations of vote fraud. Twenty-two Democrats won by 5 percentage points or less. Twenty-three lost by 5 points or less. Democrats have noticed that Bustos prospers in a mostly rural district that extends along the Mississippi from the Wisconsin border to a portion of Peoria. Sixty percent of the district's residents live in towns with populations of 1,000 or fewer, 85 percent are in towns of 5,000 or fewer. In November, she won all of her district's 14 counties, 11 of which are entirely rural.
What lessons can Democrats learn from her success among Trump voters? They might start by marrying a cop. She says she gets "instant credibility" by telling audiences that her husband, who has been in law enforcement for 34 years, is the sheriff of Rock Island County. Regarding guns, it is helpful if one of your sons finished second in the national collegiate trap-shooting competition. It also is helpful if another son is a union welder.
Favorable trends might tempt Democrats to think they can thrive without the voters Bustos reaches. The Economist, noting that Trump's approval rating is "stratified by age," reports that baby boomers - those born between 1946 and 1964 - who have been America's largest age cohort for more than five decades, will in 2019 be outnumbered by millennials, those born between 1981 and 1996. Boomers are - were; they are shuffling off stage - almost 75 percent white; millennials are 56 percent white. In this year's midterm elections, Democrats won two-thirds of voters ages 18 to 29, and 71 percent of millennial women.
Furthermore, the GOP, which thinks of itself as the redoubt of the devout, is competing in an increasingly secular country. The Economist says that "Nones" - people with no religion - "already outnumber Catholics and mainline Protestants," and in 2019 might outnumber evangelicals. "There will soon be more Nones than any single group of Christians." Ex-Catholics are 13 percent of the American population.
Furthermore, The New York Times reports that with the Democrats' capture of New York's 11th Congressional District, which includes Staten Island and part of Brooklyn, Republicans now hold no "truly urban" district. Since Republicans lost four Orange County, Calif., seats in November - the Democrats lost only two seats nationally - there is now no Republican from there in Congress for the first time since 1940. And no Republicans from New England.
If, however, Democrats aspire to be less of a coastal party - come January, there will be more House Democrats from California than from 36 other states combined - they should want to emulate Bustos' success among voters she calls "Trump triers," those who are less than his devoted acolytes.
Republicans can hope that in 2020, with Trump presumably at the top of their ticket, the turnout will be much larger and very unlike that of 2018. But analyst Charlie Cook, citing Michael McDonald of the United States Elections Project, says the 2018 turnout of 50.1 percent was the highest of any midterm election since 1914. David Wasserman of the Cook Political Report says Republicans lost 96 percent of House contests in districts Trump either lost or carried by less than 7 points.
Bustos sometimes connects with her constituents by asking them what they do for fun. When one woman answered "cable television," Bustos asked if her family did not go out to movies. No, the woman replied, four tickets and popcorn exceed the family's budget. This answer spoke volumes about the constituent's disposable income. Bustos' question revealed a well-honed political intuition. Democrats, she says, have to "own" districts like hers, "not rent them." This is what ownership looks like: Her four margins of victory have been 6 percentage points, 11, 20 and 24.

Texto completo: BEIJING - China reached a milestone in space exploration on Thursday, landing a vehicle on the far side of the moon for the first time in history, the country's space agency announced.
The landing of the probe, called Chang'e-4 after the moon goddess in Chinese mythology, is one in a coming series of missions that underscore the country's ambitions to join - and even lead - the space race.
China landed another rover on the moon in 2013, joining the United States and the Soviet Union as the only nations to have carried out a "soft landing" there, but the Chang'e-4 is the first to touch down on the side of the moon that perpetually faces away from the Earth.
The mission "has opened a new chapter in humanity's exploration of the moon," the China National Space Administration said in an announcement on its website. The agency said the spacecraft landed at 10:26 a.m. Beijing time at its target on the far side of the moon.
The probe sent back to Earth the first close-up image of the moon's far side using a relay satellite China calls "Queqiao," or "Magpie Bridge," the space agency said in a notice that included images it said were taken by the probe.
Although a latecomer by decades to space exploration, China is quickly catching up, experts say, and could challenge the United States for supremacy in artificial intelligence, quantum computing and other fields.
"This space mission shows that China has reached the advanced world-class level in deep space exploration," said Zhu Menghua, a professor at the Macau University of Science and Technology who has worked closely with the Chinese space agency. "We Chinese people have done something that the Americans have not dared try."
China now plans to begin fully operating its third space station by 2022, to put astronauts in a lunar base by later in that decade and to send probes to Mars, including ones that could return samples of the Martian surface back to Earth.
Though the moon is hardly untrodden ground after decades of exploration, a new landing is far more than just propaganda coup, experts say.
The crater where the Chinese landed is the oldest and deepest on the moon, so the probe's discoveries may offer insights into the moon's origins and evolution. And some scientists suspect that the surrounding basin may be rich in minerals. If exploiting the moon's resources is the next step in space development, a successful mission could leave the Chinese better positioned.
"This is a major achievement technically and symbolically," said Namrata Goswami, an independent analyst who wrote about space for the Defense Department's Minerva Research Institute. "China views this landing as just a steppingstone, as it also views its future manned lunar landing, since its long-term goal is to colonize the moon and use it as a vast supply of energy."
The place the probe is exploring, Goswami said, could become a future refueling base for missions deeper into space in the way "navies viewed coaling stations, for purposes of refueling and resupply."

Sinema's dress draws attention at swearing-in

Texto completo: Kyrsten Sinema and Martha McSally made history Thursday, becoming the first two women from Arizona sworn into the U.S. Senate.
Sinema made even more history than that, becoming the first openly bisexual person in the Senate.
So, naturally, everyone talked about her dress.
OK, maybe not everyone. But a lot of people on social media took note of Sinema's outfit, which a non-fashion expert can best describe as a pink coat worn over a sleeveless white blouse with matching bracelet and flower-print skirt; she also wore a fur-looking thingamajig over her shoulders for the actual swearing-in.
Twitter took note. And how.
Mary Emily O'Hara, associate editor at @INTO, tweeted, "Kyrsten Sinema is sworn in today as the nation's first openly bisexual senator and the first-ever Mamie Van Doren cosplayer in congress."
There were plenty of other tweets and mentions — Dolores Umbridge, High Inquisitor of Hogwarts in the "Harry Potter" series, came up a few times, among other references. So, too, did Elle Woods, Reese Witherspoon's character in "Legally Blonde."
Why does this matter? Probably in the big scheme of things it doesn't. After all, no one was commenting on Vice President Mike Pence's dark suit and blue tie (though it was some tie) that he wore as he swore Sinema and McSally in. (For her part, McSally's purple dress didn't generate a lot of social-media chatter, either. But maybe it should have — it was a nice bipartisan purple, which may say something about bipartisanship. Or not.)
But there were some notable things about Sinema's outfit — particularly the color of her coat: pink. Remember, during the campaign (Sinema defeated McSally; Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey appointed McSally), McSally went after Sinema for protesting the Iraq war while wearing a pink tutu. There are a lot of colors in the world's prism, and Sinema chose the same one she was mocked for wearing.
Andrew Kaczynski, a reporter for CNN, tweeted, "One of attacks from Republicans on Sinema during the campaign was she worn a pink tutu while protesting Iraq — which Republicans attempted to label as denigrating service members. I can't help but thinking this is an elaborate troll."
Others found political motivation, too, sort of. Constance Grady, a culture writer for Vox, tweeted, "Can we talk about the incredibly weaponized femininity Kyrsten Sinema is bringing to the party for her swearing in."
Virginia Heffernan, a contributing editor at Wired and a columnist for the Los Angeles Times, was more forthright: "If there is a gender on earth that doesn't want to have sex with Kyrsten Sinema I don't want to be right."
To be sure, there was some backlash toward those making fashion-choice comments, and it was a notable day for fashion all the way around. The New York Times, in promoting a story, tweeted, "Nancy Pelosi, wearing a hot pink dress, ascended to the marble dais in the center of the House chamber to accept the wooden gavel."
That went over predictably poorly; not long after the Times tweeted the following: "We've deleted an earlier tweet to this article that was poorly framed."
But in general the vibe seemed to be more celebratory than anything else. How long that lasts is anyone's guess.
And it makes you wonder: What will Sinema wear tomorrow? And should we care?

Celebrate 'Crazy Rich Asians,' flaws and all. It has redefined Hollywood and being Asian.

Texto completo: Given the polarized racial climate of our society, it is all too easy to pick a side. “ 'Crazy Rich Asians' is going to change Hollywood. It's about time,” reads the headline on Karen K. Ho’s optimistic article for Time magazine. She extols “the first modern story with an all-Asian cast and an Asian-American lead in 25 years,” and she’s not wrong.
But then again, neither is the opposite take. “For some viewers, ‘Crazy Rich Asians’ is not Asian enough,” Mike Ives counters in The New York Times, citing descriptions of the film as “problematic” and “oppressive. ”
We laud this movie as a cinematic masterpiece and disregard its defects, or we point out its faults and discredit its significance as a culturally revolutionary film. Now that the dust has settled, and "Crazy Rich Asians" has been nominated for two Golden Globe awards, we mustn’t overlook the insight the film grants us if we don't reduce it to a good-bad binary.
We all know cultural appropriation is bad. Before I was capable of understanding what the words meant, I knew they were dirty.

'Black Panther' highlights Africa's centuries of greatness, empowers students of color
Why 'Crazy Rich Asians' made me cry
#MeToo and inclusion riders are great. But should I worry about my son?
The sentiment was everywhere. My elementary school teachers showed me villainized photos of rice-farmer Halloween costumes, warning us of the insensitive bigots we could inadvertently become if we weren’t careful. My Cantonese mother imbued me with a visceral aversion to Oriental-theme parties, which threatened cultural erasure by perpetuating stereotypes that all Asians are the same.
These lessons served me well. I implicitly knew that cultural appropriation should be avoided at all costs, and I was also aware that it could happen by accident. I understood the offense many took when Scarlett Johansson was cast as lead Motoko Kusanagi in the live action version of the Japanese manga “Ghost in the Shell,” and the way it potentially trivialized Asian culture to a movie theme while suggesting that Asian actors and actresses themselves are less than desirable.
When "Crazy Rich Asians" hit theaters several months ago, I was similarly disgruntled. I gasped at the outdated, Confucian, misogynistic stereotype the film perpetuated by suggesting that powerful Asian women must sacrifice their careers, and frowned at the cherry-picked dumpling parties and mahjong games that threatened to reduce Asian culture to a means of entertainment. Under the false guise of economic profitability, the film homogenized the term "Asian," supplanting sub-Asian diversity with a myopically fair-skinned, wealthy, British-accented version.
'Crazy Rich Asians' makes Asians seem sexy
Yet no offense was taken. Instead, Asians and non-Asians alike overlooked these deficiencies, labeled "Crazy Rich Asians" a cinematic triumph, and declared it the momentous step forward that the industry so direly needed.
To my surprise, I largely agreed.
In case you haven’t heard enough about the #OscarsSoWhite cinematic environment in which we find ourselves, "Crazy Rich Asians" is monumental. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences was more than 92 percent white as recently as 2016, and the last full-Asian cast took place a quarter-century ago.
The film turns Singaporean society to an opulent potpourri of food, cars and glamour, making Asianness seem enviable in the process. In fact, in glorifying the Asian romance between Nick Young and Rachel Chu, "Crazy Rich Asians" actually makes Asians themselves sexy.
Cultural appropriation and celebration, too
In certain respects, "Crazy Rich Asians" certainly does commit cultural appropriation, and we must be prepared to acknowledge that. Yet if we stubbornly degrade it as a failure to embrace Asian culture, we lose sight of the unprecedented wave of Asian popularity that it has catalyzed, redefining our perception of Asianness in and outside of cinema. Cultural appropriation and cultural celebration, despite popular opinion, are not mutually exclusive.
At a time when Hollywood is trying to change, this proof of coexistence could not be any more pertinent. While the #OscarsSoWhite movement speaks to a lack of representation, it simultaneously illustrates a decisive awareness and calls attention to progress that can’t be ignored. Last year's "Black Panther," for instance, paralleled "Crazy Rich Asians" in its attempt to revolutionize cinematic representation and cultural norms.
On a less dramatic scale, "If Beale Street Could Talk" (which opened last month) and "Miss Bala" (opening Feb. 1) constantly question the cinematic portrayal of culture. We can either swallow our qualms about cultural appropriation and accept it as a necessary evil, or we can negate the potential of film to redefine cultural norms in the same way "Crazy Rich Asians" has.
Even when the excitement over "Crazy Rich Asians" fades, its redefinition of cultural appropriation will remain critical. Let’s not forget this nuance during awards season.

How Did We Get To This Place?

Texto completo: Editor,
Need it be repeated?
Denial is not a river in Egypt!
I consulted the Dec. 10 Wall Street Journal, aka “Chamber of Commerce Daily.” (How is this newspaper able to command $4 when the greatest paper in the world, The New York Times, only charges $3?)
It seems that conservatives at any and all times never permit themselves to reject Trumpism bluntly and publicly. The president’s bold and reckless presentation has them totally snookered; the other side remains confounded at their enthusiasm.
On the matter of indebtedness, the Journal on this day featured two interesting (and unusual) articles. An op-ed wants to proclaim the Trump Tax stokes a healthy economy into the foreseeable future.
Like the George W. Bush taxes of 2001 and 2003, its success will have a short duration. Bush’s lasted but two years and Reagan’s back in 1981, nary three and a half years.
Budget Director David Stockton said in 1985 that it had been a gross failure. It was “trickle down” economics, which would be tried again and again - even to now as we are gradually coming to an end of W’s debt. No, John Hollenback, it was never Barack Obama; he did less discretionary spending (much less) than anyone since Dwight D. Eisenhower.
The second article is the editorial, and it is equally obtuse: The special counsel’s probe should end post haste. The truth is that Robert Swan Mueller III’s superb team needs yet a little more time to get to the bottom of it.
Donald John Trump provides an unprecedented challenge. How so? He thought like everyone else that he had no chance of winning the 2016 election. He didn’t, however, want to lose badly. In fact, he wanted to make it as close as possible in order to enhance his credibility. Maybe then he could dramatically rebound to build the Trump Media Empire, to the satisfaction of his zealous followers.
That is the reason for the onslaught of such irregular campaign behavior ... large and irresponsible and unethical. He never sought to exercise control over the miasma.
That is the reason we are now in this place.

Texto completo: Taxes, everyone's favorite subject.
There's been a lot of buzz about the new tax reform bill this year. Change is always hard, and taxes are harder. And with all the changes taking place this year, the thought of filing your taxes can feel overwhelming at best. While most of these changes should simplify the process, a lot of people are wondering how this reform will impact them and their bank accounts.
The good news is there are some nice things in store for most people with the tax reform. Let's walk through a few you should know before filing your taxes.
Updated Tax Brackets and Lower Income Tax Rates
The new tax brackets and income tax rates are one of the most talked about changes when it comes to the tax reform. The main thing you should know is that the seven tax brackets we already have in place will stay that way, but tax rates for each are going down through 2025. For example, if you're single making $50,000 a year, your tax rate will drop from 25 percent to 22 percent. In 2026, these cuts will expire, unless there is another bill in the future that changes. For now, people are paying less in taxes.
The New Standard Deduction
The standard deduction is dollar amount that you're able to deduct from your taxable income. Under the new reform, the standard deduction has nearly doubled! Before the reform, the standard deduction for an individual was $6,350. Now, it's $12,000. For a married couple it used to be $12,700, and that has gone up to $24,000. So, if you're single and would normally do an itemized deduction, if it equals less than $12,000 you would take the standard deduction instead.
Changes for Married Couples
Married couples will rejoice this tax season. Before the tax reform, some married taxpayers were bumped into a higher tax bracket when they combined their incomes. The new tax brackets have doubled for people filing jointly, so no more marriage penalties this time!
Updated Child Tax Credit
People with kiddos will be happy with at least one part of the new tax reform. Previously, parents who made less than $110,000 jointly and $75,000 individually received a $1,000 tax credit for qualified children under age 17. Now, that credit has increased to $2,000 and the income limits were raised to $400,000 jointly and $200,000 individually. If you have kids and fall below those income levels, that's $2,000 back in your pocket!
More Reason to Give
If there wasn't enough incentive for charitable giving before, there is now. Before these changes, taxpayers used to be able to deduct up to half of their income in qualified charitable donations. That limit has been increased to 60 percent of your income!
These are just a few of the changes from the reform. If you still feel overwhelmed, don't worry. Even the IRS is scrambling to keep up with the changes this year. If there ever was a time to consider hiring a professional to do your taxes, this would be the time to do it. You don't want to guess on your taxes!

Pre-Kindergarten Program Is Shining As New York City's Schools Struggle

Texto completo: [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox. ]
A well-placed, orderly sandbox. Teachers who laugh often. Plenty of miniature tables and chairs.
Those are markers of an excellent pre-K classroom. And New York City, home to the largest citywide prekindergarten initiative in the country, has these features -- and many more -- in the vast majority of its programs, according to new data shared with The New York Times.
In 2018, about 94 percent of the city's pre-K programs met or exceeded a threshold that predicts positive student outcomes after pre-K, according to a national evaluation system, the Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale, developed by a coalition of experts.
This means that as Mayor Bill de Blasio's signature initiative -- public pre-K for all 4-year-olds in New York City -- gets bigger, it is also improving.
In 2013, there were only 19,000 New York City children enrolled in pre-K; Mr. de Blasio's initiative launched in 2014 and now enrolls about 70,000 pre-K students.
The new data represents a big jump from the first time the mayor's pre-K system was evaluated in 2015, when just 77 percent of the programs were found to be up to par. So it is not just that existing programs are improving; many of the new pre-Ks joining the initiative are already high quality.
"The hardest thing is getting instructional quality at scale across thousands of classrooms," said Shael Polakow-Suransky, the president of Bank Street College of Education and a former top education official under Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. New York appears to have succeeded so far.
Universal pre-K has provided Mr. de Blasio with one of his clearest political wins and perhaps his best shot at the national prominence that he has long sought. The program was implemented relatively smoothly, is broadly popular and continues to pay dividends for a mayor who has not reached the same level of success with the rest of his education agenda.
Mr. de Blasio's high-profile plan for struggling schools, known as Renewal, was a disappointment and is set to end in the coming months. The city will have spent nearly $800 million on that plan, but it did not have a major impact on academic performance in those schools.
Mr. de Blasio has also faced criticism from advocates who want him to take more forceful action to racially integrate city schools.
When city inspectors enter pre-K classrooms, they are looking for things a parent who simply sees a room of exuberant toddlers might miss.
There should be a clear nap schedule, students who know how to wash their hands by themselves and lots of opportunities for children to talk. There should be few instances when the whole class is gathered together on the rug, and instead children should be playing in small groups.
And when children misbehave, the teacher should not yell or berate them. Instead, teachers should tell students what they did wrong and what they should do better next time.
New York City's pre-K programs scored especially high on students' language and reasoning skills and interaction among children, and scored lowest on the "personal care routines" category.
The work is far from over, both in New York and in cities experimenting with large pre-K programs around the country. Research has shown that if students move from excellent pre-Ks to mediocre kindergarten and first-grade classes, the gains achieved in pre-K can evaporate. As New York's pre-K expands and becomes more successful, the city should focus on improving its early elementary school instruction, Mr. Polakow-Suransky said.
"If we're going to be a model, we need to pay attention to the places other folks have struggled," he said. This year, the city added more reading coaches in an attempt to assist teachers instructing elementary school students.
The second phase of the mayor's early childhood education plan is just beginning. In 2017, Mr. de Blasio announced the expansion of pre-K into a program for 3-year-olds, now commonly known as 3-K.
The program currently serves about 5,000 children in six mostly low-income neighborhoods. 3-K will be available throughout the city in 2021 -- if City Hall can secure $700 million in funding from the state or federal government before then.
Expanding city schools into a system that runs from 3 to 18 years old will present big challenges.
As part of the 3-K expansion, Mr. de Blasio's administration will have to find suitable space for thousands of toddlers. In addition, the program will confront a longstanding issue: salary disparities among early childhood teachers in different types of schools. Plus, the mayor will have to bring much of the city infrastructure that supports infants and toddlers under the Department of Education, rather than the Administration for Children's Services.
But 3-K offers significant opportunities, said Kendra Hurley of the Center for New York City Affairs at the New School, who has studied the issue.
Under pre-K and now 3-K, she said, New York "can follow kids from birth onto high school."

Local Native Set To Become State Senator

Texto completo: President Donald Trump’s election in 2016 bumped up Lindsey Williams’ plans.
The Wyoming Borough native, lawyer and Democrat hoped to run for public office someday, just not so soon.
Even though Trump won over many working families, his election left Williams feeling as if they would get left out.
“It was more that I wanted to see people fighting for working families, that’s what upset me,” Williams said. “I wanted to see actual movement to protect unions, to protect teachers, to fight for funding for education, to fight for an increase in the minimum wage.”
That turned her into a candidate for the state Senate.
Today, after a tough election and a bit of post-election controversy, Williams, 35, will take the oath of office as the new senator representing the 38th state Senate District, which covers communities outside of Pittsburgh in Allegheny County’s North Hills.
Her district includes all or part of nine boroughs and townships that overlap with the 33rd House District represented by state House Democratic Leader Frank Dermody, a 1969 Abington Heights High School graduate.
Williams, who lives in West View, graduated from Wyoming Area High School in 2001, earned a bachelor’s degree in political science and sociology from Dickinson College in 2005 and a law degree from Duquesne University in 2008.
From there, she went to work as director of advocacy at the National Whistleblower Center in Maryland, but got fired in November 2012 as she and another lawyer aimed to unionize the center’s workforce. They took their case to the National Labor Relations Board, which issued an unfair labor practices complaint against the center for firing them because they tried to form a union, according to a December 2015 New York Times story.
Effectively, they blew the whistle on the whistleblower center.
Williams and the other lawyer eventually settled the case against the center for an undisclosed sum. She moved on to join the Teamster union as a campaign strategist in Washington, D.C., she said.
In October 2014, she accepted a job at the Pittsburgh Federation of Teachers. On Nov. 6, 2014, she said in a sworn affidavit, she moved in with friends in the 38th district until she could find her own apartment. She also came home to visit her parents, Jack and Nancy Williams, a weekend earlier, signaling her intent to move to the state, she said.
That was critical because Nov. 6, 2014, is exactly four years before her election. The state constitution requires a state senator to live in the district he or she represents for at least four years before being elected.
After a brutal campaign, Williams defeated Republican Jeremy Shaffer by 793 votes - 62, 361 to 61,568 - or 0.64 percentage points, out of almost 124,000 votes cast.
Her win helped Democrats trim the Republican advantage in the Senate to 29-21 from 34-16 and represented the only Republican-held district in western Pennsylvania that Democrats flipped to their side in the 2018 election.
While the results became official earlier this month, it wasn’t clear until Friday that Senate Republican leaders would allow Williams’ swearing in.
They questioned whether she lived in the district the minimum four years. She convinced them by providing the sworn affidavit about moving in with friends and more than 100 documents, including tax returns and bank and credit card statements, she said.
She trained in 2016 to run for office in Emerge Pennsylvania, a program that educates women on how to run.
Knowing Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton beat Trump in the 38th district, Williams saw an opportunity to run earlier than expected.
“It was an opportunity where people were excited and paying attention and I thought that I had a lot to offer as somebody who spent my career fighting for working families and decided that it was time to my name on the ballot,” Williams said.
Last February, she began knocking on doors.
“I knocked on thousands of doors. Honestly, that’s my favorite part, that’s where I come from, that’s how I started as a volunteer was knocking on doors,” she said. “That’s the best way to know your voters and earn their vote to really talk to them on their porch about the issues they care about.”
Her father helped, traveling each Thursday to Pittsburgh and staying through the weekend knocking on doors. Jack Williams is a retired member of International Union of Operating Engineers Local 542 District 3 in Plains, and unions were big supporters, she said.
“I think it’s hard to feel that (confident of victory as a campaign unfolds),” she said. “I think you have really great days and you have days where you get beat up a little bit. But for me when I was feeling a little beat up, that’s when I spent some more time door knocking. Those were the conversations that get you through, where somebody tells you what’s been happening in their community and you get to really learn.”
She started organizing her Senate office this month and has already signed on as a co-sponsor of bills that would require health insurance companies doing business in Pennsylvania to live up to the Affordable Care Act in case the United States Supreme Court declares the law unconstitutional.
