Texto completo: The not-a-stimulus deal Congress reached over the weekend — seriously, this is about disaster relief, not boosting the economy — didn’t come a moment too soon. Actually, it came much too late: Crucial aid to many unemployed Americans and businesses expired months ago. But now some of that aid is back, for a while.
True, the aid will be less generous than it was in the spring and summer: $300 a week in enhanced unemployment benefits, rather than $600. But because the workers still out of a job as a result of the pandemic tended to have low earnings even before the coronavirus struck, they will, on average, be receiving something like 85% of their pre-COVID-19 income.
By the way, although the one-time $600 checks to a much wider group of Americans are getting much of the media coverage, they account for only a small percentage of the overall expense and are far less crucial than the unemployment benefits to keeping families afloat.
So what’s not to like about this relief package? There’s some dumb stuff, like a tax break for corporate meal expenses — fighting a deadly pandemic with three-martini lunches. But the serious problem with this deal is that economic aid will end far too soon: Enhanced unemployment benefits will last just 11 weeks. And the process by which the deal was reached has ominous implications for the future.
Why isn’t 11 weeks of aid enough? Because we won’t be able to begin a vigorous economic recovery until a large fraction of the population is vaccinated, which might not happen until the summer or even the early fall. And we’re still down around 10 million jobs from pre-COVID levels; even if we can regain jobs as quickly as we did during the false dawn of May and June (when the Trump administration insisted that the pandemic was ending), it will take months more before we’re anywhere close to full employment.
So while the new legislation provides a sort of bridge to the post-COVID future, it’s a bridge that spans only part of the chasm ahead. And the way the bill was passed offers few reasons to be optimistic about Republican willingness to let the Biden administration finish the project.
Remember, until recently Mitch McConnell showed little interest in passing any kind of relief package. And there’s no mystery about what changed his mind: It was all about the Senate runoffs in Georgia. “Kelly (Loeffler) and David (Perdue) are getting hammered” over the failure to provide aid, he told his political allies.
Once those races end on Jan. 5, McConnell’s sure to lose interest all over again. And unless Democrats win both elections, he’ll still be Senate majority leader, in a position to stand in the way of any further economic relief.
Beyond that, the final hurdles to reaching an agreement were a reminder of something we should have learned during the Obama years: When a Democrat is in the White House, Republicans try to sabotage the economy. And the sabotage doesn’t stop with using phony deficit concerns to block necessary spending; it also involves deliberately increasing the risk of financial crisis.
Remember, GOP flimflam when Barack Obama was president went beyond posing as deficit hawks to block needed fiscal stimulus. It also involved constant criticism and harassment of the Fed over its efforts to rescue the economy. And now it’s happening again.
Some background: Although the pandemic recession was deep and ugly, it could easily have been even uglier. For a few weeks in March, America teetered on the edge of a financial crisis approaching the meltdown following the fall of Lehman Bros. in 2008. Fortunately, however, this incipient crisis was quickly contained by the Federal Reserve, which stabilized markets both by purchasing trillions of dollars’ worth of financial assets and by making it clear that it would do even more if necessary.
That was a job well done. But the risk of financial crisis hasn’t gone away, so we want to make sure that the Fed has the tools to meet future challenges.
Yet last month Steven Mnuchin, the blessedly departing Treasury secretary, gratuitously clawed back hundreds of billions of dollars in budget backing for Fed emergency lending programs, making those funds unavailable to his successor. And talks over economic relief almost fell apart over a last-minute demand by Sen. Pat Toomey, backed by the Republican leadership, that the legislation bar the Fed from restarting some of these programs or anything like them.
In the end, this poison pill appears to have been rendered mostly harmless, with face-saving language that prevents exact copycat programs but seems to leave room for slightly different programs that would achieve the same results.
But the episode was a preview of things to come. If another crisis develops, expect Republicans to do all they can to prevent an effective response.
So how should we feel about this relief deal? The glass is half full: For millions of American families, the next few months will be less hellish than they would have been otherwise. The glass is half empty: Unless Democrats win those Georgia seats, expect an ugly spring and years of economic sabotage ahead.

Texto completo: Over the last few decades, Congress has diversified in important ways. It has gotten less white, less male, less straight — all positive developments. But as I was staring at one of the many recent Senate hearings, filled with the usual magisterial blustering and self-important yada yada, it dawned on me that there’s a way that Congress has moved in a wrong direction, and become quite brazenly unrepresentative.
No, it’s not that the place seethes with millionaires, though there’s that problem too.
It’s that members of Congress are credentialed out the wazoo. An astonishing number have a small kite of extra initials fluttering after their names.
According to the Congressional Research Service, more than one third of the House and more than half the Senate have law degrees. Roughly a fifth of senators and representatives have their master’s. Four senators and 21 House members have MDs, and an identical number in each body (four, twenty-one) have some kind of doctoral degree, whether it’s a Ph.D., a D.Phil., an Ed.D., or a D. Min.
But perhaps most fundamentally, 95% of today’s House members have a bachelor’s degree, as does every member of the Senate. Yet just a bit more than one-third of Americans do.
“This means that the credentialed few govern the uncredentialed many,” writes the political philosopher Michael J. Sandel in “The Tyranny of Merit,” published this fall.
There’s an argument to be made that we should want our representatives to be a highly lettered lot. Lots of people have made it, as far back as Plato.
The problem is that there doesn’t seem to be any correlation between good governance and educational attainment that Sandel can discern. In the 1960s, he noted, we got the Vietnam War thanks to “the best and the brightest” — it’s been so long since the publication of David Halberstam’s book that people forget the title was morbidly ironic. In the 1990s and 2000s, the highly credentialed gave us (and here Sandel paused for a deep breath) “stagnant wages, financial deregulation, income inequality, the financial crisis of 2008, a bank bailout that did little to help ordinary people, a decaying infrastructure, and the highest incarceration rate in the world.”
Five years ago, Nicholas Carnes, a political scientist at Duke, tried to measure whether more formal education made political leaders better at their jobs. After conducting a sweeping review of 228 countries between the years 1875 and 2004, he and a colleague concluded: No . It did not. A college education did not mean less inequality, a greater GDP, fewer labor strikes, lower unemployment or less military conflict.
Sandel argues that the technocratic elite’s slow annexation of Congress and European parliaments — which resulted in the rather fateful decisions to outsource jobs and deregulate finance — helped enable the populist revolts now rippling through the West.
“It distorted our priorities,” Sandel told me, “and made for a political class that’s too tolerant of crony capitalism and much less attentive to fundamental questions of the dignity of work.”
Both parties are to blame for this. But it was Democrats, Sandel wrote, who seemed especially bullish on the virtues of the meritocracy, arguing that college would be the road to prosperity for the struggling. And it’s a fine idea, well-intentioned, idealistic at its core. But implicit in it is also a punishing notion: If you don’t succeed, you have only yourself to blame. Which President Donald Trump spotted in a trice.
“Unlike Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, who spoke constantly of ‘opportunity’” Sandel wrote, “Trump scarcely mentioned the word. Instead, he offered blunt talk of winners and losers.”
Trump was equally blunt after winning the Nevada Republican caucuses in 2016. “I love the poorly educated!” he shouted.
A pair of studies from 2019 also tell the story, in numbers, of the professionalization of the Democratic Party — or what Sandel calls “the valorization of credentialism.” One, from Politico, shows that House and Senate Democrats are much more likely to have gone to private liberal arts colleges than public universities, whereas the reverse is true of their Republican counterparts; another shows that congressional Democrats are far more likely to hire graduates of Ivy League schools.
This class bias made whites without college degrees ripe for Republican recruitment. In both 2016 and 2020, two thirds of them voted for Trump; though the GOP is the minority party in the House, more Republican members than Democrats currently do not have college degrees. All 11 are male. Most of them come from the deindustrialized Midwest and South.
Oh, and in the incoming Congress? Six of the seven new members without four-year college degrees are Republicans.
Of course, far darker forces help explain the lures of the modern GOP. You’d have to be blind and deaf not to detect them. For decades, Republicans have appealed both cynically and in earnest — it’s hard to know which is more appalling — to racial and ethnic resentments, if not hatred. There’s a reason that the Black working class isn’t defecting to the Republican Party in droves. (Of the nine Democrats in the House without college degrees, seven, it’s worth noting, are people of color.)
For now, it seems to matter little that Republicans have offered little by way of policy to restore the dignity of work. They’ve tapped into a gusher of resentment, and they seem delighted to channel it, irrespective of where, or if, they got their diplomas. Ted Cruz, quite arguably the Senate’s most insolent snob — he wouldn’t sit in a study group at Harvard Law with anyone who hadn’t graduated from Princeton, Yale or Harvard — was ready to argue on Trump’s behalf to overturn the 2020 election results, should the disgraceful Texas attorney general’s case have reached the Supreme Court.
Which raises a provocative question. Given that Trumpism has found purchase among graduates of Harvard Law, would it make any difference if Congress better reflected the United States and had more members without college degrees? Would it meaningfully alter policy at all?
It would likely depend on where they came from. I keep thinking of what Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, told me. His father was a mechanic’s assistant in the segregated South. The white men he worked for cruelly called him “The Secretary” because he could neither read nor write. “So if my father had been elected? You’d have a different Congress,” Green said. “But if it’d been the people who he served — the mechanics who gave him a pejorative moniker? We’d probably have the Congress we have now.”
It’s hard to say whether more socioeconomic diversity would guarantee differences in policy or efficiency. But it could do something more subtle: Rebuild public trust.
“There are people who look at Congress and see the political class as a closed system,” Carnes told me. “My guess is that if Congress looked more like people do as a whole, the cynical view — Oh, they’re all in their ivory tower, they don’t care about us — would get less oxygen.”
When I spoke to Rep. Troy Balderson, R-Ohio, he agreed, adding that if more members of Congress didn’t have four-year college degrees, it would erode some stigma associated with not having one.
“When I talk to high school kids and say, ‘I didn’t finish my degree,’ their faces light up,” he told me. Balderson tried college and loved it, but knew he wasn’t cut out for it. He eventually moved back to his hometown to run his family car dealership. Students tend to find his story emboldening. The mere mention of four-year college sets off panic in many of them; they’ve been stereotyped before they even grow up, out of the game before it even starts. “If you don’t have a college degree,” he explains, “you’re a has-been.” Then they look at him and see larger possibilities. That they can be someone’s voice. “You can become a member of Congress.”

Texto completo: I first read “The Iliad” in high school. The translation my teacher handed out had a single photograph on the cover: American G.I.s on D-Day storming out of a landing craft onto Omaha Beach.
The subtext of this pairing wasn’t obvious to me, as a teenager. The rage of Achilles, the death of Hector and all those Greeks in their “black-hulled ships” seemed to have little to do with the Second World War.
Many years later, after having fought in two wars of my own, that image has come to resonate in a new way. If “The Iliad” served as an ur-text for the shape the ancient Greeks assumed their wars to take (Alexander the Great, for example, is said to have slept with a copy beneath his pillow when on campaign), then World War II has served a similar function in our society, framing our expectations of war, becoming our American Iliad. We still expect to be the good guys; we expect there to be a beginning, a middle and an end; and we expect that the war is over when the troops come home.
But that final expectation — that a war is only over when all the troops come home — has never really held true, not in World War II, and not today.
Among the myriad challenges inherited by the incoming Biden administration will be not only ending our nation’s longest ever war, in Afghanistan, but also clearly defining what ending a war actually means. The new president will be handed a less than durable peace negotiated by the Trump administration with the Taliban, as well as recent significant troop reductions.
And one of the greatest trials Joe Biden will face is a public not only expecting our soldiers back, but also conditioned to believe that wars are over only when the troops all return. If the goal is reducing all troop levels in Afghanistan to zero, we’re ensuring that the war will drag on for years to come, enshrining its status not only as America’s longest war but truly as America’s forever war.
Which returns us to “The Iliad,” to the importance of the narratives we apply to our wars, and to our long-held misconceptions about homecomings.
There are nearly 40,000 troops garrisoned in Western Europe; their presence has secured a generations-old peace in the countries where World War II was fought. We also station nearly 30,000 troops in South Korea in a decades-long effort to ensure stability in the region. Despite episodic violence and metaphorical saber rattling, no one would argue that these wars are ongoing, and most would concede that our presence has proved a much-valued source of regional stability that has made both the world and America safer and more prosperous.
Obviously, the situation in Afghanistan today is more volatile than Western Europe or East Asia. But U.S. troops stationed in-country have remained relatively safe in recent years. Four men died in Afghanistan this year. But in 2020, many more service members died in training accidents at Camp Pendleton alone. Indeed, since 2015, Defense Department training accidents have exceeded combat deaths worldwide. I raise this point not to sound callous about combat deaths, but rather to put them in a context that allows us to create sound policy.
Afghanistan in 2009 is not Afghanistan in 2020. Where once we were fighting to win a war, today we are fighting to sustain a tenuous peace. This is a distinction Mr. Biden should make to the entire country. That means, assuming conditions on the ground remain stable, decoupling the phrases “U.S. troops in Afghanistan” from “the U.S. war in Afghanistan.”
He should emphasize how our presence in Afghanistan stabilizes the region and assures U.S. interests abroad. He should also then explain that conditions for our forces in Afghanistan have changed over the years, that the work these troops are doing is different than the aggressive combat operations that characterized their presence a decade ago, thus announcing what so many already know: For us the war has all but ended.
The Bidens are a military family. Beau Biden’s military service, and his deployment to Iraq, has been a fundamental part of the family’s story. The president-elect likely understands that the psychology of a forever war is a fraught one, particularly for veterans and their families who’ve struggled for closure with a conflict that always simmers on a low boil in the background not only of their lives, but in American life writ large.
Unlike World War II, when veterans were welcomed home with ticker-tape parades, or even the Vietnam War, when stomach-churning images of Saigon’s evacuation at least gave veterans a moment to pause and declare the nightmare over, veterans of our generation’s wars have had no such closure. Mr. Biden ran on a platform of unity, asserting that this was “a time to heal” our country. Perhaps in the opening days of his administration he might pause and focus on the healing of veterans as a first step to a broader national healing.
Part of that healing will be reframing the war in Afghanistan. That means welcoming our veterans home from what, for some, has been a decades-long odyssey, not only of service in our forever wars but as veterans of wars that simply refuse to end.
It’s time to tell veterans that it’s over, that they (and we) no longer need to live in a state of perpetual war; for service members still deploying to Afghanistan, it is time to clarify that they are no longer prosecuting a war but advancing a peace. And who knows, if handled correctly, it might be the first step in ending our perpetual wars at home, too.

Texto completo: Journalist Anne Helen Petersen recently asked, on Twitter, for articles about the “long-term psychological effects” of the pandemic. She soon noticed that many of the replies were about the damage it was doing to children.
Seeing this crystallized something I’d been dimly aware of. The strange politics of the coronavirus have created a taboo, at least in certain progressive circles, in talking too much about the emotional suffering wrought by nine months of purgatorial isolation. It’s easier to discuss what it’s doing to our kids, because we feel justified in trying to spare them pain.
If, before this year, I felt for a day the way I now feel all the time, I’d consider it an emergency and do anything I could to fix it. Now that I’m waiting out a pandemic in a small apartment with small kids and winter closing in, most things I’d need to do to be less miserable are proscribed, though sometimes by suggestion rather than decree. In many cases, it’s up to each of us to decide how much seclusion, how much joylessness, how much boredom and frustration we can tolerate, even though the pandemic means that whatever risks we take for relief aren’t ours alone.
So emotional respite has become a public good. Many conservatives, not surprisingly, feel entitled to make whatever use of the commons they want. Throwing gratuitous holiday parties is like the social equivalent of “rolling coal,” modifying vehicles to be extra polluting and thus own the libs.
By contrast the liberal response, at least publicly, has often been an expectation of near-total social abstinence. Some blue states made this official in November, banning most gatherings of people who don’t live together, even when they’re outdoors. But even without edicts, the rules seem clear enough.
When journalist Will Leitch wrote an essay about living a life that’s careful but not completely locked-down, he titled it, “Confessions of Pandemic Risk-Taker.” As Julia Marcus, a public health researcher at Harvard Medical School, wrote in The Atlantic, “Americans have been told during this pandemic that taking any risks, no matter how carefully calculated, is a sign of bad character.”
I don’t blame public health authorities for this. America — though not only America — has let the virus get so out of control that only inhuman measures can begin to contain it. But people will, naturally, rebel against modes of living that are inhuman. A privatized, shame-based pandemic response is inadequate and doomed to fail. It is also, until vaccines are widely distributed, all we have.
This weekend, Dr. Deborah Birx, coordinator of the White House coronavirus response, became the latest political leader exposed as an apparent coronavirus hypocrite. Birx had warned Americans, rightly, not to travel over Thanksgiving, or celebrate with people outside their household. But according to The Associated Press, the day after Thanksgiving, she went to one of her Delaware vacation properties with her daughter, son-in-law and grandchildren. (She said in a statement that they went to winterize the place, and that they’re all part of the same “immediate household,” though they live in different homes.)
Birx joins a dubious pantheon that includes Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, who attended a dinner party at an opulent Napa Valley restaurant after exhorting citizens to social distance, and Mayor Steve Adler of Austin, Texas, who recorded a video telling people to stay home while he was on vacation in Mexico. Obviously, such lapses reek of entitlement and irresponsibility; leaders have a duty to model the sacrifices they demand of others. Perhaps the reason they keep happening, though, is that few can endure the loneliness that is a moral requirement of this moment.
Often, when people find themselves unable to live up to public standards, it inspires discussion and literary confession. But with a few exceptions — Leitch’s piece is one — the pandemic makes candor about transgressive behavior harmful. No one who takes the disease seriously wants to create a permission structure for people to endanger others because they just can’t bear to keep living the way we’re all supposed to.
In April, when the pandemic was still new, I interviewed a community leader in a particularly hard-hit Brooklyn housing project who told me, frankly, that she and her friends weren’t social distancing because they needed each other too much, especially in apocalyptic times. “You don’t want to know that your friends and family are going to lock you out because there’s zombies outside,” she said.
I couldn’t help but sympathize. At the time my family, vastly more privileged, had moved in with friends at a remote country house, hoping to wait out a disaster we expected to end in a month.
We’re alone now, but I understand people who decide they can’t be, even if these decisions are collectively calamitous. My guess is that when this ends, many will start talking about the loopholes they found to avoid losing their minds. For now, as this hellish year reaches its end, solace and guilt are intertwined.

Texto completo: Growing up in rural northern Louisiana, everyone I knew, at least every household, seemed to have guns. Men had guns racked in the back windows of their pickup trucks, and pistols under their seats. Women, like my mother, tucked smaller handguns into their purses.
My hometown, Gibsland, a flyspeck of a place, was and is majority Black. Gun ownership was the norm in those parts, including in the Black community. It was not associated with danger but with safety. There were many older Black people in the South who could tell stories about a time when they were left to defend themselves against the threat of white terror, a father or an uncle or a brother sitting on a porch with a rifle through the night, should trouble come.
Indeed, one could argue that the right to bear arms in this country has never been so brazenly and openly abridged as it has against Black people. Many state codes prohibited Black gun ownership before the Civil War and allowed for the disarmament of Black people after. Many Black people saw these as attempts to prevent them from defending themselves against terror. Some efforts at gun control, such as those in the 1960s at the height of the Black Power movement, have been seen by historians as explicitly targeted at Black people.
As Adam Winkler reported for The Atlantic in 2011, the Safe Streets Act of 1968 and the Gun Control Act of 1968 “expanded the federal licensing system for gun dealers and clarified which people — including anyone previously convicted of a felony, the mentally ill, illegal-drug users, and minors — were not allowed to own firearms.” The laws also “restricted importation of ‘Saturday night specials’ — the small, cheap, poor-quality handguns so named by Detroit police for their association with urban crime, which spiked on weekends.”
Winkler continued, “Because these inexpensive pistols were popular in minority communities, one critic said the new federal gun legislation ‘was passed not to control guns but to control blacks.’”
Folks in my hometown, including single mothers like mine, also drove pieced-together, secondhand and thirdhand cars, sometimes at night, to larger, neighboring towns to shop for groceries or other needs. More often than one would like to believe, those cars broke down on a lonely stretch of pitch-black road, and people would have to walk to the nearest light, a friendly-seeming stranger’s home or a small roadside store, sometimes with children in tow, to look for help.
Particularly in the days I grew up, there was no roadside assistance on call, no cellphones and, in our town, there was only one police officer. Being armed was often the only way that people could feel safe.
Beyond safety though, guns were and are seen as a tool in these agrarian regions: rifles used for hunting, to slaughter livestock or to keep vermin out of the garden and snakes out of the grass.
Children, particularly boys, were trained to use guns from the time they were toddlers, graduating from cap guns, to BB guns, to pellet guns, to small rifles. It was nothing at all unusual to see a pack of boys walking the streets with their weapons, on their way to target shoot at cans or some such.
When I went away to college, my mother gave me a pistol, “just in case.” (Luckily, no such case presented itself.)
When I moved north, first to Detroit and then to New York, I moved into a mental space of more stringent gun control. In general, people weren’t hunting. There was law enforcement everywhere, reachable as quickly as one could dial 911. There were cellphones.
Armed crimes were rampant as well as shootings and gun-related homicides. There were mass shootings and drive-by shootings, all phenomena foreign to me. In my mind, city dwellers simply didn’t have the same need for weapons as the people in the rural community where I was raised, and many were also not reared with the respect for and knowledge of weapons we possessed.
I, like many, were convinced that fewer guns in the Black community would make it safer. But, for many Black people, that sentiment has turned. Since the gun-buying surge in the wake of the Obama presidency, the unrelenting series of unarmed Black people being killed on video and the uncertainty brought on by the pandemic, gun sales to Black people are surging. According to an October CNN report, gun sales among Black Americans were up 58% through September.
I, as much as anyone, would like to live in a society in which all citizens felt safe without the need of personal firearms. America could have created such a society. However, it chose not to.
Sure, there are still hunters and farmers and people living in rural areas who use rifles as a tool. There are people who use guns for sport or who collect them. But, there are also people who buy and hoard guns because they have been fed a dystopian fantasy of a race war or a government takeover.
It seems to me that the surge in Black gun-buying is in large part simply a response to that. As has been the case since slavery, many Black people feel the need to defend themselves from their own country.

Texto completo: OAKLAND, Calif. - In 2000, just two years after it was founded, Google reached a milestone that would lay the foundation for its dominance over the next 20 years: It became the world's largest search engine, with an index of more than 1 billion web pages.
The rest of the internet never caught up, and Google's index just kept on getting bigger. Today, it is somewhere between 500 billion and 600 billion web pages, according to estimates.
Now, as regulators around the world examine ways to curb Google's power, including a search monopoly case expected from state attorneys general as early as this week and the antitrust lawsuit the Justice Department filed in October, they are wrestling with a company whose sheer size has allowed it to squash competitors. And those competitors are pointing investigators toward that enormous index, the gravitational center of the company.
"If people are on a search engine with a smaller index, they're not always going to get the results they want. And then they go to Google and stay at Google," said Matt Wells, who started Gigablast, a search engine with an index of around 5 billion web pages, about 20 years ago. "A little guy like me can't compete."
Understanding how Google's search works is a key to figuring out why so many companies find it nearly impossible to compete and, in fact, go out of their way to cater to its needs.
Every search request provides Google with more data to make its search algorithm smarter. Google has performed so many more searches than any other search engine that it has established a huge advantage over rivals in understanding what consumers are looking for. That lead only continues to widen, since Google has a market share of about 90%.
Google directs billions of users to locations across the internet, and websites, hungry for that traffic, create a different set of rules for the company. Websites often provide greater and more frequent access to Google's so-called web crawlers - computers that automatically scour the internet and scan web pages - allowing the company to offer a more extensive and up-to-date index of what is available on the internet.
When he was working at the music site Bandcamp, Zack Maril, a software engineer, became concerned about how Google's dominance had made it so essential to websites.
In 2018, when Google said its crawler, Googlebot, was having trouble with one of Bandcamp's pages, Marii made fixing the problem a priority because Google was critical to the site's traffic. When other crawlers encountered problems, Bandcamp would usually block them.
Maril continued to research the different ways that websites opened doors for Google and closed them for others. Last year, he sent a 20-page report, "Understanding Google," to a House antitrust subcommittee and then met with investigators to explain why other companies could not recreate Google's index.
"It's largely an unchecked source of power for its monopoly," said Maril, 29, who works at another technology company that does not compete directly with Google. Fie asked that The New York Times not identify his employer since he was not speaking for it.
A report this year by the House subcommittee cited Maril's research on Google's efforts to create a real-time map of the internet and how this had "locked in its dominance." While the Justice Department is look.ng to unwind Google's business deals that put its search engine front and center on billions of smartphones and computers, Maril is urging the government to intervene and regulate Google's index. A Google spokesperson declined to comment.
Websites and search engines are symbiotic. Websites rely on search engines for traffic, while search engines need access to crawl the sites to provide relevant results for users. But each crawler puts a strain on a website's resources in server and bandwidth costs, and some aggressive crawlers resemble security risks rhat can take down a site.
Since having their pages crawled costs money, websites have an incentive to let it be done only by search engines that direct enough traffic to them. In the current world of search, that leaves Google and - in seme cases - Microsoft's Bing.
Google and Microsoft are the only search engines that spend hundreds of millions of dollars annually to maintain a real-time map of the English-language internet. That's in addition to the billions they have spent over the years to build out Iheir indexes, according to a report this summer from Britain's Competition and Markets Authority.
Google holds a significant leg up on Microsoft in more than market share. British competition authorities said Google's index included about 500 billion to 600 billion web pages, compared with 100 billion to 200 billion for Microsoft.
Other large tech companies deploy crawlers for other purposes. Facebook has a crawler for links that appear on its site or services. Amazon says its crawler helps improve its voice-based assistant, Alexa. Apple has its own crawler, Applebot, which has fueled speculation that it might be looking to build its own search engine.
But indexing has always been a challenge for companies without deep pockets.The privacy-minded search engine DuckDuckGo decided to stop crawling the entire web more than a decade ago and now syndicates results from Microsoft. It still crawls sites like Wikipedia to provide results for answer boxes that appear in its results, but maintaining its own index does not usually make financial sense for the company.
"It costs more money than we can afford," said Gabriel Weinberg, chief executive of DuckDuckGo. In a written statement for the House antitrust subcommittee last year, the company said that "an aspiring search engine startup today (and in the foreseeable future) cannot avoid the need" to turn to Microsoft or Google for its search results.
When FindX started to develop an alternative to Google in 2015, the Danish company set out to create its own index and offered a build-your-own algorithm to provide individualized results.
FindX quickly ran into problems. Large website operators, such as Yelp and Linkedln, did not allow the fledgling search engine to crawl their sites. Because of a bug in its code, FindX's computers that crawled the internet were flagged as a security risk and blocked by a group of the internet's largest infrastructure providers. What pages they did collect were frequently spam or malicious web pages.
"If you have to do the indexing, that's the hardest thing to do," said Brian Schildt Laursen, one of the founders of FindX, which shut down in 2018.
Schildt Laursen launched a new search engine last year, Givero, which offered users the option to donate a portion of the company's revenue to charitable causes. When he started Givero, he syndicated search results from Microsoft.
Most large websites are judicious about who can crawl their pages. In general, Google and Microsoft get more access because they have more users, while smaller search engines have to ask for permission.
"You need the traffic to convince the websites to allow you to copy and crawl, but you also need the content to grow your index and pull up your traffic," said Marc Al-Hames, a co-chief executive of Cliqz, a German search engine that closed this year after seven years of operation. "It's a chickenand-egg problem."
In Europe, a group called the Open Search Foundation has proposed a plan to create a common internet index that can underpin many European search engines. It is essential to have a diversity of options for search results, said Stefan Voigt, the group's chairman and founder, because it is not good for only a handful of companies to determine what links people are shown and not shown.
"We just can't leave this to one or two companies," Voigt said.
When Maril started researching how sites treated Google's crawler, he downloaded 17 million so-called robots.txt files - essentially rules of the road posted by nearly every website laying out where crawlers can go - and found many examples where Google had greater access than competitors.
ScienceDirect, a site for peer-reviewed papers, permits only Google's crawler to have access to links containing PDF documents. Only Google's computers get access to listings on PBS Kids. On Alibaba, com, the U.S. site of the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, only Google's crawler is given access to pages that list products.
This year, Maril started an organization, the Knuckleheads' Club ("because only a knucklehead would take on Google"), and a website to raise awareness about Google's web-crawling monopoly.
"Google has all this power in society," Maril said. "But I think there should be democratic - small d - control of that power."

Texto completo: Stanley Cowell, a pianist, composer, record-label impresario and educator who brought a technician's attention to detail and a theorist's sophistication to his more than 50-year career as a jazz bandleader, died Friday in Dover, Delaware. He was 79.
Sylvia Potts Cowell, his wife, said that the cause of his death, at a hospital, was hypovolemic shock, the result of blood loss stemming from other health issues.
Cowell's playing epitomized the piano's ability to consolidate generations of musical history into a unified expression, while extending various routes into the future. And when he needed to say more than the piano allowed, he expanded his palette.
He was among the first jazz musicians to make prominent use of the kálimba, a thumb piano from southeastern Africa. In his later decades he worked often with a digital sound-design program, Kyma, that allowed him to alter the pitch and texture of an acoustic piano's sound.
In 1971, together with trumpeter Charles Tolliver, Cowell founded Strata-East Records, a pioneering institution in jazz and the broader Black Arts Movement. It would release a steady run of pathbreaking music over the coming decade, becoming one of the most successful Black-run labels of its time.
Cowell and Tolliver met in the late 1960s, as members of the drummer Max Roach's ensemble. After recording a now-classic album with Roach, "Members, Don't Git Weary," in 1968, they formed a quartet called Music Inc., which released its debut LP, "The Ringer," on Polydor in 1970. But Cowell and Tolliver found themselves unable to find a label that would pay what they considered a fair advance for their next album, at a time when jazz's commercial appeal was fading.
Inspired by the Black musicians' collectives that had recently sprouted up in cities across the country, and by the artist-run Strata label in Detroit, Cowell and Tolliver founded Strata-East. Their second album together, "Music Inc.," with the quartet fleshed out into a large ensemble, was the label's first release.
"The aesthetic ambition was to compose, play and extend the music of our great influences, mentors and innovators, while keeping the distinguishing features of the jazz tradition," Cowell said in a 2015 interview for the Superfly Records website.
Over the coming decade, Strata-East would release dozens of albums with a similar goal at heart, including some gemlike LPs by Cowell: "Musa: Ancestral Streams" (1974), a solo album of understated breadth; "Regeneration" (1975), an odyssey equally inspired by pop music and pan-Africanism; and a pair of singular albums with the Piano Choir, a group of seven pianists, "Handscapes 1" (1973) and "Handscapes 2" (1975).
Cowell was also becoming one of New York's most in-demand side musicians, known for his adaptability and his vast command of the jazz language. In the coming decade he would play an integral role in the Heath Brothers band and groups led by the saxophonists Arthur Blythe and Art Pepper and the vibraphonist Bobby Hutcherson.
After becoming a full-time music professor in the 1980s, Cowell eventually stepped back from public performances and recordings.
His quartet's appearance at the Village Vanguard in 2015 was his first weeklong engagement in New York in nearly two decades. Reviewing one of those shows for The New York Times, Ben Ratliff wrote, "Mr. Cowell can create impressive momentary events, but what's best about him is his broad frame of reference and the general synthesis he is proposing."
In addition to his wife, Cowell is survived by their daughter, Sunny Cowell Stovall; a sister, Esther Cowell; another daughter, Sienna Cowell, from a previous marriage; and two grandchildren. He had homes in Maryland and Delaware.
Stanley Allen Cowell was born in Toledo, Ohio, on May 5,1941, to Stanley and Willie Hazel (Lytle) Cowell, who kept a wide variety of music playing in the house at all times. The couple ran a series of businesses, including a motel that was among the only places in Toledo where touring Black musicians could stay. Many artists became friends of the family, including the stride piano master Art Tatum, himself a Toledo native.
During a visit to the family home when Stanley was 6, Tatum played a version of the show tune "You Took Advantage of Me" that Cowell would never forget. When he recorded his first album as a leader in 1969, "Blues for the Viet Cong," he included a dazzling stride rendition of "You Took Advantage of Me" alongside his own forward-charging originals.
As a child, Cowell played and composed constantly. By the time he arrived at the Oberlin College Conservatory in Ohio at age 17, he had already written a number of pieces, including "Departure," which would become the opening track on "Blues for the Viet Cong." He studied for a time in Austria, then went on to the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, where he received a graduate degree in classical piano while working six nights a week in a jazz trio.
He also fell in with the experimental improvisers and poets of the nearby Detroit Artists Workshop. That experience opened his mind to new artistic possibilities, while planting a seed of passion for artist-led organizing.
His connections in Detroit led him to the saxophonist Marion Brown, who helped him land on his feet after moving to New York City in the mid-1960s. Brown brought the young pianist to his first recording session, in 1966, for the album "Three for Shepp."
Cowell recorded "Blues for the Viet Cong" with a trio in 1969, and followed it with "Brilliant Circles," a sextet date.
He went on to make over a dozen albums in the 1970s, '80s and '90s, including a run for the Steeplechase label while in his 40s and 50s that, while generally unsung, represents one ofthat era's most consistently brilliant stretches of jazz recordings.
In the 1980s, Cowell began to focus more heavily on his work as an educator - first at the City University of New York's Lehman College and later at Rutgers. He expanded his inquiries into electronic instrumentation and orchestral composing, becoming adept at Kyma and teaching courses on electronic music. He composed a lengthy "Juneteenth Suite" for chorus and orchestra, inspired by the celebrations of Black Americans after the Emancipation Proclamation.
After retiring from teaching in 2013, Cowell revved up his performing career again. He reconnected with his old cohort, including Tolliver and other former members of the Strata-East roster, touring under the name the Strata-East All Stars. And in 2015, Cowell released the album "Juneteenth," featuring what he called "a solo piano reduction" of the suite.
In an echo of his experiences almost 50 years earlier, he had been unable to find a record label willing to invest in recording the suite with a full orchestra. Eventually a small French label, Vision Fugitive, offered to put out the solo-piano version.
He often noted the irony of his inability to find an American label for the record, which celebrates a suppressed legacy of American music. But he was proud to have put it out anyway, upholding his understanding of the musician's role.
"We are not just artists, we are citizens of our respective nations, and ultimately citizens of the world," he told Superfly Records. "In our own personal ways, and when necessary, in unity with others, we should add our 'fuel' to the cleansing fire against injustice."

You can't stimulate an economy that's still manually shut down

Texto completo: Congress just passed a nearly $1 trillion pandemic relief package that includes direct payments in the form of "stimulus" checks, but I'm curious. How do you stimulate an economy that is still manually shut down?
Both liberals and conservatives whined on social media that the $600 checks aren't enough. Who knows? Maybe they're even right. But what difference would any amount of money make when governors and mayors are still keeping closed down all the places it might be used at, including bars, restaurants, and entertainment venues?
The mass closure of restaurants, many of which will be permanent, isn't a minor inconvenience. That's a chain of millions of jobs. Per Forbes, "It’s the delivery people and the transportation companies that dispense to the restaurants; the farmers, brewers and distillers that create, grow and cultivate the goods sold to the restaurants; and the technology platforms that provide social media, sales systems and reservation methods for the restaurants."
Disposable income should be going to such businesses up and down the supply chain, but it's not because the consumer-facing part of this industry has been forced to shut down. It is instead going toward buying a bunch of plastic garbage made in China.
The New York Times last week reported that Chinese imports are "surging" thanks to the stay-home orders. "The surge in imports is another byproduct of the coronavirus," the New York Times said, "with Americans channeling money they might have spent on vacations, movies and restaurant dining to household items like new lighting for home offices, workout equipment for basement gyms, and toys to keep their children entertained."
In other words, the bulk of all that "stimulus" money we are sending out the door is likely to go toward more stuff to keep people home. That's not stimulus. That's stagnation.
Everyone can complain about $600 not being enough. But their energy would be better spent pressuring their elected officials to stop the lockdowns.

Texto completo: The New York Times has yet to report on a story involving Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell’s relationship with a suspected Chinese spy two weeks after Axios broke the news.
It was reported on Dec. 8 that a former campaign bundler and possible romantic interest of Swalwell's, Christine Fang, is a suspected Chinese spy who worked on behalf of the Communist Chinese government as part of a significant influence operation.
Several days later, many on social media noticed that a search on the New York Times website for articles about the alleged scandal turned up nothing.
“The New York Times has yet to inform its readers that Congressman Eric Swalwell, who sits on the Intelligence Committee, had a relationship with a Chinese spy,” former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer tweeted about the lack of coverage back on Dec. 11. “Journalism is broken.”
Tweet
As of Dec. 22, zero results populate when the names “Eric Swalwell” and “Christine Fang” are searched within the time frame of the last month.
The New York Times has not responded to multiple requests for comment from the Washington Examiner.
Swalwell has largely remained silent on the accusations and has suggested that the controversy is a politically motivated smear and resorted to personal attacks against Republicans who have questioned him.
“Rep. Swalwell, long ago, provided information about this person — whom he met more than eight years ago, and whom he hasn’t seen in nearly six years — to the FBI,” Swalwell’s office said when the story broke. “To protect information that might be classified, he will not participate in your story.”
Several other media outlets, including the Washington Post, MSNBC, and CNN, have also been criticized for their sparse coverage of the Swalwell story, which some have said has been far less aggressive than coverage of alleged connections between President Trump and the Russian government during the 2016 campaign.
In 2018, The New York Times was also criticized for declining to publish a “single word” about a Chinese spy who was a member of Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s office for more than a decade. A search for coverage on the story this week yielded no results.

Deutsche Bank director who oversaw loans to Trump resigns

Texto completo: A director at Deutsche Bank AG behind hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of loans to President Trump's company announced her resignation.
Rosemary Vrablic, the banker for Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, said she has "chosen to resign" from the bank effective Dec. 31 and that she is "looking forward" to retirement, according to the New York Times. She's joined by longtime colleague Dominic Scalzi, who was also involved in securing the loans for Trump's company.
“I’ve chosen to resign my position with the bank effective Dec. 31 and am looking forward to my retirement,” Vrablic said in a statement.
Vrablic and Scalzi began working for Deutsche Bank in 2006. Five years later, Vrablic convinced her bosses to approve the loans for Trump, who had been "mostly off limits to the mainstream banking world" given his record of defaulting on loans, the New York Times reported.
"Rosemary Vrablic and Dominic Scalzi have tendered their resignations to Deutsche Bank effective as of year-end, which was accepted by the bank," Deutsche Bank's Daniel Hunter told the Washington Examiner.
It's unclear what prompted either resignation.
In August, Deutsche Bank announced it was starting an internal review of Vrablic regarding a 2013 real estate purchase she made. Vrablic purchased a property that belonged to a company part-owned by Kushner. Deutsche Bank said it was not aware of the transaction until contacted by the New York Times. Banks typically do not allow employees to conduct personal business with clients in order to avoid potential conflicts of interest.
Earlier in 2020, Deutsche Bank was reportedly looking for ways to "cut ties" with Trump after the international bank received negative publicity for its connection to the outgoing president, which it referred to as "serious collateral damage." Trump owes Deutsche Bank roughly $330 million in outstanding loans against properties owned by Trump and personally guaranteed by him, according to paperwork the president filed to the U.S. Office of Government Ethics.
Those loans come due in 2023 and 2024. The bank had considered selling the loans to another bank or demanding repayment from Trump and foreclosing if he is unable to pay off the loans.
Trump's relationship with the bank received increased scrutiny after he was elected president. Two Democratic-controlled House committees, the Committee on Financial Services and the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, subpoenaed Deutsche Bank and Capital One for Trump’s financial records in 2019. Trump sued the banks to thwart the subpoenas.
The New York attorney general’s office, led by Letitia James, opened an investigation into Trump’s relationship with Deutsche Bank in 2019 following testimony from former Trump lawyer and now-convicted felon Michael Cohen. A New York district attorney is also seeking Trump’s financial information from Deutsche Bank.
The Washington Examiner attempted to reach out to the Trump Organization for additional comment.

Workaround could double vaccinations without additional production

Texto completo: About 50 million people in the United States are expected to receive a coronavirus vaccine by January. But some believe that the number could effectively be doubled to 100 million without any additional production of shots, accelerating the return to normal.
Both of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration, are supposed to be given in two doses, the first one a prime and the second a booster. The two doses of the Pfizer vaccine are to be given 21 days apart, with the Moderna at 28 days apart.
But some experts suggest that one dose may provide ample protection.
"First doses of Pfizer/Moderna vaccines are 90%+ effective after 14 days," tweeted Dr. Keith Klugman, director of the pneumonia program at the Gates Foundation. "Most high risk lives will be saved by giving all these limited early supplies of vaccine as first doses—second doses can be given later if first dose effectiveness wanes or when supply improves."
Last week, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis floated the idea.
“One dose of this Pfizer vaccine they’re finding is protective,” DeSantis said. “Some argued you shouldn’t even do the booster with Pfizer right now — just get as many doses out there. I’m not sure Pfizer would agree or the FDA would agree."
The data provided by the FDA showed that the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine became effective after about 10 days. It was about 89% effective at preventing COVID-19 infection in the period between the time the first dose was administered and the second.
Moderna broke its data down even further, showing that the first dose of the vaccine was 92.4% effective after two weeks.
Yet there are considerable hurdles to overcome, most significantly that the FDA would need to sign off on it.
The data "raises the question of whether we should already be administrating only a single dose," wrote Zeynep Tufekci and Dr. Michael Mina in the New York Times. "But ... important questions remain, and approval would require high standards and more trials."
Tufekci, a sociologist and writer for the New York Times, and Mina, an epidemiology professor at Harvard, wrote that one-dose trials should begin immediately on people who were among the first to get vaccinated. This would include those healthcare workers and essential workers who are at a lower risk of getting a severe case of COVID-19.
Much would depend on how long the efficacy of a single dose would last before people needed the second dose. But Tufekci and Mina pointed out that there is no hard and fast rule that a second dose must be given within weeks of the first. They note that for the measles vaccine, the second dose is given years after the first. If the second dose of the coronavirus vaccine could be delayed six months to a year, according to Tufekci and Mina, "that would allow twice as many people to get vaccinated between now and later next year, accelerating herd immunity — greatly helping to end the crisis phase of the pandemic in the United States."

Memorial Sloan Kettering Gave Top Doctor $1.5 Million After He Was Forced to Resign Over Conflicts of Interest

Texto completo: ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they’re published.
In 2018, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center’s chief medical officer, Dr. José Baselga, resigned under fire over his failure to disclose payments from health care companies in dozens of research articles he wrote.
Now, recent Internal Revenue Service filings show the nonprofit hospital paid more than $1.5 million in severance to Baselga in 2018 and 2019.
The revelations about the former executive led to significant changes governing Memorial Sloan Kettering’s ties to the health care and pharmaceutical industries and prompted an overhaul of its conflict-of-interest policies. The disclosure failures, which were uncovered by The New York Times and ProPublica, also led to a broader reexamination of how medical journals enforce their conflict-of-interest policies as well as heightened scrutiny of the relationships between medical researchers and for-profit companies at cancer centers around the country.
The hospital would not say whether it paid additional severance to Baselga in 2020. A spokeswoman said the past payments reflected the hospital’s “contractual obligation” to Baselga under his employment agreement.
Baselga now is an executive at the pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca, where he oversees development of its cancer drugs. He declined to comment through a company spokeswoman.
Nonprofit institutions, like many of their for-profit counterparts, often enter into employment contracts with top officials that provide compensation upon their departure. And it’s difficult to break those agreements except in situations like court determinations of illegality, said Marcus S. Owens, who ran the IRS division that oversees nonprofits during the administrations of Presidents George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton.
That said, nonprofits, by law, must disclose the nature of their severance agreements for key officials in their IRS filings. The large payment to Baselga was striking given how significantly his departure rattled the institution.
In the fall of 2018, Memorial Sloan Kettering’s chief executive, Dr. Craig B. Thompson, apologized to his staff for the handling of the episode, saying, “the events of the last few weeks have not been handled as well as I would have liked.”

At the same time, the then-chairman of the board, Douglas A. Warner III, disparaged Baselga, who also held the title of physician in chief, saying he “crossed lines” and “went off the reservation” in his dealings with for-profit companies.
Even though Baselga officially resigned from his position, Warner suggested that the departure was not voluntary, saying that despite Baselga’s talents, he “left us no choice.”
Baselga was a prominent researcher and a prolific author of medical articles. In his resignation letter, he acknowledged his lapses and said the controversy had proved to be “too much of a distraction.”
Baselga also stepped down from the boards of the drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb and Varian Medical Systems, a radiation equipment manufacturer, as well as the cancer journal where he had been an editor.

Top Official at Memorial Sloan Kettering Resigns After Failing to Disclose Industry Ties
Dr. José Baselga, the hospital’s chief medical officer, stepped down days after a report by ProPublica and the New York Times that he failed to disclose millions of dollars in payments from the health care and drug industry in research articles.
Memorial Sloan Kettering Leaders Violated Conflict-of-Interest Rules, Report Finds
A policy review follows months of turmoil at the cancer center, which pledged an overhaul, including new rules on public disclosure and limits on outside profits.
After months of review, Memorial Sloan Kettering overhauled its conflict-of-interest policy, barring its top executives from serving on corporate boards of drug and health care companies and placing limits on how executives and top researchers could profit from work developed at the institution.
Like other major hospitals, Memorial Sloan Kettering’s finances have taken a hit during the coronavirus pandemic. For the first three quarters of 2020, the hospital reported an operating loss of $453 million compared with an operating profit of nearly $77 million in the first nine months of 2019. The hospital saw a decline in surgical procedures and clinic visits, as well as clinical trials and other research. The hospital did receive $100 million in relief funds as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act.
Baselga wasn’t the only former official to receive severance from Memorial Sloan Kettering in 2019. It also paid more than $250,000 in severance to Avice Meehan, the hospital’s former chief communications officer, according to its IRS filing. Meehan declined to comment.
Laurie Styron, the executive director of CharityWatch, an independent watchdog group, said that hospitals often compensate their staff generously because they must attract highly trained and educated doctors who would be well-paid elsewhere. Still, she said, the multimillion-dollar sums can surprise donors, who typically give money to support research or patient care.
“The reactions we get from donors are negative when they hear that they, as a middle-class working person, sent in what they could toward a charitable cause and then they find out that someone is making millions of dollars,” she said.

NEW YORK — More than a dozen people shimmied through a glitzy banquet room in Queens earlier this month, forming a conga line during a holiday party thrown by a local Republican club. Coronavirus cases were spiking around the country, and it was days before Gov. Andrew Cuomo closed indoor dining in the city.
No one in the conga line wore a mask.
The dance was captured in a video that circulated on social media this week, leading to an outcry that culminated with criticism from the governor and led to an investigation by the State Liquor Authority.
“COVID conga lines are not smart, that’s my official position,” Cuomo said at a press briefing Tuesday. “Why you would do an unmasked conga line in the middle of a COVID pandemic, whatever your political persuasion, defies a logical explanation.”
The Whitestone Republican Club held the party Dec. 9 at Il Bacco, an Italian restaurant in Little Neck, Queens.
“In early December we held a small gathering observing all the COVID guidelines in place at the time,” said a statement on the club’s Facebook page Tuesday. “Every attendee was told to wear a mask and everyone either had one when entering or was given one.”
Officials at City Hall felt differently.
“There will be significant fines for this incident, and we’re looking at both the group that held the event and the establishment that hosted it,” said Mitch Schwartz, a spokesman for the mayor. “There will continue to be consequences for putting New Yorkers at risk.”
Video of the conga line was shared on Twitter on Monday by Matt Binder, a journalist who said the footage was initially posted on a private local Facebook group. The conga line snaked past a DJ booth with a spinning disco ball as the Bee Gees blasted in the background, the video showed. A man hoisting a Trump 2020 campaign flag led the dance before Vickie Paladino, a staunch conservative who is the club’s president and a City Council candidate, took over.
Thomas Paladino, Paladino’s son and her campaign strategy director, said that the restaurant and the club took precautions, like providing hand sanitizer and taking temperatures at the door.
“We’re not the mask police,” Thomas Paladino said Tuesday. “We’re all grown adults, and if somebody chooses to put a mask on, they can put a mask on.”
The party, which took place days before Cuomo again closed indoor dining in the city to slow the spread of the virus, was just the latest in-person gathering to draw opprobrium as coronavirus cases increase around the country.
Both Democrats and Republicans in the region have hosted risky get-togethers. Criticism abounded after Democratic leaders in Brooklyn held a birthday party in late November where many participants lacked masks, and the New York Young Republican Club flouted the rules at a secret gala in New Jersey not long afterward.
Il Bacco has a dining room, banquet room and rooftop space, and Thomas Paladino said the party was spread between the roof and banquet room to allow for social distancing. He would not comment on the number of people who attended the party, but said that the club had more than 250 members.
The restaurant’s website said that the banquet room can hold up to 160 people. The video shows a smaller crowd, though it is not clear if the party met the state’s capacity limit at the time.
Bill Crowley, a spokesman for the State Liquor Authority, confirmed Tuesday that the authority was investigating Il Bacco. Crowley said that the state has suspended 279 liquor licenses for violations of coronavirus-related regulations.
A man who answered the telephone at Il Bacco on Tuesday evening said that the restaurant followed all the coronavirus regulations, but he would not comment on the party or the investigation.
Tina Maria Oppedisano, Il Bacco’s manager, was part of a group that sued Mayor Bill de Blasio and the governor over closing indoor dining during the summer, along with her father, Joe Oppedisano, the owner of the restaurant. She has remained critical about restaurant restrictions.
“As long as we are abiding by all the laws and all the safety precautions,” Tina Oppedisano recently told The New York Times, “I don’t understand why we can’t just conduct our business.”
Thomas Paladino described the outcry over the video as “insane,” noting that everyone at the party was aware of the risk and, as far as he knew, nobody who attended had contracted the virus.
“That we have to feel like we have something to be ashamed of because we chose to celebrate the holiday in a perfectly ordinary way is crazy,” he said.

France and Britain Strike Deal to Reopen Border for Freight and Some Travel

LONDON — Britain agreed Tuesday night to conduct mass coronavirus tests on truck drivers as part of a deal with France to reopen the border to some travelers and to freight trucks, raising hopes of relief for hundreds of drivers stuck near British ports and for supermarkets warning that they could soon run short of fruit and vegetables.
Two days after France closed its border, fearing a new and possibly more transmissible variant of the coronavirus that has been spreading in Britain, British ministers said rail, air and sea routes between the two countries would be restored on Wednesday morning.
The border closure had left more than 1,500 trucks stranded as the Port of Dover and the Eurotunnel were shut to outbound traffic. Some drivers slept in their trucks for two nights.
More broadly, the supply chain in Europe was disrupted, and industry experts warned that the effects would continue to ripple across the Continent for days.
Still, the deal announced Tuesday offered hope to people who had been struggling to get home and to drivers who had been stranded for days. Earlier in the day, France said that select groups of people would be allowed to travel from Britain to France if they could produce proof of a recent negative coronavirus test.
Those now allowed to travel include French and European Union citizens, noncitizens with a permanent residence in the EU and people whose travel is deemed essential. Among them are diplomats, health workers helping in France’s fight against COVID-19, and the drivers and crew of passenger planes, trains and buses.
The ban on freight trucks was lifted after the French and British governments agreed that drivers could travel to France if they were administered a rapid coronavirus test.
Even with the border closed, trucks from France had been allowed to bring goods into Britain. But few drivers chose to do so, worried they, too, would get marooned on the other side of the border.
It may be some time before a return to normalcy at the ports. The British government said it would discourage truck drivers from traveling to the congested roads near Dover as it works to ramp up a mass testing program, which may include the military.
“I am pleased that we have made this important progress with our French counterparts this evening,” Grant Shapps, the British government’s transport secretary, said in a statement. “We continue to urge haulers not to travel to Kent until further notice as we work to alleviate congestion at ports.”
The agreement came hours after the EU urged member states to step back from the draconian travel bans imposed in recent days. The bloc’s executive urged countries to continue discouraging nonessential travel to and from Britain, but said that British and other European citizens should be allowed to return to their homes and that goods should be allowed to move back and forth.
Many scientists suspect the new variant is already in continental Europe. And they stressed that travel bans were useful only if such measures gave countries time to minimize the spread of the virus within their borders and ramp up efforts to detect the new variant.
“Clearly, we need balance,” Emma Hodcroft, a researcher at the University of Bern in Switzerland, wrote on Twitter. “Act too soon with too little info and you generate panic without evidence — damaging economy, livelihoods and trust. But wait too long, and you could miss a vital window when we have the chance to have the most effective response.”
The discovery of the variant had led in recent days to a lockdown across much of southeastern England and bans on flights and trains between Britain and dozens of countries as they tried to stop the variant from spreading.
Because the trucks passing between France and Britain are continually cycling through Europe, the blockade has disrupted a continentwide freight system that industry experts said could quickly grind to a halt.
Drivers stuck near British ports were given a single cereal bar by local officials Monday, said Rod McKenzie, the director of policy at the Road Haulage Association, which represents the road transport industry. While drivers pack their own food, he said, they usually do not take much more than they expect to need for their few hours in Britain.
“It’s a story of human misery,” McKenzie said. “The government planning has been shocking on this, and there are no adequate lavatory facilities on the motorway for the past couple of days with up to 1,000 trucks parked up.”
The British government introduced plans devised for similar problems at the border after the country finalizes its split from the European Union on Dec. 31. It shut off parts of a motorway to allow trucks to park on the road and opened an old airport with room for 4,000 trucks to park.
British commentators noted that the usefulness of Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Brexit plans for a once-in-a-century pandemic did not do much to raise people’s confidence about how the country would fare if it crashes out of the EU at month’s end without a deal governing future commercial relations across the English Channel.
Scientists also noted that the new variant’s discovery in Britain did not mean an absence from the rest of Europe. Britain does considerably more genomic sequencing than other countries, allowing it to detect mutations more quickly.
“If you were going to pick it up anywhere, you were going to pick it up in the U.K.,” said Thomas Connor, a professor specializing in pathogen variation at Cardiff University in Wales. “The question for other countries around the world is: What capacity do they have to actually start undertaking some surveillance using genomic sequencing to be able to actually get an idea of what’s circulating there?”
In light of the unlikelihood that the variant is confined to Britain, the European Commission, the bloc’s executive arm, recommended on Tuesday that member states lift blanket bans on travelers from Britain.
It also urged countries not to impose cumbersome and time-consuming requirements for the most thorough coronavirus tests on truck drivers, but rather to rely on more rapid tests while ensuring that any such measures do not disrupt the flow of goods.
“While it is important to take swift temporary precautionary action to limit the further spread of the new strain of the virus and all nonessential travel to and from the U.K. should be discouraged, essential travel and transit of passengers should be facilitated,” the commission said in a statement. “Flight and train bans should be discontinued given the need to ensure essential travel and avoid supply chain disruptions.”
Addressing the issue of EU citizens stuck in Britain and British people stuck elsewhere on the Continent, the commission said they should be exempted from any temporary blockades and allowed to return home.
Those “traveling to their member state or country of residence as well as third-country nationals that enjoy EU free movement rights should be exempted from further temporary restrictions provided that they undergo a test or quarantine,” the recommendation said.

All Pixar features arrive with technical innovations, but “Soul,” opening Friday on Disney+, breaks important new ground: The movie centers on the studio’s first Black protagonist, Joe Gardner, a jazz pianist on what might be the biggest day of his life, and the creative team includes the company’s first Black co-director, Kemp Powers.
In general, Black stories and talent remain underrepresented in American animation, on screen and off. You can hear Black stars in supporting roles (Samuel L. Jackson as Frozone in the “Incredibles” movies) or voicing animals (Chris Rock and Jada Pinkett Smith in the “Madagascar” series). But “Soul” is only the fourth American animated feature to make Black characters the leads, following “Bebe’s Kids” (1992), “The Princess and the Frog” (2009) and “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse” (2018).
“To me, Joe represents a lot of people who aren’t being seen right now,” said Jamie Foxx, who provides Joe’s voice. “Joe is in all of us, regardless of color. To be the first Black lead in a Pixar film feels like a blessing, especially during this time when we all could use some extra love and light.”
Knowing their work on “Soul” would be minutely scrutinized, director Pete Docter, co-screenwriter Mike Jones and producer Dana Murray, who are white, set out to create a character who would be believably Black while avoiding the stereotypes of the past.
The journey of Joe Gardner — and “Soul” — began four years ago, when Docter felt at loose ends after winning his second Oscar, for “Inside Out.” Murray recalled, “Pete had this feeling, ‘Is this it? Do I just do this again?’ I don’t know if it was a midlife crisis as much as a midlife 'what-am-I-doing?' moment.”
Docter began wondering about the origins of human personalities, and whether people were born destined to do certain things. Jones added, “In our first meeting, he told me, ‘Think about an idea set in a place beyond space and time, where souls are given their personalities.’”
Docter said he and Jones worked for about two years to develop Joe, a Black middle-school music teacher and musician from Queens. But something was missing. “We wanted somebody who could speak authentically about this character and bring some depth to him,” Docter said. “That’s when Kemp Powers came on,” as the film’s co-director
Powers’ background is in live action and journalism; he adapted the coming film “One Night in Miami” (also due Friday) from his own play. But he felt at home in the new medium. “Animation is a very collaborative, iterative form, which felt very akin to live theater,” he said. He was initially hired for 12 weeks as a writer, but his contract was extended. “Later, I got promoted to co-director, because Pete really wrapped me into the process.”
Nevertheless, Powers understood the pitfalls of his role: “Some people might relish the idea of saying they speak for Black people, Black Americans, whatever: I am not one of those people,” he said, adding, “I’m absolutely a Black man, and I know my history; at the same time, I can’t speak for all the Black men who are from New York; I can’t speak for my generation.”
Murray said Pixar recognized that “if Joe’s going to be Black, we’d need a lot of help.” She said Britta Wilson, the company’s vice president of inclusion strategies, helped build an internal “Cultural Trust” made up of some of the studio’s Black employees, a group that was diverse in terms of gender, jobs and age. “We also talked to a lot of external consultants and worked with Black organizations to make sure we were telling this story authentically and truthfully,” Murray added.
Powers said they were all aware of the specificity needed for Joe’s character. “Treating the Black experience as a monolith makes things a lot easier: You can have one Black person rubber-stamp something and use that as your excuse for not having tried harder to get it right.”
He recalled that the individual consultants brought a range of viewpoints: “We’d have 20 Black people in a room: We’d ask a question and get 20 different answers.” Their debates sometimes “broke along generational lines, which was interesting: Things I think are fine may seem offensive to the younger generation. Everyone had a different take, which made the job exponentially harder, but that care was needed.”
Further complicating their work was the fact that animation is a medium of caricature: No human is as squat and angular as Carl in Pixar’s “Up,” yet audiences accept him as a crabby old man. For “Soul,” the Pixar crew strove to create characters who were recognizably Black while avoiding anything that recalled the racist stereotypes in old cartoons, from Mammy Two Shoes, the Black maid in the Tom and Jerry cartoons, to George Pal’s stop-motion Jasper.
Docter, who has written about animation history, acknowledged, “There’s a long and painful history of caricatured racist design tropes that were used to mock African Americans.”
He recalled that when he was making “Up,” he worried about how the design of Asian American scout Russell might be perceived. Docter said his fellow Pixar director Peter Sohn, a Korean American artist, advised him, “‘Korean eyes are shaped differently than Caucasian eyes. Look at me and draw what you see: The truth isn’t racist.’”
Powers agreed that there was an important difference between “leaning into and taking pride in those features and making fun of those features.” Pixar, he said, was mindful of the sorry images from animation history. When it came to designing appealing but stylized characters, the artists “took care not to make them insulting. At the same time, we didn’t want them to be white characters who happen to be brown-skinned. We had to give them distinct looks, so they’re not just boring, monotone characters.”
To create those looks, Pixar artists and technicians needed to capture the textures of Black hair and the way light plays on various tones of Black skin. Murray said they brought in cinematographer Bradford Young, whose work includes “Solo: A Star Wars Story,” to consult as well.
Finding the voice that fits an animated character is as challenging as finding the best performer for a live-action role. “You have a voice in your head that you can write to,” Jones explained. “We needed Joe to have ambition, to want to play music at the highest level, but we also needed Joe to be excited to teach what he loves — jazz — to his students, all of which Jamie provided.”
Although Foxx has voiced animated characters before, he had to adjust his performance. “When I got in the recording booth, I was delivering the lines with all kinds of facial expressions and gestures,” Foxx said. “They were like, “Uh, Jamie, let’s try that again and remember ... we can’t see you.”
During the film, Joe argues — and bonds — with a recalcitrant soul known as 22, who refuses to enter a human body. As 22, Tina Fey found the purely vocal performance liberating. Although she, too, has done other voice-overs before: “I could let go of any worry about how I looked. Even as a comedy person, you’re always thinking a little bit about finding your light and standing up straight. It’s so freeing to not have to do that.” (The relationship between Joe and 22 grows increasingly complicated, but neither actor wanted to say anything that might spoil the plot twists.)
Reflecting on the creation of “Soul,” Powers said, “When someone told me I was Pixar’s first Black director, I said that can’t be right. Pete said — and my hope is — this is an indicator of changes that are going to be pretty rapid.” There are more animators of color and women in the business than there were 15 or 20 years ago, he noted. “It’s sad it’s taken this long, but I’m glad it’s coming finally.”

NEW YORK — In 2018, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center’s chief medical officer, Dr. José Baselga, resigned under fire over his failure to disclose payments from health care companies in dozens of research articles he wrote.
Now, recent Internal Revenue Service filings show the nonprofit hospital paid more than $1.5 million in severance to Baselga in 2018 and 2019.
The revelations about the former executive led to significant changes governing Memorial Sloan Kettering’s ties to the health care and pharmaceutical industries and prompted an overhaul of its conflict-of-interest policies. The disclosure failures, which were uncovered by The New York Times and ProPublica, also led to a broader re-examination of how medical journals enforce their conflict-of-interest policies as well as heightened scrutiny of the relationships between medical researchers and for-profit companies at cancer centers around the country.
The hospital would not say whether it paid additional severance to Baselga in 2020. A spokeswoman said the past payments reflected the hospital’s “contractual obligation” to Baselga under his employment agreement.
Baselga is now an executive at pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca, where he oversees development of its cancer drugs. He declined to comment through a company spokeswoman.
Nonprofit institutions, like many of their for-profit counterparts, often enter into employment contracts with top officials that provide compensation upon their departure. And it is difficult to break those agreements except in situations like court determinations of illegality, said Marcus S. Owens, who ran the IRS division that oversees nonprofits during the administrations of Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton.
That said, nonprofits, by law, must disclose the nature of their severance agreements for senior officials in their IRS filings. The large payment to Baselga was striking given how significantly his departure rattled the institution.
In fall 2018, Memorial Sloan Kettering’s chief executive, Dr. Craig B. Thompson, apologized to his staff for the handling of the episode, saying, “The events of the last few weeks have not been handled as well as I would have liked.”
At the same time, the then-chairman of the board, Douglas A. Warner III, disparaged Baselga, who also held the title of physician-in-chief, saying he “crossed lines” and “went off the reservation” in his dealings with for-profit companies.
Although Baselga officially resigned from his position, Warner suggested that the departure was not voluntary, saying that despite Baselga’s talents, he “left us no choice.”
Baselga was a prominent researcher and a prolific author of medical articles. In his resignation letter, he acknowledged his lapses and said the controversy had proved to be “too much of a distraction.”
Baselga also stepped down from the boards of drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb and Varian Medical Systems, a radiation equipment manufacturer, as well as the cancer journal where he had been an editor.
After months of review, Memorial Sloan Kettering overhauled its conflict-of-interest policy, barring its top executives from serving on corporate boards of drug and health care companies and placing limits on how executives and top researchers could profit from work developed at the institution.
Like other major hospitals, Memorial Sloan Kettering’s finances have taken a hit during the coronavirus pandemic. For the first three quarters of 2020, the hospital reported an operating loss of $453 million compared with an operating profit of nearly $77 million in the first nine months of 2019. The hospital had a decline in surgical procedures and clinic visits, as well as clinical trials and other research. The hospital did receive $100 million in relief funds as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act.
Baselga was not the only former official to receive severance from Memorial Sloan Kettering in 2019. It also paid more than $250,000 in severance to Avice Meehan, the hospital’s former chief communications officer, according to its IRS filing. Meehan declined to comment.
Laurie Styron, executive director of CharityWatch, an independent watchdog group, said that hospitals often compensate their staff generously because they must attract highly trained and educated doctors who would be well-paid elsewhere. Still, she said, the multimillion-dollar sums can surprise donors, who typically give money to support research or patient care.
“The reactions we get from donors are negative when they hear that they, as a middle-class working person, sent in what they could toward a charitable cause and then they find out that someone is making millions of dollars,” she said.

NEW YORK — Sharon Escobar couldn’t recognize her father.
His face was so badly decomposed that she and her mother were eventually able to identify him only because of a scar on his leg.
Escobar had paid a funeral home in Brooklyn to tend to the remains of her father, Elisha Magosha, after he died in mid-April from complications of COVID-19.
Two weeks later she learned that his body had been disintegrating alongside more than a dozen others inside two U-Haul trucks parked in front of the Andrew T. Cleckley Funeral Home, a small building squeezed between a sex shop and a dollar store.
Odors seeping from the trucks were the clues to what was going on at the funeral home on Utica Avenue, prompting passersby to complain to authorities.
The discovery in early May, as the pandemic held a firm grip on New York, shocked and angered a traumatized city, and in November, the home’s director, Andrew Cleckley, had his license revoked by the state for improperly handling the remains of pandemic victims.
Cleckley said he was overwhelmed by the deluge of bodies his home received and said that even though he was the principal leaseholder, five other funeral services operated out of the building, and he could not be responsible for overseeing how all of them were treating remains.
Still, a large part of his job involved embalming bodies for those other firms, raising questions about the extent of his role.
“Everything I did was out of compassion — helping the other funeral homes, embalming their bodies, picking up bodies for them,” he said, as he stood in a visitation room on the second floor of his now-closed funeral home.
“People were calling, ‘Come get my mother, please. I can’t find a funeral home,’ ’’ Cleckley added. “It was just hard times.”
While the case attracted widespread attention in the spring, an examination by The New York Times revealed how extreme conditions had become. Cleckley continued to accept bodies even though he could not keep up with the mounting caseload and never sought outside help to lessen the burden. As a result, dozens of decomposing bodies were scattered haphazardly throughout the home and some families were unable to locate their relatives’ bodies.
What unfolded at the Cleckley home was perhaps the most extreme episode that emerged when the pandemic engulfed the city’s system for handling the dead — reflecting the tragedy, chaos and overall lack of resources in the face of the biggest public health crisis in a century.
“It was the craziest time I’ve ever been alive,” said John D’Arienzo, president of the Metropolitan Funeral Directors Association. “After Mr. Cleckley’s actions came to light, the medical examiner realized how overwhelmed funeral services were.’’
Other funeral homes were also forced to find spaces for bodies wherever they could, in chapels or visitation rooms, raising the air conditioning to prevent decomposition. They had to send bodies to other cities or out of state to have them cremated.
“Everyone wanted to use the crematories, but there was no space available,” said David Penepent, the director of the funeral services administration program at SUNY Canton, who created a service that helped transport bodies to crematories far from the city. “So that’s how the problem developed.”
Penepent was asked by New York City’s office of emergency management to help catalog and transport 63 remains from the Cleckley funeral home, including those stored in the trucks, to a makeshift morgue on the Brooklyn waterfront. He arrived at the home on May 1.
Even as a 27-year veteran of the funeral home industry, he was disturbed by what he found. Bodies inside the trucks were “stacked like cords of firewood.” In the visitation room, unwrapped remains that had not been embalmed were piled haphazardly, including a 250-pound man on top of a 185-pound woman. The smell was nauseating.
“It was horrifying, the most horrifying disrespect for human remains,” Penepent said in an interview.
Despite worsening conditions at his funeral home, Cleckley continued to accept bodies for embalmings and viewings, according to a state Health Department report obtained by The Times after a Freedom of Information request.
“Some human remains were at advanced stages of decomposition and putrefaction, having been there for an extended period of time of greater than four weeks,” according to the report, which recommended that Cleckley’s license be taken away and that he be fined $68,000.
Bodies were found lying “willy-nilly across a chapel floor, completely exposed or partially wrapped in sheets with stains of body fluids,” the report said, adding that Cleckley failed to take appropriate measures to prevent decay, like using formaldehyde, leaving remains vulnerable to maggots.
“He should have focused on the human remains scattered around his funeral home and preparations needed to connect them with loved ones,” the report said. “Instead, these bodies became victims of his neglect while he substantially increased his caseload by continuing to take in more trade work.”
But Cleckley’s lawyer argued that the state failed to prove its case against his client.
“There was not an ounce of testimony that a human remain entrusted to Mr. Cleckley was not treated with dignity and respect,’’ the lawyer, Robert Osuna, wrote in a brief submitted to the state, adding that Cleckley had an “unblemished record and never before had been the subject of a complaint.”
Cleckley was being unfairly punished for the actions of other funeral services that operated out of the home, Osuna said.
“I think he was scapegoated for the entire pandemic and the funeral industry in New York,” he said in an interview.
Magosha’s family said another funeral director at the Cleckley home, Anthony J. Armstead, sent an email claiming that he had embalmed Magosha’s remains when, in fact, the body was lying in the U-Haul truck. They have sued Armstead in addition to Cleckley.
In a brief interview, Armstead declined to discuss the case. “I did not have anything to do with anything,” he said.
Other families who hired the home to care for the remains of their dead relatives described shoddy practices that deepened their trauma.
Relatives of Hermite Mercius, who died April 18 in a Brooklyn nursing home from the virus, said the funeral home misidentified her remains, sending them a photo of someone who was not her.
“It was a completely different person,” said Mercius’ sister, Antonine Beaulieu.
When Beaulieu tried pressing the funeral home for details, “I couldn’t get in touch with anybody,” she said. “The city called me two weeks later to tell me they had the body of my sister, and they sent us a real picture of her. So I had to ask a different funeral home to go get her body.”
Cleckley is named in six lawsuits filed by relatives of six people, accusing him of improperly handling their remains.
A native of Queens, Cleckley, 41, said he was trained at the American Academy McAllister Institute, a funeral services school in Manhattan, and graduated from Nassau Community College. He opened his funeral home in February 2018.
Cleckley said he entered the funeral business after becoming fascinated with the art and science of embalming when he started doing odd jobs for a funeral director who attended his mother’s church.
“One weekend I was told to take some clothes downstairs so the embalmer could dress a body,’’ he said. “I observed what he was doing, and I made my decision right there, that that’s what I wanted to do. I fought hard to become a funeral director.”
Before the pandemic, Cleckley said he averaged between six and seven funerals every month. But by the end of February, he had already performed 20 services.
At the beginning of April, he said his phones started ringing incessantly.
“Every time I hang up with a line, my line rings back,” he said. “I took 10 calls in one day.”
Then it became 20. He started calling New York City’s five crematories, but he said they turned him away because they were full. He finally found two in New Jersey, one in Newark and another in Camden, but they only had room for a limited number of bodies.
So on April 12, he said he rented a refrigerated truck because he could not keep up with the bodies that were being taken to his funeral home.
“Things were happening so fast,” he said. “I’m in the back, I embalm five bodies. Then I got to run out and pick up two or three bodies. I’ve got to embalm those or put them on the refrigerated truck. Then I come back, and I’m told ‘Oh, these people called.’ I couldn’t attend to everybody else because I was so busy.”
One of the bodies he took care of was that of a cousin who died of the virus. “I did it because of my professional training,” he said. “But it wasn’t easy.”
On April 25, he rented a regular U-Haul truck because he said truck companies had stopped renting refrigerated vehicles to funeral homes. He used that U-Haul three times, he said, to transport bodies to the crematories in New Jersey.
Of the 63 bodies that were retrieved from the funeral home, Cleckley said only 15 of them were under his care, while the rest were the obligation of the other funeral directors working at his building.
But the state said that Cleckely bore ultimate liability for what occurred because his name was on the lease and that he did not provide evidence linking the other funeral directors to any of the bodies.
“If your name is on the front of the building, whoever was doing illegal acts or immoral acts, you’re the responsible party,” Penepent said, adding that Cleckley never asked for help.
Cleckley is now out of a job and has been cleaning out his funeral home. He has also gotten a fresh tattoo on his neck — a devil whispering in his ear.
A number of other lawsuits have recently been filed against other funeral homes in New York City and New Jersey. In one case, a funeral home cremated the wrong remains. In another, a body was sent to Hart Island — New York’s potter's field — to be buried without the family’s knowledge or approval.
“I think we were all a little sloppy in the beginning,” said Pat Marmo, an unusually frank funeral director in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, who said it was difficult to keep remains properly cold when there was no space in refrigerated storage rooms.
“They were all categorized, stacked properly, but there was one problem: I had an odor,’’ he said. “No matter how much air conditioning I put on, it wasn’t a refrigerated room. Nobody was trained for this. Nobody.”
For some families who sought Cleckley’s services, what happened to their relatives’ remains was inexcusable.
Magosha, 59, a retired diplomat and a former officer in the Zimbabwean army, died on April 15, days after being hospitalized with chest pains.
“I honestly did not think he was going to pass,” said Escobar, his daughter, breaking down in tears. “I thought he was going to be able to fight through it and he was going to come back home.
“My last word to him was walking out and saying, ‘I love you,’’ she added. “And that was it.”
Escobar and her family had to pay to have her father’s face reconstructed. His body was flown to Harare, fulfilling his wish to be buried in his homeland.
“I’m still in disbelief,’’ she said, “just still in disbelief.”

A panel of judges in the Cayman Islands on Tuesday cut the sentence of an American college student who violated the territory’s coronavirus laws to two months from four months after her lawyers argued that the sentence was too harsh.
A lawyer for the student, Skylar Mack, 18, and her boyfriend, Vanjae Ramgeet, 24, said they were sorry and asked for the forgiveness of the people of the Cayman Islands.
“Whilst it was our hope that Skylar would be able to return home to resume her studies in January, we accept the decision of the court and look forward to receiving its written reasons in due course,” the lawyer, Jonathon Hughes, said in a statement.
Mack and Ramgeet were sentenced last week to four months in prison after violating the Cayman Islands’ required 14-day quarantine period for visitors.
Mack's grandmother pleaded for an early release ahead of the hearing.
“She cries, she wants to come home,” Jeanne Mack, 68, said on NBC’s “Today” show Monday. “She knows she made a mistake. She owns up to that, but she’s pretty hysterical right now.”
In late November, with her semester at Mercer University in Georgia complete, Skylar Mack flew to the Cayman Islands to watch Ramgeet compete in the islands’ Jet Ski racing national championship.
When she arrived, however, there was a problem.
She got there on a Friday; the championship was on Sunday. And the country’s laws required her to remain in her hotel room for 14 days.
To elude the restrictions, Mack, after receiving a negative coronavirus test, slipped an electronic monitoring bracelet from her wrist and escaped to a beach on Grand Cayman’s South Sound, where she saw Ramgeet win first place.
But the event organizers were notified that Mack may have been in breach of the rules and the police were called, her lawyer said. Mack was charged with leaving her home during the quarantine period, and Ramgeet was charged with aiding and abetting her.
“This was as flagrant a breach as could be imagined,” Justice Roger Chapple said in court during the sentencing, according to the Cayman Compass, a news website in the Cayman Islands. “It was born of selfishness and arrogance.”
The islands, a British territory of nearly 65,000 residents, had reported 316 coronavirus infections and two deaths, as of Monday, with no reported cases of local transmission since July. Only people who have been preauthorized to enter the Cayman Islands can travel there, and they must quarantine at home or in a government or private facility.
Upon arrival in the Cayman Islands, visitors receive an electronic smart wristband and are equipped with a cellphone with an app, called Stay Safe Cayman. Using the app, they must log where they are quarantining. Visitors cannot end quarantines until they can show negative results from tests taken on their 15th day on the island, government officials said
Mack’s relatives in suburban Atlanta pulled together letters from friends and family members attesting to her character in an effort to get the sentence overturned on appeal, Jeanne Mack said.
Jeanne Mack also wrote to President Donald Trump for help. She received a response from the Office of Presidential Correspondence last week stating that her message had been forwarded “to the appropriate federal agency for further action.”
Eric Trump, the president’s son, said on Twitter Tuesday that a four-month sentence was unfair. “This is infuriating,” he wrote. “Skylar is an 18 year old girl who left her hotel to watch her boyfriend compete in a jet ski competition… 4 months in jail?!”
Skylar Mack, a premed student and the daughter of Dennis Mack, a professional Jet Ski racer, and her family had no excuses for what happened, her grandmother said: What she did was wrong.
“I’ll do everything to get you home, and when I get you here, I’m going to kick your butt,” Jeanne Mack said. “We’re not saying, ‘poor, innocent Skylar.’ We’re simply saying the punishment does not meet the crime.”
Skylar Mack and Ramgeet pleaded guilty to breaking the quarantine rules and were initially sentenced to 40 hours of community service and were fined 2,600 Cayman Islands dollars (about $3,100). But the punishment was increased last week after the prosecutor appealed, saying the initial sentences were “unduly lenient and wrong in principle.”
Chapple said in court last week that “the gravity of the breach was such that the only appropriate sentence would have been one of immediate imprisonment,” the Cayman Compass reported.

In a message intended to prevent a rush to the southwestern border, the incoming Biden administration announced Tuesday that it would not immediately reverse restrictions imposed by President Donald Trump that have effectively halted asylum and left thousands of migrants stranded outside the United States.
The Trump administration progressively tightened restrictions on asylum, effectively sealing the border to asylum-seekers by forcing them to wait in Mexico for the duration of their immigration hearings and disqualifying people who did not first seek protection in a country they passed en route to the United States.
During his campaign, President-elect Joe Biden promised to swiftly reverse those and other Trump administration border policies. But on Tuesday, Biden and his top advisers seemed to walk back those pledges.
At an event in Wilmington, Delaware, the president-elect told reporters that he would enact a more “humane policy” at the borders but that his administration would need “probably the next six months” to rebuild a system to process migrants and secure funding for immigration judges.
Changing Trump’s policies immediately, he warned, would be “the last thing we need” because it might lead to having “2 million people on our border.”
“It will get done and it will get done quickly but it’s not going to be able to be done on Day 1,” Biden added.
Immigrant advocates and human rights groups have called on Biden to swiftly roll back immigration measures that have barred most people from entering the United States. On Tuesday, they expressed openness to waiting for policy changes — but not for too long.
“Certainly the Biden administration is going to need a little time to undo all the damage and chaos that has been inflicted on the immigration and asylum systems, but the United States does not need six months in order to uphold its legal obligations under U.S. refugee law and treaties,” said Eleanor Acer, senior director for refugee protection at Human Rights First.
In their first detailed briefing with reporters on the president-elect’s immigration and border policies, aides to Biden said the new administration would eventually resume processing of asylum-seekers at ports of entry along the border. But they said that initially only a limited number of migrants would be allowed to have their claims heard.
The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because Biden has not taken office, said he aimed to pivot to what they called a more humane approach, not just at the border but also toward refugees abroad seeking safe haven in the United States and millions of immigrants living in the country illegally.
Quickly undoing Trump’s policies could be construed as rolling out the welcome mat, risking an uptick in arrivals that could devolve into a humanitarian crisis for a new administration that will also have to focus on taming the raging coronavirus pandemic and reviving the economy.
“Processing power at the border is not like a light that can be turned on and off,” Susan Rice, an incoming domestic policy adviser, said a day before the briefing by transition officials.
“Migrants and asylum-seekers should not at all believe the people in the region who are selling the idea that the border will suddenly be wide open to process everyone on the first day,” Rice told the Spanish-language wire service EFE. “It will not be so.”
After a sharp decline, unauthorized entries have been rising and could pose the first major test of Biden’s pledge to adopt a more compassionate policy along America’s border with Mexico.
Across the entire southwestern border, Border Patrol agents made more than 70,000 arrests of migrants in November, a slight decline from more than 70,500 border crossings recorded in October. That was the largest number since the summer of 2019, when families fleeing poverty and violence arrived at the border by the busload and turned themselves in to U.S. authorities before coronavirus lockdowns.
Intent on cracking down on unauthorized crossings and asylum, a system it believes is exploited by migrants, the Trump administration has moved in recent weeks to finalize tough border restrictions that could prove difficult for Biden to unwind.
One of those rules would bar migrants from obtaining asylum in the United States if they came from a country deemed to be a coronavirus hot spot, declaring them “a danger to the security of the United States.” This month, the administration completed other sweeping rules that restricted the eligibility criteria for asylum at the border and directed officers to deny most claims based on domestic abuse or gang violence.
The Trump administration in March also empowered the Border Patrol to turn away migrants immediately when they crossed the border, regardless of whether they wished to request asylum. Border agents have conducted 300,000 expulsions under the rule, which administration officials say is needed to prevent the spread of infection among American citizens and in detention facilities.
Aides to Biden said he eventually intended to abolish some and possibly all of those rules. But they did not specify when.
“It sounds to me like they’re taking operational considerations into account while they’re doing their planning,” said Theresa Cardinal Brown, the director of immigration and cross-border policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center. “If you just say we’re going to lift all these restrictions, people will just come en masse.”
On another major immigration issue, Biden had promised during the campaign to revive America’s role as a world leader in refugee resettlement by accepting 125,000 refugees annually.
But on Tuesday his aides said that it was too early to commit to that number, saying that the current administration had so decimated the program that it would take months to repair. Trump had set a ceiling of 15,000 refugees for the 2021 fiscal year, an all-time low.
The steep decline in admissions has hampered refugee resettlement agencies like the International Rescue Committee and HIAS, forcing them to slash workforces or shutter some offices in some cities altogether. Operations conducted abroad for processing refugees, who undergo interviews, security checks and medical exams, were also gutted by the Trump administration.
Biden’s team has also indicated that the new administration would not rush to end a policy that has forced more than 60,000 migrants to wait in Mexico for their cases to be heard by an immigration judge in the United States.
That Trump policy has left many migrants living in squalid tent encampments where kidnappings, torture and assaults at the hands of drug cartels are reportedly common.
And while Biden has said he will stop construction of a border wall, Trump’s signature immigration project, there is no sign his administration will refrain from enforcement, using agents backed by aerial and ground technology.
“The whole conversation continues to be premised on how to deter these people when it should be centered on how we welcome the most vulnerable people,” said Roberto Lopez, an organizer with the Texas Civil Rights Project, an advocacy group, in the Rio Grande Valley border region.
On the campaign trail, Biden assailed the Trump administration’s brutal “zero tolerance” policy that separated thousands of families at the border, and the officials said that he would form a task force to locate parents who still have not been reunited with their children.
However, they did not commit to bringing back parents who have been deported, something advocates say needs to be done soon.
“What the Biden administration chooses to do over the next few weeks will literally have life-and-death consequences for countless children and families,” said Lee Gelernt, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union who has been representing the families.

Kwanzaa is more than an end-of-year display of deep orange and burnt burgundy Dutch wax-print fabrics, and righteous images of fruit bowls sitting near wooden cups. It is an edifying lifestyle choice.
“More people are starting to focus on who they are, and what they want their families to experience — empowering cultural stories that get our brains from up under the foot of oppression,” said Janine Bell, president and artistic director of Elegba Folklore Society in Richmond, Virginia.
The holiday — observed by people of all ages and religious affiliations — resonates in a year of racial upheaval and the COVID-19 pandemic, which has killed more than 30,000 Black Americans, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This year’s tone is virtual ceremonial pomp and circumstance, followed by bottles of apple cider or sparkling wine.
Kwanzaa, which starts on Saturday, was founded in 1966 by Maulana Karenga, then a leader of a community organization in Los Angeles called Us, and modeled after the harvest or “first fruits” celebrations in ancient Egypt, West Africa’s New Yam Festival and other celebrations on the African continent.
Mkeka, the woven natural colored mats, and kinara, the wooden candleholder flickering with seven flames, are standard for veteran Kwanzaa devotees. For many new observers, trimming a long table plays second fiddle to living the Nguzo Saba, or seven principles of Kwanzaa.
“It’s an absolute time of freethinking and openness,” Bell said. “A sense of spirit is centered — being grounded and elevated at once.”
One of Kwanzaa’s core ideals is bonding with loved ones. The seven days of celebration are both loud and quiet, humble and large, with Black Americans getting together around the nation, from suburban enclaves outside of Atlanta to cities along the banks of the James River in Virginia, to the Center Street community in Des Moines, Iowa, and mansions in the Baldwin Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles.
Libations, a moment of silence for the ancestors, songs, dances, speeches, poems, harambee or the unity chant are activities during Kwanzaa nights. Slow-cooked meatless collard greens, crispy seasoned tofu slabs, whole spicy grilled fish, Trinidad-meets-New Orleans bread puddings and rum punch are devoured under the sound of drumming or groovy musical playlists. Young kids are encouraged to participate in all aspects of the festivities.
A time of feasting and candle-lighting are a soft pillow to collapse into after the long-haul duties of supporting Black-owned restaurants, organizing social justice direct actions, nurturing elders and dancing through pain and triumph. Black Americans reposing for seven days and bookending the time with a bounteous meal is communal self-care.
The New York Times visited five households around the country to see their Kwanzaa food traditions and explore how their families celebrate.
Rashad Frazier and Keita Orr Frazier, Portland, Oregon
“My late Aunt Beverly was the Kwanzaa snob in our family,” said Rashad Frazier, a personal chef living in Portland, Oregon. Beverly Cureton Graham died in February of causes unrelated to COVID-19, Frazier said. “We have not seen friends or family since her funeral. Kwanzaa is the perfect way to celebrate her memory.”
Frazier, 40, is from Charlotte, North Carolina, and his wife, Keita Orr Frazier, 38, grew up in Ridgeland, South Carolina. Their children, Ellis, 6, and Zora, 2, are observing Kwanzaa for the first time. “In my mind, the idea of Kwanzaa speaks to me, the principles and direction, and self-reflection,” Keita Orr Frazier said. “I have not thought about the trimmings of tables and candles.”
Bid whist, spades, rest and escape can be found in Black homes all over America at holidays, as it was in Keita Orr Frazier’s home at Christmas when she was growing up. December, when everyone comes together, allows for rare culinary indulgences — preserved fruit- and jelly-layered cakes, pineapple upside-down cakes, red velvet cakes — and Kwanzaa is no exception. “This year taught me to slow down and think about what memories I’m giving my kids,” she said.
The Fraziers will introduce their children to Kwanzaa through crafts projects and by getting them involved in preparing the special meal, or karamu. Traditionally, the feast takes place on the day dedicated to kuumba (creativity), but like most people nowadays, they’re opting for the day that is best for them.
There is no one set tradition for the food either. On the menu is Rashad Frazier’s coffee-rubbed whole fish, perfected this summer during family camping trips that also served as research for Camp Yoshi, their venture focused on guided outdoor experiences for people of color, especially Black people. For Generation X and millennials, self-identity and lineage is the Kwanzaa centerpiece, minus the Instagram posts and emoji.
Folami Prescott-Adams, Atlanta
Folami Prescott-Adams’ countertop karamu spread has evolved since guests brought chips and salsa to her first celebration in Atlanta in the early 1990s. “We needed food and not snacks,” said Prescott-Adams, a community psychologist. Now, with more than three decades of experience with Kwanzaa feast hosting, she kicks off the planning with an email to 30 families, where potluck dishes are confirmed. Last year, more than 100 people gathered inside her southwest Atlanta home.
Her contribution is always the same: “I cook 10 pounds of barbecue tofu,” said Prescott-Adams, a 60-year-old mother of four, the tofu painstakingly dried, sauced up and crisped. A serving line forms in the early hours of the shindig; marinated wings, nut “meatballs,” macaroni and cheese and vegan Southern-style string beans perching in uniformed platters fill her kitchen.
The dining room is headquarters for Kwanzaa bingo and the zawadi, or prizes. “I buy gifts all year at thrift stores and yard sales.” This year’s guests will commemorate the holiday at a virtual candle-lighting party.
Prescott-Adams is no-holds-barred with Kwanzaa vignettes around her home, though she understands the long-standing commentary about anti-commercialization around the holiday. “I’ve created something for my husband, kids and grandkids that feels warm and safe.”
Maati Kheprimeni Angaza, Brooklyn, New York
“Everything has shifted,” said Maati Kheprimeni Angaza, 21, a senior at Temple University who is finishing up her final year online in Brooklyn. For Angaza, Kwanzaa is constant — it’s all she celebrates in December.
It is a time when the dance major can teach her young cousins basic West African moves and choreograph routines for herself. “My personal Kwanzaa celebration includes taking a moment to take in all the blessings,” she said.
She winds down the year by buying products from Black owned-beauty brands, spending time with her boyfriend and prepping for the karamu.
“When it comes to the feast, do what feels authentic to you,” said Angaza, a lifelong vegan. Curry potatoes, black-eyed peas and luscious desserts are traditions in her culinary muscle memory. “My stepmother makes an amazing bread pudding, with sweet potato and raisins; it’s a little dense and reminds me of a currant roll.”
Kwanzaa has also become a time for creativity in the kitchen as she’s gotten older, she said: “During quarantine, I got good at making vegan doughnuts” — cinnamon sugar, chocolate walnut, chocolate peanut butter drizzle.
“I plan to have a bunch of those on the spread this year,” she said. “Maybe red, black, green glazed?”
She is honoring her roots and having fun: “Kwanzaa food should be a piece of us.”
Janine Bell, Richmond, Virginia
In the early 1980s, Janine Bell attended her first Kwanzaa community event, hosted by Branches of the Art, a multidisciplinary arts organization that is now defunct. She remembers casserole dishes with sweet potatoes and corn pudding. “Not African cuisine, but food that lived on our grandparents’ table — food from the American South,” said Bell, who is a pescatarian.
Growing up in Greensboro, North Carolina, she was oblivious to Kwanzaa. Since 1990, Bell has been producing the Capital City Kwanzaa Festival. This year it will be a seven-night virtual event.
At home, Bell hosts an intimate Kwanzaa affair for her immediate clan. “My daughter makes sure we have the fruits and kikombe, and makes sure that we have everything in the dining room,” she said.
It is Bell’s favorite space — olive-painted walls surrounded by her late grandparents’ furniture, crystal servingware, lace coverings, a gilded mirror and silver candelabras. African masks and a painting titled “Autumn Leaves” sit among the mkeka, kinara and Kwanzaa decorations made by her granddaughter. The room carries the energy of five generations in one place.
A 1935 family photo shows people posing around the same furnishings and eating fruit from glass salad plates stored in the sideboard — a legacy unbroken.
Kerry Coddett and Krystal Stark, Brooklyn, New York
Any other year, the revelers would be donning HBCU sweatshirts and snazzy backpacks shaped like an outline of Africa — not Santa Claus costumes — to follow the bullhorns at Kwanzaa Crawl.
“It’s one day dedicated to celebrating the Black-owned businesses in our communities,” said Kerry Coddett, who founded the annual event five years ago with her sister, Krystal Stark. “It highlights and brings in all the seven principles of Kwanzaa.” Attendees spent an estimated $500,000 at last year’s bar hop, which snaked through Harlem’s wide city blocks and central Brooklyn neighborhoods, the sisters said.
The sisters, who have roots in Trinidad and Guyana, said the holiday was always in their background but came into focus after the 2014 and 2016 civil unrest spurred by the killings of Alton Sterling and Eric Garner. “We wanted a way to celebrate our Blackness and improve the conditions of Black people around us,” Coddett said.
Because of COVID-19 restrictions this year for New York City bars and restaurants, the opening Kwanzaa ceremony and roving bacchanal are a no-go.
Coddett and Stark share an apartment and plan to celebrate Kwanzaa with their younger brother. “We’ll get to celebrate all the way,” Coddett said. Both say they’ve missed dinners and the season’s merriment because of the crawl logistics — 5,000 participants and 35 bars and restaurants.
Stark is the better cook, and the plan is brunch. “Vegan pancakes, shrimp and mushroom lasagna (homemade vegan ricotta cheese), sorrel, Champagne are on the menu,” she said. The sisters will also be ordering callaloo, roti and plantain takeout from Sugarcane in Brooklyn, one of the restaurants featured during the 2019 crawl. Together they’ll set intentions and light the kinara.
“I want to make sure we never lose our family’s language of food and love,” Coddett said.

Recipe: Coffee-Rubbed Grilled Fish
Yield: 4 servings
Total time: 30 minutes
2 whole fish (1 to 1 1/2 pounds each) such as branzino, gutted and scaled (see Notes)
2 teaspoons medium-ground coffee
2 teaspoons onion powder
2 teaspoons garlic powder
2 teaspoons ground cayenne (see Notes)
1 teaspoon ancho chile powder
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon packed brown sugar
1 teaspoon fine sea salt, plus more to taste
3 tablespoons vegetable oil, plus more for greasing the grill
Lime wedges, for serving
1. Prepare an outdoor grill or heat an indoor grill pan to medium-high, ensuring the grates are very clean. Using a sharp knife, score the fish with four diagonal slashes through the skin on both sides.
2. Mix the coffee, onion powder, garlic powder, cayenne, ancho, cumin, brown sugar and 1 teaspoon salt in a small bowl. Pat the fish very dry with paper towels, then drizzle with the oil and rub over the skin. Sprinkle the coffee rub all over the exterior and cavity of the fish and massage the seasoning into nooks and crannies.
3. Oil the grill grates or pan. Place the fish on the hot, greased grates, and cover, if using a gas grill. Grill, turning once, until skin is browned and crisp and the flesh is opaque, 5 to 6 minutes per side. The crisped skin should naturally release from the grate when turning and removing the fish. If it doesn’t, let it sit until it does. If it’s still stuck, carefully pry the skin off the grate with a spatula. Season to taste with salt, and serve right away with lime wedges.
Tips:
Other whole fish, such as rockfish, snapper and bass, work here too, as do other varieties and cuts, such as catfish or salmon fillets or tuna steaks. Increase the cooking time for bigger fish and decrease for fillets and steaks. The fish is done when the outsides are browned and the flesh opaque.
For less heat, reduce the cayenne to 1 teaspoon.
Recipe: Folami’s BBQ Tofu
Yield: 4 servings
Total time: 30 minutes, plus drying
1 pound extra-firm tofu, cut into 1/2-inch slices
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 tablespoon unsalted butter or vegan butter
1 tablespoon tamari
1/2 cup barbecue sauce
1. Two and a half hours before serving, start drying out the tofu. Place the slices in a single layer between clean, dry dish towels or double layers of paper towels. Press to remove water from the tofu, and let stand for 2 hours, replacing the soaked towels once or twice, until there is very little water left in the tofu. (You can press and dry the tofu quickly, and use it immediately, but it will be less crisp.)
2. Heat a broiler to its highest setting. Heat a large skillet over medium and add the oil and butter, swirling to cover the bottom. Pour the tamari into a small, shallow dish. Press the tofu one last time. Quickly dip both sides of a single slice in the tamari and place it in the skillet. (Be careful as the liquid may lead to hot pops from the oil.) Repeat with the remaining tofu slices and tamari.
3. Cook until the tofu gets the same beautiful golden brown on both sides, 2 to 3 minutes per side. While the tofu browns, spread half of the barbecue sauce on a small rimmed baking sheet. Transfer the tofu to the barbecue sauce on the sheet, then cover with the remaining sauce. Broil, turning once, until the sauce thickens and bubbles, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Serve hot.
Tips:
Scale up the proportions to prepare as many pounds of tofu as you would like.
Recipe: Vegan Doughnuts
Yield: 12 doughnuts and holes
Total time: 1 hour, plus rising dough and cooling
For the Doughnuts:
1 packet active dry yeast (2 1/4 teaspoons)
1/4 cup/50 grams plus 1/4 teaspoon granulated sugar
1/4 cup/60 milliliters lukewarm water
3/4 cup/180 milliliters almond milk or other nondairy alternative
5 tablespoons/70 grams vegan butter, melted and cooled
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt
1/4 cup/65 grams unsweetened applesauce
3 cups/385 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for kneading and rolling
Vegetable oil, for greasing the bowl and for frying
For the Glaze:
3 cups/370 grams confectioners’ sugar
2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
1/4 to 1/2 cup/60 to 120 milliliters almond milk or other nondairy alternative
1/4 cup/25 grams unsweetened cocoa powder (optional)
Natural green, red or black food coloring (optional)
Chopped walnuts (optional)
1. Make the doughnuts: Stir the yeast and 1/4 teaspoon granulated sugar into the lukewarm water in a small bowl. Let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, combine the almond milk, vegan butter, vanilla, salt and remaining 1/4 cup/50 grams granulated sugar in a large mixer bowl and stir well. Add the applesauce and yeast mixture. Beat with a hand mixer or stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on medium speed until well blended.
2. With the mixer running on low speed, add the flour 1/4 cup/30 grams at a time, waiting until no floury streaks remain before adding the next. Continue beating until all traces of flour disappear. With floured hands, turn the dough onto a generously floured surface and knead lightly, flouring the dough and surface as needed, to form into a ball that’s tacky and elastic but not sticky. Place the ball in a large oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise until doubled in size, 1 1/2 hours.
3. Transfer the risen dough to a generously floured work surface and lightly sprinkle the dough with flour. With a floured rolling pin, gently roll into a 13-by-10-inch rectangle. The dough should be a scant inch thick. Using a floured 3-inch doughnut or round cutter, cut out rounds as close together as possible. If needed, using a floured 1-inch cutter, cut rounds out of the centers. Gather scraps, reroll and cut. Place each doughnut with its hole, spacing an inch apart, on a small square of parchment or wax paper. Cover lightly with plastic wrap and let rise until puffed, 45 minutes.
4. Fill a large heavy pot with oil to a depth of 2 inches and heat over medium-high to 360 degrees. Line two wire racks with paper towels. Carefully flip a doughnut and hole off the parchment into the hot oil. Repeat until the pot is almost full and not crowded. Fry, turning once and adjusting the heat to maintain the oil temperature, until golden brown, 2 to 4 minutes for doughnuts and 1 to 2 minutes for holes. Drain on the paper towels. Repeat with the remaining dough, letting the oil come back to temperature between batches. Cool the doughnuts and holes to room temperature.
5. Make the glaze: Whisk the confectioners’ sugar, vanilla and 1/4 cup/60 milliliters almond milk in a medium bowl until smooth. If you prefer a chocolate glaze, stir in the cocoa powder. If you prefer a green, red or black glaze, tint with food coloring. Stir in more almond milk as needed, a tablespoon at a time, for a thinner glaze.
6. Discard the paper towels under the doughnuts and set the racks over rimmed baking sheets. Dip the tops of the doughnuts and holes in the glaze and return to the rack. If making chocolate-glazed doughnuts, sprinkle walnuts on top if you’d like. Let doughnuts stand until glaze sets. Serve on the same day.
— Kwanzaa’s Principles and Traditions
During the height of the Black freedom movement in 1960s Los Angeles, Maulana Karenga designed a Black holiday, Kwanzaa, that was modeled after West African harvest festivals on the African continent and used Swahili words and phrases. (Swahili is a lingua franca and mother tongue primarily spoken along the eastern coast of Africa.)
Every day a candle is lit to celebrate one of the seven principles, or Nguzo Saba, over the course of the cultural holiday, which runs from Dec. 26 to Jan. 1. and hits its crescendo with a feast, or karamu. “Habari gani” or “What is the news?” is a standard Kwanzaa greeting and the answer is the principle of the day.
Nguzo Saba: The Seven Principles
The Nguzo Saba (the seven principles) and their meanings are listed below in their original wording from 1966. Posters of the seven principles are often on display for Kwanzaa, alongside other trimmings. Umoja is celebrated on Dec. 26, Kujichagulia on Dec. 27 and so on until the end of the holiday on Jan. 1.
Umoja (Unity)
To strive for and maintain unity in family, community, nation, and race.
Kujichagulia (Self-Determination)
To define ourselves, name ourselves, create for ourselves and speak for ourselves.
Ujima (Collective Work and Responsibility)
To build and maintain our community together and make our brother’s and sister’s problems our problems and to solve them together.
Ujamaa (Cooperative Economics)
To build and maintain our own stores, shops and other businesses and to profit from them together.
Nia (Purpose)
To make out collective vocation the building and developing of our community in order to restore our people to their traditional greatness.
Kuumba (Creativity)
To do always as much as we can, in the way we can, in order to leave our community more beautiful and beneficial than we inherited it.
Imani (Faith)
To believe with all our heart in our people, our parents, our teachers, our leaders and the righteousness and victory of our struggle.

LONDON — Britain and France inched closer on Tuesday to a deal that would allow freight trucks to resume traveling between the two countries, raising hopes of relief for hundreds of drivers stuck near British ports and for supermarkets warning that they could soon run short of fruit and vegetables.
France closed its border for 48 hours on Sunday night, fearing the spread of a new and possibly more transmissible variant of the coronavirus in Britain. That left more than 1,500 trucks stranded in the southeast as the Port of Dover and the Eurotunnel were shut to outbound traffic. Some drivers slept in their trucks for two nights.
As talks to break the impasse continued, France was expected to reopen its borders, but only to French nationals, residents and workers like truck drivers, and only to those able to supply evidence of a recent negative test, according to France Info, a public radio station. All other travelers coming from Britain would be allowed in under the plan only if they had a permanent residence in France.
An agreement between France and Britain for reopening the border would stave off the fears that had arisen of shortages of lettuce, broccoli and citrus fruit in British shops. Even though trucks from France were still allowed to bring such goods into Britain, few chose to cross the border amid fears that drivers would get marooned there.
The negotiations came as the European Union urged member states to step back from the draconian travel bans imposed in recent days. The bloc’s executive urged countries to continue discouraging nonessential travel to and from Britain, but said that British and other European citizens should be allowed to return to their homes and that goods should be allowed to move back and forth.
Many scientists suspect that the new variant is already in continental Europe. And they stressed that travel bans were useful only if such measures gave countries time to minimize the spread of the virus within their borders and ramp up efforts to detect the new variant.
“Clearly, we need balance,” Emma Hodcroft, a researcher at the University of Bern in Switzerland, wrote on Twitter. “Act too soon with too little info and you generate panic without evidence — damaging economy, livelihoods and trust. But wait too long, and you could miss a vital window when we have the chance to have the most effective response.”
The discovery of the variant had led in recent days to a lockdown across much of southeastern England and bans on flights and trains between Britain and dozens of countries as they tried to stop the variant from spreading. The French government has said it wants to make testing mandatory for travelers coming from Britain.
And because the trucks passing between the two countries are continuously cycling through Europe, it would unblock a continentwide freight system that industry experts said could quickly grind to a halt.
Drivers stuck near British ports were given a single cereal bar by local officials on Monday, said Rod McKenzie, the director of policy at Road Haulage Association, which represents the road transport industry. While drivers pack their own food, he said, they usually do not take much more than they expect to need for their few hours in Britain.
“It’s a story of human misery,” McKenzie said. “The government planning has been shocking on this, and there are no adequate lavatory facilities on the motorway for the past couple of days with up to 1,000 trucks parked up.”
The British government introduced plans devised for similar problems at the border after the country finalizes its split from the European Union on Dec. 31. It shut off parts of a motorway to allow trucks to park on the road and opened an old airport with room for 4,000 trucks to park.
British commentators noted that the usefulness of Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Brexit plans for a once-in-a-century pandemic did not do much to raise people’s confidence about how the country will fare if it crashes out of the European Union without a deal governing future commercial relations across the English Channel at the end of this month.
Scientists also noted that the new variant’s discovery in Britain did not mean an absence from the rest of Europe. Britain does considerably more genomic sequencing than other countries, allowing it to detect mutations more quickly.
“If you were going to pick it up anywhere, you were going to pick it up in the U.K.,” said Thomas Connor, a professor specializing in pathogen variation at Cardiff University in Wales. “The question for other countries around the world is: What capacity do they have to actually start undertaking some surveillance using genomic sequencing to be able to actually get an idea of what’s circulating there?”
In light of the unlikelihood that the variant is confined to Britain, the European Commission, the bloc’s executive, recommended on Tuesday that member states lift blanket bans on travelers from Britain.
It also urged countries not to impose cumbersome and time-consuming requirements for the most thorough coronavirus tests on truck drivers, but rather to rely on more rapid tests while ensuring that any such measures do not disrupt the flow of goods.
“While it is important to take swift temporary precautionary action to limit the further spread of the new strain of the virus and all nonessential travel to and from the U.K. should be discouraged, essential travel and transit of passengers should be facilitated,” the commission said in a statement. “Flight and train bans should be discontinued given the need to ensure essential travel and avoid supply chain disruptions.”
Addressing the issue of European Union citizens stuck in Britain and British people stuck elsewhere on the continent, the commission said they should be exempted from any temporary blockades and allowed to return home.
Those “traveling to their member state or country of residence as well as third-country nationals that enjoy EU free movement rights should be exempted from further temporary restrictions provided that they undergo a test or quarantine,” the recommendation said.

The 2018 collapse of a bridge in northwestern Italy that killed 43 people was a result of problems in the structure’s conception, design, construction and, more recently, maintenance that led to corrosion in some steel cables that ultimately snapped, according to an independent report that was made public Monday.
With a trial expected to start next year, the report will play a crucial role in the prosecutors’ effort to bring a wide array of figures to account for the deadly collapse of the 51-year-old Morandi Bridge, in Genoa, which was once heralded as a symbol of Italian innovation and artistry but is now seen as a warning about the degradation of the country’s aging infrastructure.
“If, in any of these phases, the proper checks were made, it was highly likely that they could have prevented the tragedy,” the report seen by The New York Times read. “The lack and/or the inadequacy of the checks are the weak link in the system.”
The sweeping, 467-page paper, which was commissioned by a judge, was a milestone in the prosecutors’ complex investigation into the cause of the tragedy, which took place on a summer morning when the cables broke, taking down the deck as dozens of vehicles were crossing.
“This is an important piece to seek the truth,” Egle Possetti, spokeswoman for a group of the victims’ families, said in a statement. “It is very sad, but it is finally a clear confirmation that all this could be avoided. Our loved ones were killed. None can go back in time, but we can keep fighting with firmness and determination for the truth to emerge.”
Officials from the bridge operator, Autostrade per l’Italia, and from its engineering branch, as well as a number of high-ranking civil servants with the Italian Infrastructure and Transport Ministry are expected to go on trial in connection with the bridge collapse.
Both the infrastructure ministry and Autostrade declined a request for comment on the report.
Some of the findings from the engineers and physics experts confirmed earlier reports about the bridge collapse, but they also ruled out some of the theories that had been raised by Autostrade as potential causes of the tragedy, like the action of the wind and the fall of a heavy steel coil from a truck that was on the bridge when it collapsed.
The report’s authors established that the trigger for the collapse was the corrosion of the cables on the top of the southern stay of one of the towers, which started shortly after the bridge came into service and “progressed with no rest until the bridge collapsed,” the experts wrote.
The bridge’s operator never carried out the thorough tests on its stays that were suggested by its designer, engineer Riccardo Morandi, in 1985, the report said.
Morandi was aware that some of the steel cables were vulnerable to corrosion and that some mistakes were made during the complicated construction of such a peculiar bridge, according to notes he made at the time, now collected in the State Archive of Rome.
The bridge featured three narrow, A-frame towers, paired with 12 stays — supports that extended from the towers and fastened to the sides of the roadway. In his notes, Morandi was also concerned about the long-term risks associated with the location of the bridge, crossing a valley in Genoa that left it exposed to the salty winds blowing off the sea and to the chemicals coming from a nearby industrial site.
The bridge was lest retrofitted in the early 1990s, when the structure was managed by a state-controlled operator.
The restoration did not include the tower where the corroded cables would touch off the collapse 20 years later, but engineers inspected it and detected problems with the concrete’s water resistance.
The engineers suggested annual maintenance, but, according to the report, the next inspection did not come until 2012, and the investments needed for a proper retrofit were still being discussed the year the bridge collapsed. By that time, the Morandi Bridge, like about half of Italy’s highways, had passed to the management of a private company, Autostrade per l’Italia.
“The operator should have had an adequate knowledge of the work as it was actually built,” the report said.
Experts argue that engineers could have seen and forecast the collapse if the proper investigation had been carried out on the tower and its faulty stays.
Last year, Autostrade overhauled its management and implemented a new inspection system as part of an agreement with the Infrastructure Ministry and with the help of international experts, and it will invest billions in maintaining the country’s highways.

Uncovering Lost Black History, Stone by Stone

HOPEWELL, N.J. — History can seem thick on the ground in this quaint, prosperous town of 2,000 in semirural central New Jersey, not far from where Washington crossed the Delaware. A cemetery on the main street holds a grand obelisk honoring John Hart, a signer of the Declaration of Independence. Next to it stands a monument topped by a stone on which another patriot stood to give a fiery speech supporting the cause of liberty.
But one afternoon in late summer, a group from the Museum of the American Revolution in Philadelphia drove right past those landmarks, and followed a winding road up to a burial ground with a different story to tell.
Stoutsburg Cemetery, tucked in a clearing about halfway up Sourland Mountain, is one of the state’s oldest African American burial grounds. It may also be one its best chronicled, thanks to Elaine Buck and Beverly Mills, two self-described ordinary small-town, middle-aged women turned “history detectives” who have spent more than a dozen years combing through wills, property deeds, tax records and other documents to recover the area’s overlooked Black history.
Buck and Mills have had plenty of aha moments, chronicled in their 2018 book, “If These Stones Could Talk.” Now, the museum’s researchers had brought another revelation: Some Black people in the Sourland community had voted in the decades following the Revolution.
“To think that the people of color who lived here were able to vote here, before they were disenfranchised? In 1801?” Mills said, as the museum’s team brought out a wreath honoring Ephraim Hagerman, a Black man from the community whose name appears on a recently surfaced 1801 poll list.
“It’s mind-boggling,” she said. “It seems like there are just stories within stories in this cemetery.”
Plenty of people research their genealogy, or undertake local history projects. But few create their own museum, as Buck and Mills did when they founded the Stoutsburg Sourland African American Museum, which opened in 2018 in a one-room 19th-century African Methodist church not far from the cemetery.
The museum may seem to tell just one hyperlocal story, but it’s part of a broader effort to paint a fuller, more accurate picture of early America. And notably, at Sourland, the story is being told by descendants themselves.
“They are true historians,” Philip Mead, the chief historian of the Museum of the American Revolution, said of Buck and Mills. “Their research can put a lot of us to shame. But this is not an academic exercise in creativity and curiosity. It’s very emotional and powerful and raw.”
There were places like Sourland all over early America, he said. “But how much of this phenomenon of African American communities finding a place for themselves in these sour lands, these undesirable properties, is lost to historical memory?”
Buck, 67, and Mills, 70, both grew up in the Hopewell Valley, which is predominantly white. Today, they sometimes give presentations in local schools, which under a 2002 law are urged to include Black history in their curriculums.
But when they were students, they recall, they learned almost nothing about slavery in New Jersey, which was the last of the Northern states to abolish it. And little to nothing was said about the Black families whose roots in the area ran as deep as those of the white families whose names were on local landmarks — or how Black people had come to be in the area at all.
“History wasn’t interesting to me, and the reason is they left half the people out,” Buck said. “All you heard about was white people with wigs on.”
Older relatives would sometimes tell stories about life on Sourland Mountain, where many people worked in peach orchards that thrived there in the late 1800s. But even as adults, they said, they didn’t give much thought to the older stones near the center of the Stoutsburg cemetery.
“We just buried people there, and then went about our business,” Mills said.
In 2006, Buck, whose husband is the cemetery’s president, got a call from an older white man in a nearby town. His neighbor was planning to build a driveway across what he believed to be an unmarked African American burial ground, and he wanted help stopping it.
“The more he talked to us, the madder we got,” Buck recalled.
She and Mills found themselves hiring an archaeologist and poring over 19th-century wills — and contacting the local press and the state attorney general. The property owner dropped his plans.
“But it made us think, we better go to our own graveyard and see who we have buried there,” Buck said. “And that snowballed into the book.”
In the 19th century, Sourland Mountain — named, some say, for the poor quality of its soil — had a reputation as a remote, hardscrabble, even dangerous place. And its Black settlements did not go unnoted by white chroniclers, who sometimes peddled exaggerated stories. In 1883, a white doctor and local historian published an oral biography of Sylvia Dubois, a formerly enslaved woman who ran a rough-and-tumble tavern on the mountain (and who was said to have lived to age 115).
A few years earlier, in 1880, a correspondent from The New York Times had come through. He was there to cover a sensational murder trial, but ended up filing a long dispatch under the blaring headline “A REMARKABLE COLONY OF BARBARIANS IN THE MIDST OF CIVILIZATION.”
The article traced the settlement’s origins to William Stives, a “mulatto” Revolutionary War veteran who had married a Native American woman and built a cabin in the “bleak and uninhabited” hills. But it mostly expressed horror at the inhabitants’ “lawless character” and their reputation for rampant “miscegenation,” as evidenced by the appearance of many couples he saw.
“That one really got to me,” Buck, whose husband’s aunt is a descendant of Stives, said of the article. “They’re calling my in-laws barbarians?”
Buck and Mills never located Stives’ grave, as they had hoped. But they did find records of his military pension application and his discharge papers — signed, they were stunned to see, by George Washington.
They also uncovered the story of another pioneer, Friday Truehart, Mills’ fourth-great-grandfather, who arrived from Charleston, South Carolina, in 1780 at age 13 with his enslaver, a minister named Oliver Hart.
A 19th-century newspaper article said Truehart had been born in Africa, and named for Friday in “Robinson Crusoe” by a ship’s captain. But then Mills found the Hart’s transcribed diary, which included an entry noting the purchase of 4-year-old Friday and his mother, Dinah, along with the child’s precise birth date — Friday, May 29, 1767.
Mills calls learning how Truehart (who was freed in 1802) arrived in Hopewell “one of the most exciting discoveries of my life.”
Through their research, the two women have connected with white people whose history is intertwined with the cemetery. Among them is Ted Blew, the fifth-great-grandson of the man who enslaved Tom Blew, whose son Moses is buried at Stoutsburg.
Blew met Buck and Mills in 2018, when they spoke at a Blew family reunion. He had known from wills that his ancestors owned slaves. But until he visited Stoutsburg, he said, that fact was just “words on a page.”
“The cemetery has really opened our eyes to this part of our family history,” he said.
When the Museum of the American Revolution sent Buck and Mills the 1801 poll list with Hagerman’s name, the two women immediately spotted Tom Blew’s name, along with that of another Black man from the community.
And the researchers are still puzzling over how to read a third name. Is it “Isaac Blew”? Or “Jude Blew” — as Tom’s wife, Judith, who is also buried at Stoutsburg, was referred to in other documents?
If so, it would be an anomaly. Under the law at the time, only widows and unmarried women could vote. And in 1801 Tom Blew was still alive.
Mills, a retired state government supervisor who in 2016 became the first Black woman to serve on the borough council in Pennington, a town next to Hopewell, took an optimistic view.
“I’m going to claim her!” she said.
The rollback of voting rights in early New Jersey is an extremely complicated story the museum explores in the current exhibition, “When Women Lost the Vote.” (A digital version has just been released on its website.) Mead said he saw in the 1880 Times article echoes of the same racist fears that led New Jersey — the only state at the time to grant voting rights without respect to both sex and race — to pass a law in 1807 restricting the franchise to white men.
In the first decade of the 19th century, the free Black population of New Jersey, which passed a gradual emancipation law in 1804, was growing. It was not a huge number of people, Mead said, but whites may have feared that New Jersey’s democratic experiment “was getting too democratic.”
In their book, Buck and Mills discuss the tenuousness of life on the mountain. Many of the early Black landowners struggled to hold onto their property. By 1900, a peach blight had sent many who worked in the orchards down to seek work in the valley, or to leave the area entirely.
But the stones in the cemetery, and their stories, are still there.
“I’m just in awe of these people,” Mills said. “This research has completely changed my life. It told me who I am.”

Two weeks ago, the conservative media personalities Diamond and Silk falsely claimed on their Facebook page that people who were not eligible to vote were receiving ballots in Georgia’s special elections next month. Their post was shared more than 300 times.
A week later, the right-wing commentator Mark Levin shared a post on his Facebook page falsely suggesting that the Rev. Raphael Warnock, one of the two Democrats running in the Georgia Senate runoffs, once welcomed Fidel Castro to his church. The misleading claim was shared more than 3,000 times.
At the same time, a drumbeat of misinformation about the presidential election count in Georgia droned on. Lara Trump, President Donald Trump’s daughter-in-law, and the Hodgetwins, a bodybuilding duo who have turned to pro-Trump political comedy, shared several false stories on their Instagram and Facebook pages that claimed suitcases filled with ballots were pulled out from under tables during the November vote count. Tens of thousands of people shared their posts.
As Georgia prepares to hold special elections that will determine which party will control the U.S. Senate, the state has become the focus of a misinformation campaign that is aimed at discrediting the results of the November elections and convincing voters that Democrats are trying to steal the upcoming vote.
A small group of “superspreaders” is responsible for the vast majority of that misinformation, according to new research by Avaaz, a global human rights group. Not only are those accounts responsible for most of the misinformation swirling around the vote, but they are drowning out accurate reporting by mainstream media outlets on Facebook and Instagram.
The research indicates that, despite efforts by social media companies to curtail misinformation, the viral nature of false news continues to take advantage of the algorithms that gin up what people see on those platforms. The algorithms often reward outrage over accuracy, and telling people what they want to hear or what gets them angry can easily overwhelm the truth.
Americans are “being drowned in misinformation in Georgia by these superspreaders,” said Fadi Quran, a director at Avaaz.
The Avaaz study also calls into question Facebook’s recent decision to roll back a change that elevated news from authoritative outlets over hyperpartisan sources. The change, which the company said was intended to be temporary, had resulted in an increase in Facebook traffic for mainstream news publishers including CNN, NPR and The New York Times, while partisan sites like Breitbart and Occupy Democrats saw their numbers fall.
Many of the misinformation spreaders have previously been named by researchers as playing central roles in spreading misinformation about voter fraud in the November presidential election.
“Facebook has gotten a lot of pressure over claims that they are censoring the right or conservatives, but what the data shows is that they may be favoring these actors,” Quran said. “These accounts regularly spread misinformation. The question is: Why doesn’t Facebook demote their reach per their policies?”
Other misinformation spreaders included Eric Trump, the president’s son, and Sebastian Gorka, the president’s former deputy assistant. Trump also continued his barrage of misinformation about Georgia’s elections, according to the research by Avaaz.
The top 20 Facebook and Instagram accounts spreading false claims aimed at swaying voters in Georgia accounted for more interactions than mainstream media outlets. Using CrowdTangle, a Facebook-owned research tool, Avaaz examined social media posts between Nov. 8, when most news outlets called the election for President-elect Joe Biden, and Friday. They found that the top 20 “superspreaders” averaged 5,500 interactions on their Facebook posts, while the 20 largest news outlets averaged 4,100 interactions per post.
These users saw more people interacting with their posts, despite having fewer followers on Facebook than the mainstream news outlets. Combined, the news outlets had more than 208 million followers, while the top “superspreaders" had 85 million followers.
Quran said the numbers showed how Facebook’s algorithms favored the sensational, and often false, posts.
A Facebook spokesman, Kevin McAlister, said the company was still cracking down on misinformation, despite the recent rollback.
“We’re taking every opportunity to connect people to reliable information about the election,” McAlister said. He said the company was also “deploying the teams and technology we used in the general elections to fight voter suppression, misinformation and interference in the Georgia runoff elections.”
None of the top misinformation spreaders responded to requests for comment.
Their claims ran the gamut from insults — that the Democratic Senate candidates, Warnock and Jon Ossoff, are corrupt — to the often-repeated false claim that voting machines that run on software from the company Dominion Voting Systems flipped votes from Trump to Biden.
Quran said the accounts also appeared to be “professionalized” in how they spread misinformation.
“We see them regularly testing new narratives to see where they can hit a certain nerve, and then acting on it,” he said.
Misinformation that successfully targeted Latino voters during the November presidential election, for example, was also being repurposed for Georgia, he said.
One claim, that Warnock, a pastor in an Atlanta church where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. once preached, “celebrated Fidel Castro and welcomed him to his church,” was not accurate. The claim refers to Castro’s appearance at a New York City church where Warnock was a pastor 25 years ago, and there is no evidence that Warnock was involved in arranging the visit, or that he welcomed Castro.
It was a variation of claims that circulated in Florida during the presidential election that linked Democratic candidates to the Communist Party in Cuba. Some of those claims have also been translated into Spanish to target the more than 300,000 voters with Latino backgrounds in Georgia, Quran said.
Voters in Georgia are also being targeted with misleading information by new media startups. A conservative local news network, Star News group, which already runs news sites in Tennessee, Virginia and Minnesota, announced in November that it was opening a venture called the Georgia Star News, according to the liberal media watchdog group Media Matters for America.
Since then, the website has published misleading news about the presidential election and the coming runoff election, according to an assessment by NewsGuard, a startup that examines false stories.
The Georgia Star News said in a response that NewsGuard’s assessment included “subjective, nonspecific generalizations that lack any meaningful context” and that it “rejected their assessment as baseless.”
A Dec. 5 headline promised a “bombshell” story, reprinting an allegation that an audit of election results in a Georgia county revealed that Dominion voting machines flipped ballots from Trump to Biden, in spite of overwhelming evidence to the contrary.
The article was shared more than 2,000 times on Facebook, according to CrowdTangle data, reaching up to 650,000 people.

KHAO PHRA THAEO WILDLIFE SANCTUARY, Thailand — The white-handed gibbon, captured as an infant by poachers, was rescued from a grim life amusing inebriated visitors in tourist bars, then spent eight years in a cage at a rehabilitation center.
Now, this survivor of abuse and trauma lives in the jungle on Thailand’s Phuket island, where she was recently seen perched on a tree branch 50 feet above ground as her wild-born mate and their two offspring watched warily from nearby trees.
Hers is a rare success story.
Named Cop, after a police officer who aided in her rescue, she is part of a small colony of gibbons rescued, rehabilitated and released into Phuket’s largest remaining forest by the Gibbon Rehabilitation Project, a nonprofit group that rescues gibbons in Thailand.
“We now have 35 in the forest at Phuket, including those born in the wild,” said Thanaphat Payakkaporn, general secretary of the Wild Animal Rescue Foundation of Thailand, which runs the gibbon project. “Some have grandchildren now.”
But rehabilitating a rescued gibbon and training it to survive in the wild can take years, and the effort is not always successful.
Gibbons, the smallest of the apes, were once widespread across much of Asia. Rampant deforestation and ruthless hunting of the acrobatic animal has greatly reduced its numbers. In the 1990s and early 2000s, when displaying wild animals in bars was part of Thailand’s often seedy nightlife scene, young gibbons were sometimes taught to smoke, drink alcohol and eat human food.
A public outcry eventually led to new laws. Some illegal vendors switched to offering gibbons for photos at beaches or on the street. The plunge in tourism caused by the coronavirus pandemic has led other illegal owners to abandon their animals in recent months.
Since the beginning of the pandemic, Thanaphat said, he has rescued three young gibbons abandoned near forested areas north of Phuket.
At least a dozen gibbon rehabilitation centers in countries across Southeast Asia now undertake the slow process of socializing and freeing gibbons recovered from the illegal wildlife trade. Over the years, they have released about 150 gibbons into the wild, officials and the centers say.
“We would rather see an animal live four years in the jungle than 40 years in a cage,” said Edwin Wiek, founder of the Wildlife Friends Foundation Thailand, which runs the country’s largest nonprofit wildlife rescue center, with 800 animals of 70 species.
Wiek’s wildlife center in Phetchaburi province has released nearly a dozen gibbons in northern Thailand and is seeking government approval to release 50 more in an area near the sanctuary. It has also built 14 islands in a lake where more than 20 gibbons live in natural settings without fences. Since gibbons hate to swim, they stay on their islands.
The gibbon is the only ape native to Asia besides the orangutan, and there are more than a dozen species, including the siamang, the largest. Its range extends from northeastern India to southern China and across much of Southeast Asia.
It is called the lesser ape to distinguish it from great apes like gorillas and chimpanzees, but the gibbon is remarkable in its agility.
Living high in the rainforest canopy, it can swing through the trees at speeds up to 35 mph and sail across gaps as wide as 50 feet. Its powerful arms are longer than its legs and its opposable big toes help it grip branches.
Its distinctive whooping call, one of the loudest vocalizations of any land mammal, can be heard for miles. Unfortunately for gibbons, their extraordinary songs can lead poachers right to them. To capture a young gibbon, poachers will sometimes slaughter an entire family, starting by shooting the adult male and ending by killing the female as she holds her baby, Thanaphat said.
Thanaphat, 40, grew up around animals because his mother, who played a leading role in the Wild Animal Rescue Foundation, kept a menagerie at their home in Bangkok. He recalls as a child taking a blind tiger for walks and playing with two bear cubs.
He said it took many years of trial and error before the gibbon project successfully released any in the Phuket jungle, where none had lived for decades, if ever. It has also released 21 gibbons in a northern Thailand forest.
Gibbons can live up to 35 years in the wild and up to 60 in captivity. The greatest success in releasing them has come by helping them form pairs and freeing them together.
“We started the project in 1992, and it took us 10 years to successfully rehabilitate and release the first family,” said Thanaphat. “We didn’t know how to do it.”
But space is tight at the gibbon center and in the Phuket jungle itself. The center, an aging, cramped facility in the government-protected Khao Pra Theaw forest, has cages for about three dozen gibbons. The Phuket jungle is not large enough to sustain more than 40, the number it will reach in February with the planned release of five more from the center.
A wild gibbon population needs about 200 animals, experts say, if it is to survive in the long term. Some predict the Phuket colony will eventually become so inbred that it will not be viable.
“There are complaints from academics who say this is not a proper place, that we need room to release more than 200,” Thanaphat acknowledged. “But they are not here to see what we are doing.”
Returning animals to the wild has a romantic appeal and greatly improves the lives of individual animals that are freed. But others argue that, in many cases, protecting endangered species’ habitat is much more cost-effective.
“Money could be much better spent protecting the wilderness rather than on rehabilitation,” said Tim Redford, the ranger training coordinator at the Freeland Foundation, a nongovernmental group that supports rangers in their fight against poaching.
Thanaphat defended his organization by pointing out that some gibbons live permanently at the center, including two that are blind and one with limbs that never correctly developed because it was kept in a small cage as a youngster.
And, not all freed gibbons appreciate being in the wild.
There are former captives that never get used to being away from humans. One male, Arun, was released 15 years ago and still prefers eating the fruit he was served by humans at the rehabilitation center.
On one recent day, he left his wild-born mate and baby in the jungle and came into the center. As usual, he went to the cage of Santi, a blind gibbon, and stole Santi’s food.
Another gibbon, Bo, has been released half a dozen times. But each time, he has returned to the center and the comfort of his cage.
“We just open the door,” Thanaphat said, “and he goes back in.”

France Eases Restrictions on U.K. for Some Travelers as Hopes Rise for Stranded Truckers

LONDON — Britain and France reopened their border to some travelers Tuesday and inched closer to a deal that would allow freight trucks to resume moving between the two countries, raising hopes of relief for hundreds of drivers stuck near British ports and for supermarkets warning that they could soon run short of fruit and vegetables.
On Sunday, France closed its border for 48 hours, fearing the spread of a new and possibly more transmissible variant of the coronavirus in Britain. That left more than 1,500 trucks stranded in the southeast as the Port of Dover and the Eurotunnel were shut to outbound traffic. Some drivers slept in their trucks for two nights.
As talks to break the impasse continued, France announced Tuesday night that select groups of people would be allowed to travel from Britain to France if they could produce proof of a recent negative coronavirus test.
Those now allowed to travel include French and European Union citizens, noncitizens with a permanent residence in France, and other people whose travel is deemed essential, They include diplomats, health workers helping in France’s fight against COVID-19, and the drivers and crew of passenger planes, trains and buses.
The limited reopening was set to take effect at midnight.
But British and French officials were still working to resolve a freight ban that has tangled the supply chain across Europe and raised fears of shortages of lettuce, broccoli and citrus fruit in British shops.
Even though trucks from France are allowed to bring such goods into Britain, few drivers have chosen to do so amid fears that they would get marooned on the other side of the border.
French officials said they would outline a plan for resuming freight traffic later Tuesday night.
The negotiations came as the European Union urged member states to step back from the draconian travel bans imposed in recent days. The bloc’s executive urged countries to continue discouraging nonessential travel to and from Britain but said that British and other European citizens should be allowed to return to their homes and that goods should be allowed to move back-and-forth.
Many scientists suspect that the new variant is already in continental Europe. And they stressed that travel bans were useful only if such measures gave countries time to minimize the spread of the virus within their borders and ramp up efforts to detect the new variant.
“Clearly, we need balance,” Emma Hodcroft, a researcher at the University of Bern in Switzerland, wrote on Twitter. “Act too soon with too little info and you generate panic without evidence — damaging economy, livelihoods and trust. But wait too long, and you could miss a vital window when we have the chance to have the most effective response.”
The discovery of the variant had led in recent days to a lockdown across much of southeastern England and bans on flights and trains between Britain and dozens of countries as they tried to stop the variant from spreading.
Because the trucks passing between France and Britain are continually cycling through Europe, the blockade has disrupted a continentwide freight system that industry experts said could quickly grind to a halt in the absence of a deal.
Drivers stuck near British ports were given a single cereal bar by local officials Monday, said Rod McKenzie, director of policy at Road Haulage Association, which represents the road transport industry. While drivers pack their own food, he said, they usually do not take much more than they expect to need for their few hours in Britain.
“It’s a story of human misery,” McKenzie said. “The government planning has been shocking on this, and there are no adequate lavatory facilities on the motorway for the past couple of days with up to 1,000 trucks parked up.”
The British government introduced plans devised for similar problems at the border after the country finalizes its split from the European Union on Dec. 31. It shut off parts of a motorway to allow trucks to park on the road and opened an old airport with room for 4,000 trucks to park.
British commentators noted that the usefulness of Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Brexit plans for a once-in-a-century pandemic did not do much to raise people’s confidence about how the country will fare if it crashes out of the European Union without a deal governing future commercial relations across the English Channel at the end of this month.
Scientists also noted that the new variant’s discovery in Britain did not mean an absence from the rest of Europe. Britain does considerably more genomic sequencing than other countries, allowing it to detect mutations more quickly.
“If you were going to pick it up anywhere, you were going to pick it up in the U.K.,” said Thomas Connor, a professor specializing in pathogen variation at Cardiff University in Wales. “The question for other countries around the world is: What capacity do they have to actually start undertaking some surveillance using genomic sequencing to be able to actually get an idea of what’s circulating there?”
In light of the unlikelihood that the variant is confined to Britain, the European Commission, the bloc’s executive arm, recommended Tuesday that member states lift blanket bans on travelers from Britain.
It also urged countries not to impose cumbersome and time-consuming requirements for the most thorough coronavirus tests on truck drivers but rather to rely on more rapid tests while ensuring that any such measures do not disrupt the flow of goods.
“While it is important to take swift temporary precautionary action to limit the further spread of the new strain of the virus, and all nonessential travel to and from the U.K. should be discouraged, essential travel and transit of passengers should be facilitated,” the commission said in a statement. “Flight and train bans should be discontinued given the need to ensure essential travel and avoid supply chain disruptions.”
Addressing the issue of EU citizens stuck in Britain and British people stuck elsewhere on the continent, the commission said they should be exempted from any temporary blockades and allowed to return home.
Those “traveling to their member state or country of residence as well as third-country nationals that enjoy EU free movement rights should be exempted from further temporary restrictions provided that they undergo a test or quarantine,” the recommendation said.

The family of an 18-year-old college student who broke the Cayman Islands’ coronavirus laws on a trip last month has pleaded for her release from prison ahead of a hearing Tuesday before a panel of judges who will decide whether her appeal can proceed.
“She cries; she wants to come home,” the student’s grandmother, Jeanne Mack, said on NBC’s “Today” show Monday. “She knows she made a mistake. She owns up to that, but she’s pretty hysterical right now.”
Skylar Mack and her boyfriend, Vanjae Ramgeet, 24, were sentenced to four months in prison after violating the Cayman Islands' required 14-day quarantine period for visitors.
In late November, with her semester at Mercer University in Georgia complete, Mack flew to the Cayman Islands to watch her boyfriend compete in the islands’ Jet Ski racing national championship.
When she arrived, however, there was a problem.
She got there on a Friday; the championship was Sunday. And per the country’s laws, she was required to remain in her hotel room for 14 days before going anywhere else on the islands.
To elude the restrictions, Mack, after receiving a negative coronavirus test, slipped an electronic monitoring bracelet from her wrist and escaped to a beach on Grand Cayman’s South Sound, where she saw Ramgeet win first place.
But the event organizers were notified that Mack may have been in breach of the rules, and the police were called, her lawyer said. Mack was charged with leaving her home during the quarantine period, and Ramgeet was charged with aiding and abetting her. They were sentenced to four months in prison for the quarantine breach.
“This was as flagrant a breach as could be imagined,” Justice Roger Chapple said in court during the sentencing, according to the Cayman Compass, a news website in the Cayman Islands. “It was borne of selfishness and arrogance.”
The islands, a British territory of nearly 65,000 residents, have reported 316 infections and two deaths as of Monday, with no reported cases of local transmission since July. Only people who have been preauthorized to enter the Cayman Islands can travel there, and they must quarantine for 14 days in a government facility, a private facility or at home, if approved.
Upon arrival to the island, visitors receive an electronic smart wristband and are equipped with a cellphone with an app, called Stay Safe Cayman. Using the app, they must log where they are quarantining. Visitors cannot end quarantines until they can show negative results from tests taken on their 15th day on the island, government officials said.
Mack’s relatives in suburban Atlanta scrambled to pull together letters from friends and family attesting to her character in an effort to get the sentence overturned on appeal, said Jeanne Mack, 68.
Jeanne Mack also wrote to President Donald Trump for help. She received a response from the Office of Presidential Correspondence last week stating that her correspondence had been forwarded “to the appropriate federal agency for further action.”
Chapple said last week in court that “the gravity of the breach was such that the only appropriate sentence would have been one of immediate imprisonment,” according to the Cayman Compass.
The family and Skylar, a junior pre-med student and the daughter of Dennis Mack, a professional Jet Ski racer, make no illusions about what happened, her grandmother said: What she did was wrong.
“I’ll do everything to get you home, and when I get you here, I’m going to kick your butt,” Jeanne Mack said. “We’re not saying, ‘poor, innocent Skylar.’ We’re simply saying the punishment does not meet the crime.”
Skylar Mack and Ramgeet pleaded guilty to breaking the quarantine rules and were initially sentenced to 40 hours of community service and a fine of 2,600 Cayman Islands dollars (about $3,100). But the punishment was increased last week after the prosecutor appealed, saying the initial sentences were “unduly lenient and wrong in principle.”
Jeanne Mack said that if the panel of judges Tuesday decides that her appeal can proceed, then the family hopes that she will be released on bond pending the appeal.

LONDON — As nation after nation rushed this week to close their borders with Britain, the moves brought back memories of the way the world reacted after the coronavirus first emerged broadly in the spring. Most of those initial travel prohibitions came too late, put in place after the virus had already seeded itself in communities far and wide.
This time, with countries trying to stop the spread of a new possibly more contagious, coronavirus variant identified by Britain, it may also be too late. It is not known how widely the variant is already circulating, experts say, and the bans threaten to cause more economic and emotional hardship as the toll wrought by the virus continues to grow.
“It is idiotic” was the blunt assessment of Dr. Peter Kremsner, the director of Tübingen University Hospital in Germany. “If this mutant was only on the island, only then does it make sense to close the borders to England, Scotland and Wales. But if it has spread, then we have to combat the new mutant everywhere.”
He noted that the scientific understanding of the mutation was limited, and its dangers unclear, and described as naive the notion that the variant was not already spreading widely outside Britain.
Also, Britain has some of the most sophisticated genomic surveillance efforts in the world, which allowed scientists there to discover the variant when it might have gone unnoticed elsewhere, experts said.
Dr. Hans Kluge, the World Health Organization’s regional director for Europe, said that member states would try to come up with a coherent approach to any threat posed by the variant. At the moment, he wrote on Twitter, “limiting travel to contain spread is prudent until we have better info.”
But he noted, “no one is safe until everyone is safe.”
With growing calls for the United States to join the dozens of nations imposing bans on travel from Britain, Dr. Anthony Fauci, America’s top infectious disease expert, urged caution, saying there was a good chance the variant was already there.
“I don’t think that that kind of a draconian approach is necessary,” he said on “PBS NewsHour” on Monday night. “I think we should seriously consider the possibility of requiring testing of people before they come from the U.K. here.”
Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York said that British Airways, Delta Air Lines and Virgin Atlantic had agreed to require a negative coronavirus test result from passengers boarding flights from Britain to New York. In the absence of federal action, other state and local leaders called for similar measures before the peak holiday travel days.
Many countries already require a negative coronavirus test for entry, but cutting off all travel between nations is a more fraught proposition.
The European Commission, the European Union’s executive branch, urged members of the bloc to lift blanket bans on travel from Britain, but for the moment, nations seemed to prefer setting their own rules.
The situation is convulsing a travel industry already battered by the pandemic, forcing millions to change their holiday plans and injecting a fresh dose of anxiety at the end of a bleak year.
At the same time, a separate variant of the virus is causing concern as it spreads in South Africa. At least five nations — Germany, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Switzerland and Turkey — have barred travelers coming from South Africa.
Sweden blocked travel from Denmark after reports that the British variant had been detected there. And Saudi Arabia went even further, suspending all international air travel into the kingdom for at least a week.
The South Africa variant became the subject of intense scientific research after doctors there found that people infected with it carry a heightened viral load — a higher concentration of the virus in their upper respiratory tract. In many viral diseases, this is associated with more severe symptoms.
Because it is not known how widely the two variants are spreading, it is impossible to assess what effects the attempts to isolate Britain and South Africa will have on containing them.
With its sophisticated genomic surveillance efforts, Britain has sequenced about 150,000 coronavirus genomes in an effort to identify mutations. That’s about half of the world’s genomic data about the virus, said Sharon Peacock, the director of the COVID-19 Genomics U.K. Consortium and a professor of microbiology at the University of Cambridge.
“If you’re going to find something anywhere, you’re going to find it probably here first,” Peacock said. “If this occurs in places that don’t have any sequencing, you’re not going to find it at all,” she added, unless they carried out other tests that have proved useful in identifying the variant.
In Wales, a country of 3 million people, geneticists have sequenced more coronavirus genomes in the last week than scientists have examined during the entire pandemic in France, a country of 67 million, said Thomas Connor, a professor who specializes in pathogen variation at Cardiff University.
“It is probable that similar variants are popping up around the world,” he said. “And there are variants that are likely to be popping up in other places which are spreading locally and which would be completely unregarded because there’s no sequencing in place.”
British officials have said that the first case of the variant now spreading widely in the country was detected in Kent, in southeastern England, on Sept. 20. By November, around a quarter of cases in London — an international hub of commerce — involved the new variant. Just a few weeks later, the variant was estimated to be responsible for nearly two-thirds of cases in Greater London.
That means that by the time Prime Minister Boris Johnson addressed the nation Saturday night to announce severe new lockdown measures for millions of people in and around London, the variant had been spreading for months.
Officials in France and Germany acknowledged Tuesday that the variant might already be circulating in their countries. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said a few cases with the new variant had been detected in Denmark, Iceland and the Netherlands. And health officials in Australia and Italy have reported cases in travelers from Britain.
Those who support the travel bans said they could play a role in keeping cases of new variants lower.
“Numbers matter,” Emma Hodcroft, a researcher at the University of Bern in Switzerland, wrote on Twitter. “The number of people with the new variant in continental Europe is likely still small: with testing, tracing, identification and restrictions, we might be able to prevent them from passing the virus on.”
If the variant does prove to be significantly more contagious than others in circulation and becomes more widespread, it could complicate global vaccination efforts.
Dr. Ugur Sahin, a co-founder of BioNTech, which, with Pfizer, developed the first vaccine approved in the West to combat the coronavirus, cautioned that it would be two weeks before full results from laboratory studies would allow for a fuller understanding of how the mutations might alter the vaccine’s effectiveness.
“We believe that there is no reason to be concerned until we get the data,” he said.
If an adapted vaccine were necessary, it could be ready within six weeks, Sahin told a news conference Tuesday. But it would require additional approval from regulators, which could increase the wait time, he said.
He also said that a more efficient virus would make it harder to achieve levels of immunity needed to end the pandemic.
“If the virus becomes more efficient in infecting people,” he said, “it might need even a higher vaccination rate to ensure that normal life can continue without interruption.”

SRINAGAR, Kashmir — Votes were counted Tuesday in the first local elections in Kashmir since the Indian government waged a harsh political and security crackdown in the restive region last year. Officials hailed a solid turnout as a sign that democracy has been restored, but little in Kashmir feels normal.
“The voting shows democracy being alive at the grass roots,” the region’s top civil servant, B.V.R. Subrahmanyam, told a group of reporters. “People taking value of their own lives is visible, palpable.”
The election — a vote to choose rural development officials — was called suddenly, giving parties only a week to register candidates before the first round of the eight-phase polling began in November, political leaders said. Many prominent Kashmiri politicians and public figures remain in detention with no recourse, or under threat. And hundreds of thousands of political workers for India’s Hindu-nationalist ruling party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, traveled through the region carrying banners and signs, hoping to make a strong showing in a mostly Muslim territory where it has traditionally been loathed.
The party, known as the BJP, did appear to make some inroads, winning at least three seats and leading in several dozen races in the 280-seat District Development Council. But some of the voter engagement appeared to stem more from defiance than satisfaction.
“We’d never want BJP to be in power in Kashmir,” said Kulsoom Chopan, 21, who warmed her hands over a wicker fire pot while waiting to vote at a public boys’ high school in Bandipora, a northern district hemmed in by the Himalayas and Asia’s second-largest freshwater lake. “We would never vote for India.”
The New York Times was part of a small group of international media outlets permitted to visit Kashmir on a tightly controlled, government-organized trip to cover the polls.
This relatively small-stakes election was the first time that India has allowed foreign reporters into Jammu and Kashmir since August 2019, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government revoked the constitutional provision that gave the region some political autonomy. Jammu and Kashmir, which used to be India’s only Muslim-predominant state, is now a federal territory ruled directly by the Indian government.
Modi said at the time that Kashmir’s special status had helped fuel a 30-year-old armed separatist struggle that resulted in tens of thousands of deaths of security forces, rebels and civilians, and was an impediment to outside investors.
However, just as the security clampdown eased, the pandemic hit. Kashmir’s tourism-reliant economy and civil society are now on the verge of collapse: In a year and a half, there’s been no new private investment in Kashmir, and police officials say that recruitment by militant groups is on the rise.
Activists say hundreds of people, including separatists, political moderates, civil society advocates and journalists remain in jail after they were swept up last year. Accusations of torture by security forces were widespread.
In this climate of fear and uncertainty, the BJP has made a big push into the Kashmir Valley, the center of the separatist struggle, unleashing 300,000 party workers and bringing Muslim politicians in Kashmir into its fold for the first time.
“We’re only in the takeoff stage,” said Ghulam Mohammad Mir, BJP’s Kashmir spokesman and a candidate for the development council elections in the valley’s Kupwara district.
“We have thousands in election areas in every nook and corner of the valley, open, with flags,” he said.
Seven BJP party workers have been killed in 2020, and a candidate affiliated with the party was shot and injured in November by militants, according to the Jammu and Kashmir police.
In the days before the Indian government unilaterally stripped Kashmir’s autonomy, Modi sent in thousands of army troops to quell anticipated unrest.
Prominent Kashmiri politicians, including former chief ministers of Kashmir, some of their relatives and other opposition party leaders, were arrested and detained in government houses for months. Cellphone and internet access were blocked.
A dozen petitions challenging the constitutionality of the move remain pending with India’s Supreme Court.
Among those detained were Mehbooba Mufti, the head of a powerful regional party, and Farooq and Omar Abdullah, the father and son who led another influential bloc. They have since been released, but when contacted by The Times, they said they were unable to grant interviews. On Saturday, it was announced that the Indian government was investigating Farooq Abdullah on money-laundering charges.
Despite the pressure, Waheed ur Rehman Para, a youth leader of Mufti’s party, trounced his BJP competitor in the restive southern district of Pulwama from a jail cell in Jammu, where he is being held under accusation of being linked to militants. He and his family deny the accusation.
Mohamed Bhat ran as an independent candidate in Bandipora as part of the Gukpar Alliance, a coalition of opposition parties led by Farooq Abdullah promising to restore Kashmir’s autonomy.
“There was democracy in Kashmir previously, but with abrogation it was trampled upon,” Bhat said, speaking of the constitutional provision that was scrapped. “We have united to bring back the special status."
Hasnain Masoodi, a member of Indian Parliament from Abdullah’s party, complained about the haste with which the central government unilaterally decided to hold the development council elections.
“We were not given a level playing field,” he said. “There was no campaign at all. Most of the time we were either denied permission or senior leaders were confined.”
Masoodi, who earlier served as chief justice of Jammu and Kashmir before joining Abdullah’s party, said the coalition partners weren’t able to vet candidates but fielded them anyway to avoid leaving the field open for the BJP.
“They made it into a referendum” on the change to Kashmir’s political status, he said of the BJP.
Dilbag Singh, the top Indian police officer in the region, denied that opposition parties were refused permission for campaign events. He also denied accusations that police had tortured people.
Singh said that of the hundreds of people detained in August 2019, only 155 remained in custody in Kashmir and other jails around India.
“Today we have shown restraint. Not a single bullet has been fired, no civilian has been killed,” Singh said. “That’s a fact — let them prove it otherwise.”

Thomas Panek dreamed for years of running the way he did before he lost his sight, without fear and without a human or a dog tethered to his wrist as a guide.
That dream took Panek, 50, to the north end of Manhattan's Central Park one frigid morning last month, to test drive something that might one day liberate thousands of other people with severely impaired vision. As a camera crew and a team of technologists made some final adjustments, he stood on the downslope of West Drive. He straddled a painted yellow line and waited for the signal to go.
A little more than a year had passed since Panek delivered a challenge to a group of engineers at Google’s Manhattan offices during a company hackathon. Could they develop a way for him to run by himself, with a clear sense of where he was going and without having to worry about hazards along the way? There had been other attempts to find technological solutions to this problem, but none of them completely untethered runners from their guides.
Panek has retinitis pigmentosa, a genetic condition that causes the loss of photoreceptor cells. As a child, he lost the ability to see stars in the night sky. He was legally blind by young adulthood.
To run blind, Panek said, is to always fear that you are about to slam your face into a tree.
Panek, who lives in Westchester County, just north of New York City, loves to run with his guide dog, Blaze. But Blaze can’t run faster than about a nine-minute mile.
“I’m a little faster than that,” said Panek, who completed the 2015 Boston Marathon in 3 hours 42 minutes, with Scott Jurek, an ultramarathoner, guiding him. That translates to about an 8 1/2-minute mile for the marathon, though Panek can go faster at shorter distances.
By the end of that one-day hackathon last year, the engineers had sketched a basic idea of a solution. They placed a line of masking tape on the floor and had Panek and his dog follow the line. Then the mission became devising an app that worked the same way as the dog and, in the process, perhaps solving a problem for Panek and a lot of other people.
“If you start with one person and their challenges, you can bring a great benefit for him and also people like him,” said Ryan Burke, a leader at the Google Creative Lab.
It’s hard to say how many blind runners there are, or, more important, how many there could be if running became something that blind people could do on their own.
The National Federation of the Blind estimates that 7.6 million people in the United States have a visual impairment that requires them to use alternate means to engage in an activity that people with vision can do without assistance. The U.S. Association of Blind Athletes, which holds camps and regional competitions for people who are blind or visually impaired, has more than 700 members who could benefit from the technology Panek requested.
Panek is chief executive of Guiding Eyes for the Blind, which provides guide dogs to people with severe vision loss. Three years ago, the organization began a program to train dogs as running guides and since then has provided dogs to 75 runners.
In a typical year, more than 50 blind runners complete the California International Marathon with guides; 53 runners who identified themselves as having a vision impairment finished the New York City Marathon in 2019. Many others ran shorter races.
Dror Ayalon, a creative technologist on the project inspired by Panek’s challenge, said a plan became clear fairly quickly.
A crew would paint a yellow line for Panek to follow throughout a race. He would strap a phone with a camera and the newly devised app to his midsection, and the camera would track the yellow line on the ground. The app would take information from the camera and convey vibrating signals through a headset.
As Panek ran, the signals would tell him how to adjust his steps to stay on the line. Signals in the right ear meant he was wandering too far to his right and vice versa. Another signal would help him navigate a turn when the camera spotted the line curving.
Software programs used for video game design helped the app learn to interpret the images from the camera. The work became more complicated when engineers began to consider all the things that might interfere with tracking a line on pavement that a runner would be trying to follow while carrying a phone.
The camera was going to shake constantly. The sunlight would change, making a yellow line look different at noon from the way it did at dawn.
And what would happen when leaves blew onto the line, covering a part of it? Would the app interpret that break in the line as a parked car, and signal the runner to stop?
“We take examples and feed them into the model, classifying the pixels as one class and everything else as not in the class,” Ayalon said, referring to obstacles that might block the view of the line. “The model learns over time.”
So does the runner. Panek tested the technology for months over short distances, slowly gaining confidence, learning to trust the directional messages in his ears. Then, in November, it was time for a 5-kilometer run.
“Liberation is a huge motivation,” he said, “the idea of being self-reliant.”
Working with New York Road Runners, the organizer of the New York City Marathon, technologists received permission to paint their yellow line around the north loop of Central Park, a 1.42-mile circle that includes the climb known as Harlem Hill.
Despite the cold, Panek wore short sleeves. He has the wiry build of a veteran runner. The only hint of his sight loss is that his eyes sometimes appear to focus in different directions. But he adeptly compensates, following a voice and picking up on people’s unique sounds, looking toward them as he talks.
As noon approached, he was ready to run.
“Let’s go,” he said when it was time.
A starter told him to go, and he was off. He sprinted downhill toward his first turn as if he knew where he was headed. And then, about a minute in, the voice in Panek’s headset — as well as everyone around him — told him to stop. A car from the Parks and Recreation Department was parked on the line.
As a park ranger helped track down the driver to move the car, Panek headed back to the start line. Time to try this again.
And off he went. Except for a few stutter steps as he rounded the first corners, he pounded the line with confidence, rarely drifting more than a few inches from it on either side. For the first time in decades, Panek was running the way he did as a child.
He crossed the finish line. An official from the running organization draped a medal around his neck.
“Perfect,” Panek said of the run. “It was just perfect.”
It’s unclear where the technology goes from here. Engineers still have some kinks to work out. It would help if the app could navigate around a parked car. But once it can, park officials anywhere might be persuaded to paint yellow lines marking loops for blind runners on routes that are free of cars, allowing them to run freely and safely.
Perhaps one day, after the app can learn how to follow a yellow line that is partly covered by discarded paper cups, blind runners may be able to run an official 5K or even a marathon.
“There’s that blue line on the New York City Marathon route,” Panek said, referring to the race’s signature marking of the 26.2-mile route. “Maybe one day we’ll be able to get our own yellow line, too.”

Texto completo: On Christmas Day 1991, Mikhail Gorbachev, president of the Soviet Union, gave his farewell speech and more than seven decades of Russian revolutionary socialism came to an end. A generation later, the spirit of the Soviet Union has re-emerged with mass support in the U.S.
When I arrived in Moscow in 1976 to begin a six-year stint as a correspondent, I was struck by the red flags flying from government buildings and the somber streets devoid of advertising except for garish posters showing workers with clenched fists demanding an end to the arms race.
When the Soviet Union fell, it seemed the Soviet attempt to impose a deluded version of reality had died with it. Francis Fukuyama, in his 1989 essay "The End of History," said that Marxism-Leninism was doomed as an alternative to liberal democracy. I argued at the time that the drive to make a religion out of politics had not disappeared.
For the past four years, potted histories have warned about the rise of fascism in the U.S. But the real danger is the transformation of "tolerance" into an ideology with its own courts, informers and punishments, all of them reminiscent of the Soviet Union.
One of the pillars of the Soviet Union was a controlled press in which all coverage was organized to confirm a mendacious ideology.
A friend of mine in Moscow, Vladimir Fyodorov, went to work for the TASS news service, which offered readers not news but a "correct" depiction of events, especially regarding the U.S. and the "ulcers of capitalism"—racism, crime and unemployment.
On his first day at TASS, Vladimir was handed a United Press International story about a U.S. company that was promoting a high-quality tire and offered to replace older tires free of charge. Vladimir wanted to kill the story but his boss rewrote it. The new version read: "In the crafty capitalist market, firms frequently offer low-quality products. This is why a well-known American firm was forced to replace tires that were of inferior quality." The headline was "Deception of Buyer."
A few weeks later, Vladimir was given a report that prisons in Fiji were so comfortable that people preferred to stay there than to be at liberty. He produced a report that life in Fiji was so unbearable that people preferred to live in prison. His colleagues congratulated him. He told himself: "I'm going to go out of my mind here."
Soviet practices would have once been unthinkable in the U.S. media. But in August 2016, Jim Rutenberg, media columnist for the New York Times, wrote that if journalists believed that Mr. Trump was a "demagogue playing to the nation's worst racist and nationalist tendencies," it was necessary to "throw out the textbook of American journalism." The Times started to characterize Mr. Trump's statements as "lies" in news stories and suppress news that worked to Mr. Trump's advantage, such as the Hunter Biden story this fall.
The Times also advanced an ideological account of U.S. history, according to which the American Revolution was undertaken to defend slavery, and promoted it over the objections of historians and the paper's own fact-checkers.
The Soviet system also relied on the complete liquidation of academic freedom. Marxism-Leninism was treated as a perfect science. But the ideology raised obvious questions: In a "classless society," why were there special stores for officials? If socialism ended war, why did the Soviet Union and China go to war in 1969 over Damansky Island?
If a student tried to raise these questions, he was expelled from the Komsomol, the communist youth league. That ended any hope of a career. I knew a young man in Moscow who refused to be intimidated and continued to ask questions. He was committed to a mental hospital.
The Soviet style has become a reality in the U.S. Speakers are routinely canceled on ideological grounds: In July the College of the Atlantic in Bar Harbour, Maine, canceled a virtual talk with Leonard Leo of the Federalist Society because of "the moment of reckoning our society is going through." At my alma mater, the University of Chicago, the English department announced that it would "only accept applicants interested in working in and with Black Studies."
The Soviet Union finally counted on the readiness of people to betray even family and friends. The regime held up Pavel Morozov (1918-32) as a martyr. He lived in a village in the Urals when the regime was collectivizing agriculture. When Pavel learned that his father was helping peasants hide grain, he walked 35 miles to the nearest town to report him to the secret police. His father was arrested and Pavel was stabbed to death by relatives.
I thought of Pavel Morozov when I read a June op-ed in the New York Times by Chad Sanders, a black writer. He told his white friends that he didn't need their "love texts" and suggested that instead they cut off contact with family members until they sent money to Black Lives Matter or joined their protests.
When Mr. Gorbachev began the reforms that destroyed the Soviet Union, he said, referring to the U.S.: "We're going to do something terrible to you. We're going to deprive you of an enemy." Twenty-nine years later, it's clear he was right. Without the ideological challenge of the Soviet Union, we have become immersed in internal conflicts and have made an ideology out of them.
It is true that Marxism is a more coherent system of thought than "wokeism." But even an intellectual hodgepodge can engender totalitarian habits if it fulfills an emotional need and becomes a device of interpretation.
The antidote is fidelity to higher values. But that requires a moral seriousness that a world at peace and in thrall to superficialities does not inspire. "The West does not know and does not want to know what shaped it," writes Cardinal Robert Sarah, a Guinean prelate. "This self-asphyxiation leads to new barbaric civilizations."
The Soviet Union is dead, but its ghost wanders an unsettled world. Finding a lodestar for society's moral development is the most important challenge facing the U.S. today.
Mr. Satter is author of "Age of Delirium: the Decline and Fall of the Soviet Union" and a member of the academic advisory board of the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation.

As Britain found itself even more isolated on Tuesday because of a new variant of the coronavirus spreading there, the European Commission advised European Union members to lift blanket bans and ensure essential travel, recommending testing or quarantines instead. And one vaccine expert said that there was no evidence at the moment to suggest that the current product would have to be adapted.
The commission, the bloc’s executive arm, said on Tuesday that member states should move swiftly to reverse travel bans imposed over the past few days in an effort to stop the spread of the new variant of the coronavirus that has emerged in Britain. It recommended testing or quarantining as needed, and stressed that nonessential travel should be discouraged. The recommendations are nonbinding.
The commission said it was important to maintain movement for essential travel and transport between Britain and the European Union, and also suggested that to allow the transport of goods to flow freely, countries should use rapid tests for truckers and haulers rather than time-consuming PCR tests.
“While it is important to take swift temporary precautionary action to limit the further spread of the new strain of the virus, and all nonessential travel to and from the U.K. should be discouraged, essential travel and transit of passengers should be facilitated,” the commission said in a statement. “Flight and train bans should be discontinued given the need to ensure essential travel and avoid supply chain disruptions.”
A bottleneck has built up at the British-French border since the weekend, when France moved to unilaterally suspend all traffic between the two countries.
Addressing the issue of EU nationals stuck in Britain and vice versa, the commission said that they should be exempted from any temporary restrictions and be permitted to go home.
The commission’s cautionary tone was echoed by Dr. Ugur Sahin, the co-founder of BioNTech, which, with Pfizer, developed the first vaccine approved in the West to combat the coronavirus. In nuanced comments, he said that it would be two weeks before full results from laboratory studies would allow for a fuller understanding of how the mutations might impact the effectiveness of the vaccine.
“We believe that there is no reason to be concerned until we get the data,” he said.
If an adapted vaccine were necessary, it could be ready within six weeks, Sahin told a news conference Tuesday. But it would require additional approval from regulators, which could increase the wait-time, he said.
But governments around the world were not waiting for a more complete picture of the new variant, instead racing to seal their borders to travelers from Britain. More than 50 governments put in place some sort of regulation, and officials in London warned that the lockdown measures in effect in the capital and southern England might need to be expanded.
The government’s chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, said Monday night that the new strain was now “everywhere” across England and that cases were only expected to grow over the holiday period.
“I think it’s likely therefore that measures will need to be increased in some places in due course, not reduced,” Vallance said.
Officials in France and Germany also acknowledged that it was possible the variant was circulating in their countries.
The World Health Organization also sought to temper the growing sense of alarm over the new variant and the danger it poses.
“There is zero evidence at this point that there is any increase in the severity associated with this disease,” Mike Ryan, the WHO emergency director, said at a virtual news conference. “Clearly there is work ongoing to look at transmission and the increased rates of transmission and how much of that is attributable to this particular variant.”
While scientists around the world worked to better understand the dangers of the variant, the measures being put in place to try and contain it were already being felt across Britain. Millions of people forced to abruptly cancel Christmas plans are now also facing the prospect of a disruption to basic services unlike anything experienced so far in the pandemic. Even the Royal Mail was forced to temporarily suspend all services to Europe, with the exception of Ireland, because of the “current restrictions around air, road, ferry and train movements.”

Our Digital Lives Drive a Brick-and-Mortar Boom in Data Centers

The shift to digital work and play from home, hastened by the pandemic, has wreaked havoc on commercial real estate. But experts say it has also generated one surprising bright spot for the industry: data centers.
The growing reliance on cloud-based technology — and the big, blocky buildings that house its hardware — has created greater opportunities for developers and investors as businesses and consumers gobble up more data in a world that has become increasingly connected.
“Our houses are connected, our cars are connected, our streetlights and parking meters are connected, and every single one of those connections is passing data back and forth,” said Sean O’Hara, president of the exchange-traded funds division at Pacer Financial, an investment advisory firm in Malvern, Pennsylvania.
And companies that provide data storage are preparing for even greater demand as new technologies like 5G and artificial intelligence become more widely used.
“Our business has continued to grow through the pandemic,” said Nelson Fonseca, chief executive of Cyxtera, a company that owns 62 data centers across the United States and in five markets in Europe and Asia. “It actually accelerated all the drivers that were growing the industry in the first place.”
Fonseca said Cyxtera, which typically leases space in its centers for three-year contracts, was on the hunt for new markets.
“We’re seeing demand across the board,” he said. “Our pipeline going into 2021 is even larger.”
The acceleration of existing consumer behaviors and workforce trends has driven companies to demand more space for their data, said Patrick Lynch, senior managing director of the data center solutions group at the real estate services and investment firm CBRE.
“Things like working from home and online shopping and distributed workforces all just layered into the momentum the industry had,” he said.
And investors have taken note.
“Over the past 90 days, we’re seeing a massive shift in capital toward this industry by big investment funds,” said Andy Cvengros, senior vice president and a member of the technology solutions practice at JLL, a real estate services and investing company.
Goldman Sachs announced in October an investment of up to $500 million in data center infrastructure, and the private equity firms Blackstone and KKR have recently announced data center investments.
Real estate investment trusts focused on data centers delivered returns of 19% in the first half of 2020 — one of only two REIT sectors that showed growth, according to a recent report by JLL. (The other sector, industrials, yielded a modest 2% return.) By comparison, returns for hotel and resort REITs plunged 49%, those for retail fell 37% and office space dropped 25%.
“It’s an acknowledgment that this is not a niche real estate market anymore,” Lynch said.
Data centers have emerged as a critical part of the digital infrastructure that connects people and businesses to one another and the rest of the world, said Jon Lin, president for the Americas region at Equinix, one of the largest global data center companies.
“We’re the foundation, in a lot of ways, for that digital infrastructure,” he said.
That infrastructure is no longer just the purview of technology companies. The Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and Hurricane Sandy in 2012 prompted many companies across a variety of sectors in New York, like finance and media, to rethink their information technology as a hedge against future disasters or damage. Now, pandemic-induced office closures and remote work arrangements are spurring corporations to reevaluate where and how they house their central nervous systems.
“A lot of companies had been moving into cloud-based services before, but the lockdown forced them to move to cloud-based a lot faster,” said Keith Snyder, an equity analyst at CFRA Research, an investment research firm.
Demand for space in data centers is also being fueled by the growing number of businesses that use cloud services to manage their operations without having to buy, maintain and update hardware and software. Many providers of these services want to have electronic outposts near their clients’ servers.
In addition, corporate America’s increasing adoption of sophisticated data analytics aided by artificial intelligence and machine learning requires more computing power, which also takes up physical space.
“You think about data as an intangible asset, but data has to be stored somewhere,” said Milena Petrova, an associate professor at Syracuse University who teaches real estate and corporate finance.
The more data a company is going to analyze, the more it is going to need to invest in servers and storage space, she said. Larger companies might be able to afford to buy that kind of space, but for many others, it’s cheaper to lease space in a data center that houses multiple companies under one roof.
And storage providers are trying to make leasing as easy as possible by offering flexible size and payment options.
“You can go to the cloud and swipe your credit card and have data center space on demand,” said Cvengros of JLL.
The coming rollout of 5G cellular networks is expected to stimulate the need for more computing and data storage on an enormous scale as well.
“We’re going to create significantly more data because of 5G,” Lynch said. “A large percentage of that will need to be stored somewhere.”
Silicon Valley might have the reputation as the shiny place where the future happens, but real estate professionals say data centers are being built all around the country. Most are on the outskirts of major metro areas including Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas-Fort Worth, New York and Phoenix.
A key criterion in site selection is proximity to the clusters of undersea cables that send and receive data from all over the world. In the United States, the cloud’s Grand Central Terminal is Northern Virginia.
“The Ashburn area outside D.C. is the largest data center market in the world,” said Lin of Equinix. “It’s really the hub of the digital economy in a lot of ways.”
Other considerations include the costs of land and local taxes. Building a facility can create as many as 1,000 temporary jobs. Completed data centers do not require large labor forces, but the jobs are generally high paying, so cities and states compete fiercely for these developments by offering tax incentives.
Data centers typically are new construction, given the challenges with retrofitting a building to meet requirements, such as raising the floor above the foundation and running powerful cooling systems to keep the hardware from overheating.
The generators and cooling components are built to allow repairs while they continue to operate, and they consume a lot of energy. Because data centers work around the clock, they need ready access to cheap, reliable power.
“Data centers are hungry in terms of power consumption,” Snyder said. “Reliable power delivery is probably one of the most important factors in choosing a location.”
All the complexities make choosing a site to build a data center more complicated.
“It’s not simple real estate,” O’Hara said. “It’s not an apartment.”

Texto completo: It's not every day you see a plane emergency slide in use. It's even less likely you'll see two passengers use it to slide out of a plane with their dog before the flight takes off.
But on Monday, that happened at LaGuardia Airport in Queens, New York.
"During flight 462’s taxi-out at LaGuardia on Dec. 21, a party of two (people) opened a cabin door and exited the aircraft via the slide," Morgan Durrant, spokesperson for Delta Air Lines, told USA TODAY.
The passengers, Antonio Murdock, 31, and Brianna Greco, 23, both residents of Florida, also had a service dog with them, Lenis Valens, spokesperson for Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which oversees the airport, told USA TODAY.
Passenger Brian Plummer told the New York Times that he had noticed the trio before boarding the plane and said when they did board, they changed seats multiple times. Plummer said that as the plane began to taxi out, the man, who claimed to have post-traumatic stress disorder, ignored a flight attendant's direction that he must be seated.
"The passengers activated the emergency slide and exited the aircraft onto the ramp," Maria Njoku, spokesperson for the Federal Aviation Administration, told USA TODAY, noting the incident happened around 10:40 a.m. "The passengers were subsequently arrested by law enforcement."
Murdock was arrested on multiple charges, including a felony charge for criminal mischief in the second degree, reckless endangerment in the second degree and criminal trespass in the third degree, Valens said.
Meanwhile, Greco was arrested on a charge of criminal trespass in the third degree.
Following the incident, the aircraft returned to its gate where the other passengers deplaned and were accommodated on other flights, according to Durrant. Afterward, maintenance technicians evaluated the plane and returned it to service Monday night.
"It’s fair to characterize an episode like this as ultra-rare," Durrant added.
But similar incidents have happened before.
In March, a passenger on Frontier Airlines used the slide to exit when the plane was parked at the gate, the Washington Post reported. And a decade earlier, in 2010, a JetBlue flight attended disembarked via slide after a dispute with a passenger, the New York Times reported. In 2018, another passenger escaped a United flight pre-takeoff using a slide according to NBC 4 New York.

Texto completo: Lawmakers struck a nearly $900 billion COVID-19 stimulus deal Sunday that includes another round of stimulus checks and badly needed jobless benefits for struggling Americans, ending a long standoff in Washington with one of the biggest rescue bills in U.S. history.
After months of impasse, negotiations came down to the wire as 12 million people are set to lose unemployment benefits the day after Christmas. The deal includes restarting a $300 boost to the federal unemployment insurance benefit, extending eviction moratoriums for renters for an unspecified amount of time and a $600 direct payment to most Americans.
Even though lawmakers reached a deal, some jobless Americans could see their unemployment benefits lapse because it might take weeks for aid to reach them through outdated state systems, experts say.
The measure will be tied to a $1.4 trillion must-pass
spending bill that will fund federal agencies and programs through Sept. 30, the end of the fiscal year.
Congress passed a one-day extension of government funding late Sunday to give lawmakers one more day to review the deal to avert a partial government shutdown deadline.
For the bill to become law, both the House and Senate must pass the legislation, and President Donald Trump will need to sign it.
Here's what is in the stimulus package:
Will I get another stimulus check?
The measure contains an up to $600 direct payment to most Americans, and $600 per child, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement. That is less than the $1,200 checks approved in the spring.
It would also include $1,200 for couples making up to $150,000 a year.
The size of the benefit would be reduced for those earning more than $75,000 in 2019, similar to the last round of stimulus checks, according to The Washington Post.
When will stimulus checks be sent?
The government will begin to send out direct payments to millions of Americans next week, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Monday.
"People are going to see this money the beginning of next week," Mnuchin said in a CNBC interview.
Are unemployment benefits extended?
The bill would extend all pandemic unemployment programs set to expire at the end of December. It's unclear for how long.
Those benefits would likely be extended for 11 weeks of unemployment, according to The Washington Post.
The deal came as two unemployment programs were set to end Dec. 26: the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program, which provides aid to self-employed, temporary workers and gig workers; and the Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation program, which provides an additional 13 weeks of benefits beyond the typical 26 weeks that states provide to jobless workers.
Are there enhanced unemployment benefits?
The measure would provide a federal unemployment benefit of $300 a week for up to 11 weeks through mid-March, less than the $600 provided under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act passed in March. The benefits aren't retroactive.
The bill also would give an additional federal benefit of $100 a week to those who earned at least $5,000 a year in self-employment income but are disqualified from receiving a more generous Pandemic Unemployment Assistance benefit because they are eligible for state jobless aid, according to The New York Times.
Is paid sick leave included?
The agreement provides a tax credit to support employers offering paid sick leave, based on the framework of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, enacted in March, according to Pelosi and Schumer's statement.
Families First required many employers to provide workers with two weeks of sick leave related to COVID-19 at full pay, and up to 12 weeks of family and medical leave to care for family members at two-thirds pay.
As many as 87 million workers could lose access to emergency paid leave at the end of the month. If those benefits aren't extended, it would limit workers' ability to stay home to quarantine after COVID-19 exposure, or care for a child whose school or day care is closed.
It's unclear whether the measure would still require companies to offer paid sick leave to workers who have COVID-19, or those caring for children after school closures.
Are eviction moratoriums extended?
Yes. It would offer $25 billion in emergency rental assistance and provide an extension of eviction moratoriums. It's unclear for how long based on Pelosi and Schumer's statement.
The latest legislation extended the moratorium through Jan. 31, The New York Times said.
The loss in jobless aid and other stimulus relief would have put 30 million to 40 million people at risk of eviction as moratoriums were set to expire in January, according to the Aspen Institute, a think tank.
Will student loan forbearance continue?
Pelosi and Schumer didn't mention an extension to student loan relief Sunday. Though lawmakers have called for a continuation on federal student loan forbearance. It's unclear if it will be in the final version of the bill.
Earlier this month, Trump paused federal student loan payments for another month through Jan. 31.
What else is in the package?
The package includes an extension of the small business Paycheck Protection Program, which expanded eligibility to local newspapers, broadcasters and nonprofits. It will direct another $20 billion to small business grants and $15 billion to live event venues.
The measure increased funding for vaccine distribution and coronavirus testing.
It also provided $13 billion in increased benefits for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.

Texto completo: Our panel predicts a big year for the Nets and the Pelicans' Zion Williamson, a surprise from Damian Lillard, a Lakers repeat and a fierce battle among the rookies.
The last time the sports staff of The New York Times and assorted friends gathered to make the annual set of N.B.A. preseason predictions, we got some things right.
Ahead of the 2019-20 season, several of us thought that Giannis Antetokounmpo of the Milwaukee Bucks would repeat as the N.B.A.'s most valuable player. (Yawn.) Others predicted that the Oklahoma City Thunder would have a surprisingly successful season after a summer in which they traded Paul George to the Los Angeles Clippers, and that the Memphis Grizzlies' Ja Morant would win the league's Rookie of the Year Award over Zion Williamson of the New Orleans Pelicans.
But no one predicted that the Los Angeles Lakers would win the championship -- let alone advance to the N.B.A. finals. (The Clippers were the unanimous choice to come out of the West.) Or that the Lakers' title run would come after the arrival of something called the "coronavirus," which would suspend the season for four months and before resuming in a spectator-free bubble at Walt Disney World outside Orlando, Fla.
The point being: Predictions are difficult, and sometimes impossible. But that is not about to stop us from trying again.
Here is a look at some of our highly unscientific picks and prognostications for the season ahead:
(The New York Times does not permit its staff to vote for the official N.B.A. awards.)
The predictors:
Jonathan Abrams, sports reporter
Harvey Araton, Hall of Fame sportswriter
Elena Bergeron, assistant sports editor
Jonah Bromwich, staff writer
Scott Cacciola, sports reporter
Sopan Deb, sports reporter
Evan Easterling, senior staff editor
Shauntel Lowe, N.B.A. editor
Marc Stein, Hall of Fame sports reporter
Most Valuable Player
Abrams: Anthony Davis (Lakers)
Araton: Luka Doncic (Mavericks)
Bergeron: LeBron James (Lakers)
Bromwich: Damian Lillard (Trail Blazers)
Cacciola: Stephen Curry (Warriors)
Deb: LeBron James (Lakers)
Easterling: Luka Doncic (Mavericks)
Lowe: LeBron James (Lakers)
Stein: Luka Doncic (Mavericks)
Why Curry? "He's back. The Warriors won't be title contenders without Klay Thompson. But they'll be in the thick of the playoff race with Curry putting on nightly shows." -- Cacciola
Why Lillard? "The smart pick here is Kevin Durant or Luka Doncic, but I love Lillard, everyone else loves Lillard and if the Blazers crack the top five in the West, he's got a great chance at it." -- Bromwich
Rookie of the Year
Abrams: Obi Toppin (Knicks)
Araton: Immanuel Quickley (Knicks)
Bergeron: LaMelo Ball (Hornets)
Bromwich: Isaac Okoro (Cavaliers)
Cacciola: Tyrese Haliburton (Kings)
Deb: James Wiseman (Warriors)
Easterling: LaMelo Ball (Hornets)
Lowe: LaMelo Ball (Hornets)
Stein: Deni Avdija (Wizards)
Why Ball? "More offense will run through Ball than rookies on teams that are closer to contention, like James Wiseman in Golden State, or joining ready-made tandems, like Anthony Edwards, who'll play alongside Karl-Anthony Towns and D'Angelo Russell in Minnesota. In limited preseason action, he showed signs his passing ability will translate to the N.B.A., a skill that will be augmented by playing with Gordon Hayward and Devonte' Graham." -- Easterling
Defensive Player of the Year
Abrams: Anthony Davis (Lakers)
Araton: Anthony Davis (Lakers)
Bergeron: Anthony Davis (Lakers)
Bromwich: Anthony Davis (Lakers)
Cacciola: Anthony Davis (Lakers)
Deb: Anthony Davis (Lakers)
Easterling: Joel Embiid (Sixers)
Lowe: Anthony Davis (Lakers)
Stein: Anthony Davis (Lakers)
Sixth Man of the Year
Abrams: Dennis Schröder (Lakers)
Araton: Caris LeVert (Nets)
Bergeron: Danilo Gallinari (Hawks)
Bromwich: Spencer Dinwiddie (Nets)
Cacciola: Spencer Dinwiddie (Nets) or Caris LeVert (Nets)
Deb: Caris LeVert (Nets)
Easterling: Tyler Herro (Heat)
Lowe: Caris LeVert (Nets)
Stein: Caris LeVert (Nets)
Why the best sixth man will come from the Nets: "Whichever guard -- LeVert or Dinwiddie -- Coach Steve Nash chooses to bring off the bench is going to produce big numbers for a team that has all the components for a title run." -- Cacciola
Most Improved
Abrams: Lonzo Ball (Pelicans)
Araton: Tyler Herro (Heat)
Bergeron: Michael Porter Jr. (Nuggets)
Bromwich: Deandre Ayton (Suns)
Cacciola: Deandre Ayton (Suns)
Deb: Rui Hachimura (Wizards)
Easterling: OG Anunoby (Raptors)
Lowe: Tyler Herro (Heat)
Stein: Christian Wood (Rockets)
Wild Predictions for Houston:
"John Wall will have a bounce-back season, leading a James Harden-less Houston Rockets team to fringe playoff contention." -- Abrams
"It's not that wild: John Wall is going to ball out in Houston. He seems fully rehabbed and highly motivated to show out, and the fresh start will help him bounce back from a rough two years off the court." -- Bergeron
Coach of the Year
Abrams: Monty Williams (Suns)
Araton: Erik Spoelstra (Heat)
Bergeron: Erik Spoelstra (Heat)
Bromwich: Steve Nash (Nets)
Cacciola: Steve Kerr (Warriors)
Deb: Steve Nash (Nets)
Easterling: Michael Malone (Nuggets)
Lowe: Monty Williams (Suns)
Stein: Steve Nash (Nets)
Why Steve Nash? "The Nets and the Clippers remind me of each other a bit: superteams assembled in the last normal off-season, with sky-high potential and possibly combustible chemistry. The Nets will overcome the inevitable Kyrie Irving-related distractions and Nash will get credit for making it all run smooth-ish." -- Bromwich
Executive of the Year
Abrams: Rob Pelinka (Lakers)
Araton: Sean Marks (Nets)
Bergeron: Rob Pelinka (Lakers)
Bromwich: Rob Pelinka (Lakers)
Cacciola: Rob Pelinka (Lakers)
Deb: Daryl Morey (Sixers)
Easterling: James Jones (Suns)
Lowe: Rob Pelinka (Lakers)
Stein: Rob Pelinka (Lakers)
Wild Prediction: "Tired of paying mega-salaries for meager results, Michael Jordan cashes out as majority owner of the Hornets to go all-in on NASCAR." -- Araton
Best Record in the League
Abrams: Milwaukee Bucks
Araton: Miami Heat
Bergeron: Milwaukee Bucks
Bromwich: Milwaukee Bucks
Cacciola: Milwaukee Bucks
Deb: Milwaukee Bucks
Easterling: Milwaukee Bucks
Lowe: Milwaukee Bucks
Stein: Brooklyn Nets
Wild Predictions: What happens to James Harden?
Cacciola: The Rockets will wait until the trade deadline to deal James Harden. What's the rush?
Deb: James Harden remains in Houston all season.
Easterling: The Indiana Pacers trade for James Harden.
Worst Record in the League
Abrams: Detroit Pistons
Araton: Detroit Pistons
Bergeron: Detroit Pistons
Bromwich: Knicks
Cacciola: Cleveland Cavaliers
Deb: Chicago Bulls
Easterling: Cleveland Cavaliers
Lowe: Cleveland Cavaliers
Stein: Cleveland Cavaliers
Wild Prediction: "In the preseason, I watched the Cavaliers surprise Indiana twice, and then totally missed them losing to the Knicks in their next two. That means I'm unjustifiably excited about the Cavs, particularly Collin Sexton and Isaac Okoro. My wild, semi-informed prediction is that Cleveland will be fun to watch for the first time since LeBron left, and -- why not? -- will sneak into a play-in game." -- Bromwich
Breakout Star
Abrams: Collin Sexton (Cavaliers)
Araton: Zion Williamson (Pelicans)
Bergeron: Christian Wood (Rockets)
Bromwich: Talen Horton-Tucker (Lakers)
Cacciola: Michael Porter Jr. (Nuggets)
Deb: Devonte' Graham (Hornets)
Easterling: Michael Porter Jr. (Nuggets)
Lowe: Obi Toppin (Knicks)
Stein: Zion Williamson (Pelicans)
Why Williamson? "Fully unleashed on the league." -- Araton
Eastern Conference Finals
Abrams: Sixers over Bucks
Araton: Heat over Nets
Bergeron: Bucks over Heat
Bromwich: Nets over Bucks
Cacciola: Celtics over Nets
Deb: Bucks over Nets
Easterling: Heat over Nets
Lowe: Nets over Bucks
Stein: Heat over Nets
Western Conference Finals
Abrams: Lakers over Trail Blazers
Araton: Lakers over Jazz
Bergeron: Lakers over Mavericks
Bromwich: Lakers over Clippers
Cacciola: Lakers over Clippers
Deb: Lakers over Warriors
Easterling: Lakers over Mavericks
Lowe: Lakers over Clippers
Stein: Lakers over Clippers
N.B.A. Finals
Abrams: Lakers over Sixers
Araton: Lakers over Heat
Bergeron: Lakers over Bucks
Bromwich: Lakers over Nets
Cacciola: Lakers over Celtics
Deb: Lakers over Bucks
Easterling: Lakers over Heat
Lowe: Lakers over Nets
Stein: Lakers over Heat
Why the Lakers will win again: "I will never again bet against LeBron, even if he runs for president." -- Araton

Liberal Media Scream: Calls for ‘Truth Commission’ to take Trump down

Texto completo: This week’s Liberal Media Scream features the media’s latest effort to hit President Trump, this time with a “Truth Commission” after he leaves office.
Opinions came in from PBS NewsHour White House correspondent Yamiche Alcindor and Meet the Press host Chuck Todd.
In talking about it, Alcindor dissed Trump’s 75 million voters in suggesting that they are not in control of facts, thus they can't agree on the truth.
iFrame Object
On his show, Todd raised a New York Times editorial he characterized as calling for “a truth and reconciliation commission” to address the supposed misdeeds of Trump and administration officials.
From Sunday’s Meet the Press on NBC:
Chuck Todd: “Yamiche, what kind of appetite do you think the Biden administration’s going to have? You know, I talked about a COVID commission. I think that’s likely to happen, something like that. But I noticed the New York Times today called for something — they didn’t call it this, but it almost felt like a ‘truth and reconciliation commission.’ Is that something that our current politics could allow to happen?”
Yamiche Alcindor: “I think because of this thing that former President Obama called ‘truth decay,’ it’s very hard to have a ‘truth and reconciliation commission’ when Americans can’t agree on the truth. Hallie Jackson’s talking about Kellyanne Conway talking to you about alternative facts. I remember being on Meet the Press when Rudy Giuliani told you, ‘Truth isn’t truth.’ It is the thing that defined the Trump administration and this era, that they wanted to completely create a new version of the truth. And so many Americans, more than 75 million of them, went along with that for President Trump. I’m not sure if we can get to a place where Americans can sit down and say, ‘Let’s talk about our differences,’ when we can’t even agree on the facts.”
Tweet
Media Research Center Vice President Brent Baker explains our weekly pick: “So much for media enthusiasm for how Joe Biden will bring people together by showing respect for political opponents. Todd seems excited about the idea of getting some vengeance, while Alcindor only sees the supposed denial of ‘truth’ by Trump supporters as an impediment to creating such as Orwellian ‘truth commission.’”
Rating: Three out of five screams.

Texto completo: Federal prosecutors looking into President Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani have reportedly discussed a legal request to obtain his electronic communications.
One source familiar with the matter told NBC News that an investigation into the former New York mayor being conducted by the Southern District of New York is still “very active.” That source and another also claimed that SDNY prosecutors told Justice Department officials in Washington, D.C., that they want to see Giuliani’s emails.
Per agency policy, Justice Department officials in Washington, D.C., must give the permission to the SDNY before prosecutors can ask a judge to sign a search warrant for communications that might be guarded by attorney-client privilege.
Spokespeople for both the Justice Department and the SDNY declined to comment on the report. Giuliani’s attorney, Robert Costello, told NBC News that he has “no reason to believe there’s any truth to the allegations that there is renewed interest in my client.”
Although details about the SDNY inquiry into Giuliani are being kept tightly under wraps, in 2019, the New York Times reported that he was being investigated by federal prosecutors in Manhattan. The investigators were reportedly probing whether Giuliani broke lobbying laws for his work in Ukraine.
Two of Giuliani’s associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, were charged last year for an alleged plot to use straw donors to send illegal contributions to political figures in order to advance their own business and political interests. They pleaded not guilty. Also charged were Ukrainian-born Andrey Kukushkin and David Correia, who both pleaded not guilty. However, Correia changed his position and pleaded guilty in October to defrauding investors.
Giuliani, who is now leading Trump's legal effort to challenge the results of the 2020 election, denied a New York Times report a few weeks ago that said he spoke to Trump about a pardon.

President-elect Joe Biden received the coronavirus vaccine on live television Monday at the Christiana Hospital in Newark, Delaware, sending a message to Americans across the country that the vaccine is safe to take.
“Left’s good,” he told the nurse practitioner who administered the vaccine, rolling up the sleeve of his black long-sleeve turtleneck and exposing his left arm. “You just go ahead anytime you’re ready.”
He credited the Trump administration for its work on Operation Warp Speed, which helped to deliver a quick vaccine.
“The administration deserves some credit getting this off the ground,” he said. “I’m doing this to demonstrate that people should be prepared when it’s available to take the vaccine.”
Biden, however, warned Americans that vigilance in the coming months was still necessary.
“It’s going to take time,” he said, encouraging people to continue to wear masks and socially distance. “If you don’t have to travel, don’t travel,” he said. “It’s really important.”
He thanked health care workers, calling them heroes, and ended with an awkward elbow bump with Tabe Mase, the nurse practitioner who administered to him the first course of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. His wife, Dr. Jill Biden, received the vaccine privately, earlier in the day Monday, according to a spokesman, and joined him at the hospital.
Since March, Joe Biden’s team has been taking public health guidelines about social distancing and masks seriously, as President Donald Trump and his aides have willfully disregarded them. But even Biden’s more careful circle has been infiltrated by the virus. Rep. Cedric Richmond, D-La., one of Biden’s closest advisers, tested positive for the coronavirus last week, the transition team announced.
Vice President-elect Kamala Harris is expected to receive her vaccine after Christmas, a spokesperson said, following advice from doctors who recommended Biden and Harris stagger their first shots rather than receive them together.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease expert who will also be Biden’s chief medical adviser, will be vaccinated at 10 a.m. Tuesday at what the National Institutes of Health is billing as a “kick off” event showcasing Moderna’s vaccine, which received emergency authorization from the Food and Drug Administration on Friday.
Fauci’s vaccination has been long-awaited by public figures and health experts. Former President Barack Obama recently said that if Fauci endorses a coronavirus vaccine, that will be a signal to him that it is safe.
Vice President Mike Pence, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Sen. Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, all received the first dose of the vaccine Friday.
Trump, however, has neither participated in nor supported the public health campaign to reassure vaccine skeptics worried about its dangers.
On Friday, he did nothing to promote Pence taking the vaccine, an event held at the White House that officials asked all of the television networks to carry live on TV for maximum exposure. Instead, Trump was tweeting out anti-mask claims minutes after Pence received his vaccine.
Some of Trump’s advisers have defended his decision to put off his own vaccination, arguing that he still has the protective effects of the monoclonal antibody cocktail that was used to treat him for the virus in October.
But doctors have said it would set a good example to Americans who have recovered from COVID-19 that they still should receive the vaccine.
“We know that infection doesn’t induce a very strong immune response and it wanes over time,” Moncef Slaoui, the chief adviser of Operation Warp Speed, said on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday. “So I think, as a clear precaution, it is appropriate to be vaccinated because it’s safe. I think people should be vaccinated, indeed.”

Stimulus Offers $15 Billion in Relief for Struggling Arts Venues

For the music venue owners, theater producers and cultural institutions that have suffered through the pandemic with no business, the coronavirus relief package that congressional leaders agreed to this week offers the prospect of aid at last: It includes $15 billion to help them weather a crisis that has closed theaters and silenced halls.
The money, part of a $900 billion coronavirus relief package, is designed to help the culture sector — from dive-bar rock clubs to Broadway theaters and museums — survive. Many small proprietors described it as their last hope for being able to remain in business after a nearly yearlong revenue drought.
“This is what our industry needs to make it through,” said Dayna Frank, the owner of First Avenue, a storied music club in Minneapolis. She is also the board president of the National Independent Venue Association, which was formed in April and has lobbied Congress aggressively for relief for its more than 3,000 members.
As the news of the deal began to trickle out on Sunday night, a collective sigh of relief ricocheted through group text messages and social media posts. “Last night was the first time I have smiled in probably nine months,” Frank said.
Broadway theaters, which have been closed since March, applauded the relief package.
“We are grateful for this bipartisan agreement which will provide immediate relief across our industry and a lifeline to the future,” Charlotte St. Martin, the president of the Broadway League, the trade organization for producers and theater owners, said in a statement.
Nataki Garrett, the artistic director for Oregon Shakespeare Festival, said that the aid would be crucial for nonprofit theaters. “Our situation was critical and dire,” she said.
But the leaders of some large nonprofit cultural organizations worried that the way the bill is structured — giving priority to organizations that lost very high percentages of their revenue before considering the rest — could put them at the back of the line for grants, since they typically get a significant portion of revenues through donations.
With the bill set to be approved in both chambers of Congress as early as Monday evening, arts groups around the nation were cautiously celebrating while studying the fine print to see what kind of aid they might qualify for. Most doubt the entertainment industry can fully swing back into action until well into next year, at the earliest.
The bill allows independent entertainment businesses, like music venues and movie theaters, along with other cultural entities, to apply for grants from the Small Business Administration to support six months of payments to employees and for costs including rent, utilities and maintenance. Applicants must have lost at least 25% of their revenue to qualify, and those that have lost more than 90% will be able to apply first, within the first two weeks after the bill becomes law.
Grants will be capped at $10 million.
The core of those provisions were proposed in the Senate in July by Sens. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and John Cornyn, R-Texas. As relief efforts languished for months in Washington, venues and institutions began to give out. According to the independent venue association, at least 300 music spots have shut down since the start of the pandemic.
Klobuchar credited the venue groups with a relentless campaign to persuade members of Congress of their economic and cultural value to local communities.
“It was the grassroots efforts of musicians and theaters and fans all across the country,” Klobuchar said in an interview on Monday. “And it was the fact that the coalition stuck together. They didn’t infight.”
The pandemic forced small music venues and nonprofit theaters — normally strangers to Washington — to learn the fine art of lobbying. Proprietors spoke of the elbow grease they put into building their businesses, the ancillary benefit to local communities through tourism and dining, and the historical role that arts organizations have played in revitalizing blighted corridors of urban America.
The idea of cultural groups suffering in every corner of the country helped this part of the overall relief package obtain wide bipartisan support.
In addition to theaters and museums, the bill will allow talent agents and managers to apply for relief. The bill would restrict publicly traded companies and other large players.
“I wanted to make sure it didn’t benefit the Ticketmasters of the world,” Klobuchar said.
Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader in the Senate, has been an aggressive advocate for cultural relief — he wore a “Save Our Stages” mask through the last flurry of negotiations on Capitol Hill last week — with, naturally, a particular focus on groups in New York, including Broadway theaters.
“It was not just Broadway,” Schumer said in an interview. “It was more the independent venues that were the lifeblood of New York. Young people come to New York, and that’s part of the reason they do come — to cities in general, not just New York.”
“The nonprofit and arts world is very important to the economies of cities,” he added. “People forget that.”
For some of the mom-and-pop venue operators who found themselves campaigning for relief, the process was a do-or-die necessity, if a bewildering one.
“We used to call managers and agents to book talent,” said Chris Bauman of Zenith Music Group, which operates a handful of venues in Chicago. “Now we got thrown into this crazy world of politics. Eighty hours a week of Zooms with mayors, senators, congressmen.”
“It shows there’s the ability to get it done,” Bauman added, fighting back tears. “Not be left behind.”

For U.K., an Early Taste of Brexit as Borders Are Sealed

LONDON — Christmas plans were canceled. Many flights off the island were stopped. And lawmakers called for cultivating new plots of land to shore up the nation’s food supply, conjuring images of plates full of root vegetables.
Britain, christened not long ago by a pro-Brexit lawmaker as “Treasure Island” for the riches it offers, earned another moniker Monday as a new variant of the coronavirus ripped through the country and set off blockades at its borders: Plague Island.
As dozens of nations banned British travelers, choking off some of the most-traveled routes to and from Britain by road, air and sea, Britons raged at the seesawing plans of their own government, which suddenly reimposed a lockdown across much of the country’s southeast, including London, this weekend.
And they lamented having to grapple with a new and potentially more transmissible variant of the virus even as they steeled themselves for the looming chaos of the country’s split with the European Union in 10 days.
“I’ve had better times,” Tom Henderson, a 29-year-old a concert promoter, said understatedly as he recounted canceling a Christmas visit with his family in southern England and watching his industry disintegrate in the pandemic.
On a wet, gray day in London, he said he took solace in his belief that, contrary to the gloomiest predictions, “this isn’t some New Year’s Eve movie where the world is going to end.”
Still, for Britons who were already girding for the country to finalize its messy divorce from the European Union on Dec. 31, the sudden sense of being cut adrift from the bloc — and from the world at large — felt like a bitter taste of what might be to come.
Supermarket giants were warning of fruit and vegetable shortages. Freight trucks were stranded near ports. People trying to leave Britain for their homes elsewhere in Europe before travel bans took effect were in some cases being held up for long stretches at airports.
And while Britain and France were taking steps Monday to minimize threats to the food supply — about a quarter of all the food eaten in Britain is produced in the European Union — many people in Britain saw the travel ban and port closures as their worst fears about their country’s post-Brexit fate come true.
And sooner than expected.
“Psychologically for me, there was already that barrier in place because of Brexit,” said Russell Hazel, who was ill with the virus for seven weeks earlier this year. “Now, there’s a physical one.”
Hazel said that a good friend was visiting Spain. Now, he worries about how the friend will make it back home.
The confusion, Hazel said, feels like a “dry run” for Britain possibly crashing out of the European Union without a deal governing future commercial relations across the English Channel.
For their troubles, Britons largely blamed Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
After locking down Britain later than other European countries in the spring, a decision that led to one of Europe’s highest per capita death rates from the virus, Johnson’s government encouraged people over the summer to return to their offices. It even subsidized meals out at restaurants.
That helped set the stage for a resurgence of the virus.
Even so, as recently as Wednesday, Johnson was pledging to stick with a policy of special allowances for Christmastime travel. Streets in London were thronged with shoppers. And the government took legal action to prevent schools from sending students home early for the holidays in the midst of soaring infections.
That decision was called into question Monday after scientific advisers to the government said there were signs that children may be more susceptible to the new variant of the virus.
Kelly Merris, who is originally from Australia, said that talking to family and friends there made it clear just how much more recklessly Britain had handled the virus.
“I think the rest of the world looks at us and shakes their head,” said Merris, who had long ago canceled plans to return to Australia over Christmas. “It’s not a very nice thought to be on a plague island, and that other countries don’t want you.”
Her husband, Aaron McDonald, who is also Australian, said British exceptionalism had taken on a different meaning during the pandemic.
“The U.K. often sees itself as slightly different from the rest of the world and continental Europe,” he said. “Now we’ve distinguished ourselves in a not very good way. It’s very disappointing.”
The British government had begun warning of the new variant days before it changed its policy of so-called amnesty for Christmastime travel, leaving many people frustrated about having to cancel plans at the last minute.
Others had more urgent worries, like whether an older relative they could no longer visit would be able to make new arrangements for food deliveries or at-home care over the holidays.
But some Britons said the cascading travel bans were partly the price Britain paid for its yearslong effort to separate from the European Union.
“If you ask for Brexit, this is what you get,” said Suraya Klein-Smith, as she waited in line at a butcher Monday. “Why should the Europeans have any sort of empathy or deals for us?”
An airline flight attendant who has watched many of her friends lose their jobs this year, Klein-Smith said she sympathized with the Londoners who scrambled to leave the city Saturday, shortly after Johnson told people to stay at home. She said many people, having already taken precautions by self-isolating, were desperate to see their families.
But the government itself deserves no sympathy, she said, adding that she hoped Johnson would resign by January.
“They made sure people spent their money in the shops, prepared, got train tickets,” she said. “Canceling it at the last minute is just shambolic.”
Some Londoners said the worries over the new variant had only confirmed what they already knew: People had been socializing far too much lately to make trips home for Christmas safe.
“We were all far too socially occupied in the last few weeks,” said Bruce McCombie, who has not seen his family in Scotland for a year and who canceled a planned visit home. “It wasn’t sensible.”
Piers Storey, a teacher, laughed hollowly when he was asked about European countries’ decision to cut off travel from Britain.
“What can you say?” he said. “Nothing feels as isolating as Brexit.”

Producing it was a messy, time-consuming affair that did nothing to improve Congress’ reputation for dysfunction. But by the time the House and Senate had agreed on the terms of a pandemic aid package, it showed the ascendance of a moderate new force in a divided Senate and validated President-elect Joe Biden’s belief that it is still possible to make deals on Capitol Hill.
Along with struggling Americans and businesses, the incoming president was a major beneficiary of the $900 billion pandemic stimulus measure haltingly but finally produced by Congress, which will give him some breathing room when he enters the White House next month. Rather than face an immediate and dire need to act on an emergency economic aid package, Biden and his team can take a moment to instead try to fashion a more far-reaching recovery program and begin to tackle other issues.
“President-elect Biden is going to have an economy that is healthier,” said Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., one of the chief players in a breakaway effort by centrists in the Senate and House that led to the compromise. “This is a significant financial injection into the economy at a time that is critical.”
The group of moderates was essential to the outcome, pushing Senate and House leaders of both parties into direct personal negotiations that they had avoided for months. Had the leaders not moved forward, they risked losing control over the legislation as the compromise forged by the centrists gained momentum with members of both parties. That was a possibility that Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the majority leader, was eager to avoid in the interest of keeping his tight grip on the Senate.
“I’m glad we forced the issue,” said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, who, along with Sen. Joe Manchin III, D-W.Va., were leaders of a monthslong effort to break the impasse over pandemic aid even as the virus exacted a growing economic and health toll on the country.
Given the slender partisan divides that will exist in both the Senate and House next year, the approach could provide a road map for the Biden administration if it hopes to break through congressional paralysis, especially in the Senate, and pass additional legislation. Biden has said another economic relief plan will be an early priority.
“I believe it is going to be the only way we are going to accomplish the president-elect’s agenda in the next two years,” said Rep. Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., a leader of the 50-member bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus that took part in forging the compromise. “In the long run, this is the way to govern.”
But the extraordinarily difficult time Congress had in coming to terms over pandemic legislation demonstrated once again just how difficult a task Biden confronts. Almost every influential member of the House and Senate acknowledged the relief was sorely needed, but it was impeded in part by last-minute Republican attempts to undercut Biden’s future authority. Some Republicans are already suggesting that the latest package should tide over the nation for an extended period, with no additional relief necessary for some time.
Biden on Sunday applauded the willingness of lawmakers to “reach across the aisle” and called the effort a “model for the challenging work ahead for our nation.” He was also not an idle bystander in the negotiations.
With Republican and Democratic leaders in the House and Senate far apart on how much they were willing to accept in new pandemic spending, Biden on Dec. 2 threw his support behind the $900 billion plan being pushed by the centrist group, a total equal to less than half of the $2 trillion House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., had been insisting on.
Biden’s move was not without risks. If it had failed to impact the discussions, the president-elect risked looking powerless to move Congress, even before he had taken the oath of office. But members of both parties said his intervention was constructive and gave Democrats confidence in lowering their demands.
“It helped a lot with the Democrats because it told them he doesn’t want to have a worsened economy and more serious unemployment and a shortfall in vaccine money when he takes office,” Collins said.
Deep disagreements over the spending level had been an impediment since the spring, when McConnell balked at another round of pandemic relief, saying he wanted to pause and see how the more than $2.8 trillion already allocated was being used. Democrats, on the other hand, were pushing a sweeping, $3.4 trillion measure that would never pass the Senate, including as much as $1 trillion in relief for state and local governments that McConnell called a nonstarter. Then the rescue plan got caught up in the November election, and any chance for movement died even as the crisis persisted and the economic situation of millions worsened.
With the election over, the centrists renewed their efforts; eight of them met at the Capitol Hill home of Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, on Nov. 17 to exchange ideas and plot strategy. In contrast to other such efforts in the past, the participants decided to put ideas hashed out in what were described as tough negotiations into actual legislative language — not just a series of principles or talking points. That gave heft to their proposal, and negotiators said it would serve as a model for the future.
“We didn’t just give them a memo with concepts,” said Sen. Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat who participated in the talks despite his role in the party leadership. “We gave them an actual bill.”
The proposal provided concrete evidence of an alternative to the dug-in positions of the leaders in both parties, with substantial bipartisan support in both the House and Senate. Murkowski said the legislation was never intended to be an all-encompassing solution but instead represented a “lifeline” to get hard-hit Americans through a crisis that McConnell himself conceded Saturday was a “five-alarm national crisis.”
“We presented that multi-hundred-page package to the public, to the administration, to leadership,” Murkowski said. “We basically said, ‘Here is a gift. Take it.’”
McConnell was not so eager to unwrap the present. Bipartisan negotiating groups, often known as “gangs” on Capitol Hill, can be seen as a threat to leadership. To the dismay of the negotiators, the majority leader quickly dismissed the compromise legislation. But after months of delegating the negotiations with Democrats to the Trump administration, McConnell became personally involved and began talks with Pelosi, Schumer and Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California, the House Republican leader.
While the centrists might have, in Murkowski’s term, lost “ball control” of the legislation, they were satisfied that their work provided the framework for the eventual outcome. Schumer credited them with “unlocking” the stalled talks.
“I think we broke the logjam,” said Warner.
Those who took part in the negotiations saw their efforts as a good example of what can occur when the White House and Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill decide they want to compromise rather than trade accusations over who is responsible for a stalemate. Members of the centrist group said they had been approached by many other lawmakers interested in participating in the next round of talks.
But pursuing such compromises requires accepting steep political risks, including defying party leaders, breaking with colleagues and being willing to settle for something less than some in one’s party would prefer.
“There is nothing wrong with working together and getting 80% of what you want instead of insisting on 100%,” Gottheimer said. “This is about actually governing. It is a different model. It is not the one that gets you clicks, but it is how you a get a bill.”

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
PARIS — Earlier this month, David-Alexander Leduc rolled his suitcase down a nearly empty platform at the Gare du Nord train station and scanned his ticket at the turnstile to board the sole Eurostar leaving that day for London.
Leduc used to shuttle regularly for business on one of at least 17 high-speed Eurostar trains that ran back and forth daily, morning to night, through the underwater Channel Tunnel linking Britain and France.
He was lucky there was a train to take.
“It’s constraining,” said Leduc, who lives in London and has cut back hopping over to France to meet clients as a plunge in ridership from national quarantines forces Eurostar to slash services. “But you have to adapt.”
On Monday, a bad year for Eurostar suddenly turned worse. All service from London to Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam was suspended for at least 48 hours, as governments on the continent banned travelers from Britain, a precaution as health officials try to control a new variant of coronavirus sweeping across parts of England. Trains will continue operating from Paris to London, the company said.
Eurostar, the sleek and speedy mode of travel that ties London, Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam and other cities, is a shadow of itself, crippled by the pandemic. Its ridership has all but vanished, and its finances are threatened. More than 90% of its employees have been furloughed, one of its unions said.
Its woes reflect a struggle for survival playing out across the European train industry, as the pandemic continues to upend the business of transportation. Like Europe’s airlines, the railway sector is facing its worst crisis in modern history.
Ridership has slumped 70% to 90% amid lockdowns and social-distancing requirements, pushing the industry toward a staggering 22 billion euros (about $26.9 billion) in losses this year, around the same expected for European airlines, according to CER, a Brussels-based trade group representing passenger and freight train operators. Thousands of trains have been mothballed, and tens of thousands of workers are on government-subsidized furloughs.
“It’s a totally extraordinary situation,” said Libor Lochman, CER’s executive director. “There is no comparison for it, and it can and will lead to the bankruptcy of a number of companies, unless there is the political will to prevent it,” he said.
With more than 9 billion passengers and 1.6 billion tons of freight carried on tracks stretching from Spain to Sweden, Europe’s trains are as vital as planes for whisking people and goods across the continent.
But even after the pandemic, analysts say work-from-home practices, online socializing and the rise of internet shopping will have a lasting impact on rail travel of all types, leaving privately owned companies like Eurostar and state railways including DeutscheBahn in Germany and SNCF of France, Eurostar’s biggest shareholder, struggling to survive.
The European Union needs the industry to remain viable: It has made rail transport a centerpiece of the European Green Deal, a landmark environmental policy that aims to make Europe the first climate-neutral continent by 2050. The plan includes doubling high-speed rail and freight traffic, and expanding electric-powered trains and tracks to slash carbon emissions.
Eurostar, which employs 3,000 people and has its headquarters in London, has appealed to the British and French governments, citing its role as a low-carbon mode of travel, after the aviation industry and public rail received billions in financial support.
“There is a risk that this iconic service could be left to fail,” Eurostar’s chief executive, Jacques Damas, wrote in an op-ed article.
As an independent train operator, the company isn’t eligible for direct aid in Britain, but it is pressing on other fronts. Eurostar is seeking relief from British business taxes, and especially the steep tolls it pays for using train tracks in Britain, which Lochman said can sometimes cost several hundred euros per mile.
State railways are getting billions in support. SNCF, which faces losses of up to 5 billion euros, with only a fraction of its high-speed TGV trains currently running, received a 4 billion-euro capital injection from the French government last Tuesday. DeutscheBahn’s expected losses of 5.6 billion euros this year will be offset by up to 4 billion euros in rail support from the German government.
Privately held operators that rely on shareholders and customer receipts face higher hurdles. Startup low-cost train companies, including Flixtrain in Germany, have cut service and face financial strain. Leo Express, a competitor in the Czech Republic, filed for bankruptcy in October.
Eurostar is the biggest and most well known of the bunch. Owned by a consortium including SNCF, which holds a 55% stake, as well as investment firms and the National Railway Company of Belgium, it was already bracing for a potential hit to business from Britain’s decision to leave the European Union, which officially takes effect Jan. 1.
Pandemic restrictions have dealt it a swifter blow. After record profit in 2019, when 11 million people crowded onto its trains, Eurostar said it was now “fighting for its survival” after a “total collapse in demand” for international rail travel.
Passenger numbers have plunged 95% since March. Revenue fell by 340 million euros in the first half, down 61% from a year ago. From a peak of running more than 60 trains a day, Eurostar cut service to one daily round-trip between London and Paris, and one on its London-Brussels and Amsterdam routes.
Until this week, Eurostar was temporarily adding more daily trains before the Christmas holidays, with plans to return to a reduced schedule in January.
The suspension of service out of London will depend on whether European governments agree to accept British travelers. “We are waiting further detail from the governments on restrictions beyond this initial 48 hour period,” the company said Monday.
Eurostar recently secured more than 200 million British pounds in financing from its shareholders, but the money is finite. A spokesperson said the outlook for 2021 “continues to be significantly lower passenger numbers and loss of revenue than can sustain our business.”
Unions, which typically fight management, are aligned with Eurostar executives in pushing for government help.
“Until COVID broke, we had a business that was on the up and up,” said Mick Lynch, a representative of the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers, which represents Eurostar’s employees in Britain. “Now, we are looking at 5% of previous revenue and passengers on a good day. No business can operate on that.”
Even after a vaccine is rolled out, Europe’s major rail companies face a precarious transition period. A full turnaround for passenger railway operators is unlikely before 2023 or 2024, and even that will depend on government support, said Maria Leenen, a founder of SCI Verkehr, a Hamburg-based rail industry consultancy.
As the industry maps out a post-pandemic recovery, analysts say it will need to inspire new loyalty in riders, in part by promoting trains as an ecological way to travel as Europe moves toward a greener future.
Companies are also reviewing pricing models that worked fine when business executives and selfie-taking tourists swarmed to Europe’s capitals, but are less viable as a pandemic-induced recession cuts into consumers’ spending power.
With fewer trains, ticket prices have been climbing to sometimes astronomical levels that have sent even environmentally conscious commuters searching for airplane flights that are up to 75% cheaper.
Leduc, an industrial consultant for British and French startups, paid about 400 euros (about $485) for his round-trip ticket, about double the normal fare. He said he paid it because the trip was for business. But as he plans holiday travel back to France with his wife and daughter, he is mulling whether to take easyJet, a discount airline, after realizing that train tickets for his family could cost nearly 1,000 euros.
“If Eurostar prices stay in the stratosphere, I won’t hesitate to start taking the plane, even if it’s more tiring, longer and more polluting,” he said.
Even when quarantines are lifted, people may not use trains as frequently, including lucrative business travelers who thought nothing of hopping on the Eurostar to Paris for a meeting, then returning to dine in Soho that evening. Some riders will have ditched the train for cars. In metropolitan areas, commuters may turn increasingly to bicycles for short-distance travel.
Still, the pandemic is unlikely to wipe out Europe’s love affair with trains. People will probably gravitate back to their old mobility behavior as the pandemic fades, said Leenen of SCI Verkehr.
“But the trains will just be a little less full,” she said.

A Wolf Pup Mummy From the Ancient Arctic

More than 50,000 years ago, a den in sandy soil collapsed on a wolf pup and killed her, sealing her away from air and moisture so the pup’s body mummified in the cold.
She stayed buried in permafrost until four years ago, when the work of global warming and the explorations of a gold miner uncovered her in Canada’s Yukon Territory near Dawson City.
He wanted a precious metal; what he found was paleontological gold.
That mummy is now on display at the Yukon Beringia Interpretive Centre in Yellowknife — body and fur intact, lips shrunken back so her teeth are visible in what looks a bit like a snarl. The puppy is so well preserved that it is easy to tell from visual observation that she is female.
She also has a name, Zhur (meaning wolf), in the language of the Trʼondëk Hwëchʼin people, in whose ancestral land the wolf was buried.
Among fossil animals, Zhur is “basically the best preserved wolf that’s ever been found,” said Julie Meachen, a paleontologist and professor of anatomy at Des Moines University in Iowa, who led a team of specialists in using noninvasive techniques, including DNA, biochemistry and bone structure, to study everything that could be learned about the ancient wolf pup.
She and her colleagues published the results Monday in Current Biology.
Angela Perri, an archaeologist at Durham University in England, who was not involved in the study but has collaborated with Meachen on other projects, said the study of the pup was an example of how scientists have become able in recent years to reach back into deep time and paint a vivid and detailed picture of an individual animal.
The researchers, she said, were able to ask not just “What were Arctic wolves like?” but “What was the life of this wolf?”
The first stroke of luck, Meachen said, was the discovery and the preservation of the pup. Because of climate change, the permafrost in the Yukon is melting, as it is around the world. In Siberia as well, warming has exposed troves of valuable fossils.
The miner who found the mummified pup, Neil Loveless, notified Grant Zazula, a paleontologist with the Yukon territorial government, who contacted Meachen. She and Zazula put together an interdisciplinary team of Canadian and U.S. scientists to study Zhur.
Using a variety of methods, such as carbon dating, DNA studies of the evolutionary age of the fossil, and chemical studies of the oxygen levels in the specimen, they zeroed in on the time Zhur lived, some 56,000 to 57,000 years ago. It was a mild period in an ice age called an interstadial, when temperatures were warm enough for there to be flowing rivers and streams in the area.
By looking at X-rays of the bones and the development of teeth in Zhur, they knew she was between 6 and 7 weeks old at the time of her death. She was in good health and well nourished, and the soil in which the den was dug was sandy, and therefore unstable, so the researchers concluded that she most likely died when the den collapsed. The fate of her probable littermates, mother and the rest of the pack is a mystery.
Studying her DNA showed she was an arctic wolf of the Pleistocene, the same species as today’s gray wolves, but not a direct ancestor. Just as humans came from Eurasia in multiple waves, so did wolves.
Her world was one of large herbivores and other carnivores, many of them gone, such as saber-toothed cats, cave bears and American lions. Wolves of this time did prey on large mammals like caribou, but a look at the chemicals preserved in Zhur’s bones showed that her diet was heavy on creatures from the sea, most likely salmon.
There are wolves today that live on salmon at certain times of the year, when the fish are swimming rivers and streams to spawn.
Once the coronavirus pandemic is over, you can travel to Yellowknife to see Zhur in person.

WASHINGTON — Attorney General William P. Barr said Monday that he saw no reason to appoint special counsels to oversee the Justice Department’s ongoing criminal investigation into Hunter Biden, son of President-elect Joe Biden, or to investigate President Donald Trump’s baseless claims of widespread voter fraud, again undercutting Trump’s efforts to bend the department to his political will and to overturn the results of the election.
At a news conference to announce charges in an unrelated terrorism case, Barr said that he did not “see any reason to appoint a special counsel” to oversee the ongoing investigation into the younger Biden.
“I have no plan to do so before I leave,” Barr said. ”To the extent that there is an investigation, I think that it’s being handled responsibly and professionally.”
He also said that he would name a special counsel to oversee an inquiry into election fraud if he felt one was warranted.
“But I haven’t and I’m not going to,” Barr said.
He added that he saw “no basis” for the federal government to seize voting machines.
Barr’s comments are sure to further poison his relationship with Trump, who has expressed rage that Barr has not done more to help him overturn the results of the November election.
Barr has long been regarded as Trump’s most loyal and effective cabinet member, who on several occasions made decisions that directly benefited Trump and his allies. But his relationship with the president fractured in the wake of the election after he publicly said that he had not seen enough voter fraud to change the election’s outcome and it became clear that he had kept the ongoing investigation in Biden’s son under wraps.

Texto completo: The surge in Black gun-buying is a response to America's failing to create a society where all citizens feel safe.
Growing up in rural northern Louisiana, everyone I knew, at least every household, seemed to have guns. Men had guns racked in the back windows of their pickup trucks, and pistols under their seats. Women, like my mother, tucked smaller handguns into their purses.
My hometown, Gibsland, a flyspeck of a place, was and is majority Black. Gun ownership was the norm in those parts, including in the Black community. It was not associated with danger but with safety. There were many older Black people in the South who could tell stories about a time when they were left to defend themselves against the threat of white terror, a father or an uncle or a brother sitting on a porch with a rifle through the night, should trouble come.
Indeed, one could argue that the right to bear arms in this country has never been so brazenly and openly abridged as it has against Black people. Many state codes prohibited Black gun ownership before the Civil War and allowed for the disarmament of Black people after. Many Black people saw these as attempts to prevent them from defending themselves against terror. Some efforts at gun control, such as those in the 1960s at the height of the Black Power movement, have been seen by historians as explicitly targeted at Black people.
As Adam Winkler reported for The Atlantic in 2011, the Safe Streets Act of 1968 and the Gun Control Act of 1968, "expanded the federal licensing system for gun dealers and clarified which people -- including anyone previously convicted of a felony, the mentally ill, illegal-drug users, and minors -- were not allowed to own firearms." The laws also "restricted importation of 'Saturday Night Specials' -- the small, cheap, poor-quality handguns so named by Detroit police for their association with urban crime, which spiked on weekends."
Mr. Winkler continued, "Because these inexpensive pistols were popular in minority communities, one critic said the new federal gun legislation 'was passed not to control guns but to control blacks."'
Folks in my hometown, including single mothers like mine, also drove pieced-together, secondhand and thirdhand cars, sometimes at night, to larger, neighboring towns to shop for groceries or other needs. More often than one would like to believe, those cars broke down on a lonely stretch of pitch-black road, and people would have to walk to the nearest light, a friendly-seeming stranger's home or a small roadside store, sometimes with children in tow, to look for help.
Particularly in the days I grew up, there was no roadside assistance on call, no cellphones and, in our town, there was only one police officer. Being armed was often the only way that people could feel safe.
Beyond safety though, guns were and are seen as a tool in these agrarian regions: rifles used for hunting, to slaughter livestock or to keep vermin out of the garden and snakes out of the grass.
Children, particularly boys, were trained to use guns from the time there were toddlers, graduating from cap guns, to BB guns, to pellet guns, to small rifles. It was nothing at all unusual to see a pack of boys walking the streets with their weapons, on their way to target shoot at cans or some such.
When I went away to college, my mother gave me a pistol, "just in case." (Luckily, no such case presented itself.)
When I moved north, first to Detroit and then to New York, I moved into a mental space of more stringent gun control. In general, people weren't hunting. There was law enforcement everywhere, reachable as quickly as one could dial 911. There were cellphones.
Armed crimes were rampant as well as shootings and gun-related homicides. There were mass shootings and drive-by shootings, all phenomena foreign to me. In my mind, city dwellers simply didn't have the same need for weapons as the people in the rural community where I was raised, and many were also not reared with the respect for and knowledge of weapons we possessed.
I, like many, were convinced that fewer guns in the Black community would make it safer. But, for many Black people, that sentiment has turned. Since the gun-buying surge in the wake of the Obama presidency, the unrelenting series of unarmed Black people being killed on video and the uncertainty brought on by the pandemic, gun sales to Black people are surging. According to an October CNN report, gun sales among Black Americans were up 58 percent through September.
I, as much as anyone, would like to live in a society in which all citizens felt safe without the need of personal firearms. America could have created such a society. However, it chose not to.
Sure, there are still hunters and farmers and people living in rural areas who use rifles as a tool. There are people who use guns for sport or who collect them. But, there are also people who buy and hoard guns because they have been fed a dystopian fantasy of a race war or a government takeover.
It seems to me that the surge in Black gun-buying is in large part simply a response to that. As has been the case since slavery, many Black people feel the need to defend themselves from their own country.

My Regrets Working For Trump

Texto completo: No matter our intentions, lawyers like me were complicit. We owe the country our honesty about what we saw -- and should do in the future.
I was an attorney at the Justice Department when Donald Trump was elected president. I worked in the Office of Legal Counsel, which is where presidents turn for permission slips that say their executive orders and other contemplated actions are lawful. I joined the department during the Obama administration, as a career attorney whose work was supposed to be independent of politics.
I never harbored delusions about a Trump presidency. Mr. Trump readily volunteered that his agenda was to disassemble our democracy, but I made a choice to stay at the Justice Department -- home to some of the country's finest lawyers -- for as long as I could bear it. I believed that I could better serve our country by pushing back from within than by keeping my hands clean. But I have come to reconsider that decision.
My job was to tailor the administration's executive actions to make them lawful -- in narrowing them, I could also make them less destructive. I remained committed to trying to uphold my oath even as the president refused to uphold his.
But there was a trade-off: We attorneys diminished the immediate harmful impacts of President Trump's executive orders -- but we also made them more palatable to the courts.
This burst into public view early in the Trump administration in the litigation over the executive order banning travel from several predominantly Muslim countries, which my office approved. The first Muslim ban was rushed out the door. It was sweeping and sloppy; the courts quickly put a halt to it. The successive discriminatory bans benefited from more time and attention from the department's lawyers, who narrowed them but also made them more technocratic and therefore harder for the courts to block.
After the Supreme Court's June 2018 decision upholding the third Muslim ban, I reviewed my own portfolio -- which included matters targeting noncitizens, dismantling the Civil Service and camouflaging the president's corruption -- overcome with fear that I was doing more harm than good. By Thanksgiving of that year, I had left my job.
Still, I felt I was abandoning the ship. I continued to believe that a critical mass of responsible attorneys staying in government might provide a last line of defense against the administration's worst instincts. Even after I left, I advised others that they could do good by staying. News reports about meaningful pushback by Justice Department attorneys seemed to confirm this thinking.
I was wrong.
Watching the Trump campaign's attacks on the election results, I now see what might have happened if, rather than nip and tuck the Trump agenda, responsible Justice Department attorneys had collectively -- ethically, lawfully -- refused to participate in President Trump's systematic attacks on our democracy from the beginning. The attacks would have failed.
Unlike the Trump Justice Department, the Trump campaign has relied on second-rate lawyers who lack the skills to maintain the president's charade. After a recent oral argument from Rudy Giuliani, Judge Matthew Brann (a Republican) wrote that the campaign had offered "strained legal arguments without merit and speculative accusations, unpled in the operative complaint and unsupported by evidence." Even judges appointed by Mr. Trump have refused to throw their lots in with lawyers who can't master the basic mechanics of lawyering.
After four years of bulldozing through one institution after another on the backs of skilled lawyers, the Trump agenda hit a brick wall.
The story of the Trump campaign's attack on our elections could have been the story of the Trump administration's four-year-long attack on our institutions. If, early on, the Justice Department lawyers charged with selling the administration's lies had emptied the ranks -- withholding our talents and reputations and demanding the same of our professional peers -- the work of defending President Trump's policies would have been left to the types of attorneys now representing his campaign. Lawyers like Mr. Giuliani would have had to defend the Muslim ban in court.
Had that happened, judges would have likely dismantled the Trump facade from the beginning, stopping the momentum of his ugliest and most destructive efforts and bringing much-needed accountability early in his presidency.
Before the 2020 election, I was haunted by what I didn't do. By all the ways I failed to push back enough. Now, after the 2020 election, I'm haunted by what I did. The trade-off wasn't worth it.
In giving voice to those trying to destroy the rule of law and dignifying their efforts with our talents and even our basic competence, we enabled that destruction. Were we doing enough good elsewhere to counterbalance the harm we facilitated, the way a public health official might accommodate the president on the margins to push forward on vaccine development? No.
No matter our intentions, we were complicit. We collectively perpetuated an anti-democratic leader by conforming to his assault on reality. We may have been victims of the system, but we were also its instruments. No matter how much any one of us pushed back from within, we did so as members of a professional class of government lawyers who enabled an assault on our democracy -- an assault that nearly ended it.
We owe the country our honesty about that and about what we saw. We owe apologies. I offer mine here.
And we owe our best efforts to restore our democracy and to share what we learned to help mobilize and enact reforms -- to remind future government lawyers that when asked to undermine our democracy, the right course is to refuse and hold your peers to the same standard.
To lead by example, and do everything in our power to ensure this never happens again. If we don't, it will.

These Games Helped Us Keep a Grip

Texto completo: These are not necessarily the best games or the newest games. But these are the games that people across The New York Times played for hundreds of hours this year.
I've spent the last few months doing almost exactly what I was doing 20 years ago: suspended in deep space, riding undulating rainbow roads in Mario Kart. Now, I play on my Switch. Then, on my Nintendo 64. Maybe you were new to video games in 2020, each day of social distancing nudging you closer to an alternate reality. (You wouldn't be alone; the industry saw record spending and profits this year.) Or maybe you've been playing since you developed the motor skills to grip a controller. In any case, what matters is that video games provided a much-needed outlet in a bizarre time.
Here are the games that 20 of my New York Times colleagues played the most this year, and why.
Age of Empires
Kellen Browning, technology reporter
When the pandemic forced me back home during my final semester of college, I found one great way to pass the time: Age of Empires, a real-time strategy game first released in 1997, where players race their ancient civilizations through different eras of history, building vibrant economies and discovering advanced militaries as they try to conquer their opponents.
When I was a kid, only one person in my friend group owned the game -- stored on a golden CD-ROM. To our delight, a revamped version called Age of Empires: Definitive Edition was released on the game service Steam in 2018. But we never had the time to play until this year. Now, even though we have since graduated and started our careers, we play several times a week, chatting all the while on Discord.
The Elder Scrolls: Blades
Emily Wilson, intelligence collections manager
Blades is not Skyrim, but it scratches the Skyrim itch. It's a game that suits the pandemic attention span: a quick reprieve between meetings, a distraction while the governor announces new restrictions, a balm in weeklong election-news cycles.
I first played Blades, released in 2019, on iOS in March -- while job hunting, with suddenly higher stakes -- before joining the rush to buy a Nintendo Switch. As summer came, I found myself with a new job, a dog and less time for Skyrim's fully immersive world. Blades, also available on Switch, bridges that gap. Players have a scorched town to repair and weaving quest lines, and they can engage in lighter forms of blacksmithing and alchemy. Familiar villains abound. Seasonal updates and events keep time moving, even when the rest of the world seems to stand still.
Hades
Kyle Buchanan, culture columnist, The Projectionist
When you die in Hades -- and you'll die a lot -- a banner appears, stating, "There is no escape." It is, to be sure, a real 2020 vibe.
But every time the hero, Zagreus, is zipped back to his starting point in the underworld and must once again fight his way out to reach Mount Olympus, the game offers you another opportunity to chat with some of the witty Greek gods, or even to woo one. When the wise warrior Achilles counseled Zagreus on his budding relationship with a hunky deity of death, it thrilled me even more than all the monster-slaying. At least one of us could know romance this year!
Animal Crossing: New Horizons
Crystal Arroyo, senior staff editor, News Technology
Animal Crossing: New Horizons was released on March 20, just in time to become my lifeline in the pandemic. In the game, you're a human villager who lives on an island with anthropomorphic animals. While in reality I was stuck in my New York City apartment, I was also "out" -- fishing, catching bugs, finding dinosaur bones and relaxing by the sea. My island is very much a representation of me: a mix of "Murder, She Wrote," "Nightmare on Elm Street," "Friday the 13th" and a variety of other horror films.
I used the game to reconnect with old friends and throw virtual parties and treasure hunts -- talking to them more than I had in months or even years. Their islands even stoked a competitive streak in me. Many of my friends have moved on, but I still play every day because it's become the home that makes me feel like I'm not stuck at home.
Genshin Impact
Tracy Ma, visual editor, Styles desk
Since its release in September, I look forward nightly to a little Genshin Impact -- as a treat. It's a free-to-play role-playing game about beating baddies in order to level up, and leveling up in order to beat badder baddies.
Opposite to leveling up in real life, which is a yearslong process consisting mostly of unanswered emails and writing self-evaluations, leveling up in Genshin is direct and exhilarating. Even the slightest exertion opens up a stream of neurotransmitters in the form of virtual loot boxes, or "gachas."
It might be a copycat version of one of my favorite games, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, shoved into a pachinko machine, but in a year when the best thing to have happened to you is "not much," its surefire repetitions have been a welcome pacifier.
The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild
Jamie Stockwell, deputy editor, National desk
In a year in which we've reached for old comforts, I turned to Link, the hero of Legend of Zelda and among my best friends since 1986. In The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild -- 2017's immersive open-world breakout hit for the Nintendo Switch -- Link wakes from a 100-year slumber to find the Kingdom of Hyrule war-torn and ruled by savage beasts. Like in other Zelda adventures, Link is the key to restoring peace.
While this game can be beaten in a few hours, the more time you spend exploring Hyrule, the more secrets it reveals. Since early summer, I've spent more than 230 hours there. Hyrule is a world where good triumphs over evil, where in the end, all is calm, and in 2020, it's a world I have needed.
Persona 5 Royal
Brian X. Chen, technology columnist, Tech Fix
When I went on "vacation" recently, I dove into Persona 5 Royal, the Japanese role-playing game that is notorious for its length. For 130 hours, I took a break from endless house chores to role play as a high schooler who, with the help of friends and a talking cat, infiltrates the minds of bad guys to change their hearts.
Set in Tokyo, the game is a love letter to some of the best works of pop culture from West to East, including blockbusters like "Inception" and "The Matrix" and manga like "Sailor Moon" and "Death Note." Above all, the game celebrates the power of our relationships with the people (and pets) we love. What else could we need this lonely year?
Warplanes: WW2 Dogfight
J.D. Biersdorfer, production editor, Book Review
When I've needed a break from the present this year, I travel to the past with Warplanes: WW2 Dogfight to fly a Spitfire for the Royal Air Force and take out any Luftwaffe planes I see in the virtual sky. It's really cathartic to fire away and level up.
In the game, released in 2018, you can collect and fly different planes, and fight for other countries. I have the $ 5 iPad "full" version, which uses the tablet's accelerometer for physical steering. I think of it as my "blasting Nazis" app and a welcome diversion -- and also a reminder of a time when there was a sense of national unity around overcoming great odds in the good vs. evil conflict.
The Walking Dead: The Telltale Definitive Series
Lance Booth, photo editor
The theme of The Walking Dead: The Telltale Definitive Series seems to be that every choice you make is wrong. The plot, based in the same universe as the popular comic and television show, follows a young girl named Clementine (and a diverse set of other characters) through the apocalypse. The episodic game is closer to an interactive narrative, where you pick dialogue in a limited time and make lasting choices that affect the story.
The writing leads to decisions and conflicts that seem to mimic real life in 2020: a radio broadcast in the game states that the affliction was spreading unchecked, that the death toll was skyrocketing and that avoiding contact with exposed individuals was vital. During an actual pandemic, this story line hit differently. I couldn't help but reflect.
Call of Duty: Warzone
Jason M. Bailey, senior staff editor, National desk
The annual Call of Duty games are known for frenetic multiplayer action, and the rapid pace -- spawn, kill, kill, die, spawn, die, spawn -- is addictive, but ultimately mindless. That's what made the March release of Call of Duty: Warzone, a free, stand-alone battle royale, so refreshing. Warzone includes the guns, grenades and vehicles one would expect, but it also has a secret weapon: a narrative arc. Firefights are followed by long periods of restocking your arsenal and resituating your squad. In quieter moments, you can hear doors creak.
Rust
Leslie Pedro, software engineer
Since the lockdown started, I have been drawn back to open-world survival games, spending the most time playing Rust. It's pretty punishing and not for everyone. You start off naked and alone with a rock and a torch for tools. From there, you have to keep foraging, gathering resources and protecting what you have amassed from other players. I like to play solo, which leaves me vulnerable to larger teams who break into my mazelike bases and try to steal my loot despite my traps and turrets. I don't really care if I lose what I have gathered. I just enjoy building, defending and exploring.
Fallout 4
Gregory Schmidt, senior staff editor, Business desk
When I first tried playing Fallout 4, I found the post-apocalyptic wasteland formerly known as the Commonwealth of Massachusetts too vast, the settlement-building too tedious and the side missions too grind-y. But in the pandemic, I learned to love the grind.
It turns out that the wasteland had dozens of rickety towers and underground lairs with hidden loot waiting to be discovered. I spent hours on the treasure hunts, fighting beasts, avoiding traps and grabbing every item I could carry. In between dungeon crawls, I formed settlements, darting around to meet their endless needs for food, water, shelter and security. The pandemic gave me time to explore this dangerous and exciting world. Seven months later, I'm still grinding.
Stardew Valley
Hannah Masuga, senior manager, Data Platforms
Early in stay-at-home orders, I convinced a group chat of friends with different levels of gaming backgrounds to play Stardew Valley. I hadn't gamed much since high school, but knew enough to teach newbies how to join a private multiplayer game and install a mod -- lifting the limit on cabins so all eight of us could play together.
Everything was sublimely mundane: simple tasks, pleasant ambient music and unhurried group chatter. We ended up with a farm that was mostly chaotic patches of crops and dirt. It was purposeless and all problems could be fixed by agreeing to fall asleep.
Rocket League
Brian Hoerst, senior staff editor, News Technology
Rocket League has been with us for five years but somehow the rocket-powered car-soccer gameplay feels as fresh as the day it arrived. And in a year that begged for joy, Rocket League took on a higher purpose as a meeting ground for normalcy with my friends and family. The unthinkable aerial goals and risky backward passes were still happening onscreen, but the conversations faded from gameplay or strategy to my brother's college aspirations or a best friend's new puppy stories. It made those moments a balance of escapism and real-world happiness, far away from test results or lockdown rules. Plus, Rocket League's evolving toolbox of flashy cosmetics provided a splash of color to an otherwise drab year.
Jump Rope Challenge
Stephen Totilo, contributing writer
It's easy to argue that Hades, an excellent game about repeatedly trying to escape hell, is the definitive game of 2020. It certainly is the one I most enjoyed. But consider the only-in-2020 oddity that was Jump Rope Challenge. The simple, free exercise game was released by Nintendo in mid-June -- made by Nintendo developers who were stuck working at home. The game runs on the Nintendo Switch and emulates the physicality of jumping rope by letting players detach the system's two controllers and then hold them while jumping, counting each skip of an imaginary rope. That's all it does, but that's enough to make another day at home a little less frustrating.
Celeste
Mel Cone, software engineer
For those who have struggled with their mental health, Celeste is a platform game with a story that will resonate. The game follows Madeline on her quest to climb a mountain, but this isn't a normal mountain. Anyone who climbs it is forced to face their inner demons, literally. Madeline suffers from panic attacks and depression, and as she climbs, she learns to accept these issues instead of pushing them away. Minor spoiler -- Celeste's descriptions of anxiety and depression are among the best I've ever heard: "I'm at the bottom of the ocean. I can't see anything in any direction. It's claustrophobic, yet I feel exposed."
Hollow Knight
MJ Franklin, staff editor, Book Review
Hollow Knight, the grim, insect-themed 2017 platform game, was the perfect match for my 2020 mood. You play as a lone knight armed with a "nail" who falls into Hallownest, a once-vibrant kingdom that now lies in ruin. The game is gloomy -- at one point, you explore an area called "The Abyss," and doesn't that sound like a metaphor for this year?
And yet, even with its dark tones, Hollow Knight is downright fun. The gameplay is equal parts stylish, challenging and rewarding. Also, its world and lore are expansive and immersive. I spent hours lost, sometimes literally, in the caverns of Hallownest. Then, just when I thought I was nearing the end of the game, the already huge world of Hollow Knight opened up even more. Now I'm eagerly awaiting the sequel, Hollow Knight: Silksong.
The Sims 4
Ashley Riccardi, senior software engineer, Games
The Sims offers a way to "live" different lives virtually -- one without masks or travel restrictions. There are no story modes to follow and no monsters to conquer (unless you get the right expansion pack). It is simply what you make of it.
Some days, I want the challenge of juggling multiple ambitious Sims' careers (most recently an aspiring politician and a civil engineer), and other times, I want to waste the day away, tanning on a beach and sailing by the beautiful island of Sulani.
The Sims will meet you where you are, wherever that is. I'll let you guess how I played.
The Last of Us Part II
Renan Borelli, editor, Newsroom Development
Amid its post-apocalyptic setting and hordes of zombies, The Last of Us, released in 2013, manages to create profound, human moments that help make it a modern classic. Its sequel, The Last of Us Part II, is polarizing -- not because the game is bad, but because of its narrative choices. It takes beloved characters from the first game and turns them into unhinged villains and coldblooded murderers; you watch helplessly as they betray one another and make mistake after mistake.
There's no happy ending. The game ends with the protagonists broken and emotionally exhausted, which mirrored how I felt after finishing it. And yet, I played through this bleak, very long game twice. Call me a masochist. It's that good.
Assassin's Creed: Valhalla
Mike Isaac, technology correspondent
Over the past two weeks, I've logged more than 100 hours playing Assassin's Creed: Valhalla. I still couldn't tell you whether or not I like the game -- partly because Valhalla comes riddled with annoying glitches. It's an industrywide issue: studios pushing out splashy and expensive titles with a litany of imperfections. The gaming audience becomes the de facto beta-testing group.
Another reason is what feels like the rote repetition required of open-world games like Valhalla. They're designed to present a vast landscape to explore, but more often we find ourselves stuck carrying out similar tasks, over and over.
The game isn't a total snooze-fest. The viking theme is a welcome backdrop, and exploring as a female character in a Nordic, male-dominated digital universe is fun. Still, I've fallen into the completionist trap -- needing to collect every tattoo design, open every chest, find every weapon. It's the kind of box-checking mentality that designers build to keep players returning.
Get back to me in another hundred hours when I've conquered the game. Perhaps by then I'll be able to tell you if I liked it.

Texto completo: The state's latest travel restrictions make most hotel or short term lodging illegal. But Airbnb and Vrbo, the biggest home-sharing companies, are sticking to no-refund policies.
Travel and travel planning are being disrupted by the worldwide spread of the coronavirus. For the latest updates, read The New York Times's Covid-19 coverage here .
California's new travel restrictions, put in place to help prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed by the pandemic, have thrown vacation planning into reverse as travelers start canceling their lodging reservations. From now until at least Dec. 31, it is illegal for all hotel and short-term rental lodging owners in California to make or honor reservations for people coming from out of state unless they plan to quarantine in place for 14 days or are coming for essential purposes like health care, or infrastructure work. In much of the state, restrictions are even tighter, with only essential travel allowed.
There's a big split when it comes to cancellation and refund policies, though. Hotel chains by and large are accommodating travelers with full refunds. Many small hotels are doing the same. But some large home-sharing companies, like Airbnb and Vrbo, are telling guests that there is no guarantee they'll get their money back.
[Sign up for California Today , our daily newsletter from the Golden State.]
Every aspect of the travel industry has taken a significant hit during the pandemic, but home-sharing companies have had an advantage over hotels -- they are perceived as safer. It's easier to practice social distancing when you have your own entrance and kitchen, and are away from other guests. Short-term rentals have been regarded as a pandemic getaway for those who are working or learning remotely and can still afford a trip.
Airbnb, whose recent I.P.O. garnered the co-founder and chief executive, Brian Chesky, around $ 11 billion based on the company's overall valuation, has one of the strictest lodging cancellation policies. While it granted refunds at the very start of the pandemic and then partially reimbursed hosts, since mid-March, the company has taken the stance that guests understand that travel may be disrupted by the pandemic, and has been using pre-pandemic rules that allow hosts to choose from one of three standard cancellation policies. Payment pages include information about the cancellation rules. Airbnb does have an "Extenuating Circumstances policy" but explicitly states it does not apply to reservations made after March 14 for Covid-related circumstances other than actual sickness. Individual hosts may agree to full or partial refunds.
Vrbo, a vacation rental company owned by Expedia, follows policies similar to Airbnb. Its coronavirus resources page advises travelers to "Review the property's cancellation policies. They apply even if your reservation is affected by COVID-19." In the same vein, VRBO's "Book With Confidence Guarantee" explanation on its website specifies that the guarantee was designed to protect guests "from fraudulent listings and property misrepresentation. It does not cover cancellations due to unforeseeable circumstances, such as COVID-19." Customers who purchased travel insurance may be able to request a voucher for future dates.
In essence, travelers could bear 100 percent of the financial impact of any local shutdown when booking with the companies.
Vrbo said in an email that it does not plan on changing its policies and that "travelers should work directly with the host on an alternative that works for both parties, such as rebooking the trip or a travel credit that can be used at a later date." Hosts are not required to offer those alternatives.
Airbnb said in an email that "Our extenuating circumstances policy is intended to protect guests and hosts from unforeseen circumstances that arise after booking," and that after the declaration of a global pandemic in March, "Covid-19 and its consequences were no longer unexpected, including the risk of continued or new travel and movement restrictions." It noted that hosts choose a level of flexibility when they offer their homes for rent and that renters are informed of the policy when they make a reservation.
Those policies aren't sitting well with guests like A.J. Sheffield, a software engineer in Silicon Valley, who booked an Airbnb in Southern California with his girlfriend and children for December. When the Stay At Home order was declared and he requested a refund from Airbnb, the company cited its rule and the refund was denied. "I understand they created the policy based on previous lockdowns, but this is more severe," said Mr. Sheffield, referring to the fact that Airbnb home rentals were able to stay open in earlier shutdowns. Under current rules, hosts are breaking the law by continuing to rent for nonessential travel.
"Should we just take the hit with every new situation?" he asked. "Should we just never book with them again until we can be assured the government won't surprise us with any new restrictions?"
The major hotel chains, in contrast, have tried to accommodate guests financially as the pandemic has unfolded. Hyatt hotels in California are proactively notifying guests of the new California travel restrictions before they arrive, according to the company. The more flexible cancellation policy the company put in place at the beginning of the pandemic remains in place. Hilton hotels will notify affected guests by email and cancel reservations from out-of-state guests with full refunds, according to the company. Marriott recently extended its cancellation policy through the end of March 2021. IHG continues to extend the dates for guests who had non-refundable pre-paid bookings to be able to cancel without penalty.
Some smaller hotels are also trying to accommodate travelers' changing plans. Patty Baird owns the Cedar House Sport Hotel in Truckee, near two major ski resorts and in an area which is now limited to essential travelers. Predicting there would be travel disruptions, Ms. Baird has been taking reservations without requiring deposits since the late spring, so there is no negative financial impact to guests who cancel or reschedule. Much of her clientele returns year after year, she said. "We would never charge them if they couldn't come," she said. Those who do come are asked to sign a statement saying they are there for essential travel.
Ms. Baird is reaching out to people with reservations, but some are trying to game the system, she said. "If you are an essential worker taking a few days' vacation, that is not considered essential travel," she said. As a small hotel owner, she said she wishes the government would supply some financial assistance to make up for the closures which run through at least the end of the year. "This is our busiest time of year," she said.
Travelers are getting the message to stop coming, though. California hotels and vacation rentals had 47 percent fewer reservations made in the first week of December in 2020 compared to the same week in 2019, according to Transparent, a firm which analyzes vacation rental information for 35 million listings worldwide.

Resumen: Lawmakers struck a nearly $900 billion COVID-19 stimulus deal Sunday that would deliver badly needed aid to millions. Here's what is in the package.

Texto completo: Lawmakers struck a roughly $900 billion COVID-19 stimulus deal that includes another round of stimulus checks and badly needed jobless benefits for struggling Americans, ending a long standoff in Washington with one of the biggest rescue bills in U.S. history.
After months of impasse, negotiations came down to the wire as 12 million people are set to lose unemployment benefits the day after Christmas. The deal includes restarting a $300 boost to the federal unemployment insurance benefit, extending eviction moratoriums for renters by a month and a $600 direct payment to most Americans, according to the 5,600 page text of the bill.
Even though lawmakers reached a deal, some jobless Americans could see their unemployment benefits lapse because outdated state systems could slow down the distribution of aid, experts say.
Toilet paper troubles: Americans are hoarding TP again, and it could cost them
Americans still face lapse in aid: Unemployment benefits could be delayed for millions even with COVID-19 relief package
The measure will help Americans in the near term, but it stops short of mitigating the economic fallout that households have endured during the pandemic, some economists and unemployment experts say. The final bill provides five fewer weeks of unemployment benefits than the compromise reached by a bipartisan group of senators earlier this month.
The measure was tied to a $1.4 trillion spending bill to fund federal agencies and programs through Sept. 30, the end of the fiscal year.
The Senate resoundingly passed the package late Monday, sending the bill to Trump to sign.
Here's what is in the stimulus package:
Will I get another stimulus check?
The measure contains a $600 direct payment to Americans who earned up to $75,000 in 2019. That is less than the $1,200 checks approved in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act in March.
It provides $600 per child, up from $500 in the spring. The bill also includes $1,200 for couples making up to $150,000 a year.
The size of the benefit would be reduced for those earning more than $75,000, or $150,000 per married couple, similar to the last round of stimulus checks.
Worried about another recession? Here's what the stock market is predicting for 2021
The amount will decrease by $5 for every $100 of income above those thresholds, phasing out entirely at $87,000 for individuals and $174,000 for couples.
There is no cap on the number of children a household can claim, so a family of four would receive up to $2,400.
When will stimulus checks be sent?
The government will begin to send out direct payments to millions of Americans next week, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Monday.
“People are going to see this money the beginning of next week,” Mnuchin said in a CNBC interview. "This is a very, very fast way of getting money into the economy. People go out and spend this money, and that helps small businesses. And that helps getting more people back to work."
Mnuchin said the government would begin sending the money out via direct deposit next week. In the spring, physical checks were mailed to Americans who didn't have a bank account or for those the federal government didn't have direct deposit information.
Stimulus checks: Most Americans to receive $600 coronavirus relief checks starting next week
Are immigrant families eligible for checks?
Mixed-status households, or those where a family member doesn’t have a Social Security number, will be eligible for stimulus payments, a key change from the CARES Act.
Those without Social Security numbers, typically unauthorized immigrants, still aren’t eligible. But it would allow U.S. citizens who are married to foreign nationals without Social Security numbers to receive the aid.
Are unemployment benefits extended?
The bill would extend all pandemic unemployment programs set to expire at the end of December by 11 weeks through mid-March, less than the 16 weeks that a bipartisan plan had called for earlier this month.
The deal came as two unemployment programs were set to end on Dec. 26: the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program, which provides aid to self-employed, temporary workers and gig workers; and the Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation program, which provides an additional 13 weeks of benefits beyond the typical 26 weeks that states provide to jobless workers.
'It's a big scary mess': 12 million Americans to lose jobless aid after Christmas if Congress fails to act
Are there enhanced unemployment benefits?
The measure would provide a federal unemployment benefit of $300 a week for up to 11 weeks through mid-March, less than the $600 provided under the CARES Act.
Is the extra $300 retroactive?
No, the federal supplement isn't retroactive.
Why will some workers get an extra $100 on top of the $300 bonus?
The bill also would give an additional federal benefit of $100 a week to those who earned at least $5,000 a year in self-employment income but are disqualified from receiving a more generous Pandemic Unemployment Assistance benefit because they are eligible for state jobless aid, according to The New York Times.
Some workers who have both wage (W-2) and self-employment (1099) income will be eligible for an additional $100 a week if their state offers it. It’s unclear how states will determine eligibility for recipients. The bonus would be on top of the $300-per-week supplement and would last until mid-March.
Many independent contractors and self-employed workers may have been receiving smaller unemployment checks, experts say, since their payments were based on wages from their W-2 tax forms that didn't include their self-employment income, which could be higher.
Is paid sick leave included?
The agreement provides a tax credit to support employers offering paid sick leave, based on the framework of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, enacted in March, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement.
Families First required many employers to provide workers with two weeks of sick leave related to COVID-19 at full pay, and up to 12 weeks of family and medical leave to care for family members at two-thirds pay.
As many as 87 million workers could lose access to emergency paid leave at the end of the month. If those benefits aren't extended, it would limit workers' ability to stay home to quarantine after COVID-19 exposure, or care for a child whose school or day care is closed.
It’s unclear whether the measure would still require companies to offer paid sick leave to workers who have COVID-19, or those caring for children after school closures.
Are eviction moratoriums extended?
Yes. It would offer $25 billion in emergency rental assistance and provide an extension of eviction moratoriums by one month through Jan. 31.
The loss in jobless aid and other stimulus relief would have put 30 to 40 million people at risk of eviction as moratoriums were set to expire in January, according to the Aspen Institute, a think tank.
Will student loan forbearance continue?
The bill doesn't extend a freeze on payments and interest for federal student loan borrowers, which will affect millions of borrowers who face resuming payments as early as February.
In March, the CARES Act gave 42 million borrowers relief during the pandemic.
Earlier this month, Trump paused federal student loan payments for another month through Jan. 31.
What else is in the package?
The package includes an extension of the small business Paycheck Protection Program, which expanded eligibility to local newspapers, broadcasters and nonprofits. It will direct another $20 billion to small business grants and $15 billion to live event venues.
The measure increased funding for vaccine distribution and coronavirus testing.
It also provided $13 billion in increased benefits for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.

Trump's future: Tons of cash, plenty of options to spend it

Texto completo: Donald J. Trump will exit the White House as a private citizen next month perched atop a pile of campaign cash unheard-of for an outgoing president, and with few legal limits on how he can spend it.
Deflated by a loss he has yet to acknowledge, Trump has cushioned the blow by coaxing huge sums of money from his loyal supporters - often under dubious pretenses - raising roughly $250 million since Election Day along with the national party.
More than $60 million of that sum has gone to a new political action committee, according to people familiar with the matter, which Trump will control after he leaves office. Those funds, which far exceed what previous outgoing presidents had at their disposal, provide him with tremendous flexibility for his post-presidential ambitions: He could use the money to quell rebel factions within the party, reward loyalists, fund his travels and rallies, hire staff, pay legal bills and even lay the groundwork for a far-from-certain 2024 run.
The posvelection blitz of fundraising has cemented Trump's position as an unrivaled force and the preeminent fundraiser of the Republican Party, even in defeat. His largest single day for online donations actually came after Election Day - raising almost $750,000 per hour Nov. 6. So did his second-biggest day. And his third.
"Right now, he is the Republican Party," said John McLaughlin, a Republican pollster who worked on Trump's reelection campaign. "The party knows that virtually every dallar they've raised in the last four years, it's because of Donald Trump."
Trump has long acted with few inhibitions when it comes to spending other people's money, and he has spent millions of campaign dollars on his own family businesses in the last five years. But new records show an even more intr.cate intermingling of Trump's political and familial interests than was previously known.
Lara Trump, Trump's daughter-in-law and a senior campaign adviser, served on the board - and was named on drafts of the incorporation papers - of a limited liability company through which the Trump political operation spent more than $700 million since 2019, according to documents reviewed by The New York Times.
The arrangement has never been disclosed. One of the other board members and signatories in the draft papers of the LLC, American Made Media Consultants, was John Pence, the nephew of Vice President Mike Pence and a senior Trump adviser. The LLC has been criticized for purposefully obscuring the ultimate destination of hundreds of millions of dollars of spending.
Lara Trump and John Pence were originally listed as president and vice president on the incorporation papers, documents reviewed by the Times showed. Sean Dollman, the campaign chief financial officer, was the AMMC treasurer.
"Lara Trump and John Pence resigned from the AMMC board in October 2019 to focus solely on their campaign activities; however, there was never any ethical or legal reason why they could not serve on the board in the first place," said Tim Murtaugh, a spokesperson for Trump. "John and Lara were not compensated by AMMC for their service as board members." Murtaugh also said the two were not compensated for other positions they were listed as holding.
For Trump, the quarter-billion dollars he and the party raised over six weeks is enough to pay off all of his remaining campaign bills and to fund his fruitless legal challenges and still leave tens of millions of dollars.
Trump's plans, however, remain extremely fluid. His refusal to accept Joe Biden's victory has stunted internal political planning, aides say, with some advisers in his shrinking circle of confidants hesitant to even approach him about setting a course of action for 2021 and beyond.
Those who have spoken with Trump say he appears shrunken, and over his job; this detachment is reflected in a Twitter feed that remains stubbornly more focused on unfounded allegations of fraud than on the death toll from the raging pandemic.
Trump has talked about running again in 2024 - but he also may not. He has created this new PAC, but a different political entity could still be in the works, people involved in the discussions said. Talk of counterprogramming Biden's inauguration with a splashy event or an announcement of his own is currently on hold.
The Trump political apparatus has taken advantage of the grassroots energy and excitement over the two Senate runoffs in Georgia to juice its own fundraising. Email and text solicitations have pitched Trump supporters to give to a "Georgia Election Fund," even though no funds go directly to either Republican senator on the ballot, irritating some Senate GOP strategists.
Instead, the fine print shows 75% of the donations to the Georgia fund go to Trump's new PAC, called Save America, with 25% to the Republican National Committee.

Texto completo: While your travel plans may be on hold, you can pretend you're somewhere new for the night. Around the World at Home invites you to channel the spirit of a new place each week with recommendations on how to explore the culture, all from the comfort of your home.
There is a bar in the Senegalese capital of Dakar that you can only find if someone has pointed the way. It sits on a thin strip of beach, with a wide view of the Atlantic Ocean and the young surfers who chase waves as the sun sets in the distance. It sits below the Mamelles Lighthouse, which offers tours during the day and turns into a nightclub after dark. None of the furniture in the open-air bar matches. The five-minute walk to the cove, down a thin dirt path that snakes from a chaotic intersection - horse-drawn carts and shiny SUVs competing for space on packed roads - feels like passing through a portal between worlds.
Dakar has an aura that seeps into your soul. The sensations - the smell of grilled fish and spiced coffee, the feeling of an impending downpour, the bone-rattling vibrations from a dozen drums - stay with you long after you leave. When I visited this West African city, as part of my journey around the world as the 52 Places Traveler, I often caught myself thinking of my future. As I walked through markets that seemingly went on forever or sat on the deck of a ferry as it floated away from the mainland to one of the outlying islands, I thought, "I could live here." And while it is impossible to fully experience without making the trip, there are ways to capture at least a sliver of the magic.
Tour the sounds of the city
In between the rumble of traffic and the shouts of street vendors, there is always music in Dakar. It blares from cellphones, transistor radios and nightclubs. Shows start at midnight and last until sunrise. On a single day in the city, you will hear politically charged hip-hop; the dizzying pulse of mbalax, a dance music that combines traditional percussion with global influences; the vintage sounds of Cuban rumba put through a West African blender; and much more.
To get a sampling of the city's musical diversity tune into an episode or two of Afropop Worldwide, the radio program and podcast from Public Radio International. Or, if you are looking to skip the history lesson and just fill your home with the sounds of the city, check out my "Sounds of Dakar" playlist on Spotify.com, covering everything from the songs of national hero Youssou N'Dour to the rapid-fire raps of Sister Fa.
Get moving
Unsurprisingly, considering the integral role of music in Dakar's daily rhythms, it is hard to spend any time in Dakar without coming across some of the many dance styles of the region. From modern mbalax blaring out of nightclubs to sabar, named for the rattling drums that propel dancers to acrobatic frenzies, there are countless reasons to jump to your feet - and you can do it from home.
A number of dance studios around the world have turned to virtual classes, because of the coronavirus pandemic. For starters, check out the Alvin Alley Extension School, which offers regular online West African dance classes, led by Senegalese dancer Maguette Camara. Just be sure to clear out any fragile items, pets or small children from your rehearsal space; you will be doing a whole lot of kicking, jumping and spinning as you try and keep up with the rhythms of sabar.
Cook up a storm
Senegalese cuisine can be as simple as a whole thiof fish, a type of white grouper, grilled to perfection on the beach, or as complex as a heavily spiced stew, simmered for hours. Most importantly though, with just a few special ingredients, it can be recreated at home. Dionne Searcey, the former West Africa bureau chief of The New York Times, said that when she wants to feel like she's back in Dakar, she reaches for one of the cookbooks by Senegalese chef Pierre Thiam. Searcey's go-to is yassa poulet, "an onion-slathered chicken dish," and she serves it with fonio, a couscouslike grain popular across Senegal.
Thiam, who has an entire line of packaged fonio, recommends one dish in particular from his collection "The Fonio Cookbook." It is a fonio salad - "ideal for a hot day in Dakar," he said - with lots of parsley and mint, fresh tomatoes and diced mango for "a herbaceous taste."
Get lost in literature
If it is transportive words you are after, there is a wide range of translated fiction and nonfiction out of Senegal to choose from. Searcey says that she often returns to the words of Boubacar Boris Diop, "who pours his soul into his work," in "Africa Beyond the Mirror."
The Senegalese scholar, Dr. Souleymane Bachir Diagne, director of the Institute of African Studies at Columbia University in New York, recommends starting with Aminata Sow Fall's "The Beggars' Strike," which tells the story of a conflict between an unnamed African city's poor and the government administrators trying to "clean up" the streets. "The story does not name the city but it is Dakar seen from the perspective of the Tittle people,"' Diagne said.
Stop doomscrolling, start Dakarscrolling
Sometimes, a photo is enough to make you feel - even for a second - that you are somewhere far away. Searcey says that when she misses Dakar, she looks at the stunning fashion-centric work of Senegalese photographer Omar Victor Diop. "Even viewing it online can almost make me cry," Searcey said.
Ricci Shryock, a photographer based in Dakar, has an Instagram feed full of gorgeous snapshots of daily life in her adopted home. She recommends a wide variety of other Instagram accounts to check out if you are looking to transport yourself to the city. For an introduction to the city, Shryock recommends following Dakar Lives, which curates images of the city's past and present.
Finally, to feel like you are soaring above Dakar, she points to the work of Abdoulaye Ndao, who goes by Layepro on Instagram. "Layepro posts gorgeous aerials that make me fall in love with this city all over again each time I see them," Shryock said.
Crash course in Wolof
A favorite Instagram account of Shryock is Wolof Words. Besides capturing the spirit of Dakar, it doubles as a crash course in the Wolof language, the most commonly spoken language in Dakar. While a few hours on Instagram are not going to turn you into a fluent Wolof speaker, you might pick up a phrase or two. "To me, the sound of jaunty, loud Wolof is one of the best sounds of Dakar," Shryock said.

Ross Douthat: When you can’t just ‘trust the science’

Texto completo: One of many regrettable features of the Donald Trump era is the way that the president’s lies and conspiracy theories have seemed to vindicate some of his opponents’ most fatuous slogans. I have in mind, in particular, the claim that has echoed through the liberal side of coronavirus-era debates — that the key to sound leadership in a pandemic is just to follow the science , to trust science and scientists , to do what experts suggest instead of letting mere grubby politics determine your response.
Trump made this slogan powerful by conspicuously disdaining expertise and indulging marginal experts who told him what he desired to hear — that the virus isn’t so bad, that life should just go back to normal, usually with dubious statistical analysis to back up that conclusion. And to the extent that trust the science just means that Dr. Anthony Fauci is a better guide to epidemiological trends than someone the president liked on cable news, then it’s a sound and unobjectionable idea.
But for many crucial decisions of the past year, that unobjectionable version of trust the science didn’t get you very far. And when it had more sweeping implications, what the slogan implied was often much more dubious: a deference to the science bureaucracy during a crisis when bureaucratic norms needed to give way; an attempt by para-scientific enterprises to trade on (or trade away) science’s credibility for the sake of political agendas; and an abdication by elected officials of responsibility for decisions that are fundamentally political in nature.
The progress of coronavirus vaccines offers good examples of all these issues. That the vaccines exist at all is an example of science at its purest — a challenge posed, a problem solved, with all the accumulated knowledge of the modern era harnessed to figure out how to defeat a novel pathogen.
But the further you get from the laboratory work, the more complicated and less clearly scientific the key issues become. The timeline on which vaccines have become available, for instance, reflects an attempt to balance the rules of bureaucratic science, their priority on safety and certainty of knowledge, with the urgency of trying something to halt a disease that’s killing thousands of Americans every day. Many scientific factors weigh in that balance, but so do all kinds of extra-scientific variables: moral assumptions about what kinds of vaccine testing we should pursue (one reason we didn’t get the “challenge trials” that might have delivered a vaccine much earlier); legal assumptions about who should be allowed to experiment with unproven treatments; political assumptions about how much bureaucratic hoop-jumping it takes to persuade Americans that a vaccine is safe.
And the closer you get to the finish line, the more notable the bureaucratic and political element becomes. The United States approved its first vaccine after Britain but before the European Union, not because Science says something different in D.C. versus London or Berlin but because the timing was fundamentally political — reflecting different choices by different governing entities on how much to disturb their normal processes, a different calculus about lives lost to delay versus credibility lost if anything goes wrong.
Then there’s the now-pressing question of who actually gets the vaccine first, which has been taken up at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in a way that throws the limits of science-trusting into even sharper relief. Last month their Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices produced a working document that’s a masterpiece of para-scientific effort, in which questions that are legitimately medical and scientific (who will the vaccine help the most), questions that are more logistical and sociological (which pattern of distribution will be easier to put in place) and moral questions about who deserves a vaccine are all jumbled up, assessed with a form of pseudo-rigor that resembles someone bluffing the way through a McKinsey job interview and then used to justify the conclusion that we should vaccinate essential workers before seniors … because seniors are more likely to be privileged and white.
As Matthew Yglesias noted, this (provisional, it should be stressed) recommendation is a remarkable example of how a certain kind of progressive moral thinking ignores the actual needs of racial minorities. Because if you vaccinate working-age people before you vaccinate older people, you will actually end up not vaccinating the most vulnerable minority population, African American seniors — so more minorities might die for the sake of a racial balance in overall vaccination rates.
But even if the recommendation didn’t have that kind of perverse implication, even if all things being equal you were just choosing between more minority deaths and more white deaths in two different vaccination plans, it’s still not the kind of question that the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has any particular competency to address. If policy X leads to racially disparate death rates but policy Y requires overt racial discrimination, then the choice between the two is moral and political, not medical or scientific — as are other important questions like, “Who is actually an essential worker?” or “Should we focus more on slowing the spread or reducing the death rate?” (Or even, “Should we vaccinate men before women given that men are more likely to die of the disease?”)
These are the kind of questions, in other words, that our elected leaders should be willing to answer without recourse to a self-protective “just following the science” default. But that default is deeply inscribed into our political culture, and especially the culture of liberalism, where even something as obviously moral-political as the decision to let Black Lives Matter protests go forward amid a pandemic was justified by redescribing their motor, anti-racism, as a push for better public health.
When we look back over the pandemic era, one of the signal failures will be the inability to acknowledge that many key decisions — from our vaccine policy to our lockdown strategy to our approach to businesses and schools — are fundamentally questions of statesmanship, involving not just the right principles or the right technical understanding of the problem but the prudential balancing of many competing goods.
On the libertarian and populist right, that failure usually involved a recourse to “freedom” as a conversation-stopper, a way to deny that even a deadly disease required any compromises with normal life at all.
But for liberals, especially blue-state politicians and officials, the failure has more often involved invoking capital-S Science to evade their own responsibilities: pretending that a certain kind of scientific knowledge, ideally backed by impeccable credentials, can substitute for prudential and moral judgments that we are all qualified to argue over, and that our elected leaders, not our scientists, have the final responsibility to make.

Another major embarrassment for the New York Times

Texto completo: It has not been a great year for the New York Times.

The paper of record announced this weekend that Caliphate, its award-winning 10-part podcast series on the Islamic State, contains “significant falsehoods and other discrepancies.”

The disclosure concludes an internal investigation launched this year after Canadian officials charged the series's central narrative character with lying about his supposed involvement with the terrorist group.

Absent the testimony of the accused hoaxer, Canadian resident Shehroze Chaudhry, who spoke to the New York Times under the pseudonym “Abu Huzayfah,” there is not much left to the 2018 podcast. Indeed, the show’s most gripping and grizzly “reporting” on ISIS's operations in Syria rely entirely on the say-so of the supposed “executioner” who most likely has never even been to Syria.

"We fell in love with the fact that we had gotten a member of ISIS who would describe his life in the caliphate and would describe his crimes," New York Times Executive Editor Dean Baquet explained this week in an interview with NPR.

He added of Caliphate’s main character, "I think we were so in love with it that when we saw evidence that maybe he was a fabulist, when we saw evidence that he was making some of it up, we didn't listen hard enough."

It is not an overstatement to say Chaudhry is central to the Caliphate project. His supposed first-hand anecdotes about becoming radicalized and committing atrocities in Syria, which won the podcast a large audience, acclaim, and several prestigious journalism awards, drive the entire narrative. However, it seems clear Chaudhry lied about his alleged experiences marauding across the Middle East with ISIS, disgracing both himself and the New York Times.

The journalist responsible for Caliphate, Rukmini Callimachi, who also hosted the show, already has been reassigned far away from reporting on terrorism.

"I do not see how Rukmini could go back to covering terrorism after one of the highest-profile stories of terrorism is getting knocked down in this way," said Baquet.

Callimachi’s reassignment is a good thing, too, considering how she comported herself when questions were first raised about her “reporting” for Caliphate. She dismissed doubts about the trustworthiness of "Huzayfah" out of hand, claiming her critics simply did not have access to the sort of intelligence that she and her team did.

"We were able to get to [‘Abu Huzayfah’] both before any other media had gotten to him, but crucially, before law enforcement had gotten to him," she told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. in May 2018. "He would speak to us in this window of time when he essentially thought that he had slipped through the cracks."

She added, "He gave us a gift with the story. It's an eye-opening account of his passage through the Islamic State."

Later, shortly before Canadian authorities charged Chaudhry with perpetrating a terrorist hoax, Callimachi questioned the competency of the investigators.

Each chapter of Caliphate now bears a lengthy editor’s note, warning that the episodes that rely on Chaudhry’s testimony, which is most of them, do not meet the New York Times’s “standards for accuracy.”
The paper, by the way, does not deserve credit for finally investigating the credibility of its own reporting. Critics have raised questions since 2018 about the authenticity of Chaudhry’s tale, only to be rebuffed or ignored by New York Times leadership. The paper revisited Callimachi’s reporting only because it was left with no other choice following the terrorist hoax charges brought against Chaudhry, whose stories as recounted by the New York Times raised serious concerns in Canada over the issue of reintegrating reformed terrorists back into society.
“In the absence of firmer evidence,” reads the editor’s note, “Caliphate should have been substantially revised to exclude the material related to Mr. Chaudhry. The podcast as a whole should not have been produced with Mr. Chaudhry as a central narrative character.”
Caliphate won the 2018 Peabody Award. The New York Times has already returned it. The Overseas Press Club has also rescinded the podcast’s Lowell Thomas Award.

Man, what a year for the paper of record.

From publishing Chinese communist propaganda, to getting it wrong on coronavirus vaccine readiness, to losing top opinion editors following a temper tantrum thrown by newsroom staffers, to having nearly its entire bench of columnists suffer a collective nervous breakdown ahead of Election Day, to pretending still as if its fraudulent 1619 Project is not an abject embarrassment, 2020 has been as lousy a year for the New York Times as it has been for everyone else.

What Will Become of a Tycoon’s Art Gems?

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
NEW YORK — In an apartment high above Manhattan, paintings by van Gogh, Matisse and Modigliani overlooked the East River and tribal artworks and Egyptian antiquities mingled with Giacometti bronzes and furniture. Several blocks west, a monumental Miró bronze stood guard by a skyscraper known for its sloping glass facade and masterpieces inside.
But now the future of one of the finest 20th-century art collections hangs in the balance after the death last month of Sheldon Solow, 92, the self-made real estate tycoon who amassed it over five decades. Many works decorated the Solows’ flat at United Nations Plaza. A rotating cast of trophies was displayed in a street-facing gallery at the Solow Building on West 57th Street, the home of the Solow Art and Architecture Foundation and the heart of his real estate empire.
The art world is holding its breath. In the last decade, Solow emerged as a major seller of masterpieces at auction, and new consignments from his eclectic collection could infuse as much as $500 million into today’s market — which has been starved for supply at the high end since the pandemic hit — according to Elizabeth von Habsburg, managing director of Winston Art Group, an appraisal and advisory firm. “We are keenly awaiting the news on the disposition of this estate,” she said. “The potential is really exciting.”
In 2018, Solow came under fire from critics for having benefited from the tax-exempt status his art foundation has held since 1991 while keeping the works in the collection largely inaccessible to the public. His family is now grappling with the possibility of changing course by opening a museum, a potentially significant event in the cultural life of New York City and one that would allow the public to see the works. The Solows would be joining other wealthy families in the city with private museums, including Glenn Fuhrman’s FLAG Art Foundation, J. Tomilson Hill and Peter Brant.
“It doesn’t have to be the Metropolitan we are talking about,” Mia Fonssagrives Solow, the developer’s widow, said last month. “We are talking about a little addition to New York.”
It is still unclear whether any museum that Sheldon Solow’s heirs create would be in the Solow Building, would display only works the foundation owns or also feature pieces from the Solow private collection, or when such a museum might open.
Their elder son, Stefan Soloviev, who confirmed in a text message Sunday that he is now in charge of the foundation, said in a subsequent message that “the collection will be accessible to the public.” Asked whether that would be in a private museum or elsewhere, he said, “Wherever I want.”
Solow’s beneficiaries would be able to deduct from their income tax the market value of any personal art they give the museum, according to Ralph Lerner, art adviser and co-author of “Art Law.”
One space that was envisioned for the museum is on the ground floor of the Solow Building, with an entrance on West 58th Street facing the Plaza Hotel. It is currently hosting the Leila Heller Gallery’s pop-up exhibition of art by Fonssagrives Solow, a sculptor and jewelry designer. Her colorful, curvilinear abstract shapes and white alienlike figures are set against a backdrop of three large Miró paintings, owned by the Solow Foundation and valued at $60 million, according to the foundation’s tax return for the period ending Nov. 30, 2018.
Also unclear is what will happen to one of the gems of the collection, a 15th-century painting by Sandro Botticelli, “Young Man Holding a Roundel.” The portrait spent decades on view at the National Gallery of Art in Washington and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In September, it was consigned to Sotheby’s and is scheduled to be part of an old masters auction on Jan. 28, according to Derek Parsons, a Sotheby’s spokesman. Acquired almost 40 years ago by Sheldon Solow for just over $1 million, the painting may fetch more than $80 million.
Solow intended to use the proceeds from the Botticelli sale to create “a little jewel in the heart of Manhattan,’’ said Fonssagrives Solow, 79. But in November, she told a reporter “we may hold that,” adding, “We may make it the centerpiece of the museum. It is too early to tell.”
When a seller pulls a work after agreeing to consign it, auction houses charge a withdrawal fee. The amount is negotiable but typically ranges between 10% and 25% of the estimate depending on the auction house, according to Thomas C. Danziger, an attorney specializing in art transactions.
“The principle is that the auction house wants to make it painful enough so that a consignor thinks twice,” said Danziger, who is not involved in the Botticelli consignment. “They don’t want you to pull the work if you get a better offer.”
The son of a Brooklyn bricklayer, Sheldon Solow built a real estate empire from scratch and was known as tough and litigious. Despite being a major collector of modern art, he kept a low profile in the art world and was acutely private, according to people who knew him, often buying and selling art anonymously.
“He was definitely of a generation who started when the art world was much smaller,’’ said David Norman, chair of the Americas at Phillips auction house and formerly Sotheby’s top expert in impressionist and modern art. “They made their own choices and spoke with the great dealers of their era, but relied on themselves.”
The 13 specific artworks listed among the assets of the Solow Foundation, including the Botticelli, had a combined market value of $340.6 million in 2018, according to its last available tax return. The value of Solow’s personal collection is harder to gauge, partly because he has sold many key pieces in the last decade, generating more than $400 million at auction.
The Solow art could infuse as much as $500 million into the market, von Habsburg said. Despite the fact that the auction houses have pivoted to online auctions, and have held more of them this year, public sales at Christie’s, Sotheby’s and Phillips declined 26% to $7.3 billion through Dec. 16 over last year, according to market research firm ArtTactic. Should the family decide to sell the art and not go ahead with the museum, “there would be a tremendous competition,” said art dealer Bill Acquavella.
This year, Acquavella Galleries joined forces with two competitors, Gagosian and Pace, to outbid Christie’s, Sotheby’s and Phillips for the estate of financier Don Marron. The triumvirate would compete with the three auction houses for the Solow trove as well, Acquavella said.
But the market’s excitement about the potential Solow sales may be premature.
“He has his surviving spouse; he has kids,” said Gregoire Billault, head of Sotheby’s contemporary art department in New York. “The family will decide whether they have to sell or not.”
When he died, Solow had a net worth of $3.1 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. He had been collecting for decades, acquiring major pieces by Giacometti, Miró and Picasso since the 1970s, and setting records both as a buyer and seller. Those who visited his apartment remember pieces by Balthus and Dubuffet, Rothko and van Gogh.
In 1973, he ignited a trans-Atlantic bidding war to win Picasso’s cubist 1909 “Femme Assise” (“Seated Woman”) for $816,000, then a record.
Six years later, he traveled to London to bid in person on a fauve masterpiece by Matisse, according to Phyllis Hattis, an art dealer and friend of the Solows. “Le Jeune Marin I” (“The Young Sailor I”) was once owned by Gertrude Stein’s eldest brother, Michael.
Solow did not want to betray his interest in the work and stood in the back of the salesroom, according to Hattis. The 1906 canvas sold for $1.6 million. The New York Times would later recount that the sale “rewrote the auction record for 20th-century art and set a new high for any painting other than an old master.”
That work could be worth $75 million now, according to Acquavella. The second, more finished version of the young sailor is at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
To maximize his returns as a seller, he never took guarantees, the minimum prices offered by the auction houses to sellers in exchange for sharing the upside, auction executives said. Instead, Solow would negotiate “enhanced hammer” deals, taking a percentage of the auction commission.
“And the sales results proved him right every time,” said art dealer David Nash.
In 2016, Solow consigned Picasso’s “Femme Assise” to Sotheby’s in London. The sale took place on the eve of the Brexit vote while the pound plunged wildly. Still the work ended up making $63.5 million. “The Pointing Man,” which Solow bought in 1970 and sold for $141.3 million at Christie’s in 2015, remains an auction record for both a Giacometti and a sculpture.
He learned from people like art dealer Pierre Matisse, architect Gordon Bunshaft, who designed the Solow Building, and William Rubin, then the powerful curator of painting and sculpture at the Museum of Modern Art, according to Hattis, Rubin’s widow.
“Sheldon was a serious and passionate collector” Hattis said. “He didn’t need art to gain social status in New York City. He was collecting for genuine reasons. He did it to enhance his own life, for his own sense of beauty and living with greatness.”
For most people, his taste is on view at the Solow Building, where Giacometti’s 9-foot-tall standing woman is parked by the elevators.
“Dubuffet, Kline, Diebenkorn, Miró, Matisse — he used to keep all these extraordinary pictures there,” said Brett Gorvy, a co-owner of Levy Gorvy Gallery and former Christie’s executive. “He was very forward-thinking as the owner of the building to have art displayed on the ground floor. How many collectors have a front window on 57th Street?”
But not everyone was charmed. In 2017, Ethan Arnheim, a Washington-based art lover and activist, launched a website, scrutinizing the foundation and mocking its inaccessibility. Daily operating hours were listed as “none,’’ “inaccessible,’’ “closed” and “absolutely not.”
“While it is not illegal,” Arnheim said this week, “it operates as a nonprofit with significant tax benefits and we as taxpayers are subsidizing the collection.”
The possibility of a museum is “exciting,” he added. “It suggests that tangible steps are being taken to make the work public. I would love to turn the website over to them and enable people to go visit the collection.’’

BOULDER, Colo. — On the day before Thanksgiving, Dave Query had to close his restaurant for good. For some 26 years, Zolo Grill had been a popular eatery in Boulder offering Southwestern fare. But the slowdown in business, he said, and the cost of complying with state and county safety protocols became too much.
“There’s a moment when you have to put a bullet in the head and bury it in the backyard,” Query said. Several other restaurants that he owns are challenged, he said, and at this point he is looking for whatever help he and his employees can get.
“It should have come a lot sooner,” Query said of the stimulus package that congressional leaders agreed to on Sunday. “But anything is better than nothing.”
The legislation would provide direct payments and jobless aid to millions of Americans, as well as support for small business, hospitals and schools. For many, it is long-awaited relief, as families have been pushed from their homes and workers have lost their jobs.
Neither the deal, far smaller than the first stimulus package, nor the painfully prolonged process that produced it struck people interviewed on Sunday as ideal. But, as Query said, at least there was — finally — a deal.
The emergence of the coronavirus vaccine has stirred hope that there is light at the end of the tunnel, allowing many to imagine life on the other side of the pandemic.
The agreement is expected to provide stimulus payments of $600 to millions of American adults making up to $75,000 and to revive lapsed supplemental federal unemployment benefits at $300 per week for 11 weeks — half the level of aid delivered by the $2.2 trillion stimulus law enacted in March.
It would also continue and expand benefits for gig workers and freelancers, and it would extend federal payments for people whose regular benefits have expired.
Raquel Lodestro, a massage therapist in the New York, said she works when she can, having to leave her 10-year-old son at home while he attends school remotely. “Three hundred dollars — yeah, it’s a blessing and I will appreciate it,” she said of the unemployment aid, “but you are telling everybody that $600 is too much?”
“The fact is,” she added, “that for us even to get ahead during this pandemic was a godsend, for us to be able to survive this.”
The previous stimulus package was passed about nine months ago, just as the virus took hold in the United States, prompting widespread stay-at-home orders limiting movement and commerce. It took months to negotiate the new one as the pandemic spread out of control and people burned through their savings.
“This, the pandemic, and the associated economic impact, is not a partisan issue,” said Isabel McDevitt, who founded Ready to Work, an agency in Colorado that offers employment, housing and support services to adults transitioning out of homelessness. “Republicans and independents, unaffiliated people, everyone is being impacted. So absolutely, there needed to be more action.”
Lisa Hahn, a stay-at-home mother of four teenagers in Forest Hills, New York, in March started a support group for parents of children with special needs. Many parents in her group are not able to work, she said, because their children require constant supervision and one-on-one instruction to participate in remote school.
“I think a lot of our families, especially in New York, are really struggling — I hear it, I see it,” she said, adding: “I think that they should have passed this over a month ago, or longer. And I really think it should have been a bigger stimulus than it is.”
In New York, many are still scarred by the darkest and deadliest days of the virus, and now, because of the economic situation, the city is still being drained of people and talent.
Eric Ulloa, a writer for theater and film who also acts on Broadway, said he was seeing the posts of friends and colleagues being pushed from the city — “just deferring the dream of what they wanted to do,” he said, “which was to perform or to write or to compose or create or direct or photograph — every one of those dreams are all on hold.”
For those facing the most pressing need, the $600 payment would be welcomed, but many questioned just how much a difference it would make.
The financial news site Business Insider calculated that in America’s largest cities, looking at average monthly expenditures, the money would carry a two-person household for less than two weeks. The previous stimulus law included payments of up to $1,200. A report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York found that most of those funds were used to pay off debt or put into savings.
Housing advocates were encouraged to learn that the agreement might include a moratorium on evictions.
“It’s great to hear, but once again we’re just putting more Band-Aids on some inevitabilities,” said Joseph Zanovitch, the executive director of HOPE, a homeless outreach program in Colorado. “It’s a positive, but it’s also like a looming cliff — how long will this actually last?”
The deal does not include direct funding for state and local governments, which concerns Alec Garnett, the speaker-designate for the Colorado House of Representatives. And Garnett said he was exasperated with Washington lawmakers’ inability to arrive at an agreement sooner.
“The slow pace that this has moved is exactly what Coloradans hate about partisan politicians in Washington,” Garnett, a Democrat, said, adding that his criticism applied to both parties. “Differences should have been set aside months ago, to help keep small businesses open, keep them employed and keep food on the table.”
Kathy Valentine, an advocate for mental health support in Boulder, was among those who cast blame on President Donald Trump for failing to facilitate an agreement. “Leadership?” she asked. “There is no such word in his vocabulary.”
The economic fallout from the pandemic has strained food banks. Nederland Food Pantry, which serves the rugged mountain communities of western Boulder County and also neighboring Gilpin County, has been serving as many as 185 households a week, compared with 65 this time last year.
The Northeast Iowa Food Bank in Waterloo has seen a similar surge in demand. “It’s a lot of people who never thought they’d be in this position because everyone was working,” said Barbara Prather, the food bank’s executive director. “Things were going well. Then 2020 happened, then the pandemic happened.”
Don Miller, owner of the County Line chain of barbecue restaurants based in Austin, Texas, was not sure how he would benefit from the stimulus package. But the previous one, he said, had helped him and his business for about three months.
“Whatever the stimulus plan is, it’s about time,” Miller said. “We’re out here hanging on by our fingernails on a day-to-day basis. And we just need to get something done. Even if it’s just crumbs, each time they give it out is just fine with us.”

‘COVID Can’t Compete.’ In a Place Mired in War, the Virus Is an Afterthought.

KABUL, Afghanistan — For Mohammad Wakil, 23, social distancing is an abstract concept. Every working day, he shakes hands with scores of customers at the teeming bazaar where he sells secondhand shoes. He handles filthy Afghan bank notes. He disdains hand sanitizer. A mask? Forget about it.
“There’s no coronavirus,” Wakil said in late October as shoppers swarmed his rickety stall. “It’s a lie told by the government.”
When the coronavirus pandemic first reached Afghanistan in March, the government struggled to shut down cities and persuade Afghans to wear masks, wash their hands and practice social distancing. The measures were haphazardly enforced for several weeks before citizens began to chafe under the restrictions.
Today, even as public health officials confirm a second deadly virus wave, COVID-19 is an afterthought. Afghans have embraced a culture of denial, where personal priorities triumph over public health experts whose pleas are drowned out by public apathy, skepticism and an enduring belief that Allah determines a believer’s fate.
“The mentality that Trump and his supporters have, it’s exactly the same for the Afghan people,” said Dr. Tariq Ahmad Akbari, until recently the head physician at Kabul’s only infectious disease hospital. “They think COVID is Western propaganda.”
But unlike in the United States, there is no political party or anti-government movement playing down the virus by spreading misinformation. Even the Taliban have distributed personal protection equipment and run public health information programs. They have allowed government health workers into areas they control, the Health Ministry said.
In cities across the country, people go about their daily lives as if COVID-19 never existed. While the virus is most transmissible indoors, scientists say it can also be contracted through close personal encounters outside. Yet Afghans cram into buses and taxis, eat shoulder to shoulder indoors in restaurants, pray in mosques, embrace in traditional Afghan greetings and cluster together in sprawling bazaars.
On crowded city streets, few people wear masks. Ubiquitous public health posters warning of COVID-19 are routinely mocked as relics of a not-so-distant past when the coronavirus seemed terrifying and indomitable.
“We know people are tired of the virus and the health messages they keep hearing,” said Akmal Samsor, a spokesman for the Health Ministry. “We live in a country with serious threats of war and poverty. COVID can’t compete.”
Afghans continue to contract the virus and die, but the scale of the epidemic is nearly impossible to measure. The Health Ministry’s reported coronavirus death toll is 2,074, with 50,677 positive cases, but Afghanistan’s testing capacity is severely limited — it has conducted just 180,000 tests since March. Its beleaguered health system cannot always distinguish COVID-19 from other causes of death in a country where disease and violence are endemic.
Health officials concede that Afghanistan’s actual death toll is exponentially higher. An estimated 32% of Afghanistan’s roughly 34 million people may already have contracted the virus, the Health Ministry said. One World Health Organization model in May estimated that half the population could become infected.
“The virus is circling the country,” Samsor said, noting that the COVID-19 mortality rate rose by 47% the first week of December. “If 95% of people wore masks for just two weeks we could bring the virus under control.”
Yet local news media have lost interest in the virus, instead focusing on peace talks, the intensifying war and targeted killings in the capital.
Last spring, pharmacies were overwhelmed by requests for purported virus treatments. But some pharmacists now say customers have convinced themselves that the virus is not worth a second thought, although some continue to seek miracle cures.
“People now think COVID is not a deadly illness, so they are not worried about it at all,” said Faizullah Faizbakhsh, a Kabul pharmacist.
At domestic airport terminals, passengers ignore faded circles on the floor intended to keep them 6 feet apart. Only some airport workers wear masks. Flight attendants are masked, but not all passengers wear the free masks provided. People nonchalantly cluster in movie theaters and shopping malls.
Even heartbreaking stories of Afghans dying from the virus after infecting loved ones have not aroused widespread fears.
Zalmay Rahman, a resident of Mazar-e-Sharif in northern Afghanistan, said his entire family had worn masks and used hand sanitizer. Yet his mother died of COVID-19, he said, and he and several other relatives also contracted the virus.
“We just hope we can survive this second wave,” Rahman said.
The sense of apathy toward the virus seems to trickle from the top down. In October, the Health Ministry ordered government workers to wear masks, reinstating a policy that was disregarded in early summer. But at the presidential palace complex in Kabul, almost all employees recently encountered by visiting reporters were maskless. In a palace cafeteria, workers ate side by side, hugging and shaking hands.
The Health Ministry recently suggested mandatory masks for banks, stores and buses. It also proposed closing wedding halls, sports clubs and funeral halls, and temporarily sidelining vehicles with more than five passengers. The proposals are pending.
The government has been unable to shut down cities because most Afghans must venture out daily to earn a living. Eighty percent of the population lives near the poverty line in a country propped up by foreign aid and a subsistence economy.
Afghanistan’s health care system relies on international support, spending roughly $5 per person annually — versus $11,000 per person in the United States.
Even before COVID-19, 3.7 million Afghans needed emergency health care services, according to the World Health Organization. At least 30 health care facilities have been attacked this year, amid widespread food insecurity and the world’s highest child mortality rate.
In Kabul, the Afghan-Japan Communicable Disease Hospital admits 40 more COVID-19 cases a day now than two weeks ago, said Ramin Hamid, the hospital’s health information director.
Since the pandemic began, the hospital has received 32,000 suspected COVID-19 patients, of whom more than 500 have died.
Yet even hospital attendants sometimes neglect to wear masks or gowns, said Dr. Meranay Baratzay, the hospital’s infection prevention doctor. As he spoke, a man emerged, unmasked, after visiting the room of a family member with COVID-19.
“They don’t understand that COVID is real,” Dr. Niaz Ahmad, an emergency room physician, said of attendants and visitors. “It’s only the people who have lost someone to the virus who believe it.”
Among the patients in the COVID-19 ward on a recent day was a college student, Nazif Rezayi, 21, who squatted in his bed, coughing and wheezing. In a raspy voice, he said he had taken no precautions, even while living in a crowded student hostel.
“I didn’t take it seriously,” Rezayi said. “I do now. Everyone should.”
The 120-bed hospital has just 31 patient monitors, three X-ray machines, two ultrasound devices and no CT scanner. If the second virus wave intensifies, Akbari said, the hospital will not be able to care for every COVID-19 patient.
Ahmad shook his head in frustration. The doctor said he faithfully wore a surgical mask, washed his hands and practiced social distancing when he went about his daily life outside the hospital.
“But what good does that do,” he asked, “if nobody else is following the rules?”

Stanley Cowell, a pianist, composer, record-label impresario and educator who brought a technician’s attention to detail and a theorist’s sophistication to his more than 50-year career as a jazz bandleader, died Friday in Dover, Delaware. He was 79.
Sylvia Potts Cowell, his wife, said that the cause of his death, at a hospital, was hypovolemic shock, the result of blood loss stemming from other health issues.
Cowell’s playing epitomized the piano’s ability to consolidate generations of musical history into a unified expression, while extending various routes into the future. And when he needed to say more than the piano allowed, he expanded his palette.
He was among the first jazz musicians to make prominent use of the kalimba, a thumb piano from southeastern Africa. In his later decades he worked often with a digital sound-design program, Kyma, that allowed him to alter the pitch and texture of an acoustic piano’s sound.
In 1971, together with trumpeter Charles Tolliver, Cowell founded Strata-East Records, a pioneering institution in jazz and the broader Black Arts Movement. It would release a steady run of pathbreaking music over the coming decade, becoming one of the most successful Black-run labels of its time.
Cowell and Tolliver met in the late 1960s, as members of the drummer Max Roach’s ensemble. After recording a now-classic album with Roach, “Members, Don’t Git Weary,” in 1968, they formed a quartet called Music Inc., which released its debut LP, “The Ringer,” on Polydor in 1970. But Cowell and Tolliver found themselves unable to find a label that would pay what they considered a fair advance for their next album, at a time when jazz’s commercial appeal was fading.
Inspired by the Black musicians’ collectives that had recently sprouted up in cities across the country, and by the artist-run Strata label in Detroit, Cowell and Tolliver founded Strata-East. Their second album together, “Music Inc.,” with the quartet fleshed out into a large ensemble, was the label’s first release.
“The aesthetic ambition was to compose, play and extend the music of our great influences, mentors and innovators, while keeping the distinguishing features of the jazz tradition,” Cowell said in a 2015 interview for the Superfly Records website.
Over the coming decade, Strata-East would release dozens of albums with a similar goal at heart, including some gemlike LPs by Cowell: “Musa: Ancestral Streams” (1974), a solo album of understated breadth; “Regeneration” (1975), an odyssey equally inspired by pop music and pan-Africanism; and a pair of singular albums with the Piano Choir, a group of seven pianists, “Handscapes 1” (1973) and “Handscapes 2” (1975).
Cowell was also becoming one of New York’s most in-demand side musicians, known for his adaptability and his vast command of the jazz language. In the coming decade he would play an integral role in the Heath Brothers band and groups led by the saxophonists Arthur Blythe and Art Pepper and the vibraphonist Bobby Hutcherson.
After becoming a full-time music professor in the 1980s, Cowell eventually stepped back from public performances and recordings.
His quartet’s appearance at the Village Vanguard in 2015 was his first weeklong engagement in New York in nearly two decades. Reviewing one of those shows for The New York Times, Ben Ratliff wrote, “Mr. Cowell can create impressive momentary events, but what’s best about him is his broad frame of reference and the general synthesis he is proposing.”
In addition to his wife, Cowell is survived by their daughter, Sunny Cowell Stovall; a sister, Esther Cowell; another daughter, Sienna Cowell, from a previous marriage; and two grandchildren. He had homes in Maryland and Delaware.
Stanley Allen Cowell was born in Toledo, Ohio, on May 5, 1941, to Stanley and Willie Hazel (Lytle) Cowell, who kept a wide variety of music playing in the house at all times. The couple ran a series of businesses, including a motel that was among the only places in Toledo where touring Black musicians could stay. Many artists became friends of the family, including the stride piano master Art Tatum, himself a Toledo native.
During a visit to the family home when Stanley was 6, Tatum played a version of the show tune “You Took Advantage of Me” that Cowell would never forget. When he recorded his first album as a leader in 1969, “Blues for the Viet Cong,” he included a dazzling stride rendition of “You Took Advantage of Me” alongside his own forward-charging originals.
As a child, Cowell played and composed constantly. By the time he arrived at the Oberlin College Conservatory in Ohio at age 17, he had already written a number of pieces, including “Departure,” which would become the opening track on “Blues for the Viet Cong.” He studied for a time in Austria, then went on to the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, where he received a graduate degree in classical piano while working six nights a week in a jazz trio.
He also fell in with the experimental improvisers and poets of the nearby Detroit Artists Workshop. That experience opened his mind to new artistic possibilities, while planting a seed of passion for artist-led organizing.
His connections in Detroit led him to the saxophonist Marion Brown, who helped him land on his feet after moving to New York City in the mid-1960s. Brown brought the young pianist to his first recording session, in 1966, for the album “Three for Shepp.”
Cowell recorded “Blues for the Viet Cong” with a trio in 1969, and followed it with “Brilliant Circles,” a sextet date.
He went on to make over a dozen albums in the 1970s, ’80s and ’90s, including a run for the Steeplechase label while in his 40s and 50s that, while generally unsung, represents one of that era’s most consistently brilliant stretches of jazz recordings.
In the 1980s, Cowell began to focus more heavily on his work as an educator — first at the City University of New York’s Lehman College and later at Rutgers. He expanded his inquiries into electronic instrumentation and orchestral composing, becoming adept at Kyma and teaching courses on electronic music. He composed a lengthy “Juneteenth Suite” for chorus and orchestra, inspired by the celebrations of Black Americans after the Emancipation Proclamation.
After retiring from teaching in 2013, Cowell revved up his performing career again. He reconnected with his old cohort, including Tolliver and other former members of the Strata-East roster, touring under the name the Strata-East All Stars. And in 2015, Cowell released the album “Juneteenth,” featuring what he called “a solo piano reduction” of the suite.
In an echo of his experiences almost 50 years earlier, he had been unable to find a record label willing to invest in recording the suite with a full orchestra. Eventually a small French label, Vision Fugitive, offered to put out the solo-piano version.
He often noted the irony of his inability to find an American label for the record, which celebrates a suppressed legacy of American music. But he was proud to have put it out anyway, upholding his understanding of the musician’s role.
“We are not just artists, we are citizens of our respective nations, and ultimately citizens of the world,” he told Superfly Records. “In our own personal ways, and when necessary, in unity with others, we should add our ‘fuel’ to the cleansing fire against injustice.”

Striking a compromise between two high-risk population groups, a panel advising the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention voted Sunday to recommend that people age 75 and older be next in line to receive the coronavirus vaccine in the United States, along with about 30 million “front-line essential workers,” such as emergency responders, teachers and grocery store employees.
The debate about who should receive the vaccine in these early months has grown increasingly urgent as the daily tally of cases has swelled to numbers unimaginable even weeks ago. The country has already begun vaccinating health care workers, and on Monday, CVS and Walgreens are to begin a mass inoculation campaign at the nation’s nursing homes and long-term care facilities. This week roughly 6 million doses of the newly authorized Moderna vaccine are to start arriving at more than 3,700 locations around the country, including many smaller and rural hospitals, widening the rollout that began with Pfizer’s vaccine last week.
The panel of doctors and public health experts had previously indicated it would recommend a much broader group of Americans defined as essential workers — about 90 million people with jobs designated by a division of the Department of Homeland Security as critical to keeping society functioning — as the next priority population, and that older people who live independently should come later.
But in hours of discussion Sunday, conducted remotely, the committee members concluded that given the limited initial supply of vaccine and the higher COVID-19 death rate among older Americans, it made more sense to allow the oldest among them to go next, along with workers whose jobs put them “at substantially higher risk of exposure” to the virus.
“I feel very strongly we do need to have that balance of saving lives and keeping our infrastructure in place,” said Dr. Helen Talbot, a member of the panel and an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University.
Other types of essential workers, such as construction and restaurant workers, would qualify for a third wave of prioritization under the panel’s recommendations. The committee members acknowledged that they could not determine a timeline for that next group because they did not know how much demand there would be for the vaccine among the earlier priority groups.
“What we are providing governors and health officials with is a framework, which is supported by evidence and will address this limited supply of vaccine that we have at this time,” said Dr. Jose Romero, the committee’s chairman and a pediatric infectious disease specialist in Arkansas.
Together, the two groups the committee recommended be vaccinated next number about 51 million people. Federal health officials have estimated that there could be enough vaccine supply to inoculate 100 million people before the end of February, including the nation’s 21 million health care workers and 3 million residents of long-term care facilities. The CDC reported Sunday that more than 556,000 people had received an initial shot over the last week; both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines require a second dose several weeks later.
The director of the CDC, Dr. Robert Redfield, will now review the panel’s latest recommendation and decide, likely by Monday, whether to embrace it as the agency’s official guidance to states. After the committee suggested last month that it would recommend that essential workers get vaccinated before older people, Redfield urged its members in a statement to “demonstrate that we as a nation also prioritize the elderly.”
A working group of the committee suggested that in addition to teachers, firefighters and police, “front-line essential workers” should include school support staff; day care employees; corrections personnel; public transit, grocery store and postal workers; and those in working in food production and manufacturing.
But the group’s formal recommendation is not that specific. The panel, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, emphasized that its recommendations were nonbinding and that every state should fine-tune them to serve the unique needs of its population.
The 13-1 vote came as frustrations flared nationally about the pace of vaccine distribution. This weekend, Gen. Gustave Perna, who heads the Trump administration’s distribution effort, apologized for states learning at the last minute that they would receive fewer doses of the Pfizer vaccine next week than they had expected. Tensions were also roiling in some states over local decisions regarding which health care workers should get their shots immediately and which — including hospital administrators who do not see patients, some of whom were vaccinated last week — should wait.
When the committee signaled last month that essential workers should precede adults 65 and older, many members supported that view, expressing alarm that these workers, who are often low-wage people of color, were being hit disproportionately hard by the virus and were additionally disadvantaged because of their limited access to good health care.
But when word of that proposal emerged, the public reaction was frequently harsh because many people felt that the elderly deserved protection first, as they, too, are dying at disproportionately high rates and overwhelming health care facilities.
In addition, the committee faced a flood of often vicious accusations that it was prioritizing other racial groups over white people.
In a strongly worded statement before the panel’s vote Sunday, its chair, Romero, pushed back. “Our attempt has been always to achieve equitable, ethical and fair distribution of that resource. We have never targeted a specific ethnic nor racial group for receipt of the vaccine,” he said.
The position the committee ultimately endorsed was intended to mediate between competing and compelling concerns. The latest recommendation now trims back essential workers to a smaller category and narrows the eligible older population by a decade.
The full committee also voted to recommend a third priority group to get the vaccine after people who are older than 75 and those who are “front-line” essential workers: people ages 65 to 74 (roughly 32 million); people ages 16 to 64 with high-risk medical conditions (more than 110 million); and all other essential workers, including those with jobs in restaurants, construction, law, transportation other than public transit and water treatment.
Dr. Grace Lee, a committee member who is a professor of pediatrics at the Stanford University School of Medicine, noted that while the CDC currently lists 11 “high-risk” conditions that make people more vulnerable to a life-threatening case of COVID-19, such as severe obesity, sickle cell disease or Type 2 diabetes, the list needs to be constantly updated as clinicians learn about more conditions that can leave patients exposed.
Later this week, the CDC is expected to issue further explanations of the panel’s rationales and more guidance for doctors with high-risk patients.
Some on the committee called for refining priorities further within each large group, if only to help states and local governments make difficult decisions in the coming weeks. For example, one asked, shouldn’t older front-line essential workers go before younger ones?
The committee members said that the overarching consideration should be for those who could not do their jobs without social distancing or who did not have ready access to personal protective equipment. Those who can work remotely and otherwise do not fall into a higher priority group, they said, should wait.
But the group also suggested that the categories would be fluid and that states could move from one phase to the next if supply increased, if data suggested that most people in a group had gotten vaccinated or if appointments for the shots in any given jurisdiction began to be less than 80% filled.
“Vaccination within the phases may and likely will overlap,” said Dr. Beth Bell, a panel member and a global health expert at the University of Washington.
One debate centered on how congregate housing, such as prisons and jails, should receive vaccination priority. The recommendation lists correctional staff as front-line essential workers but is silent about prisoners themselves, who have been at very high risk of contagion.
Ultimately, the panel suggested local health departments determine whether to vaccinate prisoners simultaneously with corrections officers based in part on whether an outbreak was flaring in their institution.
Repeatedly, members of the committee underscored the fluidity of the factors they were considering in determining their allocation priorities. There is still more to be learned about the virus and the vaccines themselves, they said, that could affect decisions further down the road.
Committee members also pointed out that their recommendations could change based on what happens with supply of and demand for the vaccine. They issued an urgent call for more federal funding to state and local health departments for distribution efforts, which they said were in grave danger of being thwarted by insufficient staffing and resources on the ground.
“Today, state and local health departments are on life support,” said Dr. Jeffrey Duchin, a panel member who is in charge of public health in Seattle and King County, Washington, which saw the nation’s first COVID-19 outbreaks in March. “We’re hamstrung and stymied by the lack of necessary federal funding to allow us to take advantage of these newly available vaccines.”

Ad Spending Soars in Georgia Races With Stakes Far Beyond State

The message from President-elect Joe Biden that streamed across television screens in Georgia on Friday was simple, direct and dire: “Let me be clear: I need Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff in the United States Senate.”
Minutes later, a joint ad from their Republican opponents, Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, was similarly urgent: “This fight will determine America’s future.”
The ad wars in Georgia’s two Senate races, which have soared past the $450 million mark and saturated the airwaves at previously unheard-of levels, reflect the stakes of one of the most unusual special elections in U.S. history: the opportunity to vote for control of the Senate through two statewide races, held at the same time, with a new administration’s agenda hanging in the balance.
What began as an intensely negative mudslinging ad campaign is now taking on increasingly national messages — that the Senate, and therefore the country, is what voters should consider as they cast their ballots, not necessarily who can best serve Georgia’s needs.
Democrats, who need to win both runoff races to control the Senate, say dual victories are necessary for Biden to undertake a concerted and complete recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. Republicans say a win in January, when the elections take place, is the only buffer left against what they claim is creeping “socialism.”
Biden’s ad, which began running Friday, comes after weeks of ads from both Ossoff and Warnock that have pitched the recovery from the pandemic as hinging on their election.
“We can get our daily lives back, but only if we vote,” Ossoff says in one of his ads.
Indeed, more than 70% of Ossoff’s ads focus on the coronavirus, according to Advertising Analytics, an ad tracking firm. Warnock, the pastor of Atlanta’s famed Ebenezer Baptist Church, has spent slightly less of his ad budget on the issue of the pandemic, but it is still the second-most frequent topic in his messaging.
While the Republican attacks hit various topics, including focusing on Warnock’s sermons and Ossoff’s private business interests, they often come back to a recurring theme that was prevalent in both the midterm elections and the impeachment ad wars: that the modern Democratic Party is controlled by the far-left. Republican attack ads are packed with images of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, a favorite target of Republicans seeking to paint the party as overly liberal.
“It’s freedom versus socialism,” a narrator declares in another joint ad from Perdue and Loeffler. “This fight will determine America’s future, and we need your help now.”
It is a common tactic, one that was prevalent during the general election in many races, including the presidential one. While attempts to paint a lifelong, well-known moderate like Biden as a socialist were difficult, the branding worked in many down-ballot victories for Republicans.
“I am not at all surprised about the Republicans’ shift to the socialist attack. It worked down the ticket across the country in the 2020 general election,” said Kelly Gibson, a Democratic media strategist who advised the campaigns of Andrew Yang and Julián Castro. “The Democrats lost House seats in places that were surprising, and the main message was ‘socialist’ and 'defund the police.'”
Both races are dominated by negative ads. None of the candidates are running a majority of positive ads, and many are continuing the criticisms from the general election. Loeffler’s campaign and allied Republican groups have been running particularly caustic ads against Warnock, focusing on issues of race and policing. Nearly half of Loeffler’s ads mention law enforcement or the “defund the police” movement.
Other ads by both Loeffler and Republican allies have targeted Warnock’s sermons and have sought to tie him to a now-famous clip of the Rev. Jeremiah Wright Jr., once the pastor of former President Barack Obama, delivering a sermon about the nation’s past oppression of racial minorities that included the phrase “God damn America.”
One ad, by the Republican group American Crossroads, deceptively edited footage in which Warnock was quoting Wright and discussing his remarks, making it appear as if the Democratic candidate had also said the phrase on his own when, in fact, he had not. (In the past, Warnock has suggested that Wright’s sermon squared with the “truth-telling tradition of the Black church.”) In a response ad, Warnock’s campaign aired footage of Loeffler speaking at his church in January, saying she told the congregation she was “humbled to be there” and “would love to come back.”
A coalition of African American pastors in Georgia said at a news conference Saturday that Loeffler’s ads had crossed a line and constituted “a broader attack against the Black church and faith traditions for which we stand.”
Both Warnock and Ossoff have run ads highlighting stock sales and business transactions made by Loeffler and Perdue after they received briefings on the coronavirus earlier this year but before it had spread in the country.
“Kelly’s for Kelly,” one recent ad from Warnock’s campaign claims, after calling Loeffler the richest member of the Senate. “Warnock is for us.”
Even some of the ads that are meant to take the edge off the polarizing race slip in some attacks. In a new ad from Perdue, seven women are gathered next to a hearth, chairs in a circle, trading compliments about the first-term senator. But at the end, one woman adds, “I know that David is not going to defund our police, and he is not going to gut the military.”
Amid all the negative ads, television viewers in Georgia may or may not notice the increasingly national message. Indeed, the airwaves are becoming so saturated that political ads often run back to back, sometimes occupying entire commercial blocks for a full television show. In the past seven days, campaigns and outside groups spent more than $50 million on television, airing 88 unique political ads across Georgia.
Some days in December, more than one-third of all ads in Georgia were political. In the 5 p.m. to 6 p.m. hour, home to local news broadcasts and a common target for political campaigns, more than 60% of all ads were political. Both figures outpaced the ad saturation during the general election, when numerous races were vying for airtime.
With so many ads blanketing the airwaves, political strategists and ad experts both concede that the returns can be diminishing.
“It’s like World War I, when they would sit there in the trenches, and they would shell each other for weeks, but then nothing would happen because everyone was in trenches and bunkers,” said Ken Goldstein, a professor of politics at the University of San Francisco. He said it was like “shelling impenetrable bases.”
But, at the same time, Goldstein noted, the budgets for these Senate races are seemingly limitless, and ad budgets do not appear to be ballooning at the expense of field or other programs. And when the Senate is in play in such a close race, any impact on voters can be worth it to donors.
“The stakes are so high and the margins are so tight that even a really inefficient strategy makes sense for people who are trying to control the United States Senate,” Goldstein said.

A few ingredients go a long way when it comes to hot chocolate bombs, a cozy treat that has quickly gained popularity on social media.
These chocolate balls may look unassuming from the outside, but when placed in a cup of warm milk, the outer shell “explodes” to reveal hot cocoa powder and marshmallows within. Once mixed together, it makes for a rich cup of hot chocolate, and a fun recipe to assemble and give as gifts to family and friends.
You’ll need a silicone mold with cavities about 2 1/2 inches wide, a pastry brush or clean paintbrush to spread the chocolate, and an instant-read thermometer to help you temper the chocolate. (Silicone chocolate molds have become hard to track down, but silicone cupcake liners make a good alternative.) While tempering your chocolate isn’t necessary, it’s worth the few extra steps to ensure that the chocolate dries smooth and hard, especially if you plan to give your hot chocolate bombs as gifts.
You can, and should, customize the recipe to fit your taste. Feel free to scale up or down depending on how large of a mold you would like to use and how rich you want your hot chocolate.
Decorating the hot chocolate bombs once you’ve assembled them is half the fun, although remember to stick to treats that will go well in your cup of cocoa, like holiday-themed sprinkles or crushed candy canes.
Time: About 2 hours
Yield : 6 hot chocolate bombs
12 ounces semisweet chocolate, finely chopped (1 1/3 cups)
6 tablespoons hot cocoa mix, plus more if desired
30 to 40 mini marshmallows
Sparkling sugar, sprinkles or crushed candy canes, for decoration
1. Temper the chocolate: Melt two-thirds of the chocolate (8 ounces) in a double boiler or heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water (or microwave in a microwave-safe bowl in 15-second intervals). Stir gently as it melts and use an instant-read thermometer to ensure it doesn’t exceed 100 degrees. The chocolate should be just melted and warm to the touch. Remove from the heat and add the remaining chocolate a few pieces at a time, stirring after each addition, until melted. Continue stirring until the temperature lowers to 88 to 91 degrees.
2 . Make the chocolate shells: You will need two 6-cavity silicone molds with 2 1/2-inch-diameter half-spheres. Using a pastry brush or a clean paintbrush, evenly coat the inside of each mold with about 1 teaspoon of melted chocolate. Repeat to make 12 half-spheres, working in batches if needed. Let the coated mold sit at room temperature until the chocolate is hard, 15 to 30 minutes. Repeat twice for three chocolate coatings total. If needed, reheat the melted chocolate to 88 to 91 degrees between coatings by stirring over simmering water or microwaving for 15 seconds.
3. Carefully remove the hardened chocolate shells from the mold. (If you have plastic gloves, wear them to prevent fingerprints on the chocolate.) To even out the shells’ edges, warm a pan on the stove over low heat and gently press the rims of the chocolate shells onto the pan for a few seconds. Transfer the shells to your mold or a muffin tin turned upside-down to let the edges set and to balance them while you assemble the bombs.
4. To assemble a hot chocolate bomb, grab two of the chocolate shells. Put 1 tablespoon hot cocoa mix and 5 to 6 mini marshmallows in one shell. (Adjust the amount of hot cocoa mix and marshmallows you put inside your bomb depending on how rich you want your hot chocolate.) Press the rim of the empty shell onto the warm pan until the chocolate begins to melt. Gently press the melted rim against the rim of the filled shell to create a ball. To seal the ball, paint a little of the remaining melted chocolate around the seam with the paintbrush, your finger or the back of a spoon. Repeat with the remaining ingredients.
5. Drizzle any remaining melted chocolate over the hot chocolate bombs and sprinkle sparkling sugar, sprinkles, crushed candy canes or any other edible decorations on top.
6. To serve, drop a hot chocolate bomb in 8 ounces (1 cup) of very warm milk in a mug and watch the chocolate shell melt away to reveal the marshmallows and hot cocoa inside. Stir until the chocolate completely melts and enjoy.

Texto completo: In this era of working from home and schooling from home and exercising from home and making sourdough from home, the question will soon present itself: What else is there to do from home?
For kids, the answer might be to publish a newspaper from home. And now there are ample apps and websites to turn their ideas into real publications.
Kids starting their own paper is like a dam with a crack. And the moment they realize they have complete agency to report what they want, write what they want, as well as add comics? That's the flood.
The upsides to a homegrown newspaper are myriad. Kids learn how to investigate and listen, differentiate between reliable and unreliable sources, research and fact-check, and, perhaps most importantly, learn that their own interests have value. Plus a kitchen-table newspaper does wonders for a child's writing and editing skills.
Children by their very inquisitiveness have the makings of a great journalists. They are innately curious, naturally unbiased and typically don't let up until their questions are answered.
Here are some instructions for any budding journalists wishing to embark on a do-it-yourself literary adventure.
Start with the name.
Most people find that the most inspiring first step is titling the publication. Maybe the newspaper is named after the kids' neighborhood, state or dog. Add a secondary word like Dealer, Daily, Weekly, Post, Bulletin, Sentinel, Gazette, Tribune, Globe, Observer, Journal or even Picayune, and you've got yourself a newspaper name.
Select a focus.
Next, they need to think about what topics they want to cover. If kids actually sit at a table and write down all of their ideas, they have technically had their first editorial meeting. Discipline and structure aren't going to be the easiest skills to embrace (they are likely to be the hardest), but they are necessary. Even in the loosest possible way.
Create sections.
Coming up with story ideas can be daunting, especially to little kids, so maybe start with the sections they want: sports, school, climate. Or perhaps politics, opinion or comics, jokes and games. Pets and snacks and presidential cartoons? Sure! Even the vaguest idea of sections will inform the work ahead.
Delegate responsibilities.
Whether working with siblings or other kids remotely, the teamwork required in establishing duties and meting out responsibilities cannot be underestimated. This phase is guaranteed to raise tempers; there may be tears. Once you have a sports editor, someone in charge of the cover art, a photo director, a makeshift city desk, perhaps even a food critic, tasks will flow easier and kids will come out stronger.
Gather the stories.
The first thing a reporter needs to know is where to get information. This is a great opportunity for kids to learn the difference between primary sources (an interview with the owner of a local music store) and secondary sources (reading a reliable article about the best music of 2020). While primary sources are always preferable, they're not always necessary.
The best reporting usually involves interviewing an expert. This might sound daunting until they realize: Everyone is an expert in something. The expert may be a teacher or a student talking about virtual learning, the owner of a dog rescue explaining how to adopt a pit bull or a local librarian on the best scary books for fifth-graders.
The young reporter's job is to find experts who can supply information that is both factual and relevant.
It may not always be possible to obtain interviews, so an understanding of credible online sources is important. Given that it is a crowdsourced content hub, Wikipedia cannot be trusted as a credible source. A good alternative is brittanica.com, any website with a .gov or .edu address, a reliable newspaper or Google Scholar.
Start writing.
For the novice, a question-and-answer format is a great place to start since it doesn't require much writing beyond transcribing the interview. Writing an actual article - one with an introduction, supporting facts and a conclusion - is terrific practice and often mirrors what sixth- and seventh-graders are learning in school.
Remember the puzzles and the comics.
History tells us that a newspaper is not a newspaper without a crossword. If there was ever a place to put arbitrary facts to good use, it is here. Puzzlemaker.discoveryeducation.com or CreateWordSearchPuzzle.com do the work of building the puzzle, so the kids can focus on the theme, the words and the clues.
The comics section will not be a hard sell. Websites such as storyboardthat.com and canva.com let the artist choose a scene, select a template and drop in characters.
Teach the value of intellectual property.
For a lot of kids, creating a piece of journalism will seem as simple as cutting and pasting an article from The New York Times and putting it in quotation marks with an attribution at the end. Have them put that piece in their own words and get another source. Encourage children to ask themselves where the idea came from, if they used any of the same words as one of their sources, or if they borrowed a phrase, joke or idea from someone else and forgot to give credit.
Call in the art department.
The creative director is very likely to be the same person as the sports editor and the crossword writer. Again, the rules of plagiarism apply: An amazing picture of a polar bear in the local paper is not up for grabs without permission or proper attribution. Kids can explore a stock website, such as istockphoto.com, which has a massive inventory of images for sale.
Put it all together.
Making it look like a real newspaper is the fun part. My Newspaper app (available on an iPhone or iPad), newspaperclub.com and makemynewspaper.com are all user-friendly options with pre-existing templates. Should the newspaper become a magazine, websites like flipsnack.com and canva.com can accommodate templates, layouts and printing.
Read all about it!
For distribution, kids can walk around the neighborhood, pass it out on the corner, maybe even start their own newspaper bike route. Just be sure each copy has an email address so that readers can comment on all the hard work.

When a superspreader event keeps spreading

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - When it was disclosed last spring that the coronavirus had stealthily infected 99 people after the Cambridge, Massachusetts, pharmaceutical company Biogen held a two-day conference in February, it helped add the term "superspreader" to the pandemic lexicon.
Little did anyone know how super the spread would actually become.
A new analysis of the Biogen event at a Boston hotel has concluded that the coronavirus strains set loose at the meeting have since migrated worldwide, infecting about 245,000 Americans - and potentially as many as 300,000 - by the end of October.
The virus strains spread to at least 29 states. They were found in Australia, Sweden and Slovakia. They wended their way from a room packed with biotechnology executives to Boston homeless shelters, where they also spread widely among occupants.
Those are just the infections. How many people were killed by the virus strains cannot be reliably estimated. Nor do the figures include infections among the 6 million Americans who have tested positive for the coronavirus since October, as infections have spiked.
"It's a cautionary tale," said Bronwyn MacInnis, a genomic epidemiologist at the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT. "When we hear these stories of clusters where 20 or 50 or 100 were affected, that does not account for what happens after."
A spokesman for Biogen did not respond to requests for comment on the report.
The analysis, by more than 50 health care experts and researchers based primarily in the Boston area, was published last week in Science, the journal of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. It is based on genetic analyses of the coronavirus taken from 28 people who attended the Biogen annual leadership conference, at a Marriott hotel on the Boston waterfront, on Feb. 26-27.
At the time, only 30 coronavirus infections had been confirmed in the United States, according to data compiled by The New York Times. More than a month earlier, Chinese authorities had quarantined the 11 million residents of Wuhan, where COVID-19 was first detected. But the epidemics that would ravage Europe were still on the horizon; Italy had recorded its first death only days earlier.
Some other companies had canceled international meetings out of caution, but Biogen forged ahead, bringing in 175 executives, including officials from Italy, Switzerland and Germany, for its leadership meeting. Within days, some were falling ill.
The analysis of 28 cases determined that each person had been infected with a strain of the coronavirus, named C2416T, that had not previously been seen in the United States. The only known instances of the strain that preceded the Biogen conference involved two French patients, ages 87 and 88.
"We think the mutation arose in early or mid-February," Dr. Jacob Lemieux, an infectious-disease specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital and a researcher at the Broad Institute, said in an interview. "We think there was a single importation into Boston, and that single importation was tightly linked to the spread that occurred at the conference."
That finding and a second marker - a mutation of C2416T that appears linked solely to some infections at the conference - enabled researchers to track the Cambridge strain across the nation and even the world, and make broad estimates that excluded cases unconnected to the meeting.
By May, it was estimated that between 44,000 and 56,000 known coronavirus cases were directly tied to the Biogen conference. About 40% were in Boston, but the C2416T strain was carried across the country, to Indiana, Florida, North Carolina and perhaps elsewhere by people who had been at the meeting.
Fresh data included in the current analysis raised the estimate to about 245,000 cases - as low as 205,000 and as high as 300,000 - in 29 states. The researchers estimated that the Cambridge strain of the virus was responsible for 1.9% of all known coronavirus cases in the United States through October.
Massachusetts was no longer a center of the outbreaks, although the virus strain remained widespread there. Instead, the researchers estimated that about 29% of all cases related to the Boston meeting occurred in Florida. Lemieux said scientists have no explanation for why the Cambridge strain of the virus grew so robustly there.
One of the study's more arresting findings was that within a month of the Biogen conference, the virus strain introduced there had made its way to Boston-area homeless shelters. Tests at the shelters, affiliated with the Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program, found 14 strains of the coronavirus, four of which appeared to have become superspreaders. The researchers found that two clusters of cases that resembled superspreader events were associated with the virus from the conference.
Lemieux said that offered a lesson for those who take a casual attitude toward the coronavirus. "That's just the interconnectivity of society," he said. "Our intuition about how disconnected we can be is not reliable. We are so connected that we don't appreciate the linkages and interactions we have."
He said it was impossible to say how the coronavirus was brought into the leadership meeting.
"We don't know whether it entered with somebody who was there for the conference, or it entered before the conference and was amplified by it," Lemieux said. "All we know is that we're not able to detect any spread with cases before the conference."
But in the months since the Biogen outbreak, the company has come under fire for staging an international conference at a time when the likelihood of a pandemic was becoming clearer.
The company said previously that it decided to hold the conference using the best information it had at the time.
But the study released this month only underscored concerns about that judgment, said John Carroll, the editor of Endpoints News, which covers the biotech industry.
"The irony, of course, is that a large drug company was responsible for triggering the mother of all superspreader events that played a major role in making the virus endemic in the U.S., killing more than 3,000 Americans a day," he said. "Top Biogen execs accidentally triggered a massive health care train wreck, and watched it play out from the sidelines."

WASHINGTON — Senators broke through an impasse late Saturday night over a Republican effort to curtail the powers of the Federal Reserve, clearing away what had been seen as the final hurdle to a deal on a $900 billion stimulus package as lawmakers raced against a Sunday night deadline to avoid a government shutdown.
With time running out for a compromise, Sen. Patrick J. Toomey, R-Pa., agreed to narrow his effort to rein in the central bank, according to three aides familiar with the discussion. All three aides, speaking on the condition of anonymity, noted that the precise language was still being finalized.
Toomey had sought to bar the Fed and Treasury Department from setting up any loan program similar to those established this year that have helped to keep credit flowing to corporate, municipal and medium-size business borrowers during the recession brought on by the coronavirus pandemic. The agreed-upon alternative, which was still being drafted near midnight on Saturday, aides familiar with the process said, would bar only programs that were more or less exact copycats of the ones newly employed in 2020.
The agreement was a critical breakthrough for lawmakers who have been racing to complete the emergency plan to rush direct payments, unemployment benefits and food and rental assistance to millions of Americans, as well as provide relief to businesses and funds for vaccine distribution. While negotiators were still wrangling over a number of smaller issues, the Federal Reserve language had emerged as the thorniest sticking point to a final agreement.
“If things continue on this path, and nothing gets in the way, we’ll be able to vote tomorrow,” Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., the minority leader, told reporters as he left the Capitol shortly before midnight. “House and Senate.”
In an indication that a final deal was close, House leaders notified lawmakers to expect votes as soon as early Sunday afternoon.
President Donald Trump, who has been absent from the frenzied negotiations on the measure, weighed in on Twitter, exhorting Congress to “GET IT DONE” and provide “more money in direct payments.”
The emerging deal would send direct payments of $600 to many Americans and provide enhanced federal jobless payments of $300 per week until early spring. It would also provide hundreds of billions of dollars to prop up small businesses, schools and other institutions struggling amid the pandemic.
With government funding set to lapse Sunday and both chambers hoping to merge the stimulus package with a catchall measure to cover all federal spending for the remainder of the fiscal year, time was dwindling to finalize the recovery plan and rush it to Trump’s desk.
Without action by Congress, two programs designed to expand and enhance unemployment benefits are set to expire in the coming days, leaving about 12 million Americans without federal support. A number of other benefits are set to expire at the end of the year.
Democrats had said that Toomey’s proposal, which had been embraced by Republicans, amounted to an attempt to undercut President-elect Joe Biden and his administration’s ability to continue supporting the country’s economic recovery.
The Fed rolled out a wide-ranging suite of emergency loan programs in response to market disruptions in March and April, and Congress allotted $454 billion to back up those efforts in the first pandemic stimulus law, enacted in March. But Toomey remained concerned for months that the programs might last past the end of the year. Though Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, moved to claw back the money in mid-November, Toomey insisted that the new stimulus measure close off the programs for fear that a new Treasury secretary might try to restart the effort next year, once Biden takes office.
As initially drafted, Toomey’s proposal would have prevented the Fed and the Treasury Department from reestablishing emergency lending programs that had been backed by the congressional appropriation, and would have barred the creation of “similar” programs going forward.
While it was not clear exactly what the new language would say, two aides familiar with the agreement said it would prevent the new Treasury secretary from revamping carbon copies of the pandemic lending programs. But under the compromise struck late Saturday, proposed by Schumer, it would not prevent Fed emergency programs from lending to states or medium-size businesses in the future, so long as the design of the programs was somewhat different, the people said.
Toomey had been particularly concerned that Democrats might harness the Fed’s powers to funnel cheap money to state and local borrowers. Democrats have been seeking additional avenues to provide relief to those governments.
“This agreement will preserve Fed independence and prevent Democrats from hijacking these programs for political and social policy purposes,” Steve Kelly, a spokesman for Toomey, said in a statement.
Toomey and his Republican allies argued that his original proposal merely codified what Congress intended in March when it enacted the original $2.2 trillion pandemic stimulus law, which earmarked funding to support the Fed’s emergency lending programs. But the scope of the language proposed by Toomey went beyond that, prompting alarm from Democrats, who said they were enlisting prominent figures to weigh in against it.
Ben S. Bernanke, who led the Fed through the 2008 financial crisis, had issued a statement warning that it was “vital that the Federal Reserve’s ability to respond promptly to damaging disruptions in credit markets not be circumscribed.”
Referring to the March stimulus law, Bernanke added, “The relief act should ensure, at least, that the Federal Reserve’s emergency lending authorities, as they stood before the passage of the CARES Act, remain fully intact and available to respond to future crises.”
Schumer said that Jerome H. Powell, the current Fed chair, whom he called “hardly a flaming liberal” was “strongly opposed” to Toomey’s proposal. The Fed declined to comment on whether Powell, a Republican who was first nominated as a central bank governor by former President Barack Obama, had discussed the issue with Schumer in recent days. Schumer’s office did not respond to a request for more details.
On a private call with House Democrats on Saturday, Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California denounced the proposal, telling lawmakers that “for them to write in there that this cannot happen ever again is just beyond the pale,” according to a person on the call, who disclosed the comments on the condition of anonymity.
“It’s a way for them to say to Joe Biden: ‘We are tying your hands. No matter what comes down the pike, you can’t do this,’” Pelosi told Democrats.
Toomey denied that he was seeking to hamstring the Biden administration, and pointed out that he had for months sought to ensure that the Fed’s pandemic programs sunset. But the language he had proposed to attach to the stimulus plan was more expansive than that.
Republican senators had rallied around Toomey on Saturday. Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, privately told them during an afternoon call with Mnuchin that they should stand firmly behind Toomey.
“Now that Democrats have agreed to a version of Toomey’s important language, we can begin closing out the rest of the package to deliver much-needed relief to families, workers, and businesses,” said Doug Andres, a spokesman for McConnell.
By early evening, there were indications that Toomey might be willing to compromise. During the rare Saturday session, he could be seen circulating on the Senate floor, vigorously debating the language with his colleagues. Twice, he was spotted in Schumer’s leadership suite, including shortly before 8 p.m. Saturday.

excerpt from New York Times article about Wilmington
You know these are strange times when the New York Times and Philadelphia Inquirer are bickering over Delaware. Each newspaper filed reports about Wilmington earlier this month, jumping on the trend of media attention focusing on the city as it continues to host President-elect Joe Biden's transition team and all the journalists that follow. "CBS This Morning," the Washington Post, Al Jazeera and the Daily Beast are among those that have delivered reports in recent months about their visits to the city that's "in the middle of it all," according to the official slogan. But the Times' front-page article — "After Centuries of Obscurity, Wilmington Is Having a Moment" — lit up Delaware social media with many upset at the depiction. It featured a photo of a Biden cutout at Spaceboy Clothing on North Market Street.
The sub-headline, which basically called the city boring, probably didn't help: "Joe Biden's hometown, known chiefly for its dull, corporate vibe, has become the center of the political universe. Residents are thrilled."
"This article enraged me. ... It made us seem like a dying town whose only hope was holding onto Joe's coattails," read one Facebook comment I saw.
Others basked in the attention, even if some of it was backhanded.
"I am upset! Only Delawareans are allowed to call Delaware dull," joked another, punctuating their comment with several laughing emoticons.
That article was soon followed by the Philadelphia Inquirer's somewhat snotty response in the form of a column titled "New York Times finds Biden's Delaware hometown on a map," which spent as much time mocking the Times as it did defending Wilmington.
"The Times showed the broken sign on the hamburger joint where Biden likes to pose for man-of-the-people photos off I-95, but complains this area lacks indigenous junk food," reads the column, referencing the Concord Pike Charcoal Pit. "If the reporter had asked around, he'd have found the Capriotti's deli's Bobbie."
Joe Biden beer & Le Cavalier
While Philadelphia and New York work out their superiority issues — leave us out of it — it's been fun regularly seeing Wilmington in the news with reporters dotting the Riverfront. Anytime you see Biden's transition announcements on television, he's on stage at The Queen concert venue on North Market Street where so many of us have let loose at shows.
On Delaware Day, Fox News' Peter Doocy was on Bret Baier's "Special Report" and hoisted a four-pack of Wilmington Brew Works' Biden beer dubbed Rail Car One: Wilmington to Washington on national television. (The beer sold out earlier that day shortly after being released.)
If you're looking for the most groan-worthy Wilmington moment in the media, it's not the Times' dispatch from a Pulitzer Prize winner. It's the final moment of Doocy's report.
"It's an IPA, but it might make you want to say, 'Ale to the Chief,'" he said with an overly satisfied smirk. In response, a stone-faced Baier could only muster, "Wow, I didn't think it was going to be that bad. But, Peter, nice try."
Wilmington and Biden also were featured in a Nov. 28 "CBS This Morning Saturday" food segment focusing on chef Tyler Atkin's takeover of the former Green Room at the Hotel du Pont, renamed Le Cavalier earlier this year.
CBS News political correspondent Ed O'Keefe, in town to cover the transition, focused mostly on the launch of a new restaurant during the COVID-19 pandemic, but he also interviewed Hotel du Pont co-owner Rob Buccini of the Buccini/Pollin Group about taking over the historic 107-year-old hotel.
"You don't think of yourself as anything other than a steward when you come in here. It's part of Delaware history and obviously part of the Biden history, as well," Buccini said, referencing both Biden's 1972 campaign celebration in the Gold Room and his March speech about coronavirus from the foyer of that very same room.
CBS News also published a Wilmington dispatch in October, which included some insight into which local businesses were getting some of Biden's campaign cash at the time. There was $2,000 spent on Smyrna-based Guzzy Q BBQ & Catering and $317 of breakfast food at Rehoboth Beach's Egg, located not far from Biden's summer house.
Delaware does late night
Wilmington's television attention has even hit late night. And, no, not in the form of jokes about Delaware for once. (Well, for the most part.)
New Castle-born actor Ryan Phillippe talked up his home state a bit on ABC's "Jimmy Kimmel Live" Nov. 16, recounting his road trip from Los Angeles to Delaware in his Tesla during the pandemic. "I'm from Delaware, which is a state having a moment right now," he said, drawing applause from the small in-studio crowd. "RIP to [Wilmington native] Aubrey Plaza and I being the most famous people from Delaware."
Kimmel jokingly interjected and told the "Big Sky" star, "I have news for you. Neither of you were already. He was the vice president before this!"
Plaza, the buzzworthy actress currently starring in the film "Black Bear," got in on the fun two weeks later on "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert." (The pair had previously poked fun at Wilmington during Colbert's "Community Corner" segment in 2019.)
Colbert mentioned a 2018 Delaware Online poll that found Plaza was a more famous Delawarean than Biden and wondered aloud if she could concede now that he's president-elect.
"I will not concede. And, in fact, I have many lawsuits coming after the Delaware News Journal, so they better watch out," she joked ... we hope.
"They better count all their clicks. It was an online poll and I want those clicks counted."
She reappeared on late-night TV to visit with "Late Night" host Seth Meyers on Dec. 9. And her answer to his question about must-visit spots in Wilmington might make the Inquirer angry and prove the Times' point.
"Honestly, Delaware is the kind of place where you have to find your own fun," she said, getting a big laugh. "One thing I did growing up — I think the kids still do it these days — it's called cruising the Pike. It basically means you just get in your car and drive up and down Route 202, called Concord Pike. It's just a bunch of strip malls."
She added: "Also, a lot of s--t goes down in the Wawa parking lot. I'd suggest [going there.] And I'd also suggest going to Trolley Square. That's where a bunch of bars are and it's a real scene. Trolleywood, we're calling it now."
While the television exposure has been wide, it's been the print media that seems to be most in love with quirky stories about the biggest city in our tiny state. An unexpected one came from North Carolina's Wilmington Star-News, which compared their Wilmington to our Wilmington.
The Gannett-owned newspaper pointed out some similarities. Both cities are named for Spencer Compton, the 1st Earl of Wilmington and the prime minister of Great Britain under King George II. And both sit along a winding river: Christina in Wilmington North and Cape Fear in Wilmington South.
"For years, these similarities and others were the cause of a persistent confusion between the Wilmingtons, with the local Wilmington and Beaches Convention & Visitors Bureau fielding numerous calls from misguided vacationers," the story reads.
The Washington Post's deep dive into "lovely little Delaware" came shortly after Biden's election win, titled, "Delaware is famous for corporations, chemicals, chickens — and now, finally, a president."
It went over better than the Times' more recent attempt, even if its focus also was on our, um, uniqueness.
"Imagine a place that seems less a state than a fabled land hatched from Aesop or the Brothers Grimm. A microbe on the map, a Mid-Atlantic territory of onlys, we-don't-have-thats and so much poultry," the article opens. "Only three counties, two major universities, one U.S. House representative, a solitary area code. No major professional sports teams, no major television stations, no large commercial airports, no mountains, no valleys.
"Ninety-six miles in length, 35 miles at its widest, nine miles at its narrowest, 609 times more chickens than people. But — take that, doubters! — it boasts Joseph R. Biden Jr., the future 46th president of the United States."
Sure, we don't have much space to move around in Delaware, but that didn't stop The Daily Beast, which sent a reporter to Wilmington in November for a travel story, "Forget Scranton, Wilmington Is the Biden City Worth Visiting." It's part of their "It's Still a Big World" series that examines underrated destinations.
"In the past, Wilmington was just that mid-sized city off of I-95, the one you pass by on your way to Baltimore or Washington. Get off I-95 and check out Wilmington," the Beast advised in the glowing piece.
Among the spots visited: The Grand, the Riverfront, Russell Peterson Wildlife Refuge, Le Cavalier, Bardea and more.
Wilmington Mayor Mike Purzycki told them the city "has always been known as the corporate capital and the chemical capital of the world ... And along with that went a certain kind of stiff-shirtedness ... that's what the city was forever." But he added that the city was redefining itself, pointing to restaurants and nightlife.
It's that Wilmington mentioned in an Al Jazeera article late last month, which included interviews with both Cavanaugh's Restaurant owner Tim Pawliczek and Chelsea Tavern owner Joe Van Horn. They both spoke about COVID-19's impact on their businesses.
Van Horn told of the scene at his North Market Street restaurant on the heady night of Biden's victory speech outside at The Chase Center on the Riverfront: "We had a line out the door. We got crushed."
Restaurants also were the focus of Food & Wine magazine's October tour of Wilmington in a piece headlined, "Everybody Knows Joe': I Ate at Biden's Favorite Hometown Restaurants." The lead photograph showed Biden holding an overflowing plate of spaghetti in Mississippi while campaigning earlier this year.
They visited a lot of spots: The Charcoal Pit, Ciro Food & Drink, Buckley's Tavern, Cafe Verdi, Piccolina Toscana, Le Cavalier, La Fia, Wilmington Green Box, Walt's Chicken Express, Capriotti's, Claymont Steak Shop and Bardea, where Biden and wife Jill once celebrated her birthday. (Antacid anyone?)
Biden's belly has favorites, which were revealed by some of the owners and chefs. It's chicken Parmigiana at Cafe Verdi and cappellini al pomodoro at Piccolina Toscana, unless he's "feely racy" and going with penne al pomodoro instead. The only spot dinged by the writer was Capriotti's. It came after they the popular Thanksgiving-on-a-roll Bobbie sandwich, a Biden favorite.
"Cold, dry turkey, stuffing that tasted like Stovetop, too much cranberry sauce, and mayo on a soft hero roll, the Bobbie was only barely redeemed by the hot peppers that I got on the side. This Philly native is sticking to her hoagies," they sniped.
The Delaware Online/News Journal reporter covering Biden, Meredith Newman, tells me she hears out-of-town media talk about the city while they all await the future 46th president of the United States.
And it's not the trashing you might expect. "They often go, 'Ya know, the restaurants here aren't that bad.'"
We'll take it. But if you disrespect the Bobbie again, we know a pretty powerful guy who will set you straight.

Weight training may ease anxious feelings Lunges, lifts, squats and crunches eased anxiety levels in men and women

Texto completo: Roiled by concerns about the pandemic? Lifting weights might help, according to a timely new study of anxiety and resistance training. The study, which involved healthy young adults, barbells and lunges, indicates that regular weight training substantially reduces anxiety, a finding with particular relevance during these unsettling, bumpy days.
We already have plenty of evidence that exercise helps stave off depression and other mental ills, and that exercise can elevate feelings of happiness and contentment. But most past studies of exercise and moods have looked at the effects of aerobic exercise, like running on a treadmill or riding a stationary bike.
Scientists only recently have begun to investigate whether and how weight training might also affect mental health. A 2018 review of studies, for instance, concluded that adults who lift weights are less likely to develop depression than those who never lift. In another study, women with clinical anxiety disorders reported fewer symptoms after taking up either aerobic or weight training.
But many of these studies involved frequent and complicated sessions of resistance exercise performed under the eyes of researchers, which is not how most of us are likely to work out. They also often focused on somewhat narrow groups, such as men or women with a diagnosed mental health condition like depression or an anxiety disorder, limiting their applicability.
So for the new study, which was published in October in Scientific Reports, researchers at the University of Limerick in Ireland and other institutions decided to see if a simple version of weight training could have benefits for mood in people who already were in generally good mental health.
To find out, they recruited 28 physically healthy young men and women and tested their current moods, with a particular emphasis on whether the volunteers felt anxious. All the participants scored in a healthy range on detailed anxiety questionnaires.
The scientists then divided these well-adjusted volunteers into two groups. Half were asked to continue with their normal lives as a control group. The others began to weight train, a practice with which few were familiar.
The scientists had devised a helpfully simple resistance training routine for them, based around health guidelines from the World Health Organization and the American College of Sports Medicine. Both those organizations recommend muscle strengthening at least twice a week, and that's what the volunteers began doing. After initial instruction from the researchers, the volunteers took up a basic program of lunges, lifts, squats and crunches, sometimes using dumbbells and other equipment.
Their training continued for eight weeks. Throughout, both groups periodically repeated the tests of their anxiety levels, including at the end of the full program. (After the study ended, the control group was given the option of starting the weight training routine.)
As expected, the control group, for the most part, retained their original low levels of anxiety. They still felt about as tranquil as eight weeks before.
But the weight trainers scored about 20% better on the tests of anxiety. They had started with low levels of anxiety to begin with, but felt even less anxious now.
This effect was "larger than anticipated," says Brett Gordon, a postdoctoral scholar at the Penn State Cancer Institute at Penn State College of Medicine, who was a co-author of the study with Matthew Herring, Cillian McDowell and Mark Lyons. The benefits for mental health were greater, in fact, than those often seen in studies of aerobic exercise and anxiety. But Gordon cautions that such comparisons are limited, since the various experiments use different amounts of exercise and measures of moods.
The new study also did not delve into how weight training can affect anxiety. But Gordon and his colleagues suspect increased physical and psychological potency figure in. The lifters became stronger over time and able to lift heavier weights. "Feelings of mastery may have occurred" then, he says, leaving people feeling generally more capable of coping. Molecular changes in the lifters' muscles and brain likely also occurred and contributed to improvements in their moods, he says, noting that future studies may help to detail some of those changes.
Of course, this experiment featured only healthy young people performing one version of training, so the findings cannot tell us if lifting likewise eases anxiety in older people. Nor can it tell us which regimen might be enough, too much or just the right amount to bolster mental health. Finally, it also does not prove that heading to the gym today can acutely soothe any mental turmoil we may be feeling, since the improvements in the study showed up after weeks of training.
But if you are feeling tense and uptight, as so many of us are these days, becoming stronger is probably a worthwhile goal and need not be intimidating, Gordon says. "There are numerous ways to strength train with little to no equipment," he says. "Try common body weight exercises, such as pushups, situps or squats, or use household items as weights."
You can find more information about do-it-yourself weight training in The New York Times' Well Guides "How to Get Strong" and "How to Build Muscle in 9 Minutes."

They Turned Articles Into Poetry

Texto completo: Almost 100 readers submitted centos, collage-poems drawn from this newspaper. Here, a selection of their verse.
In her essay collection, "Vesper Flights," the poet and writer Helen Macdonald talks about encountering the natural world in field guides. They "made possible the joy of encountering a thing I already knew but had never seen before," she writes.
Poetry is a field guide of sorts. Whenever we read a poem, we are experiencing something for the first time: familiar or not. We take a step with the poet into a moment in time and see it through the writer's eyes.
In "Turn Articles into Poetry" (Nov. 29), readers had the opportunity to create a cento, a collage-poem of lines taken from the newspaper, and share it with the At Home section. On display here is a selection of some of the almost 100 centos that were received. Each reads like a guide to remembering our joy, our uniqueness, our gratitude, our imagination and our hope.
Writing poetry encourages us to escape, to create, to feel, to breathe, to forgive, to know better, to accept and to play. Some of these poems take us into brighter days that lie ahead while others instruct us on how to live "together but apart" in these moments at home. Whether playing with font size, line breaks, white space or page margins, all of them ask us to examine the unknown within us and outside of us as a way to move forward.
These centos invite you to take what you know and what you can only imagine into the new year, and most importantly, to keep creating.

Texto completo: Seeking inspiration from Vincent Canby's Gothic trestle table.
Because of the pandemic, I have Vincent Canby's desk. Millions of witty words must have drummed from his fingertips where I now slouch, stalled and mostly unproductive, without deadlines to drive me.
During a 35-year career at The New York Times that ended in 2000, Mr. Canby wrote thousands of reviews and profiles, plus novels and plays in his spare time. Just look at the adjective in the headline of his Times obituary, published 20 years ago: "Vincent Canby, Prolific Film and Theater Critic for The Times, Is Dead at 76." His byline even appeared nearly three years after his death, an advance 3,212-word obituary of Bob Hope, painting him as "a fast-talking wiseguy, a quaking braggart, an appealing heel with a harmless leer and a ready one-liner."
It's a lot to live up to. Could his desk help straighten my spine, get me back in the game?
My friend Ridgely Trufant, whose mother was Mr. Canby's first cousin, inherited his estate, including his personal desk: six feet long, chocolate-hued with gargoyle legs and brawny, clawed feet. A rail of timber embellished with chiseled rosettes supports the structure, so it's actually called a trestle table, Google tells me.
I have scrutinized its undersides, crannies and shallow drawer with a flashlight and found no identifying markers other than a strip of masking tape on the left side labeled "6755." The lot number or price Mr. Canby paid for it? Ridgely doesn't know, but suspects her cousin bought it in the 1960s or '70s when he lived in Brooklyn Heights, and Atlantic Avenue was lined with antique shops.
I found a photo online of Mr. Canby posed at the desk in 1980, an ashtray to the right of his typewriter. I've framed it, so he's here to challenge me, his eyes contemplating something in the distance, his smile a little skeptical. By this time he had settled into a roomy apartment on the Upper West Side, where he put up Ridgely when she came to the city to be a dancer.
In the mid-1980s, Ridgely and I met at Perretti Italian Café on Columbus Avenue, where we were both waitresses. Mr. Canby, at the height of his career as a film critic, would sometimes visit the restaurant. As a cinephile and aspiring writer, I revered his opinion, and he was curious about mine, never treating me like a peon because my job involved an apron. His erudite, lucid film reviews drove me to haunt now-bygone theaters like the Thalia, the Beekman, the Plaza, the 57th Street Playhouse, the 68th Street Playhouse, and Lincoln Plaza Cinemas.
Since all movie houses went dark in March, the Criterion Channel has served as my personal theater, its vintage offerings leading me to reread scores of Mr. Canby's reviews before I ever dreamed of possessing his desk. We don't always agree, but they hold up, lively and illuminating as ever.
In 1993, he switched to the theater beat. He often took Ridgely as his guest when reviewing shows, and Perretti's was a convenient stop on his way home. His longtime girlfriend, Penelope Gilliatt, had died that year, at 61. Another prolific writer, her short stories, profiles and film criticism had appeared in The New Yorker, her screenplay for "Sunday, Bloody Sunday" was nominated for an Oscar, and she wrote five novels.
Ridgely said Mr. Canby deeply loved Penelope, but at Perretti's he was adroit at masking his grief, charming and quick to laugh. He sat in the smoking section and started with a vodka on the rocks. He had a trim physique and dressed like a dapper newspaperman in a tweed jacket with elbow patches, Oxford shirt buttoned just so, his short gray hair neatly parted.
One night in particular endeared him to me. I can see him at Table 3, looking up and asking me how I was.
Terrible, I told him. I had moved to New York from Arkansas to be a writer and didn't have to be at work until 4 o'clock and yet had written nothing that day.
"You are a real writer!" he declared, jutting his brown cigarette at me. "That's exactly how I feel if a day goes by and I haven't written anything. Just lousy."
I was a waitress at Perretti's for 13 years. The restaurant's health care plan was invaluable as I advanced my freelance writing career, covering the entertainment world, restaurants and travel. When the restaurant closed in 1998, I hung up my apron, and doggedly got enough assignments to write full time.
Those gigs were consistent until this March, when restaurants and travel shut down. I used to wonder what I might accomplish -- a novel, a biography, a play, a sellable screenplay -- if I didn't have constant deadlines. It turns out I'm teeming with ideas, but without an editor checking in on me, I lack focus.
Other productive writer friends have expressed similar chagrin. A tweet from David Wondrich struck a chord, likening these unnatural days to "writing with a head full of molasses and fireflies."
In the first few months of the shutdown, I, like many other New Yorkers, found purpose in decluttering the apartment, culling books and getting rid of obsolete bank statements, press materials and embarrassing screenplays. Some of my aborted creative writing projects made me cringe, while others made me tilt my head, thinking, Not so bad. Why hadn't I tackled another draft?
Maybe it was the lack of a real, official desk that left me uninspired. In 22 years of being a professional writer, I had never put much thought into my work space. Until this year, I wrote on a slab of wood propped up by two black file cabinets.
The coronavirus changed that. In August, I found myself on a Zoom chat that included Ridgely. She lives in a one-bedroom apartment in the West Village, where she had recently committed herself to multiple virtual movement classes taught by yogis, choreographers and tango taskmasters around the world. Her living room had become a dance studio, with one big problem.
"I've got to get rid of Vin's desk," she said.
My hand shot up.
The Canby desk is a gem. I spent most of an afternoon rubbing its broad tabletop with beeswax polish and plugged away with a toothbrush to gouge the lint from legs bulging with cartoonish round eyes, libertine tongues and feathery toes. Curious about its provenance, I emailed photographs of it to antique shops and auction houses, but got no definitive answer other than that it was probably made in Europe in the mid- to late-19th century.
I do know one thing: The desk should stay in the Canby family. I have retooled my will to leave it to Ridgely or her survivors. In the meantime, here I sit, rebuilding my writing life sentence by sentence. I just got an unexpected assignment for 3,000 words. The deadline is calling me back to work, and the desk feels like an old friend here to help.

Texto completo: As African-American women continue to break barriers, nurse Sandra Lindsay who works at a hospital in Queens, N.Y., became the first person to take the COVID-19 vaccine in the United States. This historic moment was televised, she said, according to the New York Times, in order to "inspire people who look like me."
Let's face it, while Black people are dying in disproportionate numbers from the novel coronavirus, many African Americans are hesitant about taking the vaccine. According to a Pew Research article, Blacks are three times more likely to die of COVID-19 than Whites because of pre-existing issues, however, less than half of African Americans are comfortable with getting the vaccine, in comparison to Latinos and Whites.
Some of the hesitation in the Black community surrounding the vaccine roots from instances where African Americans were used in experimentations surrounding vaccines and medicine. For 40 years, beginning in 1932, the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) legally studied syphilis, through the Tuskegee Experiment, observing, originally, 600 African-American men. The patients'were not being treated and actually receiving placebos and minimal relief, although by 1947 penicillin was used to remedy syphilis. By the time a story was leaked in 1972, calling attention to the atrocities of the experiment, 28 participants had died from syphilis, 100 more had passed away from complications, 40 participants had been diagnosed with the disease and 19 children had been born with it.
Baltimore's Johns Hopkins also has its own shaky history with Black people and experimentation, like in the case of Henrietta Lacks, whose cervical cancer cells were unknowingly used when discovered as the first immortal human cell line. Lacks' cells doubled every 20 to 24 hours. According to Hopkins Medicine, the HeLa cells, named after the first two letters of Lacks' first and last names, are historic and now used to study the effects of toxins, drugs, hormones, viruses, growth of cancer cells, radiation, poisons. Lacks' cells even played a major role in the development of the polio vaccine. Despite her major contributions to science, Lacks, who died in 1951 at the age of 31, would never know that her cells were used.
On the Dec. 10 episode of the AFRO show "Chicken Boxx," the theme was Black People vs. the Vaccine, with special guest Vice President and Chief Diversity Officer of Johns Hpkins Medicine Dr. Sherita Hill Golden. As is the purpose of "Chicken Boxx," which airs every Thursday at noon on the AFRO's Facebook, in a lively, intergenerational and interactive conversation, Dr. Golden worked to dispel myths within the Black community, this time, about the vaccine.
"Black people will not be used as lab rats," Dr. Golden told the AFRO.
The Hopkins chief diversity officer said that Black people voluntarily participated in the vaccination trials.
"Of course as a scientist I want to know how to educate my people. I've gone and looked at the two clinical trials of the vaccines currently at the FDA, [and] about 10% of those studies were African American. They all signed a consent form and agreed to participate, so [it was] no experimentation from that standpoint. So it's about 4,000 people in the Pfizer trial and about 3,000 in the Moderna trial so it's important to know that some of us have volunteered to be a part of those studies."
Lindsay, 52, volunteered to be the first in the country to receive the COVID-19 vaccination, which was administered by a Black woman, Dr. Michelle Chester, at Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New York on Dec. 14. The Queens nurse said that she felt relieved and optimistic after receiving the vaccination.
"It is a huge sense of relief for me...and hope," Lindsay said to the New York Times.
Dr. Golden explained that she trusts N.I.H.'s Director of Infection Diseases Dr. Anthony Fauci, the FDA and her own research when it comes to taking the disease, and is confident that the side effects will be normal and comparable to those experienced when taking a flu shot.
"Like any vaccine, there are side effects. Like the flu shot: when you get it, your arm is sore for a couple days, or you feel achy. That happens with the regular flu shot, fatigue, fever, but that will go away in about 48 hours. It's just the natural immune response to it. For the COVID-19 shot, there are two shots, it's not one shot, like the flu is. It's not so much that you're getting sick, it's that your body is developing your immune response, so that's what you're feeling," Golden explained.
The doctor explained that while the COVID-19 vaccine may sound scary and bring back hard memories of racism against Black bodies, Africans Americans must consider the benefit in arming themselves against the novel coronavirus.
"We have to realize as Black people, we also get sick from the coronavirus and we're dying so we have to weigh the benefits here," Golden said.

Giuliani touts new election challenge strategy as Trump mulls Sidney Powell wild card

Texto completo: Rudy Giuliani said the Trump legal team is retooling its strategy to focus more on voting machines, even as the companies that provide the hardware and software used in the 2020 election demand retractions of fraud claims that have not held up in court.
Giuliani, who is President Trump’s personal attorney and who has been spearheading the effort to overturn President-elect Joe Biden’s victory, appeared Saturday morning on Steve Bannon’s War Room podcast and spoke about a concerted shift in strategy after a series of deliberations on Friday, which are beginning to generate alarming headlines about the extreme measures that the president is considering in the final month of his term in office.
“We met pretty much on and off all day yesterday, and starting this morning, there’s a completely different strategy,” Giuliani told Bannon, who was Trump’s 2016 campaign chief executive officer and later the White House's chief strategist for much of 2017. “The strategy is going to focus a great deal on some evidence we have about some of these machines that could throw off these states in a matter of maybe a one- or two-day audit."
The conversation took place at nearly the same time the New York Times first reported details of a White House meeting on Saturday, which included Giuliani by phone.
The president raised the prospect of Sidney Powell, an attorney involved in the Michael Flynn case who has been involved in several unsuccessful election lawsuits even after being disavowed by the Trump legal team, being made special counsel to investigate allegations of election fraud. Flynn, who was briefly Trump's first national security adviser and was recently pardoned by the president, also participated, and Trump brought up his recent suggestion about using the military to "rerun" the election in swing states.
The report said White House counsel Pat Cipollone and chief of staff Mark Meadows pushed back on these proposals.
During his interview with Bannon, Giuliani echoed claims that voting machines were used to throw the election to Biden in several key battleground states. He said that the Trump team wants to audit voting machines in Georgia, Arizona, Michigan, and Pennsylvania — all states that Biden won.
He said that Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a conservative who was formerly one of the president’s closest allies, and Arizona’s Republican Gov. Doug Ducey were involved in a “cover-up” following the election and claimed that digging deeper into the machines could bear fruit for Trump. Despite criticisms by Trump and his allies, Kemp attended the White House Christmas party on Friday.
“I think we can get these accomplished despite the resistance and the cover-up of the Republican governors, the guy in Arizona and the guy in Georgia — if we had their cooperation, we could have it ended by Monday,” Giuliani said. “I’m tired of dealing with them. We just push them aside, and I think over the weekend, you’ll see different strategies being employed.”
When pushed to describe exactly what he meant by the new strategy and what could be done to prove there was actual fraud, Giuliani pointed to the machines.
“In the state of Arizona, make 200 machines available — we could do it publicly. We could have the press there. … Give us eight hours, and we’ll show you how many false votes were in this machine and how it was used to manipulate the vote,” he said.
Much of Giuliani and Powell’s accusations focus on Dominion Voting Systems, which recently sent Powell a letter demanding that she retract her claims that the Canadian-founded company, now based in Denver, has ties to Venezuela and China.
“This is a voting machine designed way back in Venezuela to fix elections,” Giuliani said at one point, echoing a conspiracy theory about the election.
John Poulos, the CEO of the company, voluntarily testified under oath before the Michigan Senate’s Oversight Committee on Tuesday. This event took place before the backdrop of Powell’s so-called “Kraken” lawsuits, which have failed to produce any wins.
“Dominion is not and has never been a front for communists,” Poulos said. “It has no ties to Hugo Chavez, the late dictator of Venezuela. We have never been involved in Venezuelan elections. Its machines have never been used in Venezuela.”
“There are no ownership ties to any political parties nor to foreign governments. Dominion has no ties to the Pelosi family, Feinstein family, Clinton family, or George Soros,” he added, referring to powerful names in Democratic circles.
Also this past week, Smartmatic, another company that deals with electronic voting systems, sent a letter issuing legal notices and demanding retractions from Fox News, Newsmax, and One America News Network for “publishing false and defamatory statements.”
On Friday, Fox Business host Lou Dobbs aired what was effectively a fact-check segment of his own claims about election security involving Smartmatic, and Mediaite reported that the same segment will air on Jeanine Pirro's Fox News show Saturday night and Maria Bartiromo's on Sunday.
In speaking with Bannon, Giuliani touched on Maricopa County, Arizona, where the Board of Supervisors voted 4-1 on Friday to fight a pair of election subpoenas, including one that called for a full forensic audit of the county’s voting machines and software. This followed what was billed as a "forensic audit" of Dominion machines in Antrim County, Michigan, that state and Dominion officials have cast as error-ridden and purposefully misleading.
“Why would you even not want people to look at voting machines?” Giuliani asked.
“The only reason you would be resisting our examining those machines is because you know you did something crooked,” he said.
In addition to hinting at a new strategy related to voting machines, Giuliani called for protests over the outcome of the election.
“I also think it’s time for Republicans in those states where we have turncoat Republicans to demonstrate,” he said. “I think it’s time to let the governor of Georgia know that we think he’s a traitor to the Republican Party. Not only that, he’s a traitor to the sense of a fair election. He won’t even listen to my evidence.”
The New York Times reported on Saturday that Trump received pushback from most of his advisers, including Giuliani, when he discussed the idea of making Powell a special counsel. During the Friday meeting, the prospect of an executive order to seize voting machines and examine them was also reportedly discussed, as was having the Department of Homeland Security involved.
The DHS's cybersecurity agency released a joint statement with partners in mid-November that asserted the 2020 election was "the most secure in American history," adding, "There is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised."
Trump fired its chief, Chris Krebs, while stating his disagreement with the agency's determination. Also departing next week is Attorney General William Barr, who is in a position to appoint a special counsel, a couple of weeks after he said that the Justice Department had not seen evidence to support claims of widespread voter fraud.
Biden’s share of the Electoral College is 306-232. He also bested the president in the popular vote, taking in some 81.2 million ballots, more than 7 million than who voted for Trump.

Jean Graetz, who was among the few white people in Montgomery, Alabama, to participate in the city’s civil rights movement in the 1950s — pushing forward even as she faced slashed tires, obscene phone calls and multiple bombings — died Wednesday at her home in Montgomery. She was 90.
The cause was lung cancer, said Kenneth Mullinax, a family friend. She died just three months after her husband, Robert, with whom she had partnered in her civil rights efforts.
“Bob and Jeannie were just one of those couples, like Romeo and Juliet,” Mullinax said. “One could not survive without the other.”
The couple arrived in Montgomery in 1955 after Robert Graetz, a newly minted Lutheran minister trained in Ohio, was assigned to a predominantly Black church. Black Lutherans were rare in Alabama, and it was even more rare for a white minister to preach to them, let alone to live in their neighborhood as the Graetzes did.
Although Robert Graetz was the headliner of the couple, preaching to his flock every Sunday, Jean Graetz played an equal part behind the scenes, organizing events and building connections with members of the city’s civil rights movement.
“My mother didn’t like to look at them as a team,” her daughter Carolyn Graetz Glass said in a phone interview. “She was happy to let our dad shine. But there was no Bob without Jeannie, and no Jeannie without Bob.”
Rosa Parks, one of their neighbors, used a room in the church, Trinity Lutheran, to hold meetings of the local NAACP chapter. When Parks was arrested in 1955 for refusing to give up her seat on a segregated bus, Jean Graetz was among the women who began planning what turned into a yearlong boycott of the city’s public transportation. The boycott would propel Martin Luther King Jr., who emerged as its leader, into the international spotlight.
While her husband used his pulpit to spread the latest news about the boycott, Jean Graetz dived into the endless organizational tasks, like arranging for child care, preparing lunches and lining up interviews between the boycott’s leaders and the retinue of reporters who descended on Montgomery. An empty lot behind the Graetzes’ house was used to hold the many cars lent to the bus boycott by sympathizers.
White people who worked with Black congregations already walked a fine line in Montgomery, afforded a limited dispensation according to “the same social calculus that allowed doctors to visit a brothel in a medical emergency,” historian Taylor Branch wrote in “Parting the Waters: America in the King Years, 1954-63.”
The backlash from the white community for violating those limits was immediate, and virulent. Jean Graetz received scores of threatening phone calls. She found sugar poured into the gas tank of their car and the tires slashed.
In August 1956, while the couple was with Parks in Tennessee at the Highlander Folk School, a civil rights training center, a bomb exploded in their front yard. Five months later, another bomb hit their house, shattering windows and breaking a door, this time while they were asleep inside with their newborn son, David. Another, much larger bomb failed to detonate; a neighbor who had been trained in explosives in the Army came over to help disarm it.
Parks came over as well, and helped Jean Graetz sweep up the broken glass while Robert Graetz dealt with the police. Several suspects were arrested. An all-white jury acquitted them.
The Graetzes, never flinching, went right back to their civil rights work.
“There are nice fuzzy liberals, and then there are the Graetzes,” Jeanne Theoharis, a professor of political science at Brooklyn College and author of “The Rebellious Life of Mrs. Rosa Parks” (2013), said in an interview. “It’s not a one-off resolve. To do what they did requires doing it every day.”
Robert Graetz received a new assignment, to a church in Ohio, in 1956. He declined the offer. But he could not do the same two years later. The couple moved back north, and Robert Graetz served in a series of churches in Ohio and Washington, D.C.
But the Graetzes returned to Montgomery several times, often with their children — they ultimately had seven — including for the last leg of the march from Selma to Montgomery in 1965 in support of the Voting Rights Act.
They also became active in civil rights and other movements in Ohio. Their first arrest — but not their last — was in 2000, when they blocked a parking garage as part of a protest for LGBTQ rights in Cleveland. They were later arrested after taking part in similar protests in Washington and Indianapolis.
“They always taught us to be protective of the ones being bullied and picked on,” said their daughter Meta Ellis, who with her wife leads an LGBTQ rights organization in Montgomery.
Jean Ellis was born on Dec. 24, 1929, on a farm in East Springfield, Pennsylvania, near the state’s border with Ohio. Her parents, Marshall and Marian (Smith) Ellis, were farmers.
In addition to her daughters Ellis and Glass, Graetz is survived by two other daughters, Diann and Katherine Graetz; two sons, David and Jonathan Graetz; four sisters, Ruth Warner, Lola Mitchell, Kathleen Iamaio and Mary Maxwell; 26 grandchildren; 17 great-grandchildren; and one great-great grandson. A son, Robert S. Graetz III, died in 1991.
Graetz met her husband at Capital University in Columbus, Ohio, where she was studying elementary education and he was studying theology. They married in 1951. When he graduated that same year, two years ahead of her, and received his first preaching assignments — Los Angeles, followed by Montgomery — she left school to follow him.
After the Graetzes returned to Montgomery in 2005, she went back to school to complete her studies, attending Alabama State University, a historically Black college. She graduated in 2015.
The couple, often dressed in color-coordinated outfits of her choosing, became a fixture in Montgomery’s activist community, helping to run the National Center for the Study of Civil Rights and African-American Culture at Alabama State.
In 2018, a handwritten note by Parks documenting their friendship came up for auction. Robert and Jean Graetz, never wealthy, bought it for $9,375. They immediately donated it to the university.
“Sacrifice is something they did their entire life,” said Mullinax, the couple’s friend. “So it really doesn’t surprise me that they would sacrifice financially at the end of their life. It ties it all up in a bow.”

How to Make Your House Merry and Really Bright

If you’ve never decorated the outside of a house before, the prospect of climbing a ladder up onto your roof can seem like a daunting proposition. But with a little strategy and planning, your home could be the shining jewel of the block.
Choose Your Spot
You don’t have to light up your entire property to make a statement. Instead, choose a focal point, and make it shine. Perhaps it’s your front door. Or maybe it’s the cherry tree in the front yard. Whatever spot you choose, focus your energy (and light bulbs) there.
“You’ll get a much bigger impact than you will trying to spread it all over the yard,” said Benjamin Bradley, star of the Netflix series “Holiday Home Makeover with Mr. Christmas.”
Don’t underestimate the power of a landscaping spotlight, which can draw attention to a single element. Bradley’s grandparents had a holly in their yard and every year they would put a big red bow on it and aim a spotlight on it. “You knew Christmas was here,” he said. “It was beautiful and simple.”
Map It Out
If you’re planning to go big, sketch out your vision ahead of time so you can buy all the lighting and garlands you need before you climb the ladder. Figure out what power sources you’ll be using — and how the decorations will reach those outlets. Do you need extension cords? More surge protectors? Get them ahead of time and avoid a frantic last-minute trip to the hardware store.
“If we’re going to put a snowman at the end of the driveway and a Santa Claus in the middle of the driveway, each of those need an independent power source,” said John DeCosmo, president of Ulta-Lit Tree Co., which makes a tool to locate broken bulbs. So before you buy that huge inflatable reindeer, make sure you have an outlet for it.
Choose Bulbs Wisely
There are two main types of bulbs — LEDs and incandescents. LEDs tend to give off a cooler light, incandescents a warmer one. Choose one option and stick with it because otherwise, the contrast between warm and cool lights can feel jarring. (LEDs tend to be more expensive upfront, but use less electricity over time.)
You can, however, mix the styles, sizes and colors of bulbs. “I still love the big C7 multicolored lights, you can see them from miles away,” said Bradley, who prefers to reserve the miniature bulbs for indoor lighting.
Hide Your Dirty Work
Yes, lights are all about the night. But people can still see your house in the daytime and it shouldn’t look like an eyesore. Cut tags off the cords before you hang the lights and decorations. Wrap lights in garland to hide the wires. Tuck extension cords along the ground beneath mulch or evergreen branches. Be neat in your work, keeping the wires taut so they don’t hang down from the rooflines.
Be Safe
Gravity is not your friend, so be careful up on that roof or on that ladder, always working with a partner who can spot you. Nobody wants to be “the cowboy who goes up on the ladder and he’s going to get the whole job done in an hour,” DeCosmo said. “And then they’re in E.R.”
Use surge protectors so you do not overload your outlets. Remember that all this stuff will be outside in the winter elements. Properly secure your decorations so a wind gust does not land your 12-foot-tall snowman in your neighbor’s yard.
Take your time, be patient and the final result will be cheerful and bright.

He Always Wanted to Be a ‘Garbageman.’ Now He’s the Commissioner.

NEW YORK — When a teacher asked a classroom of third graders what they wanted to be when they grew up, boys shouted out professions like “baseball player” and “astronaut.”
But one student, Eddie, declared, “I want to be a garbageman like my father.”
The teacher disapproved. “Don’t you think he’d want you to be better than that?”
Edward Grayson, now 44, was insulted yet undeterred. This past week, Grayson, who was appointed acting commissioner of the New York City Department of Sanitation just three months ago, faced down the biggest snowstorm to hit the city in years. He appeared in front of news cameras as the face of the city’s snow removal effort.
He led the department in clearing snow from the city’s 6,300 miles of streets: no small feat during a pandemic. The department has 400 fewer workers than normal because of cutbacks stemming from the drastic drop in tax revenues this year. The virus crisis has also transformed the streetscape; scores of curbside outdoor dining booths have created obstructions for the plows that work to make streets passable.
At a news conference Thursday morning, Mayor Bill de Blasio commended his acting commissioner and the agency for doing “an amazing job” in tackling a storm that pummeled the city with nearly a foot of snow.
Grayson, who spent 21 years working his way up through the Sanitation Department’s ranks, had left little to chance. He spent Wednesday night driving behind plows and inspecting streets before grabbing a nap on a cot in his office in lower Manhattan and joining de Blasio at the news conference the next day.
Since his first job as a trash collector, Grayson has worked many snowstorms, whether driving a plow-equipped garbage truck or overseeing operations as a supervisor and then a chief.
“Serving as the commissioner, you feel the difference,” he said. “There’s definitely a lot on the line.”
Now, he is working to keep his job. When de Blasio leaves office at the end of next year, the incoming mayor, who gets to appoint new commissioners, will decide Grayson’s fate.
A burly man with a Queens accent, Grayson took center stage at media briefings and news segments all week to assure New Yorkers that he and his fellow trash haulers were there to help protect the city from being crippled by a winter storm.
For the leaders of city agencies, there are few bigger public stages than the kind a snowstorm sets for a sanitation commissioner, a position that comes with the risk of outsized political blowback when plowing does not go smoothly. Botched snow removals have wreaked political damage upon city commissioners and mayors over the decades. In 2010, for example, a December storm left City Hall so flat-footed that Mayor Michael Bloomberg rushed home in his private jet from Bermuda, and the sanitation commissioner, John J. Doherty, was so discouraged he considered resigning.
“People want the streets cleared quick, so it’s a tough struggle,” said Doherty, 82, who like Grayson also rose through the ranks. “At times, these snowstorms can be more political than anything else, and I think Eddie is sharp enough to know that the public is going to grade you on how well you did.”
With Grayson as chief of daily operations, the department has come under criticism this year for picking up trash more sporadically during the pandemic, which the agency attributed to budget cuts.
But snowstorms are a strong suit for Grayson, who himself can mount a plow on a truck or wrap snow chains around tires. For years, he was the department’s “snow chief,” and in recent years he helped implement the tracking systems that monitor plowing in real time.
“The GPS will tell you what streets are done, but it can’t tell you about the conditions on the ground,” said Grayson, adding that when he first began plowing in Queens, in 1999, he worked off a paper map. “You need live feedback from the driver on the street, and I can understand that because I’ve been that guy.”
Grayson grew up in Middle Village, Queens, which he described as a working-class neighborhood. He said he was raised in a “sanitation family”: His parents both worked for the department.
“It was a neighborhood where you automatically signed up for your civil service tests as soon as you turned 18,” he said.
His father, also Edward Grayson, collected trash and retired as a supervisor in 1988.
“He was always smart and had the gift of gab and he’s able to do that balancing act politically,” his father, 74, said about his son’s rise in the department. “They just gave him the football and off he went.”
His mother, Patricia Grayson, made a name for herself as a recycling outreach coordinator who was persuasive enough to get New Yorkers to accept separating recyclables from trash as the city began rolling out its program in the early 1990s. In that role, The New York Times called her “an icy-eyed zealot with a tone of voice that would make Patton seem meek.”
Her son shares her powers of persuasion, but seems to lean more on his affability, which was on display Tuesday as he inspected part of his snow removal fleet in a sanitation garage in lower Manhattan. He joked and hobnobbed with workers, hugging them and asking about their families.
“I’m a rank-and-file guy who made good,” he said.
But his casual chatter belies an obsessive work ethic.
Since last winter had little snowfall, he worried that his staff had grown rusty in carrying out the synchronized operation of following plowing routes. So in October, he helped run training with a mock forecast and practice routes that incorporated outdoor dining locations.
On Thursday, city officials reported that no dining structures had been struck by plows.
Colleagues say Grayson is adept at motivating his workers, known as New York’s Strongest, to pivot from collecting 12,000 tons of waste a day to plowing — grueling work often done in blinding snow for long shifts.
Eric Forster, 45, is a retired sanitation supervisor who has worked with Grayson. “Eddie’s like Braveheart — he’s the guy you want to be charging behind,” he said. “He’s a street kid from Queens who had a passion for the job from Day 1 and made it a point to know every aspect, from what grade bolts need to put on plow to how to use a smart board for payroll. The man lives and breathes the job.”
Kathryn Garcia, Grayson’s predecessor who resigned in September after more than six years as commissioner, to run for mayor, said Grayson had a nimble leadership style that tried to maximize the talent and ideas of workers.
Grayson is so unaccustomed to his new title that when someone addresses him as commissioner, he said, he reflexively turns his head to see if Garcia is there.
But he stepped into the role eagerly the night of the storm, when he was driving in Manhattan, monitoring the plows near the dining structures in the narrow streets of Little Italy and watching the large avenues on the Upper East Side being cleared.
“There’s a part of me that still wants to see it and understand what my men and women are going through,” he said.

WASHINGTON — Congressional leaders worked feverishly on Saturday to resolve an impasse over a Republican push to curtail the powers of the Federal Reserve that was threatening to derail a compromise $900 billion stimulus plan, racing against a Sunday night deadline to avoid a government shutdown.
After a monthslong impasse on a pandemic aid package, Democrats and Republicans were tantalizingly close to completing the emergency plan to rush direct payments, unemployment benefits and food and rental assistance to millions of Americans, relief to businesses, and provide funds for vaccine distribution.
But with time running out for a deal, they remained divided over a proposal by Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., to ensure the termination of a series of pandemic relief programs created this year by the Fed and potentially curtail the central bank’s ability to fight financial crises in the future.
“We’re right within reach,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi privately told House Democrats in a party conference call on Saturday. But she said Toomey’s late-stage demands to rein in the Fed were slowing the process.
By Saturday evening, Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the second-ranking Democrat, said the dispute had cost negotiators another day in their efforts to cement a deal.
“It won’t be tonight,” Durbin said. “It really is up to Mr. Toomey at this point, what he will accept.”
Everything else, he said, is “pretty close.”
The emerging deal would send direct payments of $600 to many Americans and provide enhanced federal jobless payments of $300-per-week until early spring. It would also provide hundreds of billions of dollars to prop up small businesses, schools and other institutions struggling amid the pandemic.
But Democrats said that Toomey’s proposal, which has been embraced by Republicans, amounted to an attempt to undercut President-elect Joe Biden and his administration’s ability to continue supporting the country’s economic recovery.
As drafted, it would prevent the Fed and the Treasury Department from reestablishing programs that have helped to keep credit flowing to municipal borrowers, medium-sized businesses and corporations during the pandemic recession. It would also bar the creation of “similar” programs going forward.
Lawmakers and aides in both parties acknowledged that the Fed provision presented the most significant hurdle to a final agreement, even though negotiators were still haggling over a number of outstanding technical details, including how to provide for food assistance and the scope of unemployment benefits.
Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., the minority leader, said on the Senate floor that Toomey’s language was the “No. 1 outstanding issue.”
With government funding set to lapse Sunday and both chambers hoping to merge the stimulus package with a catchall measure to cover all federal spending for the remainder of the fiscal year, time was dwindling to find a resolution.
Without action by Congress, two programs designed to expand and enhance unemployment benefits are set to expire in the coming days, leaving about 12 million Americans without federal support. A number of other benefits are set to expire at the end of the year.
Toomey and his Republican allies argued that his proposal merely codified what Congress intended in March when it enacted the original $2.2 billion pandemic stimulus law, which earmarked funding to support the Fed’s emergency lending programs. But the scope of the language proposed by Toomey went beyond that, prompting alarm from Democrats, who said they were enlisting prominent figures to weigh in against it.
Ben Bernanke, who led the Fed through the 2008 financial crisis, issued a statement warning that it was “vital that the Federal Reserve’s ability to respond promptly to damaging disruptions in credit markets not be circumscribed.”
Referring to the March stimulus law, Bernanke added, “The relief act should ensure, at least, that the Federal Reserve’s emergency lending authorities, as they stood before the passage of the CARES Act, remain fully intact and available to respond to future crises.”
Schumer said that Jerome Powell, the current Fed chair, whom he called “hardly a flaming liberal” was “strongly opposed” to Toomey’s proposal. The Fed declined to a comment on whether Powell, a Republican who was first nominated as a central bank governor by former President Barack Obama, had discussed the issue with Schumer in recent days.
On the private call with House Democrats on Saturday, Pelosi denounced the proposal, telling lawmakers that “for them to write in there that this cannot happen ever again is just beyond the pale,” according to a person on the call, who disclosed the comments on the condition of anonymity.
“It’s a way for them to say to Joe Biden: ‘We are tying your hands. No matter what comes down the pike, you can’t do this,’” Pelosi told Democrats.
Toomey defended the provision, arguing that Democrats had pushed for very generous terms on the municipal program in particular, with an eye on helping state and local governments gain access to cheap financing. Republicans have long objected to providing a direct stream of aid to state and local governments, and Democrats are seeking to provide relief through other avenues.
“Some of my colleagues want to morph these facilities into a use that was never intended for them,” Toomey said. “Fiscal and social policy is the rightful realm of the people who are accountable to the American people, and that’s us — that’s Congress.”
Toomey denied that he was seeking to hamstring the Biden administration, and pointed out that he had for months sought to ensure that the Fed’s pandemic programs sunset. But the language he has proposed to attach to the stimulus plan has been more expansive than that.
Republican senators rallied around Toomey on Saturday. Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the majority leader, privately told them during an afternoon call with Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, that they should stand firmly behind Toomey.
Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., made a point to correct reporters and declare “it is not the Toomey language — it is the Senate Republican language, because we are wholly unified behind it.”
But there were indications that Toomey might be willing to compromise. While his initial proposal targeted all five Fed programs backed by the March stimulus law, an aide familiar with the discussions confirmed that the so-called Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility — which helps to keep the market that bundles consumer and business-facing loans chugging — had been dropped from it.
The program was also used in the 2008 crisis to unstick markets, and it has fans on Wall Street.
In the absence of an agreement, McConnell used the rare Saturday session to force confirmation votes. Toomey could be seen circulating on the Senate floor, vigorously debating the language with his colleagues.
Huddled around desks in the back of the chamber, Toomey, Cotton, Schumer, and several other senators in both parties haggled. At one point, Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., could be heard offering synonyms for legislative terms in an effort to reach a compromise.

Everyone is tired of living like this. We miss our families and our friends. We miss having fun. We miss kissing our partners goodbye in the morning and packing school lunches. We miss travel and bars and office gossip and movie theaters and sporting events.
We miss normal life.
It has been a long, difficult year, and there are many tough weeks still ahead. The coronavirus is raging, and the United States is facing a grim winter, on track for 450,000 deaths from COVID-19 by February, maybe more. Additional restrictions and closures are inevitable in some parts of the country where cases are rising, hospital beds are full and exhausted health care workers are at their breaking point.
We are entering a dangerous time in the pandemic, not just because of rising case counts but because as a society we seem to have reached peak pandemic fatigue. Many people, sick of being apart from family, flouted public health advice and crowded into airports over the Thanksgiving holiday, setting travel records not seen since shutdowns began in March. Others continue to gather with friends, feeling a sense of resignation or indifference.
But if we can safely soldier through these next few months, then normal life — or at least a new version of normal — will be within reach. New vaccines that are highly protective against coronavirus are being rolled out, first to health care workers and the most vulnerable groups, and then to the general population this spring.
“Help is on the way,” says Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert. “A vaccine is literally on the threshold of being implemented. To me that is more of an incentive to not give up, but to double down and say, ‘We’re going to get through this.’”
The vaccine won’t change life overnight. Pandemics don’t end abruptly, as New York Times reporter Donald G. McNeil Jr. wrote this fall. “They decelerate gradually, like supertankers.” It will take months to get enough people vaccinated so that the virus has nowhere to go.
Given the enormity of the crisis, it’s hard to believe that something as simple as declining a dinner party invitation could make a difference. But that’s how you tamp down a respiratory virus. You stop breathing other people’s air.
The more everyone does their part to slow down the virus now, the better and faster the vaccine will work to slow the pandemic once we can all start getting vaccinated this spring.
Wear a mask. Scale back your holiday plans. Avoid groups and indoor gatherings. Restrict your contacts to just the people in your household. Those simple measures could save more than 100,000 lives in the coming months.
“Why would you want to be one of the people who is the last person to get infected?” said Fauci. “It’s almost like being the last person to get killed in a war. You want to hang in there and protect yourself, because the end is in sight.”
Pay attention to this indicator.
You have one job this winter: Keep yourself and those around you safe and healthy. Do that, and you’ll improve the odds that all the people you care about will still be here this spring, when a new vaccine is expected to become widely available and life slowly starts to return to normal.
A crucial number to watch this winter is the test positivity rate for your state and local community. The number, also sometimes called the “percent positive” or “positivity rate,” represents the percentage of coronavirus tests that are positive compared to the overall number of tests being given, and it’s an important indicator of your risk of coming down with COVID-19.
When positive test rates in a community stay at 5% or lower for two weeks, you’re less likely to cross paths with an infected person.
But right now, very few states are below that 5% threshold. When test positivity rates start to rise above 5%, it usually means the number of cases and transmission in a community is high, and that only the sickest patients are being tested; many infected people with milder illness or without symptoms may be going undetected. Since the fall, the national test positivity rate has crept above 10%, and it’s been 30% or higher in several states.
Rising case counts and rising test positivity rates mean there is more virus out there — and you need to double down on precautions, especially if you have a high-risk person in your orbit. Cut back on trips to the store or start having groceries delivered. Scale back your holiday plans. Don’t invite friends indoors, even for a few minutes. Always stay 6 feet from people who don’t live in your home. Skip haircuts and manicures until the numbers come down again.
So how will you know when things are getting better? Case counts and test positivity rates will begin to drop as communities impose restrictions and more people stay home. The numbers will continue to decline as more people get vaccinated. You’ll still need to be vigilant until a large portion of the country is vaccinated, but when you start to see the test positivity rate drop below 1% in your community, it will be a clear sign that we’re quashing the virus.
Mask up. You’re going to need it for a while.
A study by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington estimated that 130,000 lives could be saved by February if mask use became universal in the United States immediately. Masks can also preserve the economy: A study by Goldman Sachs estimated that universal use would save $1 trillion that may be lost to business shutdowns and medical bills.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued updated guidance in early December, advocating more clearly than before that everyone, infected or healthy, should wear a mask, including indoors when not at home. Many states have issued mask mandates or strengthened their recommendations in recent weeks.
Various studies involving machines puffing fine mists have shown that simple cloth masks can significantly reduce the spread of pathogens between people in conversation.
And the common-sense evidence that masks work has become overwhelming. Dozens of “superspreader events” have taken place in venues where most people were not masked — in bars and restaurants, at summer camps, at funerals, on airplanes, in churches, at choir practice.
In contrast, there have been no documented incidents of widespread transmission in venues where most people wore masks, such as grocery stores. One well-known CDC study showed that, even in a Springfield, Missouri, hair salon where two stylists were infected, not one of the 139 customers whose hair they cut over the course of 10 days caught the disease. A city health order had required that both the stylists and the customers be masked.
Choose a mask with two or three layers that fits well and covers your face from the bridge of your nose to under your chin. “Something is better than nothing,” said Linsey Marr, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Virginia Tech and one of the world’s leading aerosol scientists. “Even the simplest cloth mask of one layer of material blocks half or more of aerosols we think are important to transmission.”
It’s important to find a mask you like and that you will wear, because masks are going to be with us for a while longer. President-elect Joe Biden said he’s going to call for 100 days of universal mask wearing after he’s sworn in on Jan. 20, 2021. And even as more people get vaccinated against the coronavirus, mask wearing will probably continue for some time in medical offices, on public transportation, in airports and when theaters finally reopen.
Close the leaks in your COVID bubble.
Here’s the harsh reality of virus transmission: If someone in your family gets sick, the infection probably came from you, another family member or someone you know.
The main way coronavirus is transmitted is through close contact with an infected person in an enclosed space. Many of us feel safer gathering in our homes, rather than at a restaurant or public space, but experts say we underestimate the risk when it comes to private get-togethers with our friends and family. Homes are now a frequent place where coronavirus transmission happens, accounting for up to 70% of cases in some areas.
“One of the challenges we have is that familiarity is seen as being a virus protector,” said Michael Osterholm, a member of Biden’s coronavirus advisory group and director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. “You can’t count on knowing someone” to protect you from the virus, he said. “More likely than not, knowing someone is the risk factor for getting infected.”
This winter, with cases surging out of control, it’s essential to limit indoor socializing to just the people who live in your home. Some families, particularly those with young children, have opted to form a “pod” or “bubble” with two or more households, essentially forming a pact that everyone will adhere to strict precautions and limit outside contacts so the group can safely socialize indoors. This summer, 47% of Americans said they had formed a “pod” or social “bubble,” according to an Axios-Ipsos survey.
But sometimes your bubble is leakier than you realize. Farhad Manjoo, an opinion columnist for the Times, had initially assumed his bubble was pretty small, but it turned out to be much larger than he guessed. His children had contact with other children in a learning pod, and by extension their parents and siblings. His daughter went to gymnastics class, where they came into contact with more families. One parent in the group was a doctor who saw 10 patients a week. Others had small children in day care. In reality, Manjoo discovered that his COVID-19 bubble had direct or indirect contact with more than 100 people.
Whether your bubble is just your immediate household — or you’ve formed a bubble with other households — take some time to check in with everyone and seal the leaks. This requires everyone in the group to be honest about the precautions they’re taking (or not taking). And it means disclosing unusual exposures — an outbreak at a child’s day care, a teen sneaking out to be with her friends or an unfortunate taxi ride with a coughing driver.
Osterholm said that convincing people that their friends might infect them has been one of the biggest challenges of the pandemic. He told the story of a man and a woman who both contracted COVID-19 after attending a wedding.
“He told me, ‘We didn’t fly. I knew everybody there,’” said Osterholm. “He somehow had the mistaken belief that by knowing the person, you won’t get infected from them. We’ve got to break through that concept.”
Watch the clock, and take the fun outside.
When making decisions about how you’re spending your time this winter, watch the clock. If you’re spending time indoors with people who don’t live with you, wear a mask and keep the visit as short as possible. (Better yet, don’t do it at all.) Layer up, get hand warmers, some blankets, an outdoor heater — and move social events outdoors.
If you do come into contact with someone from outside your household, don’t worry about brief encounters outdoors. Passing someone on the sidewalk or a runner who quickly huffs and puffs past you is unlikely to result in infection.
Your primary goal should be to avoid “swapping air” with other people, Osterholm said.
That’s why you need to wear a mask if you’re in close conversation with someone outside your household, even if the conversation is outdoors. (One documented case of outdoor transmission in China happened early in the pandemic when two friends chatted for about 15 minutes on the sidewalk. One of them had just returned from Wuhan, and he infected his friend during their chat.)
In an enclosed space, like an office, at a birthday party, in a restaurant or in a church, you can still become infected from a person across the room if you share the same air for an extended period of time. There’s no proven time limit that is safest, but based on contact tracing guidelines and the average rate at which we expel viral particles — through breathing, speaking, singing and coughing — it’s best to wear a mask and keep indoor activities, like shopping or haircuts, to about 30 minutes.
Take care of yourself, save a medical worker.
The country’s doctors, nurses and other health care workers are at a breaking point.
Long gone are the raucous nightly cheers, loud applause and clanging that bounced off buildings and hospital windows in the United States and abroad — the sounds of public appreciation each night at 7 for those on the pandemic’s front line.
“Nobody’s clapping anymore,” said Dr. Jessica Gold, a psychiatrist at Washington University in St. Louis. “They’re over it.”
In interviews, more than two dozen front-line medical workers described the unrelenting stress that has become an endemic part of the health care crisis nationwide. Many related spikes in anxiety and depressive thoughts, as well as a chronic sense of hopelessness and deepening fatigue, spurred in part by the cavalier attitudes of many Americans who seem to have lost patience with the pandemic.
“We’re sacrificing so much as health care providers — our health, our family’s health,” said Dr. Cleavon Gilman, an emergency medicine physician in Yuma, Arizona. “You would think that the country would have learned its lesson” after the spring, he said. “But I feel like the 20,000 people that died in New York died for nothing.”
Many health care workers have reached the bottom of their reservoir, with little left to give, especially without sufficient tools to defend themselves against a disease that has killed more than 1,000 of them.
For Dr. Shannon Tapia, a geriatrician in Colorado, April was bad. So was May. At one long-term care facility she staffed, 22 people died in 10 days. Tapia is beleaguered by the helplessness she feels at every turn. “Systematically, it makes me feel like I’m failing,” she said. “The last eight months almost broke me.”
Shikha Dass, an emergency room nurse at Mount Sinai Queens in New York City, recalled nights in mid-March when her team of eight nurses had to wrangle some 15 patients each — double or triple a typical workload. “We kept getting code after code, and patients were just dying,” Dass said. The patients quickly outnumbered the available breathing support machines, she said, forcing doctors and nurses to apportion care in a rapid-fire fashion.
“We didn’t have enough ventilators,” Dass said. “I remember doing CPR and cracking ribs. These were people from our community — it was so painful.”
Dass wrestled with sleeplessness and irritability, sniping at her husband and children. She couldn’t erase the memory of the neat row of three refrigerated trailers in her hospital parking lot, each packed with bodies that the morgue was too full to take.
Jina Saltzman, a physician assistant in Chicago, said she was growing increasingly disillusioned with the nation’s lax approach to penning in the virus. In mid-November, she was astounded to see crowds of unmasked people in a restaurant as she picked up a pizza. “It’s so disheartening. We’re coming here to work every day to keep the public safe,” she said. “But the public isn’t trying to keep the public safe.”
In state after state, people continue to flood hospital wards, where hallways often provide makeshift beds for the overflow. Jill Naiberk, a nurse at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, spent more of 2020 in full protective gear than out of it. It’s her ninth straight month of COVID duty. “My unit is 16 beds. Rarely do we have an open one,” she said. “And when we do have an open bed, it’s usually because somebody has passed away.”
Many of her intensive care unit patients are young, in their 40s or 50s. “They’re looking at us and saying things like, ‘Don’t let me die’ and ‘I guess I should have worn that mask.’”
What will it take to convince you?
Here’s what Dr. Elisabeth Rosenthal, a former emergency room physician, editor-in-chief of Kaiser Health News and a contributing opinion writer, had to say about convincing a skeptical country about the dangers of COVID-19.
As cases were mounting in September, the Michigan government produced videos with the exhortation, “Spread Hope, Not COVID,” urging Michiganders to put on a mask “for your community and country.”
Forget that. Mister Rogers-type nice isn’t working in many parts of the country. It’s time to make people scared and uncomfortable. It’s time for some sharp, focused, terrifying realism.
“Fear appeals can be very effective,” said Jay Van Bavel, associate professor of psychology at New York University, who co-authored a paper in Nature about how social science could support COVID response efforts. (They may not be needed as much in places like New York, he noted, where people experienced the constant sirens and the makeshift hospitals.)
I’m not talking fearmongering, but showing in a straightforward and graphic way what can happen with the virus.
Maybe we need a PSA featuring someone actually on a ventilator in the hospital. You might see that person “bucking the vent” — bodies naturally rebel against the machine forcing pressurized oxygen into the lungs, which is why patients are typically sedated.
(Because I had witnessed this suffering as a practicing doctor, I was always upfront about the trauma with loved ones of terminally ill patients when they were trying to decide whether to consent to a relative being put on a ventilator. It sounds as easy as hooking someone to an IV. It’s not.)
Another message could feature a patient lying in an ICU bed, immobile, tubes in the groin, with a mask delivering 100% oxygen over the mouth and nose — eyes wide with fear, watching the saturation numbers rise and dip on the monitor over the bed.
Maybe some PSAs should feature a so-called COVID long hauler, the 5% to 10% of people for whom recovery takes months. Perhaps a professional athlete like the National Football League’s Ryquell Armstead, 24, who has been in and out of the hospital with serious lung issues and missed the season.
These PSAs might sound harsh, but they might overcome our natural denial. Only after Chris Christie, an adviser to President Donald Trump, experienced COVID did he start preaching about mask-wearing:
“When you have seven days in isolation in an ICU, though, you have time to do a lot of thinking,” Christie said, suggesting that people “follow CDC guidelines in public no matter where you are and wear a mask to protect yourself and others.”
We hear from many who resist taking precautions. They say, “I know someone who had it and it’s not so bad.” Or, “It’s just like the flu.”
Sure, most longtime smokers don’t end up with lung cancer — or tethered to an oxygen tank — either. (That, in fact, was the justification of smokers like my father, whose two-pack-a-day habit contributed to his death at 47 of a heart attack.)
But studies have shown that emotional ads featuring personal stories about the effects of smoking were the most effective at persuading folks to quit. And quitting smoking is much harder than social-distancing and mask-wearing.
Once a vaccine has proved successful and enough people are vaccinated, the pandemic may well be in the rearview mirror. In the meantime, the creators of public health messaging should stop favoring the cute, warm and dull. And — at least sometimes — scare you.

As the coronavirus continued to surge across the United States, an independent panel of experts advising the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention voted on Saturday to endorse a second coronavirus vaccine for use in the United States.
The committee’s recommendation follows an emergency authorization granted by the Food and Drug Administration on Friday. The committee’s endorsement now awaits final approval by Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the CDC, expected shortly.
Some 5.9 million doses of the Moderna vaccine are slated for distribution starting on Sunday, and the first inoculations are expected to begin sometime on Monday.
Unlike the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which was authorized for use in people 16 and older, Moderna’s vaccine is approved only for people 18 and older. While Pfizer began clinical trials of its vaccine in children as young as 12 in October, Moderna did not begin its pediatric studies until this month and does not expect to have complete data on safety and efficacy until sometime next year.
Much of the committee’s deliberations centered on the severe allergic reactions reported in several cases following injections of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which contains ingredients similar to those in Moderna’s recipe.
Six cases of anaphylaxis have now been documented in the United States, and two in Britain. Several milder allergic reactions have occurred, as well. More than 272,000 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine have already been doled out nationwide as of Saturday, according to the CDC.
Allergic reactions to vaccines typically occur at a rate of about one in 1 million. Dr. Grace Lee, a pediatrician and vaccine expert at Stanford University, noted at the committee meeting that the estimates so far seemed to indicate that the risk of these events associated with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine “does seem qualitatively higher than for most typical vaccines.”
Still, she added, “for me, personally, it doesn’t necessarily change the risk-benefit balance of the COVID-19 vaccine at this time.”
Dr. Thomas Clark, an epidemiologist at the CDC, noted that people who experience anaphylaxis after getting a shot shouldn’t receive a second dose. It’s still unclear whether an ingredient in Pfizer’s vaccine was the direct cause of the reactions.
Some experts have pointed to polyethylene glycol, or PEG, a chemical found in many pharmaceutical products, including laxatives like Miralax, that has very rarely been found to cause allergic reactions. Both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines contain PEG, though in slightly different formulations.
Dr. Sarah Mbaeyi, a medical officer at the CDC, said the agency was recommending that people who know they have severe allergies to any ingredient in the vaccines abstain from getting the shots for now.
People with a history of anaphylaxis to other vaccines or injectable therapies should consult their doctors and linger on site for monitoring for 30 minutes after their inoculation in case they start feeling sick. (Everyone else — including people who react strongly to other substances like food, pollen or pet dander, and people with mild allergies of any sort — may leave after 15 minutes.)
Three severe allergic reactions were reported in Moderna’s clinical trials, which included more than 30,000 adults, half of whom received a placebo instead of the vaccine. None were believed to be linked to the vaccine.
At the meeting, experts also raised concerns about four cases of a temporary facial paralysis called Bell’s palsy, three of which occurred in the vaccine group in the Moderna trial. (Four cases of Bell’s palsy also arose in Pfizer’s trials, all in the vaccine group.)
There’s no evidence yet that directly links the paralysis to either vaccine, and Dr. Jacqueline Miller, a senior vice president at Moderna, said her company was continuing to monitor vaccine recipients for the side effect.
More than half of people who received the Moderna vaccine in clinical trials reported uncomfortable symptoms, including fatigue, headaches and soreness, after their second shot, given about four weeks after the first. Some volunteers also developed a fever or a rash around the injection site.
Incidents like these appear to be much more common with Moderna’s vaccine than Pfizer’s, which containers a smaller dose of the active ingredients. But most of the side effects disappeared within a day or so of the inoculation.
Temporary symptoms in the wake of vaccination are relatively common. Often, they are the outward signs of an immune system hard at work, preparing the body to fend off disease in the future.
Neither Moderna nor Pfizer has yet collected data in people who are pregnant or breastfeeding. But none of the 13 volunteers who became pregnant while participating in Moderna’s clinical trials, six of whom received the vaccine, reported harmful effects.
More than 500 Americans who have gotten a dose of Pfizer’s vaccine were pregnant at the time of their injection.
Many scientists believe the coronavirus poses a far greater risk to pregnant or breastfeeding people than the vaccine does. Stephanie Langel, an immunologist and virologist at Duke University, was prioritized to receive the vaccine because she is conducting research on the coronavirus. She got her shot on Friday.
“For me, it’s just a no-brainer,” she said, because of her frequent exposure to the virus. “It’s about your evaluation of risk.”
During the meeting, scientists and clinicians underscored the importance of bringing vaccinations to communities that have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic, including people in correctional facilities.
Experts have repeatedly noted the importance of partnering with representatives from communities of color to reaffirm vaccine safety and efficacy for people who might be hesitant or skeptical of the shots. (Exceedingly few people who identified as American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander participated in Moderna’s trials.)
Dionne Brown, the director of nursing at Summit Rehabilitation and Care Community in Aurora, Colorado, told The New York Times that she had been a “a little bit apprehensive about the side effects.” But after lengthy discussions with her colleagues about how safe and effective the vaccines have been shown to be, “I feel comfortable with taking it,” she said.
Brown, a mother of six, hopes to set an example for her family and community, as well as the other staff members and elderly residents in her long-term care facility.
“That’s what my aim and goal is,” she said. “That they will see me get it and hopefully feel comfortable.”
In a second session on Sunday, CDC officials and scientists will deliver more guidance about allocating the newly cleared vaccines, and vote on the prioritization of people to receive vaccinations.

With less than 36 hours to strike an elusive agreement on a $900 billion stimulus package and prevent a lapse in government funding, U.S. lawmakers and aides on Saturday worked feverishly to finalize the details on how to prop up the nation’s shuddering economy and send billions of dollars to distribute vaccines and support struggling American families and businesses.
Both chambers hastily approved a two-day stopgap bill on Friday, giving negotiators a window to hammer out both a final agreement and legislative text on a relief deal. The measure is expected to be merged with a catchall omnibus package needed to keep the government funded for the remainder of the fiscal year.
Congressional leaders hope to jam both spending packages through Congress and onto President Donald Trump’s desk by the time funding lapses at midnight on Sunday.
“We need to pass these measures with a big bipartisan vote and get them signed into law without further delay,” Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the majority leader, said on the Senate floor Saturday.
But the biggest hurdle was a last-ditch push led by Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., to insert language that would limit the powers of the Federal Reserve, potentially keeping it from lending to businesses and municipalities in future crises.
On a private caucus call Saturday morning, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi denounced the attempt.
“For them to write in there that this cannot happen ever again is just beyond the pale,” Pelosi said, according to a person on the call who was not authorized to speak publicly, depicting the move as a way to deprive President-elect Joe Biden’s administration of the critical tools needed to support the country’s economic recovery.
Toomey, who has fought to curtail the scope of the Federal Reserve’s power, rejected that characterization but declined to comment on whether he would accept a compromise.
In a speech on the Senate floor, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., the minority leader, said that the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, opposed the measure and that the language was “the only significant hurdle to completing an agreement.”
Negotiators are also haggling over final details of provisions, including who should be eligible for the $600 direct payments, tax extenders and the length of the enhanced and extended unemployment benefits. Although negotiators are coalescing around a $300 supplemental benefit — half the benefit established in the original $2.2 trillion stimulus law — it is unclear how long the benefits would run, and whether they would taper to an end. Democrats are pushing for a hard cliff to end the benefits, in part to give lawmakers a deadline to return to the negotiating table.
On the call, Pelosi also criticized Republicans for suggesting cuts to unemployment and food assistance programs to keep the overall cost of the package below $1 trillion.
Senate Republicans voiced support for Toomey’s provision in the relief package.

Once a Slogan of Unity, ‘Je Suis Charlie’ Now Divides France

PARIS — In the hours after the 2015 Islamic terrorist attack on French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, a slogan emerged to mourn the dead and defend free speech, spreading like magic across France and the globe through its unifying force.
“Je suis Charlie.”
Pictures of the slogan, “I am Charlie” — in white and light gray letters on a black background — inspired millions who marched in France and were joined by world leaders from Western and Muslim nations alike. Hollywood A-listers like George Clooney proclaimed, “Je suis Charlie.” So did Maggie on “The Simpsons.” All standing together as Charlie against terrorists who believed that the magazine had insulted Islam with its cartoons lampooning the Prophet Muhammad.
But the once unifying slogan has become one of division in France — framing complicated debates in everyday conversations and popular culture, on social media and even as part of school curriculums.
“I am Charlie” gave birth to “I am not Charlie,” giving rise to a question that demands picking camps: Are you or are you not Charlie? The answer puts people on either side of France’s major fault lines, including freedom of speech, secularism, race, national identity and, of course, Islam.
The slogan’s metamorphosis exposes the polarization of political discourse in France, further deepened by the decapitation of a middle school teacher and two other recent Islamic attacks that followed the republication of the caricatures of Muhammad by Charlie Hebdo in September. But as it took on a life of its own, the slogan itself helped sharpen France’s divisions.
“I wish this slogan would cease to exist because in the form it’s taken today, it deepens the divide,” said Joachim Roncin, the graphic designer who created the slogan, which he saw as a “security blanket: ‘Je suis Charlie — we’re in it together.’”
Today, someone who is Charlie is likely to be white and supporter of the caricatures’ publication. At its extreme, the person may back a strict secularism that at times is a cover for anti-Islam. Someone who’s not Charlie is often nonwhite and opposes the cartoons’ publication. The person could go as far as justifying Islamic terrorism or a ban of all criticism of religion.
Once a slogan that transcended political cleavages, “Je Suis Charlie” has now been largely embraced by the right and created splits on the left.
Gérôme Truc, a sociologist at the National Center for Scientific Research, said the slogan had been steadily weaponized as part of “a political fight that seeks to generate divisions, to distinguish those who are with us and those who are against us.”
The slogan put “oil on the fire” burning in France, Truc said, referring to issues that he said the country had failed to resolve over the past five years, like Islamism, freedom of speech and the place of religion in public life.
Its potential explosiveness was on display during a recent interview that President Emmanuel Macron gave to an online youth-oriented news site, Brut. A reader with an Arabic name, Karim, asked him, “I’m French, I love my country. But I am not Charlie. Am I allowed to be?”
Macron replied that Karim was, but then added: “I think we must get away from the slogan.”
On Wednesday, a court in Paris found 14 people guilty of aiding in the 2015 attacks on the Charlie Hebdo headquarters and on a Jewish supermarket. Yet even if the verdict brought legal closure, the caricatures’ effects on French society continues to be felt.
When Charlie Hebdo first published the cartoons in 2006, the conservative president at the time, Jacques Chirac, denounced their publication, calling for “tolerance and the respect of all faiths.” In 2015, the government led by the President François Hollande, a socialist, responded to the series of attacks that year, including one at the Bataclan concert hall, with a strong message of national unity.
This fall, in the wake of the three recent attacks, Macron emphatically defended the republication of the caricatures as the “right to blasphemy.” That stance led to protests in Muslim nations, was met with criticism or silence in the West, and left France isolated.
Vincent Tiberj, a sociologist at Sciences Po Bordeaux university, said that French public opinion had been shaped less by the nature of the attacks than by the political discourse and actions that followed.
After the 2015 attacks — which killed about 150 people, compared with four in the three attacks this fall — the government’s emphasis on national unity led to an increase in tolerance toward Muslims, Tiberj’s research showed. But he said that the political reaction after the recent attacks, with language that appeared to conflate the religion of Islam with Islamic extremism, risked fueling divisions.
Those fissures have widened in the arc of a changing “Je suis Charlie.”
Roncin, 44, the graphic designer, created the slogan within an hour and a half of the 2015 attack on Charlie Hebdo. He wasn’t a reader of the magazine, but when he was growing up there were regularly copies around his home. His father, a child of the May 1968 social revolution, liked the magazine’s anti-establishment spirit, he said.
Feeling that the attack was “taking away part of my childhood, part of what formed me,” Roncin uploaded the slogan on Twitter to his 400 followers. About seven minutes later, the first hashtag #JeSuisCharlie was created, according to a study on Twitter hashtags.
Within hours, it had ricocheted across the globe and Roncin was inundated with interview requests from the news media. That evening, tens of thousands gathered in Paris’ Place de la République, many holding signs with the slogan, which they had printed on home computers.
But even in the first hour after his Tweet, Roncin noticed some critical messages on social media. A hashtag #JeNeSuisPasCharlie popped up, the first sign of a politicization that would eventually turn his creation into “a slogan of the right,” he said.
He wasn’t the only one made uneasy.
Christophe Naudin, 45, survived the 2015 terrorist attack on the Bataclan concert hall, where 90 were killed, by hiding for more than two hours in a storage room.
Naudin, who grew up in a politically aware family, remembers his grandmother passionately defend author Salman Rushdie, who was threatened with death after offending many Muslims in his novel “The Satanic Verses.” Naudin said he had subscribed to Charlie Hebdo in 2006 to show support for the magazine’s decision that year to publish cartoons of Muhammad.
But he said he had canceled his subscription last year after growing increasingly uncomfortable with the magazine’s editorial tone. The magazine sometimes produced content that he considered Islamophobic, said Naudin, who teaches history at a middle school and recently published a book, “Diary of a Survivor of the Bataclan.”
A cover illustration on the August 2017 Barcelona terrorist attack and an editorial by the magazine’s editor, Laurent Sourisseau, appeared to conflate Islam with Islamism, Naudin said.
The magazine did not respond to multiple interview requests. In response to charges of racism, Sourisseau told a French newspaper that part of the left was trapped in strict ideological concepts and censored itself.
“We have to say things even if they’re unpleasant,” he said.
The “Charlie” slogan pushes the French into two extremes, Naudin said, adding, “We have unfortunately reached a point of no return where nuanced speech is no longer audible.”
The slogan has even made it into the classroom.
In early October, Samuel Paty, a teacher in a middle school near Paris, organized a class on free speech around what he called “Dilemma: To be or not to be Charlie.” Days after showing two caricatures of Muhammad from Charlie Hebdo, he was killed by an Islamic extremist.
Being Charlie meant supporting the freedom of the press, the publication of the caricatures and the right to blasphemy, according to handwritten notes taken by two students who attended the class in question and provided copies to The New York Times. Not being Charlie meant believing that the magazine is not respectful of religion, publishes blasphemous caricatures, provokes Islamists and risks provoking attacks.
The students debated, they recalled, and then were asked to agree on a proposed solution.
At the bottom of their class notes, their proposal read: “Refrain from publishing that kind of caricature.”

A COVID-19 Surge and Conspiracy Theories Roil Pakistan

KARACHI, Pakistan — Iqbal Shaheen, a taxi driver, drove his sick father to this city’s three main hospitals. All of their intensive care beds and ventilators were occupied.
Shaheen was told there might be room at a private hospital, for $625 a day, far above what his earnings of $10 a day could cover. He took his father home to die.
“The poor cannot afford to be sick,” Shaheen said. “Without political connections, a coronavirus patient cannot get admitted at a public hospital, while paying a private hospital’s bills is unthinkable.”
As winter sets in, cold weather, pollution and public apathy to the coronavirus are weighing heavily on Pakistan’s limited health care system.
Pakistan’s COVID-19 positivity rate has rocketed up to about 7.7% of tests administered in recent weeks from only 2% in October, prompting a plea from health experts and doctors in Karachi for the government to impose a strict nationwide lockdown.
Prime Minister Imran Khan has closed schools but has ruled out a second lockdown, saying it would decimate the economy.
“We don’t want to lead people to death due to hunger, while saving them from coronavirus,” Khan told journalists in November.
By official figures, Pakistan is weathering the coronavirus better than the United States, Europe and neighboring India. Total infections have reached 448,522, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University using official figures, and more than 9,000 people have died.
Still, cases are surging, and limited testing compared with other countries suggests the virus could be racing through the country at an even higher rate. Health experts cite ineffective government limits on personal contact and widespread doubts, often fueled by conspiracy theories, that COVID-19 poses a threat.
Pakistan was also lulled into a false sense of security. A widely predicted rise in infections over the summer failed to show up in official numbers. Government restrictions on travel or the overall youth and resilience of Pakistan’s population may have contributed.
“Pakistanis remained safe during the first wave and didn’t face a serious situation like seen in other countries, mainly because of God’s special blessings,” said Dr. Qaiser Sajjad, a leader of the Pakistan Medical Association.
The second wave is proving more lethal. Some hospitals are turning away patients. At the Dr. Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital in Karachi, managers are scrambling for beds.
“The government seems to have failed to enforce health guidelines,” Sajjad said.
At the Holy Family Hospital in the city of Rawalpindi, virus wards that had been nearly empty are beginning to fill. Now, about a quarter of the 120-bed facility has been taken up, said Dr. Akhtar Mehmood, the hospital’s coronavirus coordinator, although patients are in worse condition than during the first wave.
“This is a major difference,” he said, adding that the hospital can take more patients as needed.
Despite the rise, people in Karachi show few signs of concern. Even as the positive testing rate topped 18% in the city of 20 million, markets were packed with shoppers without masks. Buses were full. Overflow passengers rode on the roofs.
Winter is wedding season. At night, people embrace and shake hands at crowded indoor ceremonies.
Over the summer, when official figures showed infections falling, Khan’s government credited its strategy of limited lockdowns. It had called in the Pakistan military, which plays an outsize role in the democratic country’s politics and is relatively well-organized and disciplined compared with the civil government. It also cited knowledge it had gained through a polio eradication effort.
“One clear consistent hallmark has been a coordinated, professional, data-driven, epidemiological response,” said Dr. Faisal Sultan, an adviser to Khan and Pakistan’s de facto health minister. “That’s the one thing that differentiates Pakistan from other countries.”
Sultan faulted the rising caseload on lax compliance with health guidelines on mask wearing and strangers mingling at weddings and protests. Still, he said, data showed that state interventions were working.
Other evidence cast doubt on the effectiveness of the government’s response. Under pressure from religious groups in the deeply conservative country, the government weakened many social distancing efforts almost immediately after enacting them.
When police tried to prevent worshippers from gathering at mosques for prayers during the peak of coronavirus cases in April, they found themselves under attack. In Karachi, some worshippers chased the police through narrow alleyways, pelting them with rocks and sending several officers to the hospital.
The government has proved equally ineffective at imposing restrictions as it battles a second wave.
Thousands of people have attended anti-government rallies in recent weeks. Religious congregations have ignored the official ban on assemblies.
“People are not following safety precautions, and therefore the situation at the health facilities is getting more serious day by day,” said Dr. Ismail Memon, a senior official at Dr. Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital.
As the rate of infection grows, anxiety is also rising among the ranks of small merchants, who were badly injured by Pakistan’s monthslong lockdown.
Haji Dilbar, who sells secondhand shoes out of a cart in a lower-income Karachi neighborhood, said anyone who wears a mask is treated like a pariah.
He believes, as surveys show many Pakistanis do, that the government has exaggerated the COVID-19 threat to “earn dollars” from Western countries in the form of foreign aid.
A survey conducted in October by Gallup Pakistan showed that 55% of respondents in Pakistan doubted that the virus was real and 46% believed it was a conspiracy. Those attitudes make it tougher to enforce mask-wearing and other preventive measures and could complicate the distribution of vaccines when they become widely available.
“You do have the challenge of some vaccine resistance,” said Sultan, Khan’s adviser, “and I expect that there will be some anti-vaxxers.”
Places like the village of Manga in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, on the border with Afghanistan, will present particular challenges. Fear broke out in March in Manga after one person died and more than 50 people tested positive. As the virus ebbed, some wondered whether the government exaggerated the danger.
Some people are conjuring up conspiracy theories similar to those that have haunted a national campaign to eradicate polio, which includes allegations that politicians are pocketing aid money.
“First the government made money in the name of polio,” said Syed Nawab, a Manga resident, “and now they are selling coronavirus to earn dollars from Western countries.”
Politicians and clerics have sown doubts.
A recent video of Faisal Raza Abidi, a former senator, claiming that COVID-19 is “a massacre ultimately aimed at Iran and Pakistan as they don’t accept Greater Israel” has circulated widely.
In April, Tariq Jamil, a popular Islamic preacher, used a televised sermon that was attended by Khan to assert that the virus was God’s wrath over women dancing and dressing immodestly. In another video spread on social media, Kaukab Okarvi, a cleric, accused doctors of killing patients.
Rather than take on powerful political and religious figures, the government has aimed new health restrictions at small businesses. It is levying fines for staying open late or failing to make customers wear masks, leaving some merchants grumbling.
“Instead of stopping them from holding rallies, government personnel harass small traders, restaurant and marriage hall owners, and mint money in the name of COVID-19 health regulations,” said Hakeem Shah, a merchant who organized a protest against restrictions earlier this month.
The government has also closed schools. About one quarter of the country’s 220 million people are school-age children. Private schools for Pakistan’s tiny elite have resumed online classes, but most schoolchildren lack computers, internet connections or even electricity.
“Low-cost private schools and thousands of public schools and colleges are in no position to provide the facility of online education,” said Ikramullah, an education activist in Karachi who uses one name.
Some parents are sending their children to madrasas, or Islamic schools, that have refused to close their doors.
“We follow the directions of our top religious scholars,” said Mufti Shabbir Farooqi, a teacher at a Karachi madrassa whose enrollment has swelled to 1,400 students from 900, “not the government ministers or law enforcement officers for whether to open or close the madrasas.”

Texto completo: Northampton County Council authorized a plan Thursday night that would offer Gracedale employees $750 to get the coronavirus vaccine.
But staff at Cedarbrook, the Lehigh County-owned nursing home, won't receive any cash incentives to get immunized.
Hours after the first tested, emergency-authorized vaccines were provided to Lehigh Valley health care workers, Northampton County Council signed off on plans to grant workers at its nursing home a cash incentive to follow suit.
Getting immunized is a personal health decision, and one that counties cannot force on its employees, even ones that serve vulnerable populations, Northampton County Executive Lamont McClure said Friday. With the stick not an option, the county is hoping that offering a carrot will incentivize its employees to get immunized.
"Our attorneys have concluded the current state of the law suggests we may not mandate vaccinations for incum
bent Gracedale employees," McClure said. "While Gracedale administration has for weeks been preparing our staff for the impending availability of this lifesaving inoculation, we've had numerous reports of reticence among employees with respect to receiving the vaccine, so we're offering a monetary incentive.
"It's certainly their right to still refuse, but they need to understand that vaccination in long-term care facilities will save lives. At one point, 85% of the COVID-19 cases in Northampton County were residents of long-term care facilities."
Gracedale has about 650 employees. If each agreed to the $750 payment, the county would be on the hook for $490,000. McClure said the money would come from federal coronavirus relief funding for infection control.
Meanwhile, Lehigh County Executive Phillips Armstrong said the county will not offer any cash to Cedarbrook employees to encourage them to get the vaccine. Instead, he and Cedarbrook Administrator Jason Cumello will publicly take the vaccine when it is available to demonstrate its safety.
"As it's proven there are no side effects - assuming I don't grow another arm - then I think it will become more acceptable. We are going to do it in a slow procedure," Armstrong said.
Gracedale and Cedarbook are among the nation's 10 long-term care facilities with the most coronavirus deaths, according to The New York Times. Gracedale and Cedarbrook have had 76 and 81 deaths, respectively, since the pandemic began, according to data compiled by The New York Times. Both county-owned nursing homes are among the largest in the state. Gracedale has experienced staff shortages at times and had to call in the National Guard to cover shifts over the spring.
McClure and Armstrong hoped the counties will receive the vaccine in the next few weeks. Nursing home residents and employees would receive first priority in both counties. As of Friday afternoon, McClure had not gotten a sense of how many employees would take the $750 to get vaccinated.
Scientists and governments have churned out the vaccine in unprecedented time. Normally, governments and the scientific community don't roll out vaccines until years of research have been conducted. Given the state of the pandemic, however, researchers used new methods to produce a vaccine in record time, and governments have granted it emergency approval. Results so far indicate the vaccine has a 95% effectiveness and has shown no serious side effects.
That historically fast turnaround of the vaccine may give some people pause before they agree to be vaccinated, said Jerry Green, president of United Steelworkers Local 2599 that represents about 50 employees at Gracedale. He has not heard from his members at the nursing home since the $750 offer became official Thursday night, but he understood why the incentive may not be enough to persuade some employees to get the shot. Still, he was glad employees would have access to the vaccine and the cash incentive if they chose to get it.
"This is something new here. If I had the opportunity to take it, I'm not sure I want to be the guinea pig up front. You are trusting the federal government that that's going to work," Green said.

Times Says 'Caliphate' Fell Short of Its Standards

Texto completo: The Times cited an institutional failure and determined the "Caliphate" team gave too much credence to the claims of a supposed former terrorist.
After an internal review that took more than two months, The New York Times has determined that "Caliphate," its award-winning 2018 podcast, did not meet the standards for Times journalism.
The 12-part audio documentary featuring Rukmini Callimachi, a Times correspondent who has frequently reported from conflict zones, sought to shed light on the Islamic State terrorist group. The Times found that "Caliphate" gave too much credence to the false or exaggerated accounts of one of its main subjects, Shehroze Chaudhry, a resident of Canada who claimed to have taken part in Islamic State executions.
Dean Baquet, the executive editor of The Times, said the blame fell on the newsroom's leaders, including himself.
"When The New York Times does deep, big, ambitious journalism in any format, we put it to a tremendous amount of scrutiny at the upper levels of the newsroom," he said in a podcast interview that was posted by The Times on Friday.
"We did not do that in this case," he continued. "And I think that I or somebody else should have provided that same kind of scrutiny, because it was a big, ambitious piece of journalism. And I did not provide that kind of scrutiny, nor did my top deputies with deep experience in examining investigative reporting."
The Times started its review of "Caliphate" after Canadian authorities arrested Mr. Chaudhry on Sept. 25 and charged him with perpetrating a terrorist hoax. In an Editors' Note on Friday, The Times said its investigation had "found a history of misrepresentations by Mr. Chaudhry and no corroboration that he committed the atrocities he described in the 'Caliphate' podcast. As a result, The Times has concluded that the episodes of 'Caliphate' that presented Mr. Chaudhry's claims did not meet our standards for accuracy."
The Editors' Note described two main problems: The Times's failure to assign an editor well versed in terrorism to keep a close watch on the series; and the "Caliphate" team's lack of skepticism and rigor in its reporting on Mr. Chaudhry.
"From the outset, 'Caliphate' should have had the regular participation of an editor experienced in the subject matter," the note said. "In addition, The Times should have pressed harder to verify Mr. Chaudhry's claims before deciding to place so much emphasis on one individual's account."
Every episode of "Caliphate" now begins with a correction read by Michael Barbaro, the host of The Daily podcast, who tells listeners that the chapters on Mr. Chaudhry "did not meet our standards for accuracy." A new installment, "An Examination of 'Caliphate,"' has also been added. It includes the interview with Mr. Baquet, conducted by Mr. Barbaro, that was released on Friday. In the interview, Mr. Baquet raised the possibility that Mr. Chaudhry had "duped" The Times, but said the news organization was at fault.
"Look, there was a well-known reporter involved in it -- Rukmini Callimachi," he said. "But this failing isn't about any one reporter. I think this was an institutional failing."
The Times reviewed "Caliphate" in two separate investigations. Dean E. Murphy, an associate managing editor for investigations, headed a group that examined how the series was reported, edited and fact-checked, and reviewed past articles by Ms. Callimachi. Mark Mazzetti, an investigative correspondent with an expertise in intelligence, led a team of reporters who looked into Mr. Chaudhry. On Friday the Times published an article by the Mazzetti-led team, which provided a depiction of Mr. Chaudhry that contrasted sharply with the man who was central to "Caliphate," describing him as "a fabulist who spun jihadist tales about killing."
Mr. Baquet said in the interview with Mr. Barbaro that "the reporting team couldn't find any independent evidence to back up his story of being an ISIS executioner in Syria." He added, "I think this guy, we now believe, was a con artist, who made up most if not all that he told us."
Since the start of the review process, Ms. Callimachi's byline has not appeared in The Times. Mr. Baquet said in an interview for this article that Ms. Callimachi will stay at the paper. "She's going to take on a new beat, and she and I are discussing possibilities," he said. "I think it's hard to continue covering terrorism after what happened with this story. But I think she's a fine reporter." Her last published work was a series of articles on the killing of Breonna Taylor. As a result of the internal investigation, The Times added editors' notes describing problems with two articles by Ms. Callimachi in 2014 and 2019.
In a Twitter statement on Friday, Ms. Callimachi, who declined to comment for this article, said, "To our listeners, I apologize for what we missed and what we got wrong. We are correcting the record and I commit to doing better in the future."
"Caliphate" was something new for The Times -- a venture into narrative audio that came as part of a recent emphasis on multimedia journalism. It was a creation of the Times audio department, which has grown quickly since it was started in 2016. In its review, The Times found that journalists working in audio had less oversight from upper-level editors than reporters who work for the newspaper itself.
"We do a lot of things we didn't do before," Mr. Baquet said in the interview for this article. "We don't just produce long-form newspaper stories. I don't think we have built a system to give that kind of support to some of the bigger things we do." He added, "For the most part we've gotten everything right. But I think this fell through the cracks, because it was a different way of telling stories than The New York Times is used to. We didn't have a system in place to manage that, to help the audio team manage that."
"Caliphate" had suspenseful moments, a moody score and a pair of likable hosts in Ms. Callimachi, the winner of major journalism awards for her reporting on terrorism and Islamic extremism, and Andy Mills, an audio producer and reporter. The series was the brainchild of Lisa Tobin, the executive producer of Times audio; Sam Dolnick, an assistant managing editor; and Mr. Mills, according to two people with knowledge of the podcast.
The first installment came out on April 19, 2018, as part of an episode of The Daily. The first words of "Caliphate" were an exchange between Ms. Callimachi and Mr. Chaudhry taken from a 2016 interview recorded in Canada.
"How does ISIS prepare you to kill people?" Ms. Callimachi asked.
Mr. Chaudhry, who said he had assumed the name Abu Huzayfah as a member of the Islamic State, replied haltingly, saying, "We had dolls to practice on." In later installments, he said he had taken part in lashings, as well as the killings of two people, describing the executions in grisly detail.
His apparent confession created a firestorm in Canada. Politicians asked why a supposed Islamic State executioner was living quietly within the nation's borders. Upon his Sept. 25 arrest, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police charged Mr. Chaudhry under a law usually applied to people who make false terroristic threats.
The hoax charge cast doubt on "Caliphate," but The Times was initially supportive. "The uncertainty about Abu Huzayfah's story is central to every episode of 'Caliphate' that featured him," a Times spokeswoman said in a Sept. 26 statement. Days later, The Times announced that it would review the series, which had been a popular and critical success in 2018, hitting No. 1 on Apple's list of most downloaded podcasts and later winning an Overseas Press Club prize and a Peabody Award. (By the end of Friday, the Overseas Press Club had rescinded its award, and The Times said it had offered to return the Peabody, an offer that was accepted by the Peabody Awards' executive director.)
There had been warning signs during -- and even before -- the months when "Caliphate" episodes came out each Thursday. In a 2017 interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, Mr. Chaudhry gave an account of his time with the Islamic State that differed greatly from what he had told Ms. Callimachi. In that CBC interview, he said he had "witnessed violence on a scale he could never have imagined," but did not say he had taken part.
In another interview, published on the CBC website on May 11, 2018, Mr. Chaudhry recanted his confession. When asked why he had told The Times that he had participated in atrocities, he said, "I was being childish. I was describing what I saw and, basically, I was close enough to think it was me."
Behind the scenes at The Times, as was previously reported by the paper's media columnist, Ben Smith, high-level editors had raised concerns about "Caliphate" before it was released.
In March 2018, after reviewing draft scripts, Michael Slackman, the paper's assistant managing editor in charge of international coverage, called members of the "Caliphate" team into a meeting with Matthew Purdy, a deputy managing editor, and Mr. Dolnick. Mr. Slackman and Mr. Purdy said that parts of the series seemed to rely too much on Mr. Chaudhry's uncorroborated accounts. They told the reporters and editors to pause the project until they had done more reporting.
The "Caliphate" team decided to add an episode on the discrepancies in Mr. Chaudhry's account. It was released May 24, 2018, under the title "Chapter Six: Paper Trail." In it, Ms. Callimachi said she had gone over her notes and documents with fresh eyes and noticed stamps in Mr. Chaudhry's passport suggesting he had misled her concerning his whereabouts at certain times. "It was at that point that I felt a sinking feeling in my stomach," she said in the episode.
Narrative journalism can be perilous, said Ann Marie Lipinski, a former editor in chief of The Chicago Tribune who has run the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard since 2011. "That's a certain kind of storytelling that is much valued and does have this built-in entertainment quality," she said. "But you can never sacrifice the reporting to that."
In his interview with Mr. Barbaro, Mr. Baquet said that "a really good piece of journalism not only chews on the stuff that supports the story -- it chews on the stuff that refutes the story."
"And in the end," he continued, "good journalism comes from some sort of internal debate over whether or not the stuff that supports the story is more powerful than the stuff that refutes the story. I think this is one of those cases where I think we just didn't listen hard enough to the stuff that challenged the story. And to the signs that maybe our story wasn't as strong as we thought it was."

Texto completo: He and Christopher Dodd ran the party organization, raising record sums, expanding the voter and donor bases, and sometimes raising eyebrows.
Don Fowler, a former co-chairman of the Democratic National Committee and a mainstay of South Carolina and national politics for decades, died on Tuesday in Columbia, S.C. He was 85.
Trav Robertson, the chairman of South Carolina's Democratic Party, confirmed the death, at a hospital. Jaime Harrison, the associate chair of the Democratic National Committee, said Mr. Fowler had had leukemia.
Mr. Fowler led the South Carolina party from 1971 to 1980 and was named by the national party to run the 1988 Democratic National Convention in Atlanta, which launched Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts on an unsuccessful general election campaign against his Republican rival, Vice President George Bush.
Mr. Fowler served as national chairman of the Democratic National Committee from 1995 to 1997. He was picked by President Bill Clinton to run the party's day-to-day operations in a power-sharing arrangement with Senator Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, who was named general chairman.
The two were credited with raising record-breaking sums for the party, deepening its pool of donors, expanding its army of volunteers and leading a successful voter-registration drive focusing on African-Americans, The Washington Post reported.
Mr. Dodd, the more well known of the two, was largely the public face of the party leadership. But Mr. Fowler was thrust into the spotlight himself when he was accused of improperly trying to enlist the help of the C.I.A. in 1995 to aid a major donor to President Clinton's 1996 re-election campaign.
The donor, an oilman who had developed a relationship with the C.I.A. on previous ventures, was seeking to build a pipeline in Turkey and sought help from the White House.
Testifying to a Senate committee, Mr. Fowler professed that he could not remember speaking to a C.I.A. agent who claimed that he had done precisely that. "I have in the middle of the night, high noon, late in the afternoon, early in the morning, every hour of the day, for months now searched my memory about conversations with the C.I.A.," Mr. Fowler told the senators. "And I have no memory, no memory of any conversation with the C.I.A."
He was not charged with any wrongdoing.
Mr. Fowler also found himself defending a plan to entice potential donors with a variety of perks in exchange for their dollars, including dinners with the Clintons, private meetings with administration officials, participation in "issue retreats" and "honored guest status" at the party's 1996 convention in Chicago. In an editorial, The New York Times called the plan "seedy."
In 1996, Mr. Fowler successfully fought off a lawsuit by the fringe candidate Lyndon LaRouche, who was seeking the Democratic nomination for the fifth time. He filed the suit after Mr. Fowler had instructed state parties to disregard votes for him. Mr. Fowler had described Mr. LaRouche's views as "explicitly racist and anti-Semitic" and had accused him of defrauding donors and voters. Mr. LaRouche was not, he said, "a bona fide Democrat."
Donald Lionel Fowler was born on Sept. 12, 1935, in Spartanburg, S.C. He earned a degree in psychology from Wofford College in Spartanburg, where he was a star basketball player; he was later inducted into its Hall of Fame. He received a master's degree and a doctorate in political science from the University of Kentucky.
While holding his political posts and running an advertising and public relations business in Columbia, he taught political science for five decades at the University of South Carolina and also at the Citadel, South Carolina's military college.
His first wife, Septima (Briggs) Fowler, with whom he had two children, died in 1997. In 2005, Mr. Fowler married Carol Khare. They had worked together at the Democratic National Committee and at his communications firm. Carol Fowler became chair of the state party in 2007.
Complete information on survivors was not immediately available.
This year, the Fowlers' home in the Five Points area of Columbia, the state capital, became a regular stop for many Democrats seeking their party's presidential nomination in the run-up to the South Carolina primary in February. Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar and Bill de Blasio were among those who showed up as dozens of people crowded into the Fowlers' living room.
Representative Jim Clyburn of South Carolina, the House majority whip and a frequent guest lecturer in Mr. Fowler's classes, told the South Carolina newspaper The State, "Don was always the connector, the one bringing political friends and, sometimes, enemies together."

Texto completo: A Canadian's gruesome account as an Islamic State executioner in Syria, which was the subject of the "Caliphate" podcast by The New York Times, was fabricated, officials say. A Times review found no corroboration of his claim to have committed atrocities.
He described the killings in lurid detail -- how he shot one man in the head and stabbed another in the heart before hanging the corpse on a cross.
He spoke at length about joining the religious police of the Islamic State in Syria, and being trucked to a terrorist training session on attacking the West, including North America, his homeland.
He recounted how Islamic State commanders displayed maps and color-coded instructions, showing recruits like him how to strike major Western targets, get into restricted areas, kill people and attain martyrdom.
They envisioned "something as spectacular as 9/11," he said. "They wanted to outdo Al Qaeda, make their mark."
But Shehroze Chaudhry, the central figure in the 2018 podcast "Caliphate," by The New York Times, was a fabulist who spun jihadist tales about killing for the Islamic State in Syria, Canadian and American intelligence and law enforcement officials contend.
Mr. Chaudhry, they say, was not a terrorist, almost certainly never went to Syria, and concocted gruesome stories about being an Islamic State executioner as part of a Walter Mitty-like escape from his more mundane life in a Toronto suburb and in Lahore, Pakistan, where he spent years living with his grandparents.
Mr. Chaudhry's elaborate accounts, told to The Times and other news outlets, caused a political uproar in Canada. The award-winning "Caliphate" series broadcast his claims of killing for the Islamic State to millions of listeners, fueling outrage that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government had allowed a terrorist to live freely in suburban Toronto despite the crimes Mr. Chaudhry had so openly confessed to committing in Syria.
Now, Mr. Chaudhry's public declarations have put him in legal jeopardy. In September, the Canadian authorities charged Mr. Chaudhry with perpetrating a terrorist hoax, a criminal charge that could bring up to five years in prison if he is convicted.
Tracking the thousands of fighters who have traveled from across the world to fight with the Islamic State is a sprawling, often murky, undertaking. Before "Caliphate" aired, two American officials told The Times that Mr. Chaudhry had, in fact, joined ISIS and crossed into Syria. And some of the people who know and have counseled Mr. Chaudhry say they have no doubt that he holds extremist, jihadist views.
But Canadian law enforcement officials, who conducted an almost four-year investigation into Mr. Chaudhry, say their examination of his travel and financial records, social media posts, statements to the police and other intelligence make them confident that he did not enter Syria or join ISIS, much less commit the grievous crimes he described.
American officials interviewed for this article support the conclusion that Mr. Chaudhry, who turns 26 on Saturday, was never a terrorist threat. It is difficult to say with absolute certainty that he never entered Syria, they warn.
But even if he did, they contend, it would have been for a brief period -- in which he claimed to have joined ISIS, received religious and weapons training, gone on patrols, meted out punishment, carried out executions and participated in secret discussions about plotting high-profile attacks against the West.
"Hoaxes can generate fear within our communities and create the illusion there is a potential threat to Canadians, while we have determined otherwise," Superintendent Christopher deGale, the head of the national security team that conducted the investigation, said in a statement about the case.
The "Caliphate" series raised questions about some of Mr. Chaudhry's assertions and devoted an episode of the podcast to them. After the Canadians charged Mr. Chaudhry with a hoax, The Times examined his case again, taking a fresh look at social media posts, photographs, travel records, academic transcripts and other potential evidence that could shed light on his contention that he had joined, and killed for, ISIS in Syria.
The review established a timeline of his movements, which did not rule out the possibility that Mr. Chaudhry went to Syria within a narrow window of a few weeks. But it also identified a history of misrepresentations by Mr. Chaudhry -- including using pictures of fighters in Syria that were available on the internet and passing them off as his own to portray himself as an ISIS member -- that casts ample doubt on his claims. Indeed, the review found no independent corroboration of Mr. Chaudhry's participation in the atrocities he claims to have committed in the "Caliphate" podcast.
As a result of the review, The Times on Friday published an editors' note that the podcast was "not sufficiently rigorous" and that the episodes presenting Mr. Chaudhry's claims did not meet its standards.
'His Real Life Is a Bit Dull'
Today, Mr. Chaudhry spends much of his time in Big Grill, his family's shawarma and kebab shop in a sprawling and busy strip mall in Oakville, a suburb outside of Toronto.
On a recent afternoon, Mr. Chaudhry was applying toppings and wrapping up takeout orders as a steady stream of customers made their way into the restaurant. A brightly lit picture of a shawarma rotisserie sat in the window, alongside a note offering free meals to people left hungry by the coronavirus pandemic.
"He's bored," said Amarnath Amarasingam, an assistant professor at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, who has been counseling Mr. Chaudhry for more than three years and believes his account of joining ISIS in Syria. "His real life is a bit dull."
Mr. Chaudhry declined to comment, but his lawyer, Nader R. Hasan, said that his client would dispute the hoax charge. Under the law, prosecutors not only need to show that Mr. Chaudhry lied, but that he also intended to frighten the public into thinking that terrorists were about to cause "death, bodily harm" or significant property damage.
"Mr. Chaudhry has been charged with a very serious criminal offense of which he is not guilty," Mr. Hasan wrote in an email to The Times, without specifying how he would contest the charge.
Legal experts say Mr. Chaudhry's defense will probably challenge the second requirement of the hoax charge -- that he intended to sow fear.
Cultivating a Persona
The Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the national police force, and other security agencies began investigating Mr. Chaudhry in late 2016, after he posted on social media that he had "been to the battlefield" in Syria for "a bit less than a year" and shared pictures online to cultivate his image as an ISIS warrior.
Even at the time, Mr. Chaudhry's social media claims offered little evidence. His postings, compiled by researchers, showed photographs of silhouetted fighters holding assault rifles in a jagged, rocky landscape. Mr. Chaudhry described the rugged setting as his "humble abode."
But far from proving Mr. Chaudhry's jihadist bona fides, at least one of the pictures was a brazen copy of widely available news photography, The Times's examination found. The original image had been taken months earlier by a photographer for the official Russian news agency, Tass, and had been distributed by Getty Images, one of the world's biggest suppliers of photographs.
Other images Mr. Chaudhry provided as evidence that he had gone to Syria -- specifically, snapshots he said he had taken of armed men at the beach, whom he described as his "fellow fighters" -- also proved to be identical to photographs that had been posted on Twitter years before by Syrian antiwar activists, The Times's examination found. And as with other images, Mr. Chaudhry misrepresented -- or perhaps didn't actually know -- where, and sometimes when, they had been taken.
Canadian officials did not say exactly when they became convinced that Mr. Chaudhry had fabricated large parts of his story, but they insist it didn't take very long to figure out. Ralph Goodale, the Canadian public safety minister from 2015 to 2019, said he had information suggesting that Mr. Chaudhry's accounts of joining ISIS in Syria were false when The Times broadcast "Caliphate" in 2018. Still, Mr. Goodale said he was unable to declare that publicly at the time because the police investigation was underway.
"I had reason to suspect this individual was not what he pretended to be," Mr. Goodale, who is no longer in politics, said in an email.
Despite the many holes in Mr. Chaudhry's story, confusing and sometimes contradictory intelligence reports circulated about him for years, offering a glimpse into the daunting challenge officials face in identifying the thousands of foreign fighters who streamed into Syria to join the Islamic State.
One Canadian official, who was not involved in the criminal investigation, recently described a 2017 intelligence report that said Mr. Chaudhry -- who went by the name Abu Huzayfah -- had traveled to Syria to join the Islamic State. But the report, according to the official, said that Mr. Chaudhry had done little of consequence in the country and left not long after he arrived.
Beyond that, a senior Iraqi intelligence official recently said that a source had identified Mr. Chaudhry in a photograph and called him an ISIS combatant in Iraq and Syria who had also been imprisoned in Syria, muddying the waters even more.
But after examining the evidence they collected, Canadian officials now say they are confident that Mr. Chaudhry never went to Syria, and they do not expect him to argue at trial that his claims of being an ISIS executioner are even partly true.
'You Can't Just Sit Back'
Mr. Chaudhry moved to Canada from Pakistan with his family when he was less than 2 years old, according to his uncle, and grew up in Burlington, a suburb southwest of Toronto. In a university enrollment form in Pakistan, Mr. Chaudhry stated that he graduated from a Burlington high school in 2012. His father opened the family restaurant in nearby Oakville.
After high school, Mr. Chaudhry traveled to South Africa in 2012 and enrolled in a madrasa, an Islamic school, in a town just south of Johannesburg. Photographs Mr. Chaudhry provided, which The Times recently verified as having been taken at the madrasa, showed the school, its dorms and him with other students there.
But he didn't settle at the madrasa, according to his uncle, Muhammad Usman. Mr. Chaudhry moved to Pakistan to live with his maternal grandparents, with whom he was close. By the end of 2012, he was enrolled in an environmental science course at the Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology at the University of Lahore, the school's records show.
He spent the next three and a half years living in Lahore in a middle-class district, returning to Canada during school holidays, according to his family and passport records.
"He used to go to university regularly," his grandfather, Shakil Ahmed, told The Times in 2018. "I used to pick him up and drop him at the bus stop. I used to collect him from the bus stop on a motorbike," he said at the time. Mr. Ahmed has since died.
At the campus where Mr. Chaudhry studied, students in both Western and traditional Pakistani dress mingle freely. Unlike at another famous university in Lahore, the University of the Punjab, where Islamist groups keep a tight check on male and female interactions, the University of Lahore's atmosphere is relatively relaxed and casual.
His uncle, Mr. Usman, said Mr. Chaudhry had shown some attraction to militant culture, but suggested it was more role-playing than anything serious. "He just got attracted to those types because he wanted to be a true Muslim," he said. "He used to get very excited," he added, by wearing garments in "Taliban style."
Mr. Chaudhry said in the "Caliphate" podcast that the brutal civil war in Syria, which began in 2011, woke him to the plight of Muslims around the globe and spurred him to action. "You can't just sit back and, you know, watch the world burn," he said.
At first, he told The Times that he had flown to Turkey from Pakistan and crossed into Syria on foot, sneaking through a hole in a border fence to join the Islamic State in February 2014. He described his duties with the religious police force, patrolling the streets to enforce the group's harsh interpretation of Islam and meting out brutal punishment on local residents, sometimes with a metal-studded belt.
He said he remained in Syria through July 2014, and was there when ISIS' leader at the time, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, declared the territory a caliphate, claiming to revive the Muslim theocracy that ended with the fall of the Ottoman Empire. Mr. Chaudhry described the celebrations inside ISIS-controlled territory at that triumphal moment, but said he left Syria after that, having grown disillusioned with the group and the killings he had been ordered to carry out. So he fled, he said, slipping back across the Turkish border and making his way back to Pakistan.
But suspicions arose when The Times, while reporting "Caliphate," found no stamps for Turkey in his Canadian passport and determined that his Pakistani passport had long expired. Records show he had actually flown from Lahore to Toronto in February 2014, returned to Lahore later that same month, and then flown back to Toronto again in July 2014 -- during the period he said he was in Syria.
Confrontation, and a Changed Story
Before "Caliphate" was broadcast, The Times confronted Mr. Chaudhry with some of the inconsistencies in his account. He then changed his story, claiming that he had traveled to Syria well after the declaration of the caliphate -- sometime "after September 2014," he ultimately said in the "Caliphate" podcast.
But even that version of events is called into question by his university records, which suggest that he went to school that fall and appear to leave little time for him to have gone to Syria.
The records show a middling student who got into trouble when he failed to pay his bus fees and who pestered the university over his biology grades. But his transcript shows that he was awarded grades for the 2014 fall term, which ended in January 2015.
Then, weeks later, records show, he submitted a handwritten note to the university in March 2015, requesting time off from his studies; his family said he had had a motorbike accident in Lahore. His Canadian passport says he left Pakistan a few weeks later, and Facebook posts by Mr. Chaudhry, documented by a Canadian journalist before they were taken down, suggested that he was back in Canada in April and May.
Overlooked Inconsistencies
Mr. Chaudhry told The Times before "Caliphate" went on the air about one of his supposed emirs, or commanders, inside Syria. The emir had been the subject of an article in a Swedish publication.
The journalist who wrote the article helped The Times interview the emir for the "Caliphate" podcast. In the interview, the emir said he recognized, with some uncertainty, Mr. Chaudhry's face from photographs that The Times had provided.
But the emir's account challenged several of Mr. Chaudhry's central assertions. The emir described himself as a commander in a different city from the one where Mr. Chaudhry claimed to have been stationed. He rejected the notion that Mr. Chaudhry had ever served under him. And he said that Mr. Chaudhry most likely had a military role, undercutting a principal element of Mr. Chaudhry's story -- that he was a religious police officer, not a battlefield soldier. Some of these inconsistencies were not included in the "Caliphate" podcast.
Later, the emir sent a short voice message of a second ISIS official who claimed to remember Mr. Chaudhry. The Times never interviewed the person directly, yet included his assertions in "Caliphate." And, as noted in the podcast, The Times did not independently verify the identities of these supposed officials or vet the accuracy of their accounts.
Beyond that, the "Caliphate" podcast said the second ISIS official seemed to have inside information about Mr. Chaudhry -- specifically, that he was Canadian -- that had not been given to him in advance. But in its later review, The Times found that Mr. Chaudhry's nationality had already been provided to the emir during his interview for the "Caliphate." The emir then contacted the second official to see if he recognized Mr. Chaudhry.
When Mr. Chaudhry's social media posts grabbed the attention of the Canadian police in 2016, catching people who had gone abroad to join ISIS and charging them under terrorism laws was a big priority for the authorities. For the mounted police, Mr. Chaudhry's social media postings held the promise that they could bring a case against a Canadian citizen.
Officials said the first steps of the investigation used the digital fingerprints from Mr. Chaudhry's trove of online activity, travel data and other information from several countries to determine if he had, in fact, entered Syria through Turkey or Iraq -- the two most common entry points for foreign fighters going to Syria to join the Islamic State.
As the investigation continued, Mr. Chaudhry settled back into his life in Burlington. Before "Caliphate" aired, he told The Times that he had resumed his studies at a Canadian university. But Canadian officials say their investigation found no evidence that he was a student in Canada.
'He's Created a Fantasy'
The police and others have made attempts to shake Mr. Chaudhry from his radical views. Those people include Mubin Shaikh, known in Canada for his work as a confidential informant for the authorities inside a group known as the Toronto 18. Its members had plotted an elaborate wave of terror attacks in Canada.
Mr. Shaikh, who now acts as a deradicalization guide, said he got to know Mr. Chaudhry but parted ways with him because he believed that Mr. Chaudhry would not renounce his views. He believes the stories Mr. Chaudhry told were "fantasies."
"He's an ISIS supporter, a hundred percent," Mr. Shaikh said. "So it looks like he's created a fantasy for himself. I can see how this happens. You're consuming this ISIS stuff day in and day out. You have no life, no friends, no real anything."
But Mr. Amarasingam, the professor who has been counseling Mr. Chaudhry, rejects the idea that the young man is an impostor. "You would have to be some sort of a sociopath to literally invent a story like this in your head, have all the details in place and then tell hundreds of people about it for months at a time, or dozens of people, and just kind of carry on like that," Mr. Amarasingam said. "This seems insane to me."
He says he remains in touch with Mr. Chaudhry and has spoken with him since his arrest. "He was upset that his name was public and his face was public, because now it's going to prove difficult to get a job or prove difficult when he's in a relationship," Mr. Amarasingam said. "I think he's definitely pro-jihadist, probably a bit pro-ISIS, even though he's critical of them. He still talks very nostalgically in a weird way about the people he knew there."
In May, after a special national security unit led by the mounted police investigated whether Mr. Chaudhry had gone to Syria in an attempt to join or assist ISIS -- crimes in Canada -- the authorities decided to pursue the hoax charge, officials say.
On Sept. 25, they say, the police arrived at the Chaudhry family's rented home. Minutes later, Mr. Chaudhry was put in a car, where he was informed that he was being arrested under a terrorism hoax section of Canada's criminal law.
He was allowed to go back into his house, without any other conditions. His lawyer would not describe Mr. Chaudhry's legal strategy in the case, other than to say that "he intends to vigorously defend himself."

NEW YORK — Since its arrival Monday, the coronavirus vaccine has brought hope to New Yorkers.
But so far, only a few have actually been administered the vaccine.
In the first 72 hours after the vaccine’s arrival, some 5,200 health care workers in New York City received the first of two doses, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Thursday. It was a slow start to what officials are calling the greatest mass vaccination campaign in the past 50 years, perhaps since polio.
In fact, in the first three days of vaccinations, more than twice as many new coronavirus cases have been reported in the city as shots administered.
Mass citywide distribution isn’t expected for months. But the first week has brought at least some clarity on how the process might go.
It’s going to move slowly, at least initially
On Monday, as the first shipments of vaccines arrived, Gov. Andrew Cuomo predicted a speedy rollout. “Today we’re in the process of administering 10,000 vaccines,” he said.
But two days later, the state health commissioner, Dr. Howard Zucker, said only 4,000 people had been vaccinated across the state.
Hospitals took it slow from the start. At Mount Sinai in Manhattan, about 25 people were vaccinated at the health system’s flagship hospital Tuesday shortly after it received its first shipment, though doctors there said the vaccination program would quickly scale up.
“We’re going to need to pick up the pace dramatically just to vaccinate all our health care workers, let alone the population at large,” said Mark Levine, a New York City councilman who is chair of the City Council’s Committee on Health.
Hospitals do expect to quicken the pace. But with so many unanswered questions at the start of the week — when the vaccine would arrive, how many doses they would receive — it did not make sense to schedule too many people for vaccinations at first.
So the vaccination campaign is off to a slow start. In 1947, New York City managed to vaccinate a few million people against smallpox in a matter of weeks.
Fewer doses arrived than anticipated
Earlier this month, Cuomo said that New York state would receive 170,000 doses of the vaccine made by Pfizer and BioNTech on Tuesday. On Wednesday, Cuomo said only about 87,000 of that initial batch had arrived. By Friday, the rest of the shipment had arrived, according to the governor’s office.
Amid growing scarcity, the state Health Department has instructed hospitals in New York not to publicly disclose how much they received, even asking them to sign a memorandum of understanding, representatives of three hospital systems said.
“Due to the potential for security concerns, the MOU requires facilities not to disclose quantity on hand,” the state Department of Health said in a statement.
Levine said he believed that hospitals got slightly under 1,000 doses each, although a single hospital system like Mount Sinai or NewYork-Presbyterian may have received shipments at multiple hospitals.
Regardless, the doses that did arrive were well-received.
On Tuesday, Ji Won Lee, an emergency room nurse at Mount Sinai Hospital, said she was inspired by watching the video of a nurse in Queens, Sandra Lindsay, become the first person in the U.S. to be vaccinated.
“It was groundbreaking,” she said. “We have been waiting for this vaccine for so many months, for this pandemic to be over.”
“I wanted it, too,” she added.
Being first can be worrisome
While many health care workers are eager to be vaccinated, some acknowledge feeling ambivalent.
In authorizing the Pfizer vaccine, which during a clinical trial appeared to offer strong protection against the virus, the FDA said it found no “meaningful imbalances” in serious health complications between those that received the vaccine and those that received the placebo in a large-scale trial.
But that was not enough to convince all health care workers, who are part of Phase 1 of vaccine distribution.
“Some of my colleagues feel they want to wait for the second wave,” said Petrona Ennis-Welch, a critical care nurse and the first health care worker to receive the vaccine at Mount Sinai Hospital this week. “They do not want to be a part of the first round. They want to see how people do — which is understandable.”
Ennis-Welch, 54, has been treating coronavirus patients since March, when the first wave brought a surge of desperately sick people to emergency rooms across the city. “Patients were very ill, and they were dying quickly,” she recalled.
She acknowledged that even she had some misgivings. “To be honest, I had concerns, but when I stopped to think about it, I said, ‘You know, you’re here working every day, you’re among COVID patients, you really should just take it,’” she recalled.
Still, it seemed that the overwhelming majority of health care workers would choose to be vaccinated. At Northwell Health, the state’s largest hospital system, more than 1,600 people had been vaccinated by midday Thursday. Only two people had declined or deferred, said Joe Kemp, a spokesperson for the hospital.
One of the earliest Mount Sinai Hospital employees to be vaccinated was John Gomez, 53, who cleans hospital floors and patient rooms. Back in March, he fell sick with a severe case of the virus and was hospitalized for about a week.
When he heard a vaccine was available, it was an easy decision: “I’ll take it,” he said.
He noted that among some of his colleagues in housekeeping, the vaccine might prove a tougher sell. He had heard a number of conspiracy theories from them.
Past infection didn’t eliminate anyone
Some of those receiving the vaccine likely already have some protection against the coronavirus from a past infection. At Mount Sinai, several of the first group to be vaccinated recalled being sick with the virus or testing positive for antibodies.
Dr. Jolion McGreevy, medical director of the emergency department, said he had the coronavirus a couple of months ago, though it was a light case with just one day of symptoms.
“It’s important protection, not just for us, but more importantly for the patients we care for and our families at home,” McGreevy said about the shot he had received just a few minutes earlier.
The amount and duration of protection that past COVID-19 infections offer is not fully understood, but some researchers believe that many people likely experience some long-term protection. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that clinical trials suggest the vaccine “is safe and likely efficacious” in people who have had prior coronavirus infections.
Dr. Dave Chokshi, the New York City health commissioner, has said an “antibody test result has no bearing on whether or not you should get a COVID-19 vaccine.”
That’s an important point in New York City, where one study suggested that more than one-fifth of the city’s residents had the coronavirus during the first wave in the spring.
More is on the way
The Pfizer vaccine has so far received the most attention, because it’s the first vaccine the FDA has authorized for emergency use.
But the Moderna vaccine, which received FDA approval on Friday night, could start arriving in New York early next week in larger numbers than the Pfizer vaccine. Cuomo has said he expected the state to soon receive 346,000 doses from Moderna.
But the initial shipments from Pfizer and Moderna won’t even cover half of the 1.8 million people in the state who form part of the Phase 1 group, which also includes nursing home residents and workers.
On Wednesday, Cuomo indicated that Phase 2, which includes those categorized as essential workers, isn’t likely to start until late January.

We may think of 2020 as a year of seemingly endless bad news as the pandemic threatened our health, forced us to stay at home and upended most facets of life. But it wasn’t all bad.
Here are some of the things that managed to come out on top.
Rescue Animals
In a pandemic, a young man’s — and pretty much everyone else’s — fancy lightly turns to thoughts of ... pets. Or so it seemed this year, anyway, as the hottest commodity during lockdown after toilet paper and sourdough starters turned out to be rescue puppies and other critters.
Stuck in our homes, starved of emotional interaction, suddenly we viewed those formerly unwanted animals in a new light. Their needs gave a structure to formless days; their affection was an antidote to the loneliness of social distancing; their energy was an excuse to get out of the house.
The race to adopt was on as of April, when Wired reported, “All over the country, from New York to Wisconsin and North Carolina to Colorado and New Mexico, animal shelters are reporting massive upswings in the numbers of animals they’ve been able to adopt out or place in foster homes.”
By August, some organizations had waiting lists. When holiday season rolled around, gift givers had to start thinking hamsters. Now we’re all barking up the same tree.
— VANESSA FRIEDMAN
Guns
In the first six months of 2020, according to the National Vital Statistics System at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1,778,000 babies were born in the United States, while 1,626,000 people died. During the same period, Americans purchased approximately 19 million firearms. According to estimates by the Brookings Institution, based on background check data provided by the FBI, 3.9 million guns were bought in June alone, the highest single-month sales on record.
The June surge in gun purchases corresponded with a national protest movement against racism, as well as episodes of street violence and property destruction — a response that, if not exactly heartening, was predictable and with precedent.
More novel, though, was the surge that came just three months before, in March, when President Donald Trump declared the pandemic was a national emergency and cities and states across the country locked down.
Millions of Americans responded to the shock and uncertainty of a new, deadly and poorly understood disease by stocking up on food, toilet paper, cleaning supplies and communications equipment. Millions more, additionally or perhaps just instead, drove to the store and left with a new gun.
— JOHN HERMANN
Edibles
A steady stream of anxiety-inducing events that could make anyone wish for an escape hatch called for one thing: marijuana. By late spring, cannabis stores and medical marijuana dispensaries were deemed essential businesses in more than a dozen states. Weed won at the polls too. Arizona, Montana, New Jersey and South Dakota legalized recreational marijuana, and Mississippi and South Dakota made medical marijuana legal.
Edibles became a popular choice for a pandemic. Sales were up with cannabis edibles even before the coronavirus swept the United States, as people drifted away from smoking and vaping to protect their lungs from the respiratory virus. With so many stuck inside with a bit of extra time on their hands, it’s no surprise what they ended up reaching for. Whatever works.
— LINDSEY UNDERWOOD
Streamers
There was perhaps no group of creators more prepared for the horrors of 2020 than streamers. Sitting in front of their cameras, often alone, talking for hours to the camera is what they do, and many are excellent at it. As those in traditional media struggled to entertain audiences on platforms like Instagram Live and Twitch, streamers were perfectly positioned to capture the moment.
They hosted gaming tournaments, debates and news coverage. They provided millions of bored Americans with educational content, streaming themselves cooking, baking bread and crafting. They hosted politicians including Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., who used the streamers to help encourage young people to vote.
All of this contributed to a livestreaming boom in 2020. Twitch hit a high in terms of monthly hours watched, with 1.7 billion hours watched in November alone, according to a report from StreamElements, a livestreaming tools and services provider, and arsenal.gg, an analytics firm. Chatting channels, where streamers talk with their audience, became the most popular category as quarantine took hold and people grasped for social connection.
Streamers also captured the political moment. The 29-year-old progressive political commentator Hasan Piker rose to the top of Twitch in November after more than 80 hours of live election coverage. As the Black Lives Matter movement spread this summer, “Twitch became a hub for airing the sit-ins and marches over racial inequality,” The New York Times reported.
Outside of Twitch, popular influencers who had only dipped their toes into streaming began broadcasting hours of their lives, streaming themselves even as they slept.
— TAYLOR LORENZ
Screen Time
Before this year, screen time was a hotly contested parenting topic. On one end of the spectrum was the zero-tolerance crowd, who were certain that touch screens would short-circuit a toddler’s neurons and destroy a teenager’s life. On the other, were the all-screens crowd, who wanted to teach their children coding as a second language.
In 2020, even the most organic Montessori toy mom had to hand over the iPad for at least a little while each day to preserve her fraying sanity. Who knows if it will stick, but screens are here to stay for everyone until at least the end of 2021.
— JESSICA GROSE
Messy People
I have a theory about living arrangements: The most important compatibility test is each person’s tolerance to messiness. And as we all know, a mismatched Messiness Quotient among roommates can make things ... messy.
So as lockdowns this year forced millions of Americans indoors and turned living spaces into working spaces (and gyms, schools, bars), our collective MQs were pushed to the limit. Who can be bothered to pick up an empty water bottle or take those empty Amazon boxes to the recycling bin when the world is falling apart?
If you, like me, are a messy person whose MQ matches that of the people you live with, well, this is our moment. No longer must we hide in the shadowy dirty clothes piles and overflowing junk drawers of society. Tidying up for guests? Hosting guests is canceled! Need to clear the table for dinner? Nope, that’s a workstation now, we’re eating on the bed again. And as I wrote this, from my standing desk at home, I paused to search for my yoga mat. Unable to find it, I asked my roommate to help. No luck.
“It’s not, like, a small thing. How could we lose it?” I asked her. She smirked and said, “Come on.”
Even The New Yorker, that most august and pristine of publications, acknowledged this lifestyle on a recent cover. It featured an illustration of a woman sitting at her home desk, fully put together — from the waist up, just enough to look good for a Zoom happy hour. Outside of the view of her laptop’s camera was a house in disarray.
— TIM HERRERA
Therapy
When television writer Cord Jefferson accepted an Emmy for “The Watchmen” this year, he thanked his parents, his fellow writers and the show’s director. He also thanked his therapist, Ian, who, he said, had “changed my life in many ways.”
Self-care may be the mental health tonic of the moment, but there’s nothing like good old-fashioned talk therapy after nine long, deadly months of a pandemic. These days, you’re only human if you’re falling apart. (No, really: According to a new Gallup survey, Americans’ assessment of our mental health is “worse than it has been at any point in the last two decades.”) In the absence of national leadership, at least we’ve got our therapists.
Of course, any “winner” of 2020 is probably also kind of a loser, or at least that’s what my new therapist tells me. Therapy wins in that we could all use someone to talk to, and now we can do it from our couches. It wins in that there are startups working to close gaps in the system, and because some geographic regulations have been waived, meaning patients now have access to treatment in communities other than their own. (Mine, whom I will probably never meet in person, lives in Northampton, Massachusetts.)
And yet, therapists are drained, Zoom is exhausting, and there will always be more need than supply. As Jefferson put it in his speech, “Therapy should be free in this country.” Indeed.
— JESSICA BENNETT
Rotten Bananas
Toilet paper has always been popular, even if we never quite acknowledged it. Hand sanitizer may be in the news more than ever (was it ever in the news before?), but ask any mother with a small bottle attached to her keychain or a teacher writing a school-supply list: Well before 2020, it was a staple.
But rotten bananas?
Rotten bananas have had a pandemic-fueled, geek-to-chic glow-up.
Before this year, rotten bananas were a reminder of our waste, our excess, our inability to forsake the egg and cheese on a roll in favor of making a healthy smoothie for breakfast like we promised ourselves we would do when we bought groceries.
As we rushed from home to work or social gatherings, we never made the smoothie, we always got the roll, and our bananas idled, getting mushy and bruised.
Then came 2020: a monthslong opportunity to re-examine all that we once wrote off as without value, and to bake banana bread, relying on some very basic ingredients and our smooshy, brown, fruit-fly-attracting treasured rotten bananas.

David Brooks: Mark Shields and the best of American liberalism

Texto completo: Every Friday evening for the last 19 years, Mark Shields and I have gathered to talk politics on the “PBS NewsHour.” When people come up to me to discuss our segment, sometimes they mention the things we said to each other, but more often they mention how we clearly feel about each other — the affection, friendship and respect. We’ve had thousands of disagreements over the years but never a second of acrimony. Mark radiates a generosity of spirit that improves all who come within his light.
This week, at 83, and after 33 years total on the show, Mark announced he was stepping back from his regular duties. I want to not only pay tribute to him here but also to capture his conception of politics, because it’s different from the conception many people carry in their heads these days.
We are all imprinted as children and young adults with certain ideas about the world, which stay with us for the rest of our lives. Mark, like many who came of age in the 1950s and 1960s — including Joe Biden — was imprinted with the idea that politics is a deeply noble profession, a form of service, a vocation.
Mark’s father was the first Catholic to serve on their town’s school board. The first time he saw his mother cry was when Adlai Stevenson lost to Dwight Eisenhower. Mark went off to Notre Dame and then served in the Marine Corps, before working as a congressional aide.
This was the mid-’60s. Evidence that government worked was all around. The GI Bill had worked, though mostly for whites. Mark had served with Black Marines because Harry Truman had the courage to integrate the military. Mark saw the passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965, the Fair Housing Act of 1968.
There was never a moment when passing this stuff was easy, but everybody took for granted the legitimacy of the system, treasured the country and the way it worked.
“The two hallmarks of American politics are optimism and pragmatism,” Mark told me this week, pointing to the optimism of FDR, JFK and Ronald Reagan.
To this day Mark argues that politics is about looking for converts, not punishing heretics. You pass bills and win campaigns by bending to accommodate those whose votes can be gotten.
He went on to work on and run political campaigns, for people like Bobby Kennedy and Ed Muskie. He came to deeply respect those he worked to elect, including presidential candidate Mo Udall: “Just a great human being.” Vice-presidential candidate Sargent Shriver: “He had the best relations with his family of any candidate I have known. His kids revered him.” And Gov. Jack Gilligan of Ohio: He “believed in us more than we believed in ourselves.”
After decades in journalism, Mark still puts the character lens before the partisan lens. He has been quick to criticize Democrats when they are snobbish, dishonest or fail to live up to the standards of basic decency — often infuriating some of our viewers.
I don’t know if it was midcentury liberalism or the midcentury record of the Boston Red Sox, but Mark instinctively identifies with the underdog. Every year he invites me to do an event with him with Catholic social workers. These are people who serve the poor and live among the poor. They have really inexpensive clothing and really radiant faces, and in their lives you see the embodiment of an entire moral system, Catholic social teaching, which has its service arm and, in Mark, its political and journalistic arm.
He comes from a generation that highly prized egalitarian manners: I’m no better than anyone else, and nobody is better than me. Like Biden, condescension is foreign to his nature. As everybody at the “NewsHour” can attest, he treats everybody with equal kindness. He also comes from a generation in which military service was widespread, along with a sense of shared sacrifice.
I look at Mark’s constellation of values and worry that they are fading away. He doesn’t buy that decline narrative: “I’m more optimistic than I have been. We have to do a little better at celebrating our successes.”
When you work with somebody this long you remember little things — the way he pops chocolates into his mouth during late-night campaign coverage — and the big emotional moments, watching, on set, the first footage of bodies floating after Katrina.
One story sticks in my mind. In 2004, the Red Sox fell behind the New York Yankees three games to none in the American League Championship Series. The Sox miraculously won the next four games and took the series. Mark went to a bunch of those games, including the final one at Yankee Stadium.
After that game Mark lingered in his seat. Memories flooded over him as sweet tears flowed — a lifetime of games with his mother and father, this magnificent victory they never got to see, the century of heartbreaks now overcome. Mark and the other Sox fans just sat there, refusing to leave, absorbing this new victorious feeling, a hint of justice in the universe.
I like to think that was God’s way of saying, “Well done, good and faithful servant.”

Texto completo: Every five years or so I try to return to land’s end, the continent’s edge, where the Columbia River empties into the Pacific Ocean — the final heave of the River of the West. I prefer to go during winter solstice, the long night of the soul in the Northern Hemisphere.
Off Cape Disappointment you look out at swells of 20 feet and struggle to walk in the face of a resolute rain and wind gusts that slap you silly. It’s exhilarating.
This year, the mouth of the Columbia serves up a metaphor for these awful times. No, not the shipwreck of the Peter Iredale , embedded offshore since 1906, just to the south of the mouth. The hollowed out skeleton of that four-masted steel bark seems too obvious a symbol of the United States in President Donald Trump’s final weeks.
The better metaphor is the story of the existential crisis that bedeviled Lewis and Clark’s ragged crew, just after they got their first glimpse of the Pacific in November 1805. They were facing an endless and desperate winter in a place they knew nothing about.
But first, they took a vote, on where to build their winter camp. In their crew, York, a slave, and Sacagawea, a Native woman and former slave, were both given a voice on this occasion. The decision was made to cross the Columbia and hunker down near what is now Astoria, Oregon.
That episode comes with plenty of asterisks. Upon his return, William Clark did not free the enslaved man who had been allowed a momentary vote in the wild. He was property, as before. “If any attempt is made by York to run off, or refuse to provorm his duty as a slave, I wish him sent to New Orleans and sold,” he wrote after the expedition had ended.
And Sacagawea, the only woman in the Corps of Discovery, the special U.S. Army unit led by Lewis and Clark, and the mother of an infant that she carried to the Pacific and back, was initially denied a chance to see the ocean until she insisted.
But as a lesson in our coming catastrophe — a season which could be “the most difficult time in the public health history of this nation” as Robert Redfield, the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said earlier this month — the winter of 1805 to 1806 is instructive.
The task of that mildewed crew was to stay alive and alert until the spring, when they planned to return. You can imagine the descent toward misery. The explorers recorded only a dozen days without rain.
As Clark wrote: “O! How disagreeable is our Situation dureing this dreadful weather.”
For his part, Meriwether Lewis appears to have suffered from bouts of severe depression throughout his life. Three years after completing the expedition he died at the age of 35, of gunshot wounds — what most historians agree was likely a suicide. “I fear the weight of his mind has overcome him,” Clark wrote after hearing the news.
During the coronavirus pandemic, the number of adults exhibiting symptoms of depression has tripled, and alcohol consumption has risen. We are prisoners of our homes and our minds, Zoom-fatigued, desperate for social contact. As a nation, we are diminished and exhausted, and millions remain out of work.
Further, it has been a long fall from that crude but egalitarian vote at the mouth of the Columbia to one that is among the nadirs of democracy, when 60% of Republican House members joined a court effort this month to negate the sovereign right of the people to elect their leaders. Vladimir Putin acknowledged Joe Biden’s victory before Mitch McConnell did.
It’s equally troubling that Biden won the popular vote by 7 million, but came within 43,000 votes of losing the election because of the anti-democratic relic of the Electoral College.
The Corps of Discovery made it back without losing a person (one man died during the westward half of the expedition). They fared well once they emerged from their long winter. We, on the other hand, face a brutal early spring. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation projects that more than 500,000 Americans likely will have died from COVID-19 by the end of March.
Dr. Anthony Fauci has made similar grim assessments of what lies ahead; in November he predicted December would see “a surge superimposed upon” a surge, not unlike the waves of the Pacific, gray and unrelenting in the December dusk.
Still, we look to the spring, as did they. We rely on our ingenuity, as did they. Even as we mourn the dead, we cheer the first people to get a shot in the arm. “I feel like healing is coming,” said Sandra Lindsay, the Long Island nurse who had the distinction of becoming the first to be vaccinated on our shores, after getting her coronavirus inoculation.
We cling to the coming spring because it’s far better than thinking about tomorrow’s dreary sameness. We look forward to a new president and the return of the simple joy of human touch.
But before that, we need to be psychologically ready for three months of pure hell. How to get through it? Hibernation — taking a cue from our fellow warm-blooded mammals. Looking inward, discovering the nuance and overlooked dimensions of things long neglected. And a sliver of advice from words attributed to Irish writer Edna O’Brien — that winter is the real spring.

Texto completo: It looks as if Congress will soon pass a much-needed economic relief ( not stimulus) bill — something that will help distressed Americans get through the next few months while we wait for widespread vaccination to set the stage for economic recovery. That’s good news, because something is better than nothing, even though what we know about the legislation says that it’s going to be deeply flawed.
But the way this debate has been playing out is ominous for the future. Even some of the good guys seem a bit confused about what they’re trying to do. And the bad guys — Mitch McConnell and company — are clearly doing some of the right things only under political duress while giving every indication that they’ll systematically undermine the economy once President-elect Joe Biden takes office.
About good guys getting it wrong: Economic relief legislation is largely about providing individuals and families with a financial lifeline during the pandemic. But who should get that lifeline? Should it go to a majority of the population, like those $1,200 checks sent out in the spring? Or should the focus be on enhanced unemployment benefits for the millions of workers who, thanks to the pandemic, have no income at all?
According to The Washington Post, Sens. Bernie Sanders and Joe Manchin had a heated argument about this issue Wednesday during a conference call, with Sanders pushing for broad aid while Manchin argued that enhanced unemployment benefits were more crucial.
Well, on most issues I’m a lot closer to Sanders than to Manchin, the most conservative Democrat in the Senate. But in this case I’m sorry to say that Manchin is right. The economic pain from the coronavirus has been very unevenly distributed: A minority of the workforce has been devastated, while those who have been able to keep working have, by and large, done relatively well. Overall wages and salaries have bounced back quickly.
So if there’s a limit on the amount of aid that can be given, it’s more important to help the unemployed — and, in particular, to sustain that help well beyond the 10 weeks reportedly in the current deal — than to send checks to those who have been able to keep working. The best argument I can see for broader payments is political — people who haven’t lost their jobs to the pandemic may be more willing to support economic relief for those who have if they also get something from the deal.
But why is there a limit on the amount of aid?
Republicans appear willing to make a deal because they fear that complete stonewalling will hurt them in the Georgia Senate runoffs. But they are determined to keep the deal under $1 trillion, hence the reported $900 billion price tag.
That $1 trillion cap, however, makes no sense. The amount we spend on emergency relief should be determined by how much aid is needed, not by the sense that $1 trillion is a scary number.
For affordability isn’t a real issue right now. The U.S. government borrowed more than $3 trillion in the 2020 fiscal year; investors were happy to lend it that money, at remarkably low interest rates. In fact, the real interest rate on U.S. debt — the rate adjusted for inflation — has lately been consistently negative, which means that the additional debt won’t even create a major future burden.
And even economists who worry about deficits normally agree that it’s appropriate to run big deficits in the face of national emergencies. If a pandemic that is still keeping around 10 million workers unemployed isn’t an emergency, I don’t know what is.
Of course, we know what’s going on here. While Republicans have made the political calculation that they must cough up some money while control of the Senate is still in doubt, they’re clearly getting ready to invoke fear of budget deficits as a reason to block anything and everything Biden proposes once he’s finally sworn in.
It should go without saying that the coming GOP pivot to deficit hawkery will be completely insincere. Republicans had no problem with rising deficits during the pre-pandemic Donald Trump years; they cheerfully passed a $1.9 trillion tax cut, mainly for corporations and the wealthy.
But the hypocrisy isn’t the main issue here. More important, shortchanging relief in the name of fiscal prudence would mean vast, unnecessary hardship for millions of Americans. I’m an optimist about prospects for economic recovery once we achieve widespread vaccination. But that won’t happen until well into 2021, and even a rapid recovery will take months after that to bring us back to something like full employment. Making a deal that only provides enhanced benefits for 10 weeks is like building a bridge that goes only a quarter of the way across a chasm.
And the case for more spending won’t end with short-term economic recovery. We’ll still need huge investments in infrastructure, child care, clean energy and more.
Republicans will try to stop all of this, claiming that it’s because they’re worried about debt. They’ll be lying, and we shouldn’t be afraid to say so.

Doctors suggest CDC should deprioritize elderly for coronavirus vaccine: They're 'whiter' and we should 'level the playing field'

Texto completo: An article in the New York Times quoted several doctors suggesting that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention should deprioritize distributing the coronavirus vaccine to the elderly because they are “whiter.”
"Older populations are whiter,” Dr. Harald Schmidt, a health and policy expert at the University of Pennsylvania, said. “Society is structured in a way that enables them to live longer. Instead of giving additional health benefits to those who already had more of them, we can start to level the playing field a bit."
The article, titled “The Elderly vs. Essential Workers: Who Should Get the Coronavirus Vaccine First?”, contained multiple examples of doctors appearing to suggest that race should be a factor in the vaccine rollout, which the CDC has been accused of supporting.
Schmidt told the Washington Examiner that it would not be a “fair characterization” to describe his comments as a “race based approach” and pointed to an essay articulating his approach in more detail.
“The fundamental point is this: Among the population 65 and older, many can live socially distanced safely and with relatively less inconvenience until they receive a vaccine,” Schmidt said. “But far more among the essential workers don’t have that option, esp [sic] frontline workers. For them, getting a vaccine sooner can literally be of existential importance. Therefore, vaccinating all healthy people 65+ before essential workers is likely to make racial and economic disparities worse. And likewise, within each population group, it is therefore critical to use a measure such as a social vulnerability index, to make sure that more vulnerable people are offered a vaccine first.”
Marc Lipsitch, a Harvard University epidemiologist, said that teachers should not be treated as essential workers when it comes to passing out the vaccine if the goal is to "reduce health inequities," in part because "they are often very white."
“Teachers have middle-class salaries, are very often white, and they have college degrees,” Lipsitch said. “Of course, they should be treated better, but they are not among the most mistreated of workers.”
When asked by the Washington Examiner whether or not it was his belief that reducing health inequities should be factored into the vaccine rollout, Lipsitch’s answer was yes.
“It is my personal belief, which I hold as a citizen and someone who is informed about the extent of health inequities through my professional work,” Lipsitch said. “It is a question of values, informed by science, so I understand that others may differ on this point.”
Lipsitch added that his quoted comment in the article is purely factual but could possibly be misconstrued.
“The ACIP framework lists reducing inequity as a goal,” Lipsitch said, referring to the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices that is tasked with constructing the vaccine’s distribution plan. “I simply said that the goal is not particularly served by the prioritization of teachers (which I support for other reasons).”
“I do not believe I stated what is paraphrased ‘teachers should not be included as essential workers, if a central goal of the committee is to reduce health inequities.’ I may have said something that could be mistaken for that. I just think essential workers, and those who should be prioritized to reduce inequities, are overlapping but not identical groups of people," he said.
A senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute disagreed with Lipsitch’s comment in the New York Times article and provided a race-based conclusion of her own while arguing that teachers should be prioritized in the vaccine's distribution because their students are mostly “black and brown.”
“When you talk about disproportionate impact and you’re concerned about people getting back into the labor force, many are mothers, and they will have a harder time if their children don’t have a reliable place to go,” she said. “And if you think generally about people who have jobs where they can’t telework, they are disproportionately Black and brown. They’ll have more of a challenge when child care is an issue.”
The article has been criticized on Twitter in recent days, including a thread from a user named Jason Compson, an apparent reference to a character from a William Faulkner novel, who slammed the doctors cited in the story.
“So to sum up, in this single article by @JanHoffmanNYT, three experts — Schdmit, Lipsitch, and Gould — say that more white people dying will ‘level the playing field’, teachers are ‘too white’ to deserve a vaccine, but that their 'Black and Brown' students make them deserving," Compson tweeted. Tweet
Lipsitch took issue with that characterization and responded to Compson on Twitter.
"I have never said teachers are nonessential or that their race/income makes them nonessential," Lipsitch wrote. "Lots of people trying to stoke false arguments have read it that way, but I didn't say it, I don't believe it, and in fact I believe and have said the opposite."Tweet
When asked by Compson if he was misquoted by the New York Times, Lipsitch said, "My quote does not use the word essential, on purpose. They are essential, are not the ones to prioritize for equity reasons, apart from the points made by others about how their absence enhances inequity."Tweet
Others joined in on the criticism, including MSNBC contributor and Commentary Associate Editor Noah Rothman, who referred to Schmidt’s comment as “ghastly.”Tweet
"Yes, this actually happened: an 'expert in ethics and health policy' said that the elderly — who are at far greater risk from #Covid and have fewer vaccine side effects — shouldn’t get the vaccine first," former New York Times reporter Alex Berenson tweeted. "Why? Because the elderly are more likely to be white. Good times."
Tweet
Schmidt took to Twitter to defend his contribution to the article, as well as posting that he "never espoused race-only prioritization."
"Note: 1) never espoused race-only prioritization,'" Schmidt tweeted. "2) Key: many 65+ can live socially distanced safely, w relatively less inconvenience until vax. But far more among essential workers can’t, esp frontline workers."
The professor added, "Vaccinating all healthy people 65+ before essential workers is likely to make racial and economic disparities worse. So must focus on vulnerability across, and within population groups—disadvantage index helps."
Tweet Tweet
Race and ethnicity have reportedly been at the forefront of discussions on how to distribute the coronavirus vaccine most effectively.
"If you look at the burden of disease and death in the U.S., it is disproportionately impacting communities of color," said Grace Lee, a member of the ACIP, told the Washington Examiner earlier this month. "It is heartbreaking to realize how much of the social and racial inequities that exist impact the health of these communities."
In California, a vaccine advisory committee is weighing whether or not to factor “historical injustice” into the vaccine distribution decision-making process.
The first coronavirus vaccine was distributed in the United States earlier this week to healthcare workers on the front lines fighting the pandemic. On Friday, Vice President Mike Pence received the vaccine live on television in an attempt to demonstrate the safety and ease of the process.
"Building confidence in the vaccine is what brings us here this morning," Pence told reporters.

Strzok said Steele dossier was meant to 'influence' and not just 'inform' in September 2016

Texto completo: Peter Strzok messaged an unknown FBI official in September 2016 that he thought Christopher Steele’s now-discredited dossier was meant to “influence” as well as to “inform” and indicated he believed the British ex-spy was the source for a story published the day of his text.
Despite this admission, Steele’s reporting went on to play a central role in justifying the bureau’s pursuit of secretive electronic surveillance against Trump campaign associate Carter Page, and the bureau would insist to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court that it didn’t believe the former MI6 agent was a source for the Yahoo story (which referred to Steele only as “a well-placed Western intelligence source”) — contradicting the now-fired special agent’s stated suspicions.
"Looking at the Yahoo article, I would definitely say at a minimum Steele’s reports should be viewed as intended to influence as well as to inform," Strzok's message said.
Steele was eventually removed as a confidential human source after the FBI concluded he was leaking information to the media. The Yahoo article, written by Michael Isikoff, contained a host of claims related to Page and two Russians — Igor Sechin and Igor Diveykin. The allegations in the article were nearly identical to those in Steele’s dossier. DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz's FISA abuse report noted the FBI did not determine that Page had met with either of the Russians mentioned in the article or the dossier and criticized the bureau for concealing Page’s repeated denials from the FISA court. Isikoff said of the dossier in 2019, “I think it’s fair to say that all of us should have approached this, in retrospect, with more skepticism, particularly when we didn’t know where it was coming from.”

Strzok’s memoir, Compromised, does not mention the Yahoo story controversy and claims that “later in the fall of 2016, media reports surfaced about Steele’s material having been provided to the FBI” and "we closed Steele as a result.”
But the FBI agent’s text was from the first day of the fall in 2016, and Strzok seemed to believe Steele was a source even then — suspicions acknowledged in private at the bureau, but not his book.
An FBI document from 2017 showed the bureau’s unsuccessful efforts to confirm the dossier’s claims of collusion between the Kremlin and President Trump. The heavily redacted, 94-page spreadsheet showed the FBI’s reliance on what it termed “open source” information and also listed the Yahoo article as corroboration at least twice.
Horowitz criticized the bureau’s handling of Steele and the Yahoo story at length last year. He included the Yahoo saga as among the 17 “significant errors and omissions” in the Page FISAs and noted that “none of these inaccuracies and omissions were brought to the attention of [the Office of Intelligence] before the last FISA application was filed in June 2017,” and so “these failures were repeated in all three renewal applications."
The DOJ watchdog said his investigation “found no evidence that anyone from the FBI asked Steele in September 2016 or at any other time, if he had spoken with the Yahoo News reporter.” The FBI’s FISA application stated in a footnote that the bureau “does not believe that Source #1 [Steele] directly provided” information to the press.
Horowitz found that Steele met with journalists from Yahoo, the New York Times, the Washington Post, the New Yorker, and CNN in Washington, D.C., in September 2016 and with Yahoo, the New York Times, and the Washington Post again the next month.
Horowitz said the “Supervisory Intel Analyst” said, “It was unclear to him in September 2016 whether Steele was briefing the press.” The “OGC Unit Chief” stated that “she and others assumed that Steele's clients, or others with whom the clients had shared the information, were responsible for the press stories, but that the Crossfire Hurricane team would not have been surprised if Steele's reporting was the basis.” And “Case Agent 1” sent messages indicating he thought Steele was the source and "was selling his stuff to others." The same agent “told us that the Crossfire Hurricane team later assessed” that Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson “or someone else who had the Steele information ... was responsible for furnishing the information” to the media, but Horowitz said that “the team had no factual basis to support this” claim.
“SSA 1” told Horowitz that "his first concern was that someone from inside the FBI had disclosed information to the media” and that it seemed “foreign” that Steele “would be involved in such a breach.” Yet SSA 1’s notes from a Sept. 30, 2016, meeting noted there were “control issues - reports acknowledged in Yahoo News.”
“Drafts of the Carter Page FISA application stated, until October 14, 2016, that Steele was responsible for the leak,” Horowitz wrote. “One of the drafts specifically stated that Steele ‘was acting on his/her own volition and has since been admonished by the FBI.’ In contrast, the final version of the first FISA application stated ... the FBI does not believe that Source #1 directly provided this information to the Press.”
The “OI Attorney” told Horowitz that “at some point during the drafting process, the FBI assured him that Steele had not spoken with Yahoo News" because Steele was “a professional.” But “no one at the FBI or the National Security Division was able to explain to us the source of the information that resulted in, or supported, either the draft language that existed until October 14 or the final language” and “even after receiving additional information about Steele's media contacts, the Crossfire Hurricane team did not change the language in any of the three renewal applications regarding the FBI's assessment of Steele's role in the September 23 article.”
Horowitz said FBI interviews with Steele's primary sub-source “raised significant questions about the reliability of the Steele election reporting” and cast doubt on some of its biggest claims, noting Steele’s main source’s account "was not consistent with and, in fact, contradicted the allegations of a well-developed conspiracy" in Steele’s dossier. Declassified footnotes now show the FBI was aware that Steele’s dossier might have been compromised by Russian disinformation.

Texto completo: The New York Times acknowledged that its 2018 award-winning podcast “Caliphate” did not meet the paper's editorial standards.

The podcast featured the claims made by Shehroze Chaudhry, who has since been charged with concocting a terrorist hoax, and the publication admitted on Friday that it had not done enough to ensure the accuracy of his claims following an investigation, which was launched after his arrest in September.
“When the New York Times does deep, big, ambitious journalism in any format, we put it to a tremendous amount of scrutiny at the upper levels of the newsroom,” Dean Baquet, the executive editor of the New York Times, said in a podcast interview. “We did not do that in this case. And I think that I or somebody else should have provided that same kind of scrutiny because it was a big, ambitious piece of journalism. And I did not provide that kind of scrutiny, nor did my top deputies with deep experience in examining investigative reporting.”
The 12-part audio documentary, which was done by Rukmini Callimachi, a New York Times correspondent who has frequently reported from conflict zones and has since been reassigned, referenced the claims made by Chaudhry, who was using the pseudonym Abu Huzayfah, such as the atrocities he said he witnessed in Syria and his involvement in execution-style killings, even though the podcast's team could not sufficiently corroborate the claims.
The New York Times review found that “Caliphate” gave too much credence to his false or exaggerated accounts.
In an editors’ note posted on Friday, the paper said its investigation “found a history of misrepresentations by Mr. Chaudhry and no corroboration that he committed the atrocities he described in the ‘Caliphate’ podcast. As a result, The Times has concluded that the episodes of ‘Caliphate’ that presented Mr. Chaudhry’s claims did not meet our standards for accuracy.”
“From the outset, ‘Caliphate’ should have had the regular participation of an editor experienced in the subject matter,” the note continued. “In addition, The Times should have pressed harder to verify Mr. Chaudhry’s claims before deciding to place so much emphasis on one individual’s account.”
Baquet recognized that the incident was an "institutional failing.”
“And in the end, good journalism comes from some sort of internal debate over whether or not the stuff that supports the story is more powerful than the stuff that refutes the story," he continued. "I think this is one of those cases where I think we just didn’t listen hard enough to the stuff that challenged the story and to the signs that maybe our story wasn’t as strong as we thought it was.”

Happy Blursday! Now quit doomscrolling, grab a quarantini and please keep social distancing.
Imagine explaining that sentence to yourself in December 2019.
This year has given us scores of new words, phrases, expressions and metaphors. Some are new to the popular vernacular, like quarantine pod, while others are just newly relevant after long histories as specialized terms, like contact tracing. Some are technical, like superspreader event and aerosol droplets; some are packed with cultural meaning, like systemic racism and panic shopping; and others still, like maskne and walktails, are just goofy little turns of phrase that let us find a drop of joy in this disastrous year.
“What’s fascinating about this year is that so many of these words have gone from being words that we had maybe heard of and we might have used very occasionally, but they’ve now gone to basically inform almost every single conversation,” said Fiona McPherson, a new words editor at the Oxford English Dictionary. In more than 20 years at her job, she said, “I can’t think of anything that has been similar.”
The sheer breadth of words that were popularized this year — everything from medical jargon to social-media-friendly shorthand — was particularly unusual, McPherson said. And for the first time since 2004, when Oxford Languages, the publisher of the OED, started choosing a Word of the Year, it declined to pick just one.
We couldn’t pick one, either. But here are some words and phrases we think capture what it felt like to be alive in this unprecedented year of our quar, 2020.
Black Lives Matter
Patrisse Cullors, co-founder and executive director of Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, shares her experience with the movement in 2020 .
“Every new year brings curiosity and excitement. There is often a collective commitment from people to shed the toxic habits we developed the year before while pushing to unlock the door of possibilities for the year to come. But not a single human being in the entire world would have predicted what came in 2020. The year where Black communities were ravaged by the twin pandemics: state violence and COVID-19. A year in which Black people and our allies rallied around the globe to reckon with 400 years of racial terror.
“These three words, Black Lives Matter, resurrected yet again to help remind the world that our fight for racial justice must happen through mass protests, electoral justice and the fight to defund and ultimately abolish the state of policing and imprisonment as we know it.
“2020 was not a year we all could have prepared for, but it was a year that pushed us to become stronger, demand more from our elected officials and fight for the lives of Black people like we have never done before.”
Blursday
The passage of time itself became seemingly unreliable this year, as some days felt like a week while some months flew by in an instant. This quickly became a go-to Twitter meme as the combination of a relentless news cycle mixed with the droll, repetitive reality of life in lockdown, giving existence in 2020 a “Groundhog Day”-esque quality.
Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York made this a recurring bit in his daily coronavirus briefings, and our friends at The Washington Post even started a newsletter called “What Day Is It?”
Circuit breaker
“Markets Spiral as Globe Shudders Over Virus.” So declared a blaring headline atop page A1 of The New York Times on March 10, the day following a drop in the stock market so steep that a so-called “circuit breaker” — an automatic halt in trading after a major decline — kicked in. It was the first since 1997, and over the next nine days it would happen three more times. Some $5 trillion in stock market wealth disappeared by March 10.
For wealthier Americans, the crisis was short-lived: The markets began to bounce back as early as May following the reopening of businesses across the country. That recovery steadily continued through the summer, and, after a few major drops in the fall, the markets hit all-time highs in November.
But that’s just half the story — or, more precisely, about 10% of it, which is the percentage of households that own more than 87% of all stock as of earlier this year.
For everyone else, the economic picture is much more grim: There are still some 10 million fewer jobs than there were in February; employers last month added far fewer jobs than would be needed for a speedy recovery; some jobs may just never come back; and officials have warned that the pandemic may make the already-crippling inequality in the U.S. even worse.
Contact Tracing
Whom did you see and when did you see them? That’s the essence of this term, long familiar to anyone in public health but new to the public consciousness. South Korea gained attention for its aggressive, and highly successful, contact tracing program, while the United States continues to shrug at the concept.
Doomscrolling
This is the catchall term for consuming bad news or information you know is detrimental to your mental health and wellness yet being unable to stop. “I think the doomscrolling thing validated a lot of people’s experiences,” said journalist Karen Ho, aka “Doomscrolling Reminder Lady,” who helped popularize the term with her nightly Twitter reminders to put the phone away and get to sleep. “It’s easy to feel like, ‘Am I overreacting to everything going on?’” she said. “At night people would scroll and be like, ‘Oh, things are really bad, and if they’re not bad for me they’re bad for other people’ and feel really helpless.”
Essential Workers
By early April, much of the country was under stay-at-home orders, marooned inside and safely out of the virus’s reach ... unless, of course, you happened to work at a grocery store, a gas station, an airport, a hotel, a food processing plant, a restaurant, a convenience store, the Post Office, a child-care center, a farm, a funeral home, a bike repair shop, an auto body shop, for a delivery app or for any of the dozens of other types of businesses that were given permission to remain open during lockdowns.
“We are not essential; we are sacrificial,” Sujatha Gidla, a train conductor with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in New York, wrote in an essay in May.
Flatten the Curve
It was back to middle-school math: To prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients, the country needed to reduce the number of virus cases and stop the exponential increase in infections.
After nationwide lockdowns, we were generally successful at flattening the curve of the first surge: Confirmed cases peaked at around 33,000 in one day in mid-April and slowly declined until mid-June. Then the summer surge hit, causing that previously flat line to shoot upward for a month until reaching a second, higher peak in mid-July of about 75,000 cases in a day. After a seasonal low of about 25,000 cases on one day in early September, cases have been on the rise ever since, reaching a recent high of about 230,000 in one day earlier this month.
Front-Line Workers
Danielle Ofri is a primary care doctor at Bellevue Hospital in New York and the author of “ When We Do Harm: A Doctor Confronts Medical Error .” Ofri gave me my COVID-19 test when I became the first New York Times employee to test positive , and I turned out to be her first positive case. I’ve invited her to share her experience.
“New York City’s COVID-19 surge in the spring made our hospital feel like a jigsaw puzzle whose pieces were frantically re-scrambled each day to accommodate yet another set of unprecedented circumstances. On the other hand, it also felt oddly ordinary: In health care, you go to work every day, and your mandate is whatever your patients bring that day. Which is why the ‘hero’ appellation felt so awkward to most of us. Nurses, doctors, technicians, aides and housekeepers surely have put in heroic hours during the pandemic, placing themselves and their families at risk. But we do it every day as patients grapple with the vulnerability that illness engenders. We do it every day when they need to unload their worries and their grief.
“Health care is always front-line work. While COVID-19 was indeed unprecedented, the dominant sense was more of a utilitarian, “Well, this is what the cards have dealt today; let’s get to it.” Don’t get me wrong — the 7 p.m. cheer was the highlight of our days, both listening and participating. It was inspiring to witness our colleagues in action, to be part of this monumental effort. It was equally inspiring to feel the public’s appreciation. But even after COVID-19 is tamed by the forthcoming vaccines, health care workers will still be front-line workers. Because you never know what will show up tomorrow.”
Hydroxychloroquine
As early as March, President Donald Trump was promoting the malaria drug, saying it could be “one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine.” By May, he said he was taking it as a preventive measure against the coronavirus. Its sudden prominence showed not only his power to turn conversations to any topic he desires but also the world’s desperate search for anything to help in the fight against the virus. As for the drug itself: The FDA issued, then revoked, emergency use authorization for its use in treating COVID-19, and an analysis from the National Institutes of Health published last month said “researchers concluded that the medication hydroxychloroquine provides no benefit to adults hospitalized with COVID-19.”
Mail-In Ballot
A safe, secure and convenient way to vote, or the primary source of voter fraud in this year’s presidential election. In 2020, you got to decide!
Pod
As Americans decided “no thanks” to a genuine, strict and enforced quarantine, we settled for limiting in-person socializing to only a small group of friends and family. Deciding who’s in and who’s out, and trusting those in your pod, wasn’t without drama, but as one health policy researcher told The Times in June: “The ideal thing is that we just stay home forever and never see anybody — but that’s just not sustainable.”
PPE
Severe shortages of personal protective equipment for health care workers dominated headlines in the first few months of the pandemic, and now things aren’t much better: The Strategic National Stockpile is nearly 185 million N95 masks short of where it hoped to be by winter.
Masks became yet another symbol in the American culture war: Trump refused to wear one in public until July, even mocking President-elect Joe Biden for doing so during the first presidential debate. Even now, some Republican leaders at the state level are still declining to make masks mandatory.
Remote Learning
Farah Miller, an editor who covers parenting for The Times, shares her family’s experience with remote learning this year.
“Or are they even remotely learning? That was the question I, along with parents across the United States, found myself asking in the spring. Schools shuttered without a plan for how to teach homebound kids. My preschooler was given five worksheets and a list of activities she couldn’t possibly do on her own (“Go for a nature walk and draw what you see!”). Her sister, then in fourth grade, had to watch a litany of instructional videos each day. By noon, the big kid was bleary-eyed; the little one was feral. I was able to get some work done only because my husband was furloughed and became the primary parent.
“We finished the school year from home and thought they’d go back in the fall. By September, there were seemingly impossible decisions to make though: Will you do hybrid ? Join a pod ? My family didn’t end up having a choice. Our schools didn’t open. My younger daughter started kindergarten from our dining room.
“It is better than it was. Sometimes the house feels alive. I can hear 5-year-old voices on the first floor and fifth graders laughing on the second. All of it is a window into their lives I never would have had. We really are the lucky ones.
“But there is always a kid calling for me. They drag their laptops around, to the couch or bed or just sit on the stairs, trying to get comfortable in a situation they are not made for. The corners of every room have been overrun by academic detritus. Screen time is all the time. These kids may be learning now, but they are so far from where they are meant to be.”
Social Distancing
The pandemic forced us to re-evaluate our relationship with physical space and the way in which we occupy it. As experts learned more about the spread of the virus, “6 feet” became the golden number: The distance we should stay away from others to prevent the spread of COVID-19, yes, but also a shorthand for how to navigate socialization in the new world.
Superspreader
The first time most of us became aware of the term was this spring, when one person who attended a March choir practice in Washington state spread the virus to 52 others. According to Google Trends data, search interest in the term has stayed low for most of the year — that is, until the beginning of October. Interest spiked after the infamous Rose Garden “superspreader” event at the White House, which is thought to have accelerated the spread of the virus among Trump’s inner circle and beyond.
Unprecedented
In early weeks genuinely descriptive, this quickly became an unavoidable, hollow buzzword co-opted by advertisements and TV commercials starting in mid-April.
The word’s popularity waned, but it rose to prominence yet again as Trump and his Republican allies launched a campaign to overturn the results of the election.
Even Oxford Languages subtly tipped its hand when it titled its report on the language that defined the year, “2020: Words of an Unprecedented Year.”
Virtual happy hour
The early weeks of lockdown, like the virus itself, were novel. As people searched for new ways to stay entertained and hold onto some semblance of normalcy from home, the question of how to socialize was paramount. And so virtual happy hours became the event du jour . The wine — and quarantinis — flowed as heavily as the Zoom event invites, and we all ... well, we just got kind of drunk in front of our computers a whole bunch.
Voter Fraud
It doesn’t exist on any appreciable scale, but widespread fraudulent voting, the president and his allies have continued to insist, cost him the election.
That the claim is pure fantasy is almost beside the point: The president’s disinformation campaign around the results of the election is the culmination of a yearslong effort to sow doubt about the democratic process itself. If the voting system is corrupt, any loss Trump may suffer is simply the result of a rigged election, the thinking goes. This false narrative has become so deeply embedded in the minds of Trump’s supporters that surveys have found that 70% to 80% of Republicans doubt the legitimacy of Biden’s victory.
Wildfires
While the coronavirus raged across the world, the West Coast burned. 2020 was the worst year for wildfires in recorded California history, as some 4.3 million acres went up in flames. In Oregon, more than 1 million acres burned. And in Washington, the devastation reached more than 700,000 acres. More than 40 people died in the fires. The economic toll in California is thought to be at least $10 billion. And, as The Times wrote in the midst of last year’s wildfire season, this level of destruction is probably just a normal we’ll have to learn to live with.
Zoom
Up until around March, Zoom was enterprise software meant to help businesses communicate. Then the home became the office for millions of Americans, and our social lives moved entirely online. Almost overnight Zoom emerged as the go-to platform for private citizens, religious services and universities. “We Live in Zoom Now,” The Times declared. The term became synonymous with videoconferencing.
But privacy concerns arose, and Zoombombing became a thing as malicious trolls hijacked meetings. The company rushed to address the issues, and its CEO conceded that the company wasn’t prepared for the sudden crush of use.
Still, Zoom ends 2020 as one of a handful of pandemic “winners”: Its stock price skyrocketed nearly 500% from January to December, and Yahoo Finance named it the 2020 Company of the Year.

Buried Under Snow in a Car for 10 Hours. Who Would Come to the Rescue?

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
It was around midnight Thursday, and the snow in upstate Owego, New York, was falling at what officials estimated was a rate of 4 inches an hour. By the time it stopped, there would be 40 inches on the ground.
With the storm swirling around him, Kevin Kresen was in his car about 15 miles from home when, he said, a belt in his engine came loose, knocking out the power steering and forcing him off the road into a ditch.
After trying unsuccessfully to fix the problem, he got back into the car and called 911. It was the first several of such calls he would make over the next 10 hours as the fierce snowfall trapped him in the unheated car and a passing plow sealed him in even further, officials said.
Kresen was finally rescued by Jason Cawley, a State Police zone sergeant, who started his own day by getting stuck in the snow left by a nor’easter so severe it prompted Gov. Andrew Cuomo to declare a state of emergency across a wide swath of New York.
Cawley said he believed that if he had not found Kresen when he did, it might have been another five hours before the next plow came through and cleared some of the snow off the car, making it visible. By then, he said, Kresen would probably have been dead.
“I don’t think he would have made it another hour and a half,” the sergeant said.
In addition to Kresen’s car being entombed in snow, law enforcement officers responding to his calls for help had been stymied in their efforts to find him because he was in an area with spotty cellphone service. The car’s location could only be narrowed to a 3-mile stretch of state highway, officials said.
Cawley said that when he started his shift around 8 a.m., he had checked with the Tioga County emergency call center to see where his help was needed. He was told that Kresen had not yet been found.
The sergeant began his search by driving back and forth along the 3 miles where the missing car was believed to be. He estimated that he had done that 10 times before stopping.
“I realized at some point that his car was invisible,” Cawley, a 22-year State Police veteran, said. “It was here. I just couldn’t see it.”
He said he decided on a new tack: He drove to one end of the stretch he had been searching, got out of his vehicle and climbed up one side of the snowbank and down the other, looking for a sign of the missing car. He repeated the exercise every 100 yards, he said.
After a time, he said, he learned from the 911 center that a call had just come in from Kresen’s phone but had almost immediately been cut short. The call center was, however, able to provide an address where the call appeared to have come from, and Cawley said he used the computer in his car to confirm it.
Arriving at the spot and getting out of his car, he said, he noticed a section of snowbank that was about 6 inches taller than the rest. Thinking it was a row of mailboxes, he began to dig away at the snow in hopes of determining that he had the right address. That, he said, was when he hit the car window.
“My heart nearly jumped,” he said.
As for Kresen’s reaction, the sergeant said, “He was excited as he could be.”
Kresen told Cawley through the window that he could not feel his feet. A passerby helped dig away enough snow to get Kresen out of the car. Cawley took him to a local ambulance corps; from there Kresen was taken to Ascension Lourdes Hospital in Binghamton, where he was treated for frostbite and hypothermia and released.
The spot where Kresen was trapped was not far from a house where he could have presumably sought help, but Cawley said he might not have realized that because the house was white and did not stand out in the heavy snow.
And in any case, the sergeant said, “He said he felt safer in the car.”
Safe as he may have been, Kresen was clearly in distress when he was rescued.
“When we pulled him out of the car, he wasn’t shivering, and I took that as a good sign,” Cawley said. But he soon realized it was actually a bad sign and an indication of how far Kresen’s body temperature had fallen.
Reached on Friday, Kresen, 58, who lives in Candor, New York, said he was “feeling pretty good” after his ordeal.
He said he had been “nervous” but not scared as the hours passed with no help in sight. He played CDs until the car’s battery died and used the two phones he had only to call 911 so he could save power. Otherwise, he said, he just tried to stay awake.
“I’m not afraid of death,” he said. “If it’s my time to go, it’s my time to go, whether it’s hypothermia or whatever.”
Still, he said he was “ecstatic” at the arrival of Cawley, whose efforts he called “heroic.”
“Oh my God, I was happy,” he said.

Texto completo: In the past week, the first batch of COVID-19 vaccines, nearly three million doses made by Pfizer and BioNTech, were delivered to more than 600 hospitals and clinics across the U.S. Things went smoothly in most states thanks to diligent planning on both federal and local levels. However, as the government schedules bigger shipments for the weeks to come on shorter notices, issues begin to surface.
According to The New York Times , at least a dozen states were told that next week’s shipment of Pfizer vaccine will have much fewer doses than what they initially anticipated.
In Oregon, for example, state health officials said they were told to expect 25,350 doses next week, significantly less than the 40,950 doses the state received in the first shipment. Iowa’s public health department was given a similar notice, saying that next week’s shipment will likely be 30 percent smaller than the first one.
California, the largest state by population, will face even a bigger reduction. Governor Gavin Newsom said Thursday that his state was told to expect a 40 percent smaller shipment next week. The state had originally anticipated 393,000 doses next week based on communication with the federal government. But now, the state will only receive 233,000 doses, Newsom’s office said.
These cutbacks appear to be a result of a scheduling hiccup at the federal level. On Wednesday, officials with Operation Warp Speed, the White House’s task force leading the vaccine’s distribution, said they had allocated only two million doses for next week’s shipment, a third less than the 2.9 million doses this week.
Other states to be affected by this adjustment include Washington, Missouri, Michigan, Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Montana, Kansas, Nebraska, New Hampshire and Indiana.
On the supply side, Pfizer said manufacturing is not what’s holding things back. In a statement on Wednesday, the drugmaker said the company “is not having any production issues” and actually has millions of doses sitting in a warehouse awaiting shipment instructions.
A senior administration official told The New York Times that doses that were not included in next week’s allocation will be included in the shipment the following week.
The government is also expecting about six million vaccine doses made by Moderna as soon as this weekend, once it cleared FDA’s emergency use authorization (EUA).
Moderna reported a minor production hiccup this week. An Operation Warp Speed official said Thursday that Moderna had to discard 400,000 doses of the vaccine after a filtration issue compromised the product during the final stages of manufacturing.
The drugmaker didn’t disclose details of the filtration issue, but said it remains on track to meet its production goals for December as well as the first quarter of 2021.
Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine won a critical vote by a vaccine panel within the FDA on Thursday. An official EUA could be announced as soon as Friday, meaning the first shipment could start this weekend.
The Boston biotech startup plans to ship six million doses in the initial batch and a total of 20 million doses before the end of 2020.

Were platypuses just the beginning?
In October, researchers reported that the already perplexing animals fluoresce a psychedelic blue-green color under black light. The species joined a short list of mammals known to do this, including opossums and flying squirrels.
Since the study came out, others have begun their own investigations, mostly in Australian mammals. Although results are preliminary, the findings suggest we may have to book a larger venue for the mammal rave.
When he heard about the platypus discovery, Kenny Travouillon, curator of mammals at the Western Australian Museum, borrowed a black light lamp from the arachnology department. (They normally use the lamps to find scorpions, which also fluoresce.)
After confirming that their preserved platypuses glowed, he and his colleagues moved on to the rest of the collection. “We just went around for a bit of fun,” he said. “Putting the torch on all of them and let’s have a look.”
This was only a first pass. Fluorescence occurs when pigments in certain materials absorb ultraviolet rays, which are usually invisible to people, and re-emit them as colors that we can see. Black light lamps and flashlights soak these pigments with UV rays and cause them to glow — but they often emit visible light as well, which can muddy the waters. More rigorous studies involve filtering out this visible light, and measuring the fluorescence’s true strength and color.
But what they saw was encouraging. Bilbies — endangered marsupials with long snouts and rabbit-like ears — had orange and green accents. The quills of hedgehogs, porcupines and echidnas shone bright white, as if dipped in correction fluid.
Some specimens were more reserved: Of two wombat species they examined, only one fluoresced, and “kangaroos didn’t seem to do very much at all,” Travouillon said. The museum plans to team up with a nearby university to do a more systematic study, with better equipment, early next year.
Live animals are also being tested.
When a co-worker told Jake Schoen, a conservation technician at the Toledo Zoo the platypus news, “we got pretty excited about it,” he said. He had already modified a camera to photograph fluorescence for another project. After checking out the zoo museum’s own preserved platypus specimen, Schoen next turned his lens on the Tasmanian devils, Spiderman and Bubbles.
“The tricky part was having them sit still for a fraction of a second,” he said. Eventually, Bubbles cooperated. When the UV flash went off, voilá: A cool blue glow emerged around her eyes, at the bases of her whiskers, and inside the cups of her ears.
“Presumably all of its skin is fluorescent,” Schoen said. The portrait he captured looks a bit like a velvet painting. Preserved Tasmanian devils at the Western Australian Museum glowed in a similar way, Travouillon said.
What do the scientists who found that platypuses glow think? “These observations are exciting,” said Erik Olson, an associate professor of natural resources at Northland College in Ashland, Wisconsin, and one of the authors of the platypus paper. “I encourage folks to document such observations of biofluorescence within the scientific literature so that others can build upon their work.”
Others say it’s easy to read too much into these findings.
While looking at photos of animals with Day-Glo fur or skin gives the impression that perhaps they appear this way to one another, that’s very unlikely, said Michael Bok, a visual systems biologist at Lund University in Sweden who was not involved in any of this research. “It would be incredibly surprising,” he said, if these animals “could make out these fluorescent patterns in any sort of natural lighting environment.” He compares it to human fingernails and teeth — biological materials that also fluoresce, to little fanfare or avail.
In a 2017 paper, two biologists reviewed hundreds of known examples of fluorescing birds, plants, crustaceans and other organisms, and found only a few cases where these patterns might play a role in camouflage, mate attraction or other behaviors.
Schoen and others at the Toledo Zoo hope to work with contacts at the Save the Tasmanian Devil Program to potentially “tease out whether or not this is actually an ecologically adaptive trait,” he said.
In the meantime, he is heartened that his photo has increased public interest in Tasmanian devils. Some people have written online that they “didn’t even know that it was a real animal,” he said.
Its fluorescence “may just be a coincidence,” he said. “But it’s certainly a lot of fun.”

Protestant Church That Found Refuge in Italy’s Hills Helps Syrians Do the Same

TORRE PELLICE, Italy — The story of Maha Dahine and her two sons, Hanna and Antoine Khoury, is similar to those of countless victims of the conflict in Syria. Driven by fear and hopelessness, they left their homeland in 2016 for an uncertain future in Europe.
But while many thousands of migrants have risked their lives by crossing the Mediterranean in rickety vessels, Dahine and her sons had a vastly different experience.
In November 2018, the family boarded a plane in Lebanon, where they had lived for two years after fleeing Syria, and flew to Rome, before traveling on to the Alpine valleys of Western Piedmont to start a new life.
They were able to make the trip thanks in part to the efforts of the Waldensians, a religious movement that first settled in Piedmont in the 12th century to escape persecution in France.
Fired by those memories, the Waldensians have been at the forefront of an Italian initiative called Humanitarian Corridors, which also includes the Federation of Evangelical Churches in Italy and the Community of St. Egidio, a Catholic charity based in Rome, that has helped some 2,000 refugees from Syria arrive in the country since 2016.
Waldensians are “very sensitive to the theme of the refugee,” said Erika Tomassone, a church official, mindful of ancestors who were shunted from country to country for centuries.
“Historically, we used to be the immigrants,” said Gianluca Barbanotti, the executive secretary of the Waldensian Diaconate, which coordinates the church’s charitable activities.
The Waldensian church is the largest Protestant denomination in a country that is overwhelmingly Catholic. Today, there are about 20,000 Waldensians scattered throughout Italy. But the majority still live in three Piedmont valleys: the Val Chisone, Valle Germanasca, and Val Pellice.
The town of Torre Pellice includes a neighborhood known as the “Waldensian Quarter,” its design taken from the terraced houses of 19th-century England, with a temple influenced by Anglican churches, a nod to the British Protestants who came to the aid of the Waldensians nearly two centuries ago.
Waldensian communities throughout Italy have been deeply involved in Humanitarian Corridors, tapping into their long experience working with migrants.
Humanitarian Corridors is tailored to assist especially vulnerable refugees — often people with significant health issues — who are identified through a lengthy screening process in places like Lebanon. Even though the numbers are small, the Waldensians say their program is now being emulated in France, Belgium and Andorra.
The initiative is “a winning model for a Europe that wants to be worthy of the principles of solidarity and respect of human rights on which it was founded,” said Alessandra Trotta, who leads a seven-member panel that oversees the “Union of the Methodist and Waldensian Churches,” as the church is officially known.
The Waldensians are named after a 12th-century merchant from Lyon named Valdo who shunned his wealth and began preaching on the streets, prompting Pope Lucius III to excommunicate him and his followers, and declare them heretics.
A large number of Waldensians sought shelter in the valleys of the Cottian Alps, straddling Italy and France, which became a base of sorts through centuries of periodic persecution.
“The 17th was an especially difficult century,” said Davide Rosso, the director of the Waldensian Cultural Center Foundation, referring to a plague in 1630 and a 1655 campaign by the Duke of Savoy to suppress the Waldensians — the inspiration for a sonnet by English poet John Milton — that was ended by the intervention of Oliver Cromwell.
It was only in 1848 that King Charles Albert of Savoy, who ruled over the region where the Waldensians settled, granted them civil and political rights shortly before conceding the same rights to Italy’s Jews.
The church is known in Italy for its liberal practices. It consecrated its first female cleric in 1967, and was the first Protestant church in Italy to bless same-sex civil partnerships in a church service. The Catholic church does not allow either. Trotta said their fight to have their rights recognized has inspired their drive to ensure fundamental rights for everyone.
“We’re the strange Christians who don’t want the crucifix in public places,” including public schools, said Trotta.
Trotta was present at a 2015 ceremony in Turin when Pope Francis asked forgiveness for the Catholic Church’s past persecutions of the Waldensians.
“I was asked to give the final benediction — everyone now says: ‘You’ve blessed the pope,’” she said, laughing.
Much of the church’s funding comes from Italian taxpayers, who must devolve a percentage of their taxes to a charitable or social initiative. Last year, some 560,000 Italian taxpayers chose to fund the Waldensians, which netted around 42 million euros, or $51 million. “We are aware of the responsibility this gives us,” said Trotta.
This funding is what pays for the Humanitarian Corridors.
Trotta said the corridors were a “winning model,” that showed “something can be done” as an alternative to the unregulated and illegal immigration that hard-right political parties have seized on as a target.
“The more you keep doors closed, the more you facilitate irregular routes that bring with them social instability. It’s a vicious cycle that can be broken,” she said.
After the screening process at their point of departure, the refugees are given orientation courses, so they know what to expect when they arrive in the city that is deemed to be best suited to their particular needs.
Dahine, 60, and her sons Hanna, 28, and Antoine, 26, ended up in Pinerolo, a town of 36,000 southwest of Turin, in Piedmont.
Once the refugees arrive in Italy, they are provided with housing, a stipend for food, language training, psychological support and legal assistance, while local volunteers and church members help with immediate challenges, like dealing with bureaucracy, enrolling children in schools and job counseling. The level of assistance starts tapering off after six months, depending on the situation, which is often made more difficult by health issues.
“Helping the refugees achieve autonomy encourages inclusion. With a few exceptions it’s worked very well,” said Giovanni Comba, the president of the Waldensian Diaconate.
After two years, both Hanna and Antoine speak good Italian, their mother less so. Hanna is studying international development at the University of Turin, while Antoine had a paid internship in web development.
“If I feel as though I am improving my life, that I’m learning something new and building a career, and if my family is well, that’s enough for me,” Antoine said during an interview in the kitchen of their apartment.
Trotta said the church made it a “point of honor” not to proselytize to newly arrived migrants.
But there have been a number of Protestants among the hundreds of thousands of other migrants that have arrived in Italy in the past three decades — from Africa, the Philippines, South Korea and South America — and some have joined in the Waldensian church, profoundly changing the “numbers and composition of many of our communities,” she said.
“We seized on the challenge to try to be a united community while maintaining our differences,” said Dorothee Mack, the pastor of the Methodist church in Milan, who led a bilingual English-Italian Zoom service on a recent Advent Sunday. Her worshippers come from 15 countries.
“Some of the Waldensian and Methodist churches were becoming smaller so this arrival of new brothers and sisters has been experienced as fresh lifeblood, and something that makes our community life livelier,” she said.

Tens of thousands of prison inmates in Massachusetts will be among the first to be offered coronavirus vaccines, before home health aides, seniors and medically vulnerable residents of the state.
The inmates, along with people who live in homeless shelters and other congregate settings, will be vaccinated by the end of February, after health care workers, emergency medical workers and residents of long-term care facilities receive the shots.
The state’s high prioritization of inmates is unusual. A dozen states have listed prisoners among those set to receive vaccines in the first round of inoculations, but none ranks inmates so highly. Federal health officials have recommended that corrections officers and staff at state facilities receive high priority but have said nothing about inmates. The federal prison system has said it will vaccinate officers and staff first. “This is all because there is limited supply,” said Jennifer Kates, senior vice president and director of global health and HIV policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation. “Tough decisions have to be made.”
Some of the largest coronavirus outbreaks in the country have taken place in the nation’s prisons. At least 400,000 cases have been reported among inmates, and at least 1,800 deaths have been reported among inmates and staff, according to a database maintained by The New York Times.
There are more than 2 million incarcerated people in the United States. An estimated 20% have been infected with the coronavirus. Inmates are four times more likely to be infected than the general population and twice as likely to die of COVID-19.
While the stereotype of prisoners is that they are young, more than 1 in 10 nationwide is older than 55 and therefore more vulnerable to the virus, according to Lauren Brinkley-Rubinstein, co-founder of the COVID Prison Project, which tracks cases among incarcerated people nationwide.
Inmates also have higher rates of chronic medical conditions, like diabetes and hypertension, that increase the risk of severe disease if they become infected. Many suffer from mental illness.
Prison infections can lead to outbreaks in the community. One in seven infections in Chicago, for example, was linked to people going in and out of the Cook County Jail, according to a recent study in the journal Health Affairs. The jail is “one of the largest known nodes of SARS-CoV-2 spread in the United States,” the researchers said.
Yet there has been no comprehensive plan to roll out the vaccine for inmates. Even in those states prioritizing prisoners for early vaccination, details are often vague. Some states have simply decided that when older adults and medically vulnerable residents are vaccinated, inmates in those categories will be included — but not other prisoners.
The decision in Massachusetts to prioritize prisoners was driven by a commitment to equitable access amid a pandemic that has taken a disproportionate toll on people of color, who are also overrepresented behind bars, said Dr. Simone Wildes, an infectious disease specialist and a member of the state’s COVID-19 vaccine advisory group.
“We used equity as a core principle in our recommendations,” Wildes said. “We have had a lot of cases of COVID in the prisons, and we wanted to make sure those at highest risk were getting the vaccine first.”
Black and Hispanic people account for just over half of the prison and jail populations in Massachusetts, although they represent fewer than 20% of the state’s population, according to the Prison Policy Initiative, an advocacy organization.
Allocating scarce medical resources to people in prison can be controversial, and the Massachusetts advisory committee had some “very robust discussions,” Wildes said. But criticism so far has been muted.
“Those at greatest need — we have to take care of them,” Wildes said. “You can’t socially distance in prison.”
Nearly 4,000 infections have already been reported among inmates and corrections officers in Massachusetts, and the number of incarcerated people testing positive has been steadily increasing since November.
In recent weeks, an outbreak at the Massachusetts Correctional Institution in Concord infected 47 employees and 161 inmates, about one-quarter of the prison’s population. Outbreaks of similar size occurred among inmates at MCI-Norfolk and MCI-Shirley in November, and several county jails have also reported large outbreaks recently.
At least three inmates died of COVID-19 in December alone, but many deaths may go unreported. For example, Milton Rice, 76, was granted medical parole from the Norfolk prison but died of COVID-19 at a nearby hospital one day later, on Nov. 25, according to his lawyers.
While advocates have applauded the state’s decision to allocate vaccines to inmates, they said they hoped it would not detract from the need to take other urgent steps, including early releases to reduce crowding and increased testing to identify cases.
Many institutions are testing only inmates who display obvious symptoms of coronavirus infection. But since solitary confinement and lockdowns are used to contain the virus, many inmates are reluctant to report symptoms, said Monik Jimenez, a public health researcher at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health who is studying prison conditions.
“It’s kind of like the wild, Wild West of testing — they pick and choose what they do,” she said. “When you don’t have comprehensive testing, you know you’re only seeing the tip of the iceberg.”
Carol Rose, executive director of the ACLU of Massachusetts, said, “Prisons and jails are just petri dishes for the coronavirus. We need to reduce incarceration levels and release people who aren’t a danger to society so more people are alive to receive the vaccine when it becomes available.”
But in Massachusetts, as in other parts of the country, efforts to reduce the number of people behind bars — largely by releasing people held in pretrial detention — have slowed. And the numbers have crept back up: As of Dec. 7, there were 4,306 inmates being held in pretrial detention in Massachusetts, exceeding the 4,194 who were being held in early April.
Although the state has a process for granting medical parole, many inmates who have chronic illnesses that would put them at risk for severe COVID-19 don’t qualify.
“You have to be terminally ill, within 18 months of dying, or permanently incapacitated,” said Elizabeth Matos, executive director of Prisoners’ Legal Services of Massachusetts, an organization that defends prisoners’ rights and advocates the least restrictive imprisonment.
The organization is representing a 78-year-old inmate who was denied medical parole this past spring, even though he has heart disease and chronic lung disease and is dependent on supplemental oxygen.
There is no guarantee that offering the vaccine to prisoners will end the epidemic behind walls, several experts noted.
Simply getting the doses to prisoners will be difficult. Prisons don’t have the ultracold refrigerators required to store the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and are often located in remote areas. And tracking patients to ensure they receive both doses will also be challenging; inmates cycle in and out of jails, and prisoners are frequently transferred.
Distrust of the medical system is rampant, and doctors who work in the state’s prisons anticipate deep skepticism about the vaccine among both inmates and correctional officers.
“I’m expecting a lot of resistance,” said Dr. Alysse Wurcel, an infectious disease specialist at Tufts Medical Center in Boston.
“There’s just a lot of distrust,” added Wurcel, who is also a COVID-19 consultant to the Massachusetts Sheriffs’ Association. “If you don’t trust the medical care you’re getting in the facility, how are you going to trust the needle in your arm?”
Leslie Credle, 54, who spent four years in prison and now runs Justice for Housing, a group that fights discrimination against former inmates, says some who are still incarcerated have told her they don’t trust the state Department of Corrections to administer the doses.
“‘They’ll take it home to their wives, and we’ll get water’ — that’s what one person told me,” Credle said. “If I were still in there, I wouldn’t take it myself.”
She fears vaccinations will put an end to efforts to depopulate the state’s prisons and jails.
“They keep going back and forth, saying they’re going to release, and then they don’t,” Credle said. “Now the vaccine has come out, they’re not going to release people.”

The last time Saturn and Jupiter, the largest planets in our solar system, orbited as closely as they will Monday and were visible in the sky, the year was 1226.
Almost 800 years later, these titanic orbs will once again appear in the heavens just one-tenth of a degree apart — about the thickness of a dime held at arm’s length, according to NASA.
Astrophiles of all stripes are excited, to say the least. Astronomers and other sky watchers could witness a once-in-a-lifetime event. Astrologers are heralding it as a time of rebirth. (The conjunction falls on the winter solstice.) And holiday aficionados are calling this bright conjunction, happening so close to Christmas Day, the “Christmas star.”
Basically, it’s going to be cool. Or as Renu Malhotra, a professor of planetary sciences at the University of Arizona, put it to The New York Times: “It’s a very romantic event to see these planets approaching each other.”
In medieval times, presumably, very few earthlings witnessing what might have looked like a near collision of celestial entities would have understood what was happening, in a technical sense. But it is almost guaranteed people were fascinated by it then too, said Jo Marchant, a science journalist and author of “The Human Cosmos: Civilization and the Stars.”
“Humans have had a really intimate relationship with the cosmos ever since the dawn of our species,” Marchant said. “We forget now living in polluted cities, but it would have been the most fantastic thing in the night sky.”
And while, today, humans have telescopes, satellite systems and all manner of stargazing apps to keep them up-to-date on space and the visible solar system, we have not lost our intrinsic curiosity about the night sky, Marchant said.
“That feeling that we belong in the cosmos, that we belong in the universe and that we can find personal meaning with what is happening in the sky,” she said. “I think that's something that we still have now.”
Some form of conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn happens about every 20 years. But “this one is particularly neat because they are getting very close in the sky,” said Henry Throop, an astronomer at NASA who has been watching the impending planetary convergence from his yard. (The planets inch closer every day.)
“They are not physically touching in space,” he said, adding, for those who need to be reassured that 2020 will not deliver another crushing blow: “Jupiter won’t crash into Saturn.”
Chani Nicholas, an astrologer who lives in Los Angeles, sees the moment more mystically. “This is the end of an era and the beginning of a new one,” she said.
“The winter solstice is a really great time to set an intention because symbolically you’re setting intention with the sun returning,” she said. “With the conjunction there is a sense of gravity that comes with that moment.”
Of Jupiter and Saturn, Nicholas said: “To have these two be so beautifully placed to be so bright and enchanting in the night sky feels very cosmically poetic.” She added: “After this year of restriction and confinement and devastation, there is this feeling of there is some kind of renewal.”
Now, astrology, as we’ve mentioned, is in no way scientific. But who isn’t in the mood to manifest some positive changes?
At the very least, “this is a great chance to go outside and see the sky,” Throop said.
“Go any place where you can see the sunset and a half-hour after it you will see Jupiter and Saturn 30 degrees up in the sky,” he said. “Jupiter will be brighter than Saturn because it’s closer to us.”
The planetary tryst will end almost as soon as it begins. Jupiter and Saturn will have more distance between them on Tuesday.
Then, we’ll have to wait until the next great conjunction of this caliber, in 2080. So, go on and gape at the night sky like our ancestors did (albeit with a little more social distancing for safety).
