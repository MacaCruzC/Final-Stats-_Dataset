Texto completo: When our congregation, Church of the Savior, moved to online services some nine months ago, our family tried to keep things normal. We had the children dress in nice Sunday clothes, though we would be watching via screen instead of entering a sanctuary. We arranged the chairs in the living room to look like pews. We tried follow along, bowing at the right times and crossing ourselves at the right moment.
Anyone who has ever attended a religious service (or any event) with children knows it is a constant struggle to get them to sit still, pay attention and not distract those around them. Every Sunday in the pew is a battle of wills. But if in-person services were a skirmish, online church is war.
My family is a group of outliers. Just 33 percent of Americans attend religious services weekly. As for the rest of the country, about one-third make their way to a place of worship somewhere between a couple of times a month and a few visits annually. The final third attend rarely, if at all. But no matter where one falls on that spectrum, the pandemic has changed the way we experience religion.
After that first Zoom church week, our family abandoned the church clothes and makeshift pews. Everyone’s attention lagged.
Maybe it was screen fatigue. My children have Zoom school. As a professor, I have Zoom teaching. With my wife deployed, we have a Zoom marriage and, now, Zoom church. Something had to give.
In July, researchers at Barna, a group dedicated to studying faith and culture, found church attendance in America had dropped significantly during the pandemic. I’m not surprised. I, too, have gone through periods where I couldn’t stomach a Zoom service. Instead, we open our Book of Common Prayer and worship as a family.
And yet this is what we’ve got — lest we simply shut down these services until the church can gather without restriction.
It is true that Zoom religious services are fundamentally inadequate. This is not a criticism of the clergy and lay leaders who have put in tremendous creative effort. In a sense it is an indictment of the very idea of what we look for in church, and a chance to realign our perspective. That is because even in-person services are, in a sense, inadequate. Everyone who has come to follow a religion knows of that initial season of zeal. People are excited and energetic about their newfound faith; the services seem transcendent. But that feeling often fades and becomes something else.
If bodies and physical spaces are really means by which we attempt to encounter God on earth, something immeasurable is lost when worship goes virtual. This loss becomes all the more acute during the holiday season, a time when churches are usually filled with candles, flowers and flowing vestments. Instead, the choir stalls and pews will be largely empty.
W.E.B. Dubois is famous for describing the Black church as “the preacher, the music, and the frenzy.” That is true enough as a sociological analysis, but to members of the congregation there is a fourth element to that mix: finding God’s own presence among them.
There are few things more powerful than being in the presence of a Black gospel choir, its lead singer clapping and moving in rhythm testifying to the power of God. There are moments when the choirs and the preachers that follow can lift an entire congregation and transport it. They can fill the despairing with hope and the fearful with the courage to demand justice.
These days, instead of choirs, we mumble along trying to harmonize with a virtual worship leader.
In the months of pandemic worship, I have come to recognize that religious services, by their very nature, cannot fulfill what they promise. Services attempt to usher finite people into the presence of someone we believe is infinite. What hymn or sermon can capture that? We are chasing the wind. There are fits and starts, hints of something at the edge of our perception, but not the thing itself.
Humans disappoint, especially those we expect to share our beliefs and values. We see other believers fail to display the deep love for one another and the stranger that is commended in our sacred texts. We witness others compromise our deepest values, sacrificed for access to power. Integrity seems in short supply. We attend services where the people are unfriendly, the sermons aren’t great, and the music is a struggle. Instead of encountering the transcendent, we bump against the limits of human talent.
These frustrations, large and small, cause some to check out on religion in much the same way that people have checked out on Zoom services. And yet, why did roughly a third of Americans trudge off to services week in and week out before the pandemic? Why do some of us continue to log on during it?
We stay because attendance is not about what the church gives us; it is our way of offering something to God. It is a small rebellion, a way of saying that there is more to life than simply the acquisition of more. It is an attempt to become the kind of people who live lives of charity and service.
The very inadequacy of church services, Zoom and otherwise, is a reminder we do not come into churches to encounter a life lesson on how to raise our children or to learn to be good Americans, whatever that means. Our aim is much more audacious. We are attempting to encounter God and, in so doing, find ourselves, possibly for the first time.
One recent weekend we gathered once more for Zoom church. My wife logged on from her military outpost and I logged on with the kids. I settled into my role at tech support. Two of the younger kids lingered on the couch happily coloring. As I followed along in the service, something surprised me. I looked up from the computer and saw my daughter standing in the middle of the living room. Her tender, beautiful voice resounding throughout the space. She was singing. I found myself ushered into the presence of something that defies description.

Texto completo: A young man in Virginia says he has no regrets over waiting to release a video he saved of a high school classmate using the N-word when she was 15, which ultimately resulted in her not attending her dream college this year.
“I wanted to get her where she would understand the severity of that word,” Jimmy Galligan, who is 18 and biracial, told the New York Times of his former high school classmate, Mimi Groves, who is 19 and white. Both attended Heritage High School in Leesburg, Virginia.
“He tucked the video away, deciding to post it publicly when the time was right,” the New York Times reported of why he didn't release the video when he first saw it last year.
He released it this summer when protests and riots spread across the country following the death of George Floyd. It was also after Groves had been accepted to the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, where she was slated to compete on the school’s cheer team.
“The next month, as protests were sweeping the nation after the police killing of George Floyd, Ms. Groves, in a public Instagram post, urged people to ‘protest, donate, sign a petition, rally, do something’ in support of the Black Lives Matter movement,” the New York Times reported.
Groves realized that the video of her saying “I can drive, [N-word]” was public after she was met with condemnation from a stranger on social media for supporting the BLM movement while also previously using racist language.
“Her alarm at the stranger’s comment turned to panic as friends began calling, directing her to the source of a brewing social media furor. Mr. Galligan, who had waited until Ms. Groves had chosen a college, had publicly posted the video that afternoon. Within hours, it had been shared to Snapchat, TikTok and Twitter, where furious calls mounted for the University of Tennessee to revoke its admission offer,” the New York Times reported.
The video’s circulation ultimately ended with Groves giving up her acceptance to the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, as well as losing her spot on the school’s cheer team.
Galligan told the New York Times that he didn’t regret releasing the video, saying, “If I never posted that video, nothing would have ever happened.”
“I’m going to remind myself, you started something,” he added. “You taught someone a lesson.”
The story, however, has sparked the ire of some who say that cancel culture has gone too far, with an American Conservative opinion piece calling Galligan “an example of the kind of moral monsters this culture of ours has created.”
“We will always live in a society that is in need of moral reform. We are human. But it is a monstrous society that doesn’t offer a way for people to turn from their sins and failings, and find forgiveness and restoration,” the op-ed added.
Others agreed with the op-ed’s sentiment, with some taking to Twitter to voice their opinions.

Groves added in the interview that she regrets using the word, saying she was too young to understand its history.
“At the time, I didn’t understand the severity of the word, or the history and context behind it because I was so young,” she said of the video, adding that “it honestly disgusts me that those words would come out of my mouth.”

How to Pretend You’re in Quebec City Tonight

When the snow falls and the wind howls, the people of Quebec City don’t hibernate. Rather, they bundle up and celebrate with one of the most picturesque winter carnivals in the world. Overlooking the St. Lawrence River, with cobblestone streets and quaint stone houses, Old Quebec looks like an enchanted snow globe village — especially at Christmastime. In fact, the historic district of this former French colony is a UNESCO World Heritage site, thanks in part to it being the only city in North America to have preserved its ramparts.
If I were there I’d be taking in sweeping river views from the promenade known as Dufferin Terrace and the Fairmont le Château Frontenac, the castlelike hotel where Alfred Hitchcock filmed scenes for “I Confess.” In the evening, I’d stroll amid evergreens and twinkling string lights on the Rue Petit-Champlain and stop into Notre-Dame-des-Victoires, one of the oldest stone churches in North America. Hours would be spent ice skating, warming up at an outdoor fire pit and refueling with hearty fare like poutine and tourtière (meat pie) from beloved restaurants.
But as the song goes, there’s no place like home for the holidays. Wherever you happen to be, you can embrace the coziness of the season like Québécois do — with maple syrup-inspired recipes, craft beer, outdoor pursuits and good cheer — even if a single snowflake never falls.
Cook up Comfort With Meat and Maple Syrup
“Blast some cheesy Celine Dion song on your iPhone at earsplitting decibels, find a good recipe for poutine — that trouser-busting dish of French fries, Cheddar cheese curds and gravy — and, if you are in chillier climes, go outside and build a snowman,” advises Dan Bilefsky, the Canada correspondent for The New York Times. Born in Quebec, Bilefsky has written about the “cultural skirmish over who deserves credit” for poutine: Québécois — or the rest of Canada. Happily, all you have to decide is which poutine recipe to make. Try one from Saveur, CBC/Radio-Canada or Chuck Hughes, co-owner and executive chef of Montreal’s Garde Manger and Le Bremner.
“Québécois culture is defined by a certain cowboy excess when it comes to food,” as Bilefsky put it in an email. Cook up comfort with a Times Cooking recipe for a savory tourtière or one for maple-roasted rack of venison from celebrated Canadian chef Martin Picard of Au Pied de Cochon (often credited with reimagining poutine with foie gras). Be inspired by First Nations cuisine with chef Martin Gagné’s venison carpaccio with cedar jelly and sea buckthorn jam. And turn to chefs David McMillan and Frédéric Morin, owners of the acclaimed Joe Beef in Montreal, for more recipes in “The Art of Living According to Joe Beef” cookbook.
For dessert, fill your kitchen with the scent of maple syrup pie. Though why stop there? Bake maple syrup-soaked doughnut holes or maple tarte tartin with sweet recipes from Picard, who also created Au Pied de Cochon Sugar Shack where the essential ingredient is — what else?— maple syrup.
Host Your Own Winter Carnival
Take part in some typical Quebec Winter Carnival activities from your hometown (though perhaps skip the local tradition of ax throwing). Make snow sculptures and go sledding or snowshoeing. Not living in a winter wonderland? You can string up white fairy lights, sing “Au Royaume du Bonhomme Hiver” with Renée Martel (to the tune of “Winter Wonderland”), and savor the Carnival grog — a hot, usually alcoholic drink. A recipe to make some at home with maple syrup, cranberry juice, cinnamon, cloves and sweet grass is on the Quebec Winter Carnival website.
Parlez Français
On days it’s too cold to linger outdoors, learn or brush up on your French, the official language of government in Quebec (and a delicate subject in a majority French-speaking province surrounded by English speakers). Stick to your budget with “Want to Learn French? Italian? Russian? There’s No Time Like the Present” for language tools that are free or won’t break the bank.
Get Cozy With a Stack of Detective Novels
What better way to spend long winter nights than with intrigue and mystery set in a small Quebec hamlet? Light a fire, real or virtual, crack open one of Louise Penny’s best-selling detective novels and spend the evening with Chief Inspector Armand Gamache of the Sûreté du Québec police force. In the most recent book, “All the Devils Are Here,” published this fall, the inspector heads to Paris. But the 15 books in the Gamache series that precede it are steeped in the culture and cuisine of Quebec (with the occasional murder), beginning with “Still Life.”
Spend Movie Night With Directors From Quebec
Keep au courant with Canada’s Top Ten, the Toronto International Film Festival’s annual list of the country’s best films (10 features and 10 shorts). The 2019 selections include several from Quebec directors such as Louise Archambault, whose “And the Birds Rained Down” (“Il Pleuvait des Oiseaux”) is about older hermits living in the wild and a love that blossoms there; and Sophie Deraspe’s “Antigone,” a riff on Sophocles’ tragedy centered on an immigrant family in Montreal (it won best Canadian feature at the Toronto International Film Festival). Also on the list is “Matthias and Maxime” from writer and director Xavier Dolan, the Cannes Film Festival regular who shared the Jury Prize in 2014 for his film “Mommy” with the French filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard. (The 2020 list was recently posted online.)
Sing Along With Celine Dion
For a road trip across Quebec in 2018, Bilefsky, the Times correspondent, played songs that he felt embodied Québécois identity and would also provide an atmospheric soundtrack to the province’s landscapes. There was music from Samian, an Indigenous rapper who sings in French and Algonquin; Leonard Cohen; Éric Lapointe; Les Cowboys Fringants; the Dead Obies; and Arcade Fire. Obviously, Celine Dion, born in Charlemagne, Quebec, was on the list with “Destin.” After all, you haven’t really sung Celine until you’ve done so in French.
Wander Galleries From Your Living Room
Step inside Quebec City’s art galleries like Galerie Perreault, where you can browse works by contemporary artists as well as Canadian masters. Or take a virtual tour of the gallery. Discover Canadian Inuit sculptures through the Galerie Art Inuit Brousseau’s Instagram account. And stroll around town with photos of public artworks from Quebec City Tourism. You won’t even need to pull on your snow boots.

Barry Lopez, a lyrical writer who steeped himself in Arctic wildernesses, the habitats of wolves and exotic landscapes around the world for award-winning books that explored the kinship of nature and human culture, died Friday at his home in Eugene, Oregon. He was 75.
His wife, Debra Gwartney, confirmed his death Saturday and said Lopez had had prostate cancer. She said the family had been living in a temporary home in Eugene since September after their longtime riverfront home in McKenzie, Oregon, was consumed by a wildfire.
In a half-century of travel to 80 countries that generated nearly a score of nonfiction and fiction works, including volumes of essays and short stories, Lopez embraced landscapes and literature with humanitarian, environmental and spiritual sensibilities that some critics likened to those of Thoreau and John Muir.
He won the National Book Award (nonfiction) for “Arctic Dreams” (1986), a treatise on his five years with Inuit people and solitude in a land of bitter cold and endless expanses, where he found that howling storms could craft mirages — a hunter stalking a grizzly bear that, as he approaches, turns into a marmot, or a polar bear that grows wings and flies away: only a snowy owl.
“It treats the distant snowy world of the Arctic as a place that exists not only in the mathematics of geography, but also in the terra incognita of our imaginations,” Michiko Kakutani said in a review of “Arctic Dreams” in The New York Times. “For Mr. Lopez, it is a land where ‘airplanes track icebergs the size of Cleveland and polar bears fly down out of the stars,’ a land rich in imagery and metaphor.”
In the Canadian Arctic, Lopez was once engulfed in a blizzard of such intensity that it turned into a mystical experience: Three-dimensional space seemed to vanish all around him. He explained the science of it as a trick of light, but described the phenomenon and its deeper meaning in rhapsodic prose.
“There are no shadows,” he wrote. “Space has no depth. There is no horizon. The bottom of the world disappears. On foot, you stumble about in missed stair-step fashion. It is precisely because the regimes of light and time in the Arctic are so different that this landscape is able to expose in startling ways the complacency of our thoughts about land in general.”
Raised and educated in Roman Catholic traditions, Lopez as a young man considered vocations as a priest or a Trappist monk. But, deciding to be a writer, he drifted away from the church, as he explained in an interview for this obituary, and starting in the late 1960s adopted a deep reverence for nature and its effect upon humanity.
“I can tell you in two words,” he said when asked about his motives for writing. “To help. I am a traditional storyteller. This activity is not about yourself. It’s about culture, and your job is to help.”
The Guardian put it this way in 2005: “Throughout his writings, Lopez returns to the idea that natural landscapes are capable of bestowing a grace upon those who pass through them. Certain landscape forms, in his vision, possess a spiritual correspondence. The stern curve of a mountain slope, a nest of wet stones on a beach, the bent trunk of a windblown tree: These abstract shapes can call out in us a goodness we might not have known we possessed.”
After a trip to Alaska to research wolves for a magazine assignment in 1976, Lopez devoted two years to a study of the history, lore, habitats and literature of wolves, reviled in myths as evil and hunted since the Dark Ages as bloodthirsty beasts. He interviewed scientists, trappers and native people in the American and Canadian Northwest. He even raised a wolf pup.
His book “Of Wolves and Men” (1978) was a National Book Award finalist and won the John Burroughs Medal and the Christopher Award. A history of man’s relationship with wolves, it separated fact from fiction in what critics called a cleareyed evaluation of a creature that has been superstitiously scapegoated and historically slaughtered nearly to extinction in regions of Europe and North America.
“In coming to terms with the difference between what we know and what we imagine about the wolf, Lopez has shed light on some painful truths about the human experience,” Whitley Strieber said in a review for The Washington Post. “By laying no blame while facing the tragedy for what it is, he has made what we have done to the wolf a source of new knowledge about man.”
Lopez’s fiction, a shelf of novels and short stories, reflected his humanist convictions, a blend of adventure, intimacy, ethics and identity. In “Crow and Weasel” (1990), a fable of long ago, “when people and animals spoke the same language,” two youngsters leave their plains tribe and come of age facing perils in the wilderness on a quest for wisdom.
“Light Action in the Caribbean” (2000) was a diverse collection of short stories bound by Lopez’s belief in the redemptive values of self-respect. In “Emory Bear Hands’ Birds,” an imprisoned Native American storyteller uses magic realism to evoke hope in fellow inmates. In the title story, a young woman gives a smug, materialistic yuppie his comeuppance in a Caribbean vacation paradise:
“The first bullet tore through his left triceps, the second, third, fourth and fifth hit nothing, the sixth perforated his spleen, the seventh and eighth hit nothing, the ninth hit the console, sending electrical sparks up, the tenth went through his right palm, the next four went into the air, the fifteenth tore his left ear away, the sixteenth ricocheted off the sixth cervical vertebra and drove down through his heart, exiting through his abdomen and lodging in his foot.”
Barry Lopez was born Barry Holstun Brennan in Port Chester, New York, on Jan. 6, 1945, the older of two sons of John Brennan and Mary Frances (Holstun) Brennan, who lived in Mamaroneck, New York, and worked in advertising. Barry’s brother, Dennis, was born in 1948, and the family moved to Reseda, California, then a semirural section of Los Angeles in the San Fernando Valley.
After a divorce in 1950, Mary Brennan taught home economics in high schools and a junior college. In 1955 she married Adrian Bernard Lopez, a businessman who adopted her sons. They both took the Lopez surname.
Barry’s mother encouraged his love of nature with trips to the Mojave Desert and the Grand Canyon. He attended a Roman Catholic grade school in the nearby Encino neighborhood.
When Barry was 11, the family moved to Manhattan, where he attended the Loyola School, a Jesuit institution, and was senior class president, graduating in 1962. He considered the priesthood but enrolled in the University of Notre Dame, where he earned a bachelor’s degree in communications in 1966 and a master’s in teaching in 1968. He also spent a month at a monastery in Kentucky but decided that a monastic life would be “too easy,” he told The Times.
In 1967, he married Sandra Jean Landers. They were divorced in 1998. In 2007, he married Debra Arleen Gwartney, who had four daughters: Amanda, Stephanie and Mary Woodruff and Mollie Harger; and a half brother, John Brennan, all of whom survive. His brother, Dennis, died in 2017.
Lopez was a contributing editor at Harper’s Magazine and wrote for many national publications. He taught at Columbia University, Eastern Washington University, the University of Iowa, Carleton College in Minnesota and Texas Tech University, where his works are archived.
His essay collection “About This Life: Journeys on the Threshold of Memory” (1998) explored landscapes around the world and in the mind.
“Lopez takes readers not only out of themselves to another place, but into themselves as well,” Sara Wheeler wrote in The Times. “He is much attracted to the rift that has opened between human society and nature, and, more specifically, to the theory that art can close it. He believes in the community of artists.”

Texto completo: The claim: CNN reported hospitals went on lockdown after COVID-19 vaccine recipients started eating each other
As Americans across the country started getting vaccinated against COVID-19, social media users shared a viral image claiming that CNN reported hospitals going on lockdown after COVID-19 vaccine recipients started eating one another.
The widely shared photo shows a hospital unit with blood and medical equipment scattered across the floor along with a text that reads: "BREAKING NEWS: HOSPITALS ON LOCKDOWN AS FIRST COVID VACCINE PATIENTS START EATING OTHER PATIENTS."
Below the headline reads a smaller text that states, "Nancy Pelosi arrested for DUI," and the top right of the photo has a location of Los Angeles.
Among those who shared the claim was UFC Hall of Famer Bas Rutten, who posted the image to Instagram on Dec. 22 with the caption "I told you this was a bad idea."
USA TODAY reached out the Facebook users and Rutten for comment.
Fact check: CNN never made – or retracted – Arizona call for Joe Biden
Image is from 2019, news report not authentic
A reverse Google image search of the photo used in the claim reveals that the photo used with the edited CNN headline was published in a New York Times opinion column on Feb. 14, 2019, and was taken by medical student Eric Curran.
"The trauma bay in the emergency department at Temple University Hospital after resuscitation efforts failed," the caption of the image reads.
In his column, Curran explained his experience of treating gunshot victims in a hospital and said he started taking photos of the room "out of the helplessness and despair" he felt about the "senseless deaths." He wrote that he hoped his images would "help Americans understand what is happening."
The Google reverse search further revealed that the image originated as a joke on meme website iFunny on Dec. 16 after someone likely added a CNN logo and fake headlines onto Curran's original photo to create the meme, which then led to false claims on social media.
There is also no evidence that hospitals in Los Angeles went into lockdown from violent behavior from COVID-19 vaccine recipients or that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi,D-Calif., was arrested for driving under the influence.
Drew Hamill, Pelosi's deputy chief of staff, has told USA TODAY that the House speaker does not drink, and claims targeting Pelosi that try to make her appear intoxicated have been debunked by USA TODAY.
The claim that hospitals were locked down after coronavirus vaccine recipients started eating one another has also been fact-checked by AFP and India Today.
Fact check: Nurse who fainted after COVID-19 vaccination is alive and well
Our rating: False
The claim that CNN reported that hospitals locked down after COVID-19 vaccine recipients started eating one another is FALSE, based on our research. The image used in the claim is from 2019 and was taken at a hospital in Philadelphia after treating victims of gun violence.

The Place Hit Hardest by the Virus

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
Hospitals in Gallup are nearly full. Most stores are empty. The unemployment rate in the county where the city sits is one and a half times the national average. Earlier this month, it had the most cases per capita of any metro area in the United States, according to a New York Times database.
As the pandemic has steadily marched across the country in recent months, places like Gallup have been among the hardest hit.
Perched between the Navajo Nation to the north and Zuni Nation to the south, almost half of Gallup’s residents are Native American, according to census data.
Native American communities have been particularly vulnerable to the virus, at one point accounting for nearly 40% of all cases in New Mexico, even though those communities make up less than a tenth of the state’s population. And some who have so far been spared by the virus are nonetheless reeling from the consequences of the economic slowdown.
Eric-Paul Riege, a 26-year-old artist, is the son of a veteran and hotel manager and a Navajo mother who taught him the art of weaving. His work has appeared in galleries and collections around the country. But paid projects this year all but dried up.
When I met Riege, he was working shifts at a diner called Grandpa’s Grill, processing orders for takeout food.
Route 66 cuts through Gallup. The town has relied on tourism to help drive its economy, counting on visitors to shop at local galleries and trading posts selling Native American art and crafts. But limits on activity in the area have made that hard.
When the region was experiencing an extreme wave of virus cases in May, the city locked down, and state police officers and the National Guard barricaded highway exits to prevent people who didn’t live in Gallup from entering town unless it was an emergency.
Last month, long after the barricades came down, trading posts were open but closed for indoor shopping, limiting the chances of anyone passing by to stop and browse.
The iconic El Rancho hotel, where John Wayne and Katharine Hepburn and other Hollywood stars once stayed, was roughly a quarter full.
Gallup is in many ways a relic of conquered Indigenous lands and American expansion. Many of the trading posts, for example, are owned and operated by white people. Those small shops sit in the shadows of McDonald’s, Walmart and other big American franchises, where cars and people often spill out of parking lots now.
Bill Lee, the head of Gallup’s Chamber of Commerce, said there has been a growing economic divide because of the restrictions put in place by local and state officials. Smaller businesses often have to operate with stricter guidelines, including rules preventing in-store shopping, while bigger box stores, especially those deemed essential, could operate with fewer limits. “The governor has chosen winners and losers,” Lee said.
When the barricades were erected earlier this year, Walmart was inundated by shoppers stocking up on weeks’ worth of supplies, especially because grocery stores on Indigenous lands are few and far between. The barricades, however, also had the effect of preventing members of Native American groups from coming into town to shop.
Indigenous groups in the area have long suffered from a lack of information and resources.
Even before the pandemic, the Indian Health Service, the government program that provides health care to the 2.2 million members of the nation’s tribal communities, had severe shortages of funding and supplies, in addition to a lack of doctors and aging facilities.
The virus made those weaknesses that much more apparent.
Amid the devastation of the pandemic, some people have gotten lucky. Dan Bonaguidi, the son of the town’s mayor who owns Michele’s Ready Mix Rock and Recycle with his wife, Michele, is one of them. His business has been thriving as government grants in the pandemic have led to greater demand for building materials for home renovations and projects like new or expanded health care facilities.
But even with bright spots, there are many more stories of businesses sitting empty or being shuttered — small and large.
After an oil and natural gas boom in New Mexico and Texas in recent years, the pandemic has cut into oil demand and prices. Marathon Petroleum announced plans in August to shut down its operations in the area and lay off more than 200 workers — roughly 1% of the city’s population.
Operations like Marathon’s are vital to Gallup’s economy, and the job losses helped push the area’s unemployment rate to 10.6% in October. Raul Sanchez is one of the workers who lost his job.
As I drove by his home on a hill overlooking the western part of town one afternoon two days before Thanksgiving, Sanchez was tinkering with a red pickup truck. He’d worked at Marathon for 10 years. “No other jobs in this town pay as well,” Sanchez, 39, said.
“It’s going to have an effect on us,” the city’s mayor, Louis Bonaguidi, said earlier this year about the closing of the Marathon plant. “It’s going to affect the housing market for sure. But it’s going to affect all the businesses, too.”
When I drove through Gallup the day before Thanksgiving, the last few minutes of sun lit up the railroad rails. Despite the town’s struggles, I could still feel a sense a pride in the community as I drove around.
But the sense of vulnerability was just as apparent. Even before the pandemic hit, more than a quarter of the city’s residents lived in poverty, and those numbers have swelled this year.
Not long after my visit to the Rehoboth medical center, I watched a group of Navajo men lower a bronze-colored coffin into a grave at a cemetery 50 miles north of Gallup. It was not the only virus-related funeral scheduled there that week.

Texto completo: Both Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Attorney General William Barr say Russia was behind the massive cyberattack that compromised 18,000 U.S. companies and government agencies, but President Donald Trump isn't buying it. "Russia, Russia, Russia is the priority chant when anything happens," Trump tweeted, adding "it may" be China or "a hit on our ridiculous voting machines during the election, which is now obvious that I won big."
No, it wasn't either of these things. And by tweeting this nonsense, Trump is not only failing to respond forcefully and restore deterrence in cyberspace  he is missing an opportunity to claim vindication concerning Washington's obsession with Russian electoral interference.
Were U.S. intelligence officials so focused on detecting and deterring Moscow's election interference that they missed the Kremlin's real target  a massive cyber penetration of U.S. businesses and government agencies? That's the case Trump should be making. Undetected, Russian hackers penetrated SolarWinds, a company that produces network management software used by many Fortune 500 companies and government agencies, in October 2019, and began attaching a computer virus to the software updates the company pushed out to its clients.
SolarWinds updates acted like a superspreader, allowing Russia to create "back doors" in targeted networks that, according to the New York Times, gave Moscow the ability "to come and go, steal data and  though it apparently has not happened yet  alter data or conduct destructive attacks." Russia penetrated not only thousands of businesses but also the U.S. Departments of State, Homeland Security, Treasury, Commerce and Energy  including the National Nuclear Security Administration, which maintains the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile. We still do not know the full extent of the damage. Some national security experts have suggested that this attack could actually be a subset of a much larger operation.
The Russian hack was discovered by accident, when an employee at a compromised company saw their credentials had been used to log into the company's network from an unrecognized device. In other words, our intelligence community was overly focused on the wrong target. Rather than deny what took place, Trump should be arguing that Washington's four-year fixation with Russian interference in our elections provided the perfect cover for this unprecedented Russian cyberattack.
The lesson is that cyberattackers are like terrorists  they take advantage of our free and open society to infiltrate and attack America. And the lesson we learned after Sept. 11, 2001, is that we cannot defend perfectly in every place and at all times against every possible technique. The only way to stop or deter them is to go on offense. "What's our response to the Russians?" asks retired four-star Army Gen. Jack Keane. He points out that the United States has the most powerful offensive cyber-capabilities in the world. "We cannot let this stand. We have the capability to attack back and we should.  When you impose costs  your adversary is going to think twice before doing something."
Based on what is now in the public sphere, Trump appears to have used America's offensive cyber capabilities more than any previous president. In August 2019, the New York Times reported that he ordered "a secret cyberattack against Iran in June [that] wiped out a critical database used by Iran's paramilitary arm to plot attacks against oil tankers." In an interview with me last fall, Trump acknowledged for the first time that he had launched a cyberattack on Russia to prevent its interference in the 2018 midterm elections. But he has clearly not used them nearly enough to deter attacks like this one. If an adversary had launched a kinetic attack on us this massive, we would take out whatever weapon was used to harm us. But too often, we allow adversaries to get away with attacks in the cyber domain that would not be tolerated in any other domain.
If we want to restore cyber deterrence, that has to change. The primary reason we have gone almost two decades without another 9/11-style attack on the homeland is because America has been on offense across the world, taking out terrorists with targeted drone strikes, denying them sanctuary. We need to do the same in cyberspace. Our adversaries need to know that attacks on America in cyberspace will not be tolerated, and will be met with a swift and disproportionate response  and that the United States will preemptively take out cyber capabilities of state or non-state actors we believe threatens us.
Trump has pulled the trigger in cyberspace before. He can do it again. But to do so, he must stop denying Russia's complicity, stop obsessing with overturning the election, defend our country and restore deterrence in cyberspace.

Texto completo: Several times a day, whether I'm indoors or out, my bone doctor's mantra reverberates in my head: "Do not fall!"
That might seem like telling the sun not to shine, but it does remind me that my balance is not what it used to be. I can no longer take for granted my ability to remain erect when moving about among a plethora of unexpected tripping hazards - broken sidewalks, fallen branches, a dog on the loose. How can I keep from falling when I stumble?
Surely, I thought, there'd be helpful advice on the web. But after checking out dozens of postings on how I might improve my balance, I was more confused than enlightened. Most emphasized improving core and leg strength, which for me are already in good shape. Now what?
Then I learned of a new book with a title that echoed my bone doctor's warning: "Falling Is Not an Option: A Way to Lifelong Balance." The author, George Locker, a lifelong student of martial arts and teacher of tai chi, adapted the lessons of these ancient arts into an approach he has trademarked as "Postural Retraining."
The goal is stability by increasing one's downward force, and the examples Locker gave of surfers, skaters and skiers made perfect sense to me.
I can easily recall my stable posture when I skated on ice or pavement or skied on water or snow: a semi squat with knees and ankles bent. Although I no longer attempt these sports at age 79, my ability to remain balanced and stable is more important than ever.
As reported last year in The New York Times, between 2000 and 2016, the mortality rate from falls among those older than 75 more than doubled. Locker calls this "a medical problem without a medical solution." Rare is the doctor who prescribes postures and movements that enhance balance and stability. Yet, these are health- and life-saving abilities that can be improved regardless of a person's age by strengthening the body's postural muscles.
But unlike building up arm or leg muscles, increasing the strength of postural muscles to improve balance is not something visible. It's internal, something the body, not the mind, must learn to do, like learning how to balance on a bicycle.
"Balance," Locker wrote, "is not a skill," and it "is not attained by aptitude, memory or repetition." In an interview, he said, "Balance is not about moving, thinking about it, being athletic or strong." Nor is it subject to willful control. Rather, it is something the body learns to do automatically by engaging the postural muscles. Given the amount of sitting most of us do these days, "the postural muscles literally forget how to maintain balance, even on steady, level surfaces," he wrote.
No weights or machines are needed to strengthen postural muscles. Rather, the body's own weight is engaged, as in skating when, with bent knee and ankle, the body's weight is transferred from the back leg to the front leg, or in paddle boarding, when body weight is evenly distributed between bent legs.
As Locker, now 70, explained, "The exercises in Postural Retraining use the body's own weight to prompt the postural muscles to balance the body." The exercises are isometric; there is no movement. Rather, postural muscles are tensed and the tension is sustained as long as possible, which builds the strength of both muscles and bones.
While I'd normally be highly skeptical of such advice from a nonprofessional without a degree in physical therapy, kinesiology, rehabilitation medicine or athletic training, one paragraph in Locker's book won me over:
"Walking on an even surface is not weight-bearing," at least not as Locker defines it, because it does not train postural muscles. "The knee tends to lock when the foot contacts the ground, and the foot does not remain on the ground for more than a moment. Therefore walking, while wonderful and healthy, does not improve balance. Walking on a rocky Adirondack trail, where both legs are constantly bent to maintain balance, is weight-bearing."
I spent most of last summer in the lower Catskills, where I trekked with my dog on uneven paths over rocks and roots for an hour or more every other morning. During the first two weeks of July, I felt very unsteady and fell twice. But I became more secure with each outing, and by summer's end, my balance and stability had noticeably improved. Even when jostled by a dog while standing on a rocky surface, I easily remained stable and erect.
While many people are not in a position to train their postural muscles by hiking in the woods, Locker describes exercises that people can do safely at home using their own bodies for equipment. Basically, the feet learn to be more firmly connected to the ground while the body weight moves within a base of support.
"In tai chi," Locker noted, "we don't move to achieve balance; first we balance, then we move." Balance is not subject to conscious control, but it can be enhanced by use and diminished by disuse, he explained. "The key to balance and stability in humans is the ability to create downward force in excess of body weight. Thus, neither a statue nor a surfer standing stiff as a statue can remain upright on a surfboard."
A sample lesson: You've likely heard advice to improve balance by standing on one leg when brushing your teeth. A far better plan is to bend the knee and ankle of the leg you're standing on to engage the postural muscles. At the same time, the pelvic muscles remain relaxed.
Another simple exercise involves standing straight with thigh and buttocks muscles relaxed, then bending knees and ankles as if you're about to sit on a high stool. Keep the spine straight and pelvis relaxed. Hold this position for as long as you can, increasing the time gradually as your postural muscles get stronger, up to 15 minutes.
The ultimate goal, Locker said, is to achieve "a tremendous connection to the ground so that when you get pushed, instead of lifting up your shoulders and falling forward, your knees and ankles bend and the body naturally pushes into the ground."

Texto completo: For the first time in three months, the daily number of people hospitalized due to complications of COVID-19 in Delaware has dropped for three consecutive days – a welcomed development as officials in Delaware and elsewhere brace for what could come next following the end-of-year holidays.
As of Friday night, 400 people statewide were being treated in a hospital for their coronavirus symptoms. That's down from 454 on Dec. 22; 426 on Dec. 23; and 404 on Dec. 24 – an overall drop of 12% over three days. It's the first time the daily number has dropped for three consecutive days since a four-day stretch ending on Sept. 24, when just 53 people in Delaware were hospitalized from the virus.
The dip in hospitalizations comes while thousands may have spent the Christmas holiday traveling and at family gatherings and religious services.
"Although we would like to be encouraged with the downward trend of hospitalizations, we are concerned that a similar increase after Thanksgiving can be seen with Christmas/New Year's," Division of Public Health spokeswoman Jen Brestel said in an email Saturday. "Hospitalization is also a lagging indicator, so we may see a change weeks after any trends in new positive cases."
Cases in Delaware were mounting prior to Thanksgiving, but the post-Thanksgiving surge saw the average seven-day daily case count climb from 469 cases per day on Thanksgiving to a peak of 823.7 three weeks later on Dec. 16. That number has decreased to 621.4 through Friday, a day when the state reported 798 new cases.
Only time will tell if the rapid dip in hospitalizations over the last few days is just a blip. Hospitalizations do tend to lag behind new positive cases, and the rate of positive cases has yet to drop to a level that would indicate a drastically lower rate of community spread.
Nationally, around 120,000 people were hospitalized this weekend due to COVID-19 complications. And the total number of virus-related deaths topped 330,000, meaning the virus has taken one in every 1,000 people nationwide so far in 2020.
As of Friday night, 895 Delawareans have died, an increase of four over the previous day. The latest four deaths ranged in ages from 70s to 90s. All four had underlying health conditions and three were residents of long-term care facilities in Delaware, increasing the total deaths at such facilities in the state to 483 (54% of all coronavirus-related deaths).
What's also unclear is how heavy the surge will be following the end-of-year holidays. Officials this week urged Delawareans to stay home for Christmas and New Year's. "We can't afford another surge on top of the surge that we had coming out of Thanksgiving," Gov. John Carney said during his weekly virtual coronavirus press briefing.
The state has at times said its capacity for COVID-19 patients is between 400 and 500 hospitalizations, though Carney has referred to that estimate as a "moving target."
A New York Times graphic data set of hospital capacity around the country showed ICU capacity reached at Bayhealth campuses in Milford and Dover and capacity at Beebe running low. But officials at both of those hospitals last week did not sound any alarms about capacity issues when asked about the Times' data. "The interactive graphic from the New York Times shows a snapshot in time for our patient census," said Ryan Clarke, Bayhealth's Director of Emergency Management and Public Safety. "It's important to note our volumes do fluctuate. Currently, we are appropriately managing all our patients in our typical patient rooms at both hospitals. We are not diverting patients and we have not had to create any overflow units."
At Beebe, a spokesperson said the hospital was not "operating near capacity or in an overwhelming surge."
Similarly, ChristianaCare believes it also has the necessary capacity to see through the winter surge.
As of Thursday morning, 6,569 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine had been administered in the state. DPH expects to have another update on vaccination numbers on Monday.

Texto completo: Can you believe that 2020 is already (or finally) coming to a close? So many things have happened in this past year, some good and some bad. As we get ready to enter into a new year, we always like to poll our staff at Shreve Memorial Library to see what were their most memorable moments and favorite books of the year.
I think it is safe to say that the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the library, the community and the world topped everyone's list of memorable moments. Library services were suspended, reduced and revised to meet guidelines. Traditional library programs, such as book discussions, storytimes and lecture series, migrated to virtual platforms such as YouTube, Zoom and social media. Instead of craft programs, we encouraged and continue to offer Grab & Go craft kits and online arts and crafts tutorials. Our digital services and resources became the go-to for at home learning and library use.
Although the ongoing pandemic has changed many of the ways we do things at the library, it has not changed the services the library provides. From books, DVDs and music to research materials, reference help and Reader's Advisory services, the library continues to spark imaginations, encourage childhood literacy and lifelong learning, and provide ready references. Through it all, Shreve Memorial Library continues to be a place to dream, discover, do.
This year, I found myself with a little more time to really take advantage of the many services offered by the library. Curbside pickup service and automatic checkout renewals were two of my personal favorites this year, allowing me to catch up on my long "To Be Read" list. Some of the books I read this year included many that were new at the library and were featured in this column. In 2020, I have read If It Bleeds by Stephen King, What a Fun Age by Kiley Reid, The Only Child by Mi-ae Seo, Eight Perfect Murders by Peter Swanson, and Home Before Dark by Riley Sager to name a few. All were great reads and true page-turners!
Listed below are some of our staff's favorite books of 2020 available at the library. Be sure to visit Shreve Memorial Library and check out books that meet your interests. Remember, you can always place holds online and take advantage of the library's curbside pickup service. Just visit www.shreve-lib.org to browse the library's online catalog, see what books are available, and reserve your copy.
As a reminder, all Shreve Memorial Library branches will be closed Thursday, Dec. 31 through Sunday, Jan. 3 for the New Year's holiday. On behalf of all of us at Shreve Memorial Library, I wish all of you a very happy New Year!

The Noel Letters by Richard Paul Evans (fiction)
After nearly two decades, Noel Post, an editor for a major New York publishing house, returns to her childhood home in Salt Lake City to see her estranged, dying father. What she believed would be a brief visit turns into something more as she inherits the bookstore her father fought to keep alive. Reeling from loneliness, a recent divorce, and unanticipated upheavals in her world, Noel begins receiving letters from an anonymous source, each one containing thoughts and lessons about her life and her future. She begins to reacquaint herself with the bookstore and the people she left behind, and in doing so, starts to unravel the reality of her painful childhood and the truth about her family. As the holidays draw near, she receives a Christmastime revelation that changes not only how she sees the past but also how she views her future.
The Book of Lost Names by Kristin Hamel (fiction)
Inspired by an astonishing true story from World War II, a young woman with a talent for forgery helps hundreds of Jewish children flee the Nazis in this unforgettable historical novel from the New York Times bestselling author of the "epic and heart-wrenching World War II tale" (Alyson Noel, #1 New York Times bestselling author) The Winemaker's Wife. Eva Traube Abrams, a semi-retired librarian in Florida, is shelving books one morning when her eyes lock on a photograph in a magazine lying open nearby. She freezes; it's an image of a book she hasn't seen in 65 years, a book she recognizes as The Book of Lost Names. The accompanying article discusses the looting of libraries by the Nazis across Europe during World War II – an experience Eva remembers well – and the search to reunite people with the texts taken from them so long ago. The book in the photograph, an eighteenth-century religious text through to have been taken from France in the waning days of the war, is one of the most fascinating cases. Now housed in Berlin's Zentral-und Landesbibliothek library, it appears to contain some sort of code, but researchers don't know where it came from – or what the code means. Only Eva holds the answer – but will she have the strength to revisit old memories and help reunite those lost during the war?
The Black Swan of Paris by Karen Robards (fiction)
Paris, 1944: Celebrated singer Genevieve Dumont is both a star and a smokescreen. An unwilling darling of the Nazis, the chanteuse's position of privilege allows her to go undetected as an ally to the resistance. When her estranged mother, Lillian de Rocheford, is captured by Nazis, Genevieve knows it won't be long before the Gestapo succeeds in torturing information out of Lillian that will derail the upcoming allied invasion. The resistance movement is tasked with silencing her by any means necessary – including assassination. But Genevieve refuses to let her mother become yet one more victim of war. Reuniting with her long-lost sister, she must find a way to navigate the perilous cross-currents of Occupied France undetected – and in time to save Lillian's life. In this heart-wrenching novel, bestselling author Karen Robards showcases the extraordinary lengths one goes to save her family from a German prison. A web of spies, the resistance and a vivid portrayal of Paris in wartime.

Texto completo: Harry Berkowitz, a thoughtful, intrepid business reporter and editor at Newsday for two decades with a knack for distilling complex energy, finance and media stories down to their core, died Dec. 20 at his home in Stamford, Connecticut, of undetermined causes.
He was 67.
Berkowitz spent nearly five decades in journalism, beginning as a New York University campus correspondent for The New York Times to most recently serving as the personal finance editor for Bottom Line Personal, a twice-a-month newsletter.
He covered OPEC conferences in Europe, shake-ups and scandals in the expanding media and cable TV market, and profiled then-real estate magnate Donald Trump.
"Harry was a first-rate reporter; always very accurate," said Steve Sink, a former Newsday business editor who worked with Berkowitz for 17 years. "He was someone I would describe as skeptical but not cynical. He doubted but didn't have the attitude that everybody was necessarily a crook."
Berkowitz was born in Brooklyn, the youngest of two children, to Samuel Berkowitz, who worked in the wholesale egg business, and Sally Porter Berkowitz, a homemaker. 
He obtained a bachelor's degree in English and psychology from New York University, where he also served as a campus stringer for the Times and as an editor at the Washington Square Journal.
Daniel Berkowitz of Larchmont described his first cousin as shy but with a huge heart and who had been deeply committed to his late wife of 14 years, Elaine Neese Berkowitz. She died in 2013 of colon cancer, leaving him to raise their son, Sam, now 21.
"He was a gentle, honorable man," said Daniel Berkowitz, a retired gastroenterologist. "He was so devoted to his wife and child."
Sam Berkowitz, a student at Norwalk Community College, said of his father: "He worked very hard to make sure people he cared about were well off. He would put his all into his work and he would do it to make sure I was in a good place ... Everything he did was to make sure I had what was needed and more."
Harry Berkowitz broke into journalism as a City Hall reporter and later as the city editor for the Civil Service Leader, a labor union paper. He did a three-year stint as a business editor at the Courier-News in Bridgewater, Connecticut, and spent four years at the Stamford Advocate, two as a business editor and two as metro editor.
Kevin Flynn, who was an assignment editor at the Advocate at the time, recalled Berkowitz as a calm, charming manager who was popular with reporters and editors. He pushed staffers hard, often debating them, but his quiet persistence was softened with a quirky sense of humor that disarmed his co-workers.
"If he thought you were off on something, he'd correct you with a question: 'Do you think it could work this way?' " said Flynn, now an editor with The New York Times. "If you were really off, he'd just laugh and say, 'no, no, no, no.' Newsrooms can be very tense places, but Harry set a tone that took the edge off."
In 1985, Berkowitz moved to New York Newsday's Manhattan office, where he was a key figure in what was then one of the nation's largest business staffs. He covered real estate, the oil and gas industry, advertising, marketing and media, including coverage of Newsday itself.
Berkowitz would later be promoted to New York Newsday Business News' bureau chief before leaving in 2005 to become a manager at Deloitte Services, where he produced newsletters, wrote speeches and shaped internal communication strategy for the accounting firm.
Since 2007, Berkowitz, who loved to travel and was especially enamored with Paris, worked as the personal finance editor at Bottom Line Personal, a consumer newsletter that provides advice from experts on a host of topics to its more than 400,000 subscribers.
Marjory Abrams, a co-owner and chief content officer at Bottom Line, said Berkowitz had an innate sense for what ordinary people needed to know and what trendy topics to pick up on and avoid.
"Harry on the outside was such a curmudgeon but I would describe him on the inside as just this loving mush," said Abrams, who also served as editor-in-chief of the Bottom Line Personal newsletter. "He had a very wry sense of humor."
Besides his son and cousin, Berkowitz is survived by his sister, Michelle of Manhattan.
Funeral services for Berkowitz were held Wednesday at the Kensico Cemetery in

Texto completo: "I've been trying new recipes during the pandemic, looking for the perfect combination of ease and tastiness. This recipe for Roasted Sausages with Grapes and Onions fills the bill, and is perfect for cold weather since it calls for a 450-degree oven. The recipe comes from Melissa Clark via the New York Times.
"I took this picture the first time I made it because I was so taken with the results. I use fresh mild chicken sausage, but as Clark's notes point out, any sausage can be used. In subsequent cooking, I've increased the number of sausages to four and used 1 tablespoon dried chives because I couldn't find fresh. I also added the vinegar to the baking sheet without removing the grapes and onions, just pushed them to the side, then mixed everything together. I've been serving it with wide egg noodles and a green salad. Really yummy!
"Cooking and reading about cooking are bright spots, especially now that the days are short and cold weather is here." -- STACIE WEBB, Portland
Roasted Sausages with Grapes and Onions
Recipe from the New York Times, with tweaks from Stacie Webb.
1 large Spanish onion, thinly sliced
4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
½ teaspoon fine sea salt, plus more to taste
½ teaspoon freshly ground pepper
4 cups seedless red grapes, de-stemmed
1 teaspoon fennel, coriander, cumin or caraway seeds, lightly crushed
1 pound any sausage, poked all over with a fork (or a little more)
½ cup parsley, coarsely chopped
2 tablespoons chopped chives (or 1 tablespoon dried)
2 teaspoons rice or sherry vinegar, plus more to taste
Heat the oven to 450 degrees. On a large rimmed baking sheet, toss together the onion slices, 2 tablespoons of the oil, and the salt and pepper. Spread in an even layer and roast for 8 to 12 minutes until the onions turn translucent and the thinnest pieces take on a pale gold color.
After 10 minutes, add the grapes, spices and the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil to the pan with the onions. Spread in an even layer and nestle the sausage in the mixture.
Roast until the sausage has browned, 25 to 30 minutes, flipping the sausages and tossing the grapes and onions halfway through.
Transfer the sausage to a platter or individual plates. Add the herbs to the pan with the grapes and onions and gently toss. Push the mixture to the side of the rimmed pan and add the vinegar, scraping up any browned bits left in the pan. Add the grape-onion mixture to the plates with the sausages.

Texto completo: Photography From the Year Time Stopped

The End of Time
Usually, a photograph captures a moment in time and space. But this year, time and space were slippery and elastic. In the United States, things started off normally enough. January and February were sharply in focus: 2020 vision. But by March, time and space took on new implications and contexts. Time was counted in lockdown days; space, measured in increments of a safe six feet apart.
Soon the days oozed together, liquefied like a clock in a Dalí painting. The weirdness and the dread and the tragedy seeped into every aspect of daily life, and of course, the photographic record of it.
Suddenly, everywhere in the world, it wasn't just about what was being photographed, but how. Subjects were masked. Photographers wore P.P.E. Images were taken at a distance -- from down the hall, or through a glass window, or via the screen of a phone.
Before long, scenes that used to seem perfectly ordinary -- a crowd of humans; hands touching a woman's face; an intimate portrait in a bedroom -- were newly burdened with the weighty subtext of a new reality. Just as once upon a time we may have clutched our pearls at the sight of an ankle, we're now mildly scandalized by what was once very common social behavior. So close! Is that safe? That must be from The Before Times. Often it's intertwined with a twinge of sadness. Remember when we used to drink cocktails together? In the same room? Anxiety and loss blanket everything, and the simplest actions are steeped in fear.
In May, on assignment for The New York Times, the photographer Elliot Ross sent disposable cameras to six residents of Evergreen Gardens, an assisted living facility in Colorado. One image, by 93-year-old Muriel Morgan, stands out.
In front of a stone building and sliver of driveway, a woman sits in a wooden chair, her face turned toward the camera. She has a walker in front of her, and she wears sunglasses and a cloth mask that covers her nose and mouth. Beyond her, there are more wooden chairs, at clearly measured distances. One stands empty. Two others are occupied with more masked people. In the foreground, as a bouquet of balloons enters the frame, a toddler looks on from at least six feet away.
The colors produced by the film infuse a vintage aura, brushing on a veneer of nostalgia. Another time warp, another melted clock. Yet it is very much an image taken in 2020 -- of a very 2020 situation. Last December we may not have understood it. Why is the chair in the street? Why is everyone so far apart? Why the masks? Now it all makes sense. We've been trained to understand a new visual language.
Sometimes when something wild and unexpected happens, we joke about a tear in the space-time continuum. As if some kind of quantum sci-fi futuristic wormhole phenomenon is the only logical explanation. Looking back on photos taken during this disrupted year, as we slide into a new one, you will not see the tiny microbe that changed everything. You will not see the photographer's protective equipment or the paranoia in the air. But you will see that we soldiered on. We kept going. The clock was melting, but it didn't stop ticking.

On Sports: Football Is a Balm for Grief

Texto completo: In late March, my uncle died unexpectedly. Phillip Randle was my dad's little brother and his best friend. The loss, exacerbated by our inability to hold a funeral for him because of the pandemic, shrouded my father in a blanket of grief. I heard him weep for the second time in my life.
My father, Willlie Randle, was in Kansas City, and I was in New York, over a thousand miles away. For six months I struggled with how to comfort him, to provide any solace. Then sports swooped in.
For decades my dad, Uncle Phil and their crew of childhood friends would gather to watch the Kansas City Chiefs play football each Sunday. Knowing my uncle could not be there, I got tested, then booked a flight home to watch the September season-opening game on the couch by my father's side. It was, my family tells me, the happiest they had seen him since the tragedy.
Since that game with my father, I have hardly missed a chance to watch my beloved boys in red. In New York, I've attended outdoor socially distanced watch parties in Washington Heights with fellow Kansas Citians who were also missing their families back home; I've continued clacking out annoying but insanely self-satisfying pro-Chiefs tweets into the ether and joined others in cathartically laughing at the head coach Andy Reid's adorable struggle with a giant face shield.
I'm not supposed to say this. It hedges much of what I warned about in these pages just a few months ago regarding the dangers of holding N.F.L. games during the pandemic. But I have enjoyed, no -- I have needed -- the return of professional sports.
Pragmatism, science and common sense -- your head -- tells you that playing sports in a pandemic is a foolish idea. The heart says otherwise. It doesn't make sense, but what has this year?
If anything, this pandemic has proved just how deeply Americans misunderstood and misinterpreted one another, our sense of values and our beliefs. One of the things we've misunderstood is the depth of importance that sports, and the accompanying community of fandom, has in so many of our lives.
When I had the first anxiety attack of my life this summer, as I juggled reporting on the George Floyd protests and the pandemic's toll, I didn't have a therapist to call. I had the N.B.A. playoffs. I countered those days of fury and grief with nights of laughs with Shaquille O'Neal, Ernie Johnson Jr., Kenny Smith and Charles Barkley, the avuncular crew of "Inside the N.B.A."
I know -- from the internet and the group texts on my phone -- that I'm not alone in this. A college friend from Los Angeles, who, honestly, I am not sure was ever a baseball fan before this summer, called me, crying, when the Dodgers won the World Series in October.
"We needed this," he told me in between a mix of sobs and chest-lightening laughter.
I don't follow soccer much, but I could not help but be moved at the sight of Scottish players brought to tears after qualifying for the European Championship last month for the first time in a generation, or to relish the joy the feat brought their countrymen, seeing them high-fiving and dancing online.
I understand that to many this sounds silly, or offensive. Should we be celebrating goals and touchdowns when scientists warn we could be on the precipice of the pandemic's darkest days, when some weeks more Americans are dying each day from the coronavirus than on 9/11 or at Pearl Harbor? Should I be thinking less about home-field advantage and more about the nurses in hospitals or the grandparents in nursing homes?
"It is impossible to separate the emotional from the moral," Dr. Zachary Binney, an epidemiologist at Emory University, told me. The return of professional sports in America and abroad has ultimately contributed to the spread of the virus, Dr. Binney said, but there is room for nuance. "I try not to both sides things when I can, but here it is actually needed," he said.
While high school and collegiate sports continue to "cause outbreaks constantly," Dr. Binney says professional sports -- partly because of their vast infrastructures, resources and relatively small number of players -- have managed to effectively control the coronavirus.
"I don't think, except for baseball's outbreaks, which were tamped down quickly, that pro sports have created a substantially more dangerous environment for their players and staff than there would have been if the pandemic didn't happen," he told me. "For players and staff, sporting leagues have generally kept their infection rates below that of the general population."
I'd expected the M.L.B., the N.F.L., pro tennis, European club soccer and every other pro sports league that was not operating in a "bubble" environment to shut back down within the first few weeks. The question was not if pro sports would prove dangerous, but just how dangerous pro sports would be.
The answer, miraculously: not as dangerous as many thought.
In a year drenched in despair, the continuation of professional sports has been an essential respite and a reminder of the normalcy we yearn for.
And it got me thinking.
I don't want to sound like a sappy sports movie, because Americans are still as divided as ever and sports can't suddenly change that -- but as we begin to reach toward a semblance of normalcy in the coming months, I wonder if sports might give us an excuse to offer one another a little more grace.
I doubt the Kansas City liberals I grew up with and exurban Trump supporters in Missouri will set aside their differences if our fabled quarterback Patrick Mahomes wins another M.V.P. award at the end of this season.
But once the economy can safely, fully open, perhaps sports can supercharge our sense of community again.
I can't wait to return to John Brown Smokehouse in Queens, without my mask, to watch a Chiefs game next season over K.C.-style barbecue and beer. When I get there, will I appreciate my surroundings a bit more? Leave my phone alone and strike up an extra conversation? Embrace a stranger with more gusto after a touchdown? I think so. And no one should underestimate the strength "our bonds of affection" can have after a compatriot unlike yourself buys you a drink.
After all, I've had more than enough reason to look inward, frown or be upset this year.
In the summer of 2021, when many hope vaccinations will be widespread, we may all turn our eyes to Tokyo for an Olympics unlike any before. Historically the world's great unifying sporting event, its coming together of young talent and old nations will take on a new meaning, as the globe quite literally reunites.
We'll watch as athletes, perhaps without masks and in close proximity, some of them coronavirus survivors, march together, united in sport and struggle. If we pull it off, I expect the world will heave a collective sigh of relief.
Will we see sports differently after that? On the other side of this coronavirus misery, it may turn out that sports -- which have predominantly functioned as cherished but inessential extensions of leisure -- are recognized as more spiritually essential than we realized. And sporting competition, as old as society itself, may be remembered as the first manifestation of a world reborn and liberated.

Texto completo: Cities, you may have heard, are toast. The argument is straightforward and seemingly incontestable: The coronavirus thrives among close clusters of human beings, and nowhere are humans clustered closer than in big cities. The virus's toll seems to make the connection plain. New York City, the most populous and most dense urban area in the United States, was also the first to be devastated by the virus.
The pandemic will pass, but many fear that our response to Covid-19 may have ravaged urban economies for good. Lockdowns shuttered bars and turned restaurants into "ghost kitchens" whose primary patrons are overworked DoorDashers. The overnight shift to remote work obviated the need for office buildings and the vast economy that supports their workers, from public transit to corner stores. Online commerce, which had been decimating physical retailers for more than a decade, accelerated its crushing inevitability. Even cultural institutions seem at risk: If "Hamilton" didn't lose much in the translation from the Richard Rodgers Theater to Disney+, perhaps the end is nigh for Broadway, too.
Now that technology can shower us with many of the benefits of urban life while we laze about in giant exurban McMansions, why would we ever return to living and working so close together?
Here's one answer: because neither the United States nor the world can do without cities.
They are indispensable as engines of economic growth, catalysts of technological and cultural innovation -- and they are one of the most environmentally sustainable ways we know of for housing lots of people.
Not only are cities worth saving, they are also ripe for rebirth. The virus presents an opportunity to remake urban life for the better, particularly by addressing its inequities.
Already, the pandemic has prompted cities around the world to embrace once radical-seeming ideas. In car-free streets and permanent alfresco dining, a picture of a more livable city is emerging. But we can do a lot more than pedestrianize roads. In 2021 and beyond, we should make rebuilding our urban landscape a top priority.
Contrary to conventional wisdom, urban population density does not seem to have been the primary factor in the virus's spread -- note how Asian megacities like Hong Kong and Seoul combated the virus successfully, while many American rural areas suffered major outbreaks.
But in New York and other American cities, overcrowding within residences, caused by a lack of affordable housing, did exacerbate the contagion. So let's fix that: In addition to loosening our antiquated zoning rules, perhaps vacant office buildings and retail space can be turned into apartments, lowering the cost of housing.
This is also our chance to remake crumbling urban infrastructure -- to create more engaging outdoor public spaces and to radically improve public transportation.
Then there is climate change. Think of the coronavirus as a trailer for the horror flick of natural disasters to come. We have a chance to fortify urban space against future outbreaks of disease as well as the coming calamities caused by the changing weather -- we can even do both at the same time. For instance, reducing automobile traffic in cities will not just cut emissions that warm the climate. It will also clean up the toxic air that hangs over our most populous areas, and is thought to increase the risks of respiratory diseases, including susceptibility to Covid-19. More walkable and bikeable urban design is good for the environment and our health; a study of commuters in Britain showed that biking to work was associated with lower risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer.
What's important here aren't the specific ideas, but the larger push for civic revitalization. The coronavirus does not have to kill cities -- just our old idea of what cities were, how they worked, and who they were for.
Rethinking urban space in the aftermath of disease is hardly a new idea. If cities were going to be crushed by pestilence, they would have died millenniums ago. Disease has shaped the modern city, and the modern city has shaped disease.
The practice of epidemiology was born in the city, when John Snow, a London anesthesiologist, tracked the spread of cholera to a contaminated water pump in 1854. And much of the civic infrastructure we now take for granted -- public parks, garbage trucks, sewers -- was put in place partly to curb disease. Cities have overcome disease before, and they can do so again.
Yet at the moment, a grand project to rebuild American cities feels terribly elusive. Despite their economic and cultural importance, cities in the United States are often marginalized in politics and, more deeply, in our picture of how America should work. About 80 percent of Americans live in urban areas, but most say they'd rather live somewhere else.
Republicans use cities as a cudgel -- supposedly crime-ridden "Democrat cities" became a mantra for President Trump. Democrats depend on big cities and their surrounding suburbs for the bulk of their voters, but when was the last time you heard a national Democratic politician make a forceful case for the beauty, creativity and importance of cities -- for all that we owe to them, and all we may yet gain from them?
If we are to rebuild American cities after Covid-19, we must recognize their value and sing their praises. We must learn to love their bigness, their inherent chaos, and admit how bereft we would be without them.
"Cities were once the most helpless and devastated victims of disease, but they became great disease conquerors," wrote Jane Jacobs, the great urbanist, in "The Death And Life of Great American Cities."
Then she itemized their contributions: "All the apparatus of surgery, hygiene, microbiology, chemistry, telecommunications, public health measures, teaching and research hospitals, ambulances and the like, which people not only in cities but also outside them depend upon for the unending war against premature mortality, are fundamentally products of big cities and would be inconceivable without big cities."
Cities created the future. Now we must secure theirs.

Like so many people during these turbulent times, Leo Koloamatangi finds comfort in his routines. And so every Sunday and Monday — and in this upended NFL season, most Thursdays, plus the odd Tuesday and Wednesday — he has watched other people do what he loves most.
From his Southern California home, Koloamatangi, 26, cheers for his friends around the league and for his team, the New York Jets, longing to be on the sideline with the men he calls his brothers. He had a choice. He could have joined them, practiced with them, prepared with them, muddled through 13 losses with them before they got their first win.
But not this season.
Not during a pandemic that had already killed two close relatives when he made his decision; and not when he had a young daughter, Aurora; and when his wife, Athena, was in the early stages of pregnancy. Along with 67 other players, Koloamatangi, an offensive lineman, opted out before the NFL season, sacrificing career development and potential glory for his family’s well-being.
When Koloamatangi spoke with The New York Times in August, he called that decision the hardest of his life. In early December, he called this year his hardest as a football player. He also said he had no regrets.
“I have this overwhelming sense of accountability to my family and myself personally,” Koloamatangi said. “I’m very grateful that I can play in the NFL and compete at the highest level, and there’s nothing more that I’d want to do than satisfy my job. But because of what I must protect and who I have to look over and look after, my position was to sit out and watch the season play out.”
Amid growing restrictions in California, he has hunkered down. Koloamatangi wishes he could have had a large Polynesian party for Aurora’s first birthday last month, and he wonders what might have happened if he had not opted out.
Over three seasons, he had pinballed between the active rosters of the Detroit Lions and the Jets, never appearing in a regular-season game. He might have gotten his chance this season as practice squads expanded to 16 players from 12 to account for COVID-related roster shortfalls.
That is how Kendall Hinton, a practice-squad wide receiver for the Denver Broncos, got his first official NFL snaps, stepping in to play quarterback in a game against the New Orleans Saints after all four of the regular QBs were exposed to the coronavirus.
“There are lot of guys out there who have opportunities in front of them because of COVID,” Koloamatangi said. “Times like this, it’s great for players like that — and, quite honestly, players like me.”
As transmission rates surge across the country, the number of positive cases in the NFL has also swelled, but the season has continued, often in uncomfortable ways. Outbreaks rampaged through the Tennessee Titans and Baltimore Ravens, sickening not only players and staff members but also family members. And although most players who were infected have returned, at least two have endured serious complications: Buffalo tight end Tommy Sweeney, who has the heart condition myocarditis; and Jacksonville Jaguars running back Ryquell Armstead, who was reportedly hospitalized twice.
League officials have maintained that no evidence exists of players transmitting the virus on the field. But when Koloamatangi opted out, he fully expected to contract the virus, in part because his position requires nearly constant close contact in games and at practices.
“If somebody told me, ‘COVID’s going to have a huge impact on our schedule and our practicing and how we meet, but you and your family wouldn’t contract the virus,’ I think I would have went,” Koloamatangi said. “But because no one really had an answer, we didn’t know what to anticipate. There was no way for me to guarantee personal protection over my family.”
As per an agreement between the league and its players’ union, Koloamatangi received a $150,000 advance on next year’s salary — not a small sum of money, but a fraction of the $750,000 he would have made.
His family does not have an extravagant lifestyle — “We really only splurge on our kids,” he said — and has been able to manage the financial burden well enough.
He and his wife give each other time to themselves every day, and Koloamatangi often spends his in their garage. There, he recently installed a deluxe gym, replete with weight machines, a full power rack and a force plate; and he is confident that, after the longest offseason of his career, he will return a superior athlete. That soothes him.
He is not naive enough to think that his presence on the Jets would have prevented them from hurtling toward one of the worst seasons in franchise history. But, he said, he feels as responsible for their swoon as anyone on the roster.
So every week, when Koloamatangi watches the Jets play, he thinks about them and their families. He thinks about the pain they must be experiencing this season, and he thinks about how next season he hopes to see them again. Afterward, he sits with his wife and tells her how grateful he is for all their time together.
“I’m just looking at her like, ‘I wish I could be there. I need to be there,’” Koloamatangi said. “It’s something that I’m definitely excited to rekindle once I get back. But it’s hard, you know?”

ROME — Wine turned white with crushed fava beans. A soupy concoction of snails, sheep and fish.
If these do not sound particularly appetizing today, they appear to have been all the rage in ancient Pompeii, as evidenced by ancient leftovers found during excavations this month at the archaeological site of the former Roman city. They were found in a thermopolium — or snack bar — serving street food popular in A.D. 79.
Two years after it was first partly unearthed, archaeologists began to excavate the interior of the shop this October. In December, they found food and drink residue that is expected to provide fresh clues about the ancient population’s culinary tastes.
The work offers “another insight into daily life at Pompeii” and represents the “first time an area of this type has been excavated in its entirety” and analyzed with modern technology, Massimo Osanna, the departing director of the Archaeological Park of Pompeii, said in a statement Saturday.
Human life in Pompeii came to an abrupt halt nearly 2,000 years ago, when Mount Vesuvius spilled tons of lapilli, ash and rock onto the ancient Roman city, preserving it in time. Over the centuries, Pompeii became a powerful symbol of the transience of life and human impotence when nature unleashes its power.
Since excavations began in 1748, fragments of that ancient civilization have continued to emerge, providing clues to archaeologists and historians on how residents may have lived, dressed and eaten. About 80 thermopolii have been found at Pompeii, where residents could choose their edibles from containers set into street-front counters.
The one excavated this month included a large dolium, or earthenware vessel, that had contained wine.
“It was full of lapilli, and removing them released a very intense aroma of wine,” said Teresa Virtuoso, the archaeologist overseeing the team excavating the site. “It was so strong we could smell it through our masks.”
Although the archaeological park has been closed for part of this year because of the pandemic, excavations have continued, with archaeologists taking precautions.
In another dolium, they found the skeletal remains of a mouse, suggesting that the vessel might have contained grains of some kind and that the mouse — like the residents of ancient Pompeii — fell victim to the eruption, Virtuoso said.
The contents of two other jars remain to be analyzed, but Chiara Corbino, the archaeozoologist involved in the dig, said it appeared that they contained two kinds of dishes: a pork and fish combination found “in other contexts at Pompeii,” and a concoction involving snails, fish and sheep, perhaps a soup or stew. Further analysis is expected to determine whether vegetables were part of the ancient recipe.
“We will analyze the contents to determine the ingredients and better understand what kind of dish it was,” she said. For now, she thinks the thermopolium probably served a stew or soup that included “all these animals together.”
The remains of at least two people were also found inside the shop. Archaeologists believe that tomb robbers moved the bones in the 17th century, because the skeletons found this month were not intact.
Culture Minister Dario Franceschini said Saturday that the excavations at Pompeii continued to deliver “extraordinary discoveries.”
“Today, Pompeii is indicated in the world as an example of protection and management,” he said in a statement. Last month, Italian officials presented another new find: the remains of two of the original city dwellers.
The documentary division of the national broadcaster Rai has followed the excavations at Pompeii over the past three years. Its documentary will be shown nationally Sunday and will be available to international audiences online.
Valeria Amoretti, the anthropologist who heads Pompeii’s applied research laboratory, described the thermopolium as “a complex environment” that provides information that “had never been detected at Pompeii.”
It also exemplifies the high quality of decoration in the ancient city. Painted panels on the front of a Z-shaped counter included a central image of a Nereid, the mythological sea nymph, riding a sea horse, along with frescoes of a rooster, ducks being prepared for cooking and a chained dog. There was also a painted image of a thermopolium, complete with amphora and jars.
The frame of the collared dog includes an unusual piece of graffiti: an unprintable slur — or joke — against one of the employees or the owner of the shop.
Osanna, the site’s director, said in an interview Saturday that work on the thermopolium was expected to finish by March. He hoped to make the site available to visitors by Easter, he said, coronavirus permitting.
At the same time, Osanna said, visitors will also be able to see the restoration site of the “House of the Silver Wedding,” which he described as “one of the site’s most beautiful houses.”

RUMBUR, Pakistan — In a remote valley in northern Pakistan, hemmed in by sheer rock walls and high pastures, members of a tiny community gathered.
The Kalash are a group of about 4,000 people who live in the mountains of the Hindu Kush, where they practice an ancient polytheistic faith. Each year, they come together for Chawmos, a New Year festival that coincides with the winter solstice and is marked by dance, animal sacrifice and highly prescribed roles for men and women.
The two-week festival is a portrait in contrasts: snow and fire, solemn ritual and frenzied activity, gender segregation and public flirtation, community and isolation.
While the coronavirus has forced the world to adopt social distancing, the Kalash have practiced being a community in isolation for millennia.
The Kalash, whose wooden houses cling to the craggy hillsides of three valleys in Pakistan’s often unruly northwest, are the country’s smallest minority group. The overwhelming majority of Pakistan’s more than 200 million people practice Islam.
Despite the seclusion of the Kalash, the outside world has crept closer, bringing changes to their way of life.
Their faith is often compared to an ancient form of Hinduism, but the origins of the Kalash are a mystery. Some believe they are descended from the forces of Alexander the Great; other anthropologists contend they are migrants from nearby Afghanistan.
Their religion incorporates animistic traditions of worshipping nature as well as a pantheon of gods, whose members in some instances bear resemblances to the Vedic gods of ancient India. Chief among the Kalash gods is Balumain, the lord of heaven, to whom the festival is dedicated.
For the Kalash, cleanliness and holiness are inextricably linked. Areas of the villages and valleys where they live are designated “pure,” and access to them is sometimes restricted by gender or may first require a ritual bath. The Kalash believe places and people are most likely to be visited by Balumain only after they have been cleaned and sanctified.
During the year, Kalash women must bathe and wash their clothes and dishes away from their homes. During their periods and when they give birth, they stay in menstruation huts. These are community spaces that are the exclusive domain of women, unlike the huts found elsewhere in the region, including in Nepal, where women are left alone and die from exposure and other causes every year.
As the Chawmos festival begins each December, the women take part in a purification ritual. Held in a temple, known as a jestekan, or in an open space away from their homes, women and girls hold bread that has been baked for them by male family members.
A male relative then showers them with water and waves burning juniper branches over their heads. Only then can women pass freely between the valley’s villages and homes to take part in the festivities.
In the lead-up to the holiday, the men grind flour at a communal mill and bake their loaves at home or in the jestekan. The women gather at a bath house, where they wash their vibrantly colored dresses and wrap their hair in long braids.
In order to stay and witness the festival unfold last year, I joined the women of a family with whom I was staying in their purification ritual. I watched as, one by one, they stepped forward to be encircled by a trail of flame.
At the start of Chawmos, the crisp winter air is filled with the scent of fresh baked bread and burning juniper, and neighbors greet one another with baskets of fruits and nuts.
What follows is 14 days of song, dance and ceremony. A group of women, often from the same family or clan, will form a circle and begin singing and dancing, their arms intertwined and their eyes half-closed in prayer. As the women sing, other women and men join the ring, and the circle grows larger and louder.
When moved, a young woman will break from the group and dance in the middle of the circle. Sometimes, a woman or a man from her family will join her. But often, a young man will enter the ring to dance with her. Their dance is different: The couple face one another, their eyes locked. They are courting.
In the first days of the celebration, young people often find a spouse; the women often make the first move.
“The girl goes to the boy’s family maybe for a few weeks or a month, and then when she comes back home, they will get married,” said Bibi Jan, a woman of about 80. “ No one else decides; it is up to them what they choose.”
The dancing, as well as the flirting, is fueled by locally brewed mulberry wine. The role of women and the consumption of wine in the community contrast with the mores of their Muslim neighbors, who sometimes attend the festivals as tourists.
“The way they worship and the way men and women marry — and just interact generally — is very different from surrounding communities,” said Wynne Maggi, an anthropologist who has studied the Kalash.
The festival, the most important of the year, is also a time for the Kalash’s local leadership to deliberate over the serious challenges facing the culture.
The Kalash find themselves increasingly squeezed by outsiders buying up land and moving in. And for many years, the Kalash have been wary about the threat from Islamic militants who see their faith as sacrilege.
They face environmental threats as well. The trees that protected the valleys from floods caused by rain and glacial melt are being removed, sometimes illegally, at an alarming rate. The dearth of trees and changes to weather patterns resulting from global warming has resulted in recent years in devastating flash floods that destroy homes, bridges and crops.
Younger members are leaving the area for greater educational and employment opportunities. Government schools all teach about Islam, and each year some young Kalash decide to convert, locals say. A new road has made access to the area easier, and tourists are increasingly visiting the Kalash valleys, where most people exist largely on a mixture of subsistence farming and livestock husbandry.
Saifullah, a Kalash leader, who goes by only one name, said his biggest concern was outsiders buying land to build hotels in an effort to court tourists.
The hotels are often on or near land considered sacred to the Kalash, and the Muslim-owned accommodations are seen as depriving the community of tourist dollars, which has led to resentments.
“The Kalash will never finish,” said Saifullah, 61. “But of course the population is going down if they can’t get enough land to stay here.”
Aslam Baig, 29, who returned to the valley from Lahore, where he works, said many young people have left to find work.
“It’s very hard because we don’t have internet, we don’t have newspapers, and then you have to go to cities to find out about the jobs,” he said.
But during the Chawmos celebrations, many of these problems are momentarily forgotten.
The festival culminates with a late-night torch procession through the tiny villages in the Kalash valleys; flickering lights weave down through forests, heralding the start of a final evening of dancing. The hillsides echo with song.
The Kalash dance around a bonfire, linking arms and chanting prayers for the year ahead.

Texto completo: His unarmed bomber was caught in the thick of Japan's attack. He went on to fly some 80 missions in World War II and to become a record-setting test pilot.
Robert Thacker, who found himself caught in the middle of Japan's surprise attack on Pearl Harbor when he was piloting an unarmed B-17 bomber to Hawaii for refueling, but managed to make a hair-raising landing and went on to a distinguished flying career in war and peace, died on Nov. 25 at his home in San Clemente, Calif. He was 102.
Mr. Thacker's daughter, Barbara Thacker, confirmed his death to The New York Times on Friday. She said she had not provided confirmation until last week to The San Clemente Times, which published an obituary on Thursday.
Lieutenant Thacker, who arrived on the island of Oahu as Japanese warplanes devastated the American naval base there, would soon be dropping bombs of his own. He flew some 80 missions during World War II, seeing action in both the Pacific and European theaters. He later became a record-setting test pilot and flew in the Korean and Vietnam wars.
But it was on the morning of Dec. 7, 1941, that he faced his first test in battle.
His plane was among a flight of newly built B-17s arriving from California en route to the Philippines. As he began his descent to the Army Air Corps' Hickam Field, at first unaware of anything amiss, he was astonished to see bombers and fighters roaming the skies and black smoke rising from the American base and adjoining military installations.
One of the fighters shot out the front landing gear of his Flying Fortress as he approached the runway. But he careened to a landing and led his crew to a swamp alongside the runway to escape the inferno.
In February 1947, about 18 months after Japan surrendered, he was back at Hickam Field, this time to make aviation history. Now a lieutenant colonel, he piloted a North American Aviation P-82 fighter plane on the first nonstop flight from Hawaii to New York City in what remains the longest nonstop flight, 5,051 miles, ever made by a propeller-driven fighter, according to the National Museum of the United States Air Force, near Dayton, Ohio.
Developed at the end of World War II, the twin-fuselage, twin-propeller P-82 had been envisioned as a long-range escort for the giant B-29 Superfortresses on missions to Japan. The fighter had two cockpits, one for the pilot and the other for the co-pilot/navigator, so they could take turns flying. But the war was over before the P-82 was combat ready.
Early in the Cold War, the P-82 was viewed by the Pentagon as a potential escort in the event bombers like the B-29 were called upon to attack the Soviet Union. The pioneering test flight by Colonel Thacker and his co-pilot, Lt. John Ard, provided evidence that the fighter could carry out such a mission.
During the 14½-hour flight from Hickam, a mechanical glitch prevented the plane from jettisoning three empty fuel tanks, and the P-82 fought drag from the unwanted weight and strong headwinds. By the time it touched down, it had only enough fuel left for another 30 minutes of flight.
But Colonel Thacker handled his plane with aplomb. The P-82, named Betty Jo after his wife, landed at La Guardia Field in Queens shortly after 11 a.m. on Feb. 28, 1947, greeted by a host of reporters and news photographers and hundreds of onlookers.
Since "nothing else happened in the world that day," he told the Arrowhead Club, a California military research organization, in a 2014 interview, "I was front-page news." The New York Times ran its own Page 1 article on the flight and an editorial hailing the Army Air Forces' growing readiness for postwar combat. It viewed the flight as providing "further proof of how rapidly the globe is shrinking."
Robert Eli Thacker was born on Feb. 21, 1918, in El Centro, Calif., one of three children of Percie and Margaret (Eadie) Thacker.
When he was 8, his father, who owned a moving company, bought him a kit to build a twin-pusher model plane, a craft with two propellers that rides air currents with the aim of achieving maximum distance in competitions.
"I was hooked on aviation from that age on," he recalled in the 2014 interview.
He attended a two-year community college in El Centro, hoping to become an aeronautical engineer. But his family did not have the money for him to complete a four-year college education, so in 1939 he joined what was then known as the Army Air Corps. He received his wings as a lieutenant in June 1940.
He flew World War II bombing missions out of New Guinea, Italy and England. He later joined the nation's leading test pilots in experimental flights over California's high desert at Muroc Army Air Field in California, later renamed Edwards Air Force Base.
In addition to flying B-17 Flying Fortresses in World War II, Colonel Thacker piloted Superfortresses in the Korean War and high-altitude missions in the Vietnam War.
The P-82 (renamed the F-82) flew combat missions in the Korean War, when it was given radar capability, but jet fighters soon rendered it obsolete.
Mr. Thacker retired from the Air Force as a full colonel in 1970. His awards included two Silver Stars and three Distinguished Flying Crosses.
He was later an adviser to the aviation industry and pursued his hobby of flying radio-controlled model planes.
Mr. Thacker's daughter is his only survivor. His wife, Betty Jo (Smoot) Thacker, died in 2011.
Although the record-setting propeller fighter that Colonel Thacker flew has faded into obscurity, it has not been entirely forgotten.
That silver plane is on display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force, inscribed "Betty Jo" in red script.

Texto completo: The magenta glow of an exhibition outside the Guggenheim Museum, whose white spiral was off-limits to art lovers. The deserted grand staircase of a Metropolitan Opera silenced by the pandemic, its Sputnik chandeliers with no crowds to illuminate. Movie buffs, barred from cinemas, enjoying films at least semi-communally at a drive-in.
Yes, there was absence and apartness and pain as this most socially distant of years upended art and culture. But with hindsight, 2020 had many other things to say, too, as this selection of some of our favorite arts photography published this year by The New York Times makes clear.
Photographers for The New York Times captured it all, relying on their P.P.E. as well as their light meters and lenses to bring us not just the year's pain but also its pleasures, with glimpses of much-needed triumphs and life-affirming beauty. Have a look.
"I wanted to make an image that spoke to the quiet tension of being confined to a small space with your loved one. Little did I know, many of us would soon be experiencing this intensity of closeness during the pandemic."
-- Philip Montgomery on photographing Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick in February
"It was a trip to a parallel reality -- one I long for -- where the boundaries of gender disappear and freedom finally arises."
-- Camila Falquez on photographing Manuel Liñán and his dance company
"Chris wasn't the only person in the pool fully clothed. To get the shot, I got in there with him and happily rode back to the city sopping wet."
-- Dana Scruggs on photographing Chris Rock
"Looking back, it's hard to believe that this image is from 2020. It felt like a meditation."
-- Sasha Arutyunova on photographing a dance rehearsal in February
'The New Saturday Night'
Saturday night is a time of mythic potential and mundane reality. It's a fantasy space that only opens at the height of the weekend. We asked 33 photographers to show us the world on the weekend. What they found was the new Saturday night .
"I loved sitting in on the intimacy of Jane getting into her character in the silence and calmness before the show begins."
-- Yael Malka on photographing Jane Alexander
"She was leaning on an aluminum foil spaceship that her kids made. The shiny blue Emoji pillow in the background matched her outfit."
-- Rosie Marks on photographing Róisín Murphy
"He came into the shoot just loaded with energy and had such intense charisma. You can see how his exuberant personality is channeled into his movies."
-- Philip Montgomery on photographing Martin Scorsese
"I had an idea to shoot Jerry pressed up against glass, that goofy old trick that makes a portrait look trapped in a frame, only it would be Seinfeld trapped in the TV. So I said 'Jerry, do you have any indoor windows,' imagining a French door or something along those lines. He looked at me like I was out of my mind for a long second and said, in the world's Seinfeldy-est voice, 'What?! All windows are indoors!' Click. After that he muted me. Perfection."
-- Daniel Arnold on photographing Jerry Seinfeld via FaceTime
"It allowed me to meet some incredible artists from the African continent and to photograph them in a town that is so linked to the old South Africa."
-- Kent Andreasen on photographing the first Stellenbosch Triennale
"I loved her playfulness and warm charisma."
-- Ana Cuba on photographing Jessie Ware
"As soon as I walked into that salon on Doyers Street, I was transported to my childhood. This woman with curlers in her hair feels like a time capsule of old Chinatown, yet the mask reminds us that it's 2020."
-- Alex Lau on photographing Chinatown
"I immediately felt the epic-ness of her way of seeing in this world."
-- Aubrey Trinnaman on photographing Mary Lovelace O'Neal

In our Sources of Self Regard feature, The Times asked Black photographers to reflect on America with their self-portraits. "Being a visual artist is the ultimate resistance to invisibility," said Carlos Javier Ortiz, one of the project's contributors.
"I thought about the concept of time, and what it meant to have time in today's world, and specifically at the beginning of lockdown."
-- Tania Franco Klein on photographing the experience of watching the film "1900"
"On the calm residential street where her studio was located, Jehnny stood out like a sore thumb. Her neighbor peered out the balcony, but seemed just as unperturbed as she was."
-- Maxime La on photographing Jehnny Beth
"I chased after his hands, imagining them like strokes of a painter's touch."
-- Mustafah Abdulaziz on photographing Roderick Cox

"I knew immediately I wanted to find the quiet and intimacy within their relationship."
-- Ryan Pfluger on photographing Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn
"The sidewalks were silent, there was no traffic, and the majority of shops and businesses were closed. It was incredible to be able to appreciate the city without the rush of people, but at the same time terrifying when you stopped to think of why it was so quiet."
-- Vincent Tullo on photographing the financial district during lockdown

-- Andre D. Wagner on photographing Spike Lee
'The Take'
In our visual series The Take , we asked photographers to explore this year's cultural themes, capturing the everyday and the surreal.

-- Sasha Arutyunova on photographing "Afterwardsness"
"The last time I photographed her she was pregnant, and this year I got to meet her son, Gene, through Zoom!"
-- Heather Sten on photographing Amy Schumer
"A nice thing about a crowded city is that things eventually tend to line up if you pay attention long enough."
-- Daniel Arnold on photographing Times Square after Broadway's shutdown
"This is the only image I had in mind coming into the shoot. I wanted the viewer to feel close and personal to him."
-- Victor Llorente on photographing David Letterman
"Seeing the students push regardless of what's available to them really inspired me."
-- Stephen Tayo on photographing the Leap of Dance Academy
"I look back on this image now and it makes me miss Broadway and what made it so magical."

-- Jeenah Moon on photographing the Guggenheim's "Countryside" exhibition
"The hospitals and morgues were filling up, but the flowers at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden were undeterred."
-- Bryan Derballa on photographing the Brooklyn Botanic Garden
"With their Halloween masks on, this moment between my wife and son went from quiet and tender to frightful and strange -- but still the gentleness of the relationship shone through."
-- Landon Nordeman on photographing his family wearing horror masks
"When I arrived, the makeshift stage in their parking lot exuded this sense of joy that I hadn't experienced in a couple of months."
-- Jared Soares on photographing N'Ferno Performing Arts Center recital
"I wanted the image to be reminiscent of a Walker Evans portrait. The kind where the sun casts a heavy shadow on the face but you can see the personality of the subject in the shadows."
-- Jake Michaels on photographing Jesse Plemons
"Five minutes after I shot this photo, a roaring thunderstorm rolled in with winds so strong it knocked out the power."
-- Daniel Dorsa on photographing the Warwick Drive-In
"It was the first time either of us had really interacted with someone in public since Covid-19 hit, so it became a strange collaboration of what would normally be an ordinary situation."
-- Ryan Pfluger on photographing Mike Hadreas
"We fell into a collaborative rhythm and appreciated the opportunity to work on something that felt a bit more abstract and playful during a time of so much uncertainty."
-- Cait Oppermann and Yael Malka on photographing horror masks
"You can see Bob Ross's influence lasting and repeating throughout different generations and people from all walks of life. It was funny to see Bob adjusting Bob's hair as if in an infinity mirror."
-- Evan Jenkins on photographing the "Bob Ross Experience"
"I made a joke about needing to work on my directing skills as a photographer and he replied, 'Oh, don't worry about it, directors have no clue what they're ever talking about."'
-- Mark Mahaney on photographing Francis Ford Coppola
"Usually, photo shoots at the Met Opera are pretty hectic but on this occasion, I had no one rushing me. I had access to most of the building and went into rooms I would have never thought of."
-- Victor Llorente on photographing the Metropolitan Opera
"In a time of isolation, being able to move my body and to see myself was a powerful way of coming back to life."
-- Camila Falquez on trying Merce Cunningham's solo "50 Looks"
"You don't always get to make a connection with someone with such a packed schedule, but Antonio really let me in."
-- Ryan Lowry on photographing Antonio Banderas
"We went to a vacant lot, unpacked copious amounts of glitter, wigs and other rainbow paraphernalia, and then just let Mark do his thing."
-- Daniel Jack Lyons on photographing Mark Kanemura
"The sun was blazing and Jeff just closed his eyes and threw his head back. He said that staring at a bright light through closed eyelids was John Wayne's technique for not squinting under bright Hollywood lights."
-- Evan Jenkins on photographing Jeff Daniels
"There are obvious limitations without physically being present for a portrait session as there is no sense of periphery and there is no real engagement with the subject but I was able to make it feel as though I was there as much as possible."
-- Devin Oktar Yalkin on photographing Howardena Pindell
"I'm on a step stool, half in a bush, photographing a New York City Ballet principal through an open window, thinking, 'How did I get here?"'
-- Kim Raff on photographing Megan Fairchild
"The power of this picture is that it looks like she is being swallowed alive. The success of this dance and this setting is that it forces us to consider the extraordinary losses as a result of the pandemic."
-- Sara Krulwich on photographing Eiko Otake
"I went door to door on our block to warn folks that they might hear some screaming coming from our yard that afternoon, and not to worry since it's a portrait photo shoot, no one is getting murdered. The reactions were hilarious; one neighbor actually bent over he was laughing so hard."
-- Maggie Shannon on photographing Susan Boyajian

Duke Women's Team Cuts Its Season Short Over Safety Concerns in the Pandemic

Texto completo: The team is the first Power Five basketball team to start and stop its season because of the pandemic. The men's basketball team is expected to continue playing.
The women's basketball program at Duke University will end its season early, the team announced Friday, because of mounting coronavirus concerns. It's the first Power Five basketball team to start and stop its season because of the pandemic.
"The student-athletes on the Duke women's basketball team have made the difficult decision to conclude their current season due to safety concerns," Michael Schoenfeld, the chief communications officer for the school in Durham, N.C., said in the announcement.
All other Duke sports were expected to continue as usual, following recommend safety protocols, he added.
The women's team, which had a 3-1 record, had initially suspended operations on Dec. 16 after two members of its traveling party tested positive for the virus, requiring contact tracing. The Blue Devils consequently postponed games against North Carolina State and the University of North Carolina Wilmington; the program had already postponed a game against the University of Miami because of contact tracing concerns. It was scheduled to play Louisville next week.
Kara Lawson, Duke's first-year head coach, had said after a game against Louisville this month that she did not think the team should be playing during the pandemic. "That's my opinion on it," she said.
Other conferences and sports have postponed games or suspended seasons during the pandemic. College football completed the regular season despite several postponements, cancellations and personnel switches. The Ivy League canceled its winter sports and delayed its spring seasons in November. And a New York Times analysis published in early December showed that at least 6,600 college athletes, coaches and other personnel had tested positive for the coronavirus.
Duke's announcement comes as coronavirus cases climb throughout the United States; in North Carolina, there has been a steady daily average of over 5,500 new cases per day for the past few weeks, according to a New York Times database.
The 2021 Division I women's basketball tournament is expected to tip off in March in one region to limit travel and hopefully mitigate the virus' spread, with the N.C.A.A. eyeing San Antonio and the surrounding area. The men's Division I tournament is also expected to be held in one region this spring, with the N.C.A.A. announcing in November that it was talking with officials in Indianapolis.
The 2020 men's and women's tournaments were among the first major sporting events in the United States to be canceled as the pandemic worsened last March.

Texto completo: Picture the North American major sports leagues in the 1990s: The players were mostly people of color, but the coaches, managers and team owners were almost all white. A snapshot today looks mostly the same.
Despite a handful of initiatives meant to increase diversity in the leadership of sports organizations, coaching and management roles have mostly gone to white candidates in the past 30 years, according to a New York Times analysis of data from The Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sports.
The data calls into question whether the policies work effectively. It also shows a gap between what sports organizations say publicly about race and how they operate internally. Even as organizations have shown little progress in diversifying their leaders, many have made splashy declarations co-opting the causes of their athletes, namely pledging to combat systemic racial injustices in the United States.
The data used in this analysis, which comes from five leagues, is self-reported by teams and league offices. The information is voluntary, based on how individuals identify themselves, and in some instances does not account for people who may identify with two or more races. As a result, some of the data is incomplete and may be imprecise. The percentages used in this analysis have been adjusted to account for a small number of people who did not respond to the surveys in each league.
The analysis includes data from the N.F.L., the W.N.B.A., Major League Soccer, the N.B.A., and Major League Baseball. The N.H.L. is not included because it only recently started working with the institute, based at the University of Central Florida. In 1921, the year after the National Football League was formed under a different name, Jim Thorpe and Frederick Douglass "Fritz" Pollard became its first coaches of color, said Joe Horrigan, former executive director of professional football's hall of fame. Pollard was the only Black head coach in the N.F.L. until 1989, when Art Shell took over the Los Angeles Raiders.
Tony Dungy and Herm Edwards were the only Black head coaches in the 32-team league in 2002, when a study found that Black coaches were less likely to be hired and more likely to be fired than their white counterparts, even when they won a higher percentage of games (Dungy himself was fired by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers after a playoff appearance in the 2001 season and was hired by the Indianapolis Colts eight days later).
Under pressure from players and advocates, the N.F.L. adopted the Rooney Rule in 2003. The rule, named for the late Pittsburgh Steelers owner Dan Rooney and which has since been expanded, required teams to interview at least one nonwhite candidate for head coaching positions. Businesses within sports and beyond have looked to the rule as an example as they developed their own hiring practices.
But the rule does not require teams to hire nonwhite candidates once they conduct those interviews, and their coaches, managers and top executives have remained mostly white. At any given time, the league has had as many as eight nonwhite head coaches (a number it first reached in 2011) but that has since dipped, according to the data.
In 2020, the N.F.L. started the season with four coaches who identified as nonwhite (three as Black, one as Latino), meaning that 13 percent of head coaches were people of color. Almost 74 percent of the players who disclosed their race in the survey were people of color.
Among the five leagues that submit data to The Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport, the N.F.L. had the biggest discrepancy between the percentage of head coaches and the percentage of players who were nonwhite: a difference of 61 percentage points.
A 2019 study by the Arizona State University Global Sport Education and Research Lab showed that Black coaches were hired at older ages, had much more playing experience and did not get second chances at the same rate as white coaches. "When African American head coaches have been fired in the N.F.L., it has been more difficult for them, as compared to white and Latino American head coaches, to obtain another head coaching position at the same level," the study said.
When that study was published, 12 of the N.F.L.'s franchises had only hired white head coaches since the N.F.L. merged with the American Football League in 1970. Ron Rivera was hired by the Washington Football Team on Dec. 31, 2019, dropping that total to 11. If the Atlanta Falcons hire interim head coach Raheem Morris and the Houston Texans -- a much newer franchise than Washington or Atlanta -- do the same with Romeo Crennel, that total will be nine.

The N.F.L. updated its rules this year to apply its interview standards to more front office positions and to require teams to interview at least two nonwhite external candidates, up from one, for head coaching vacancies. It also required at least one nonwhite candidate to be interviewed for coordinator positions and senior football operations roles, to boost diversity beyond the playing field.
"We're focusing on getting more Black candidates in coaching -- especially for quarterbacks and coaches on the offensive side of the ball, since those positions tend to have a higher chance of ascending to the head coach level," said Samantha Rapoport, the N.F.L.'s senior director of diversity and inclusion.
This August, 100 years after the N.F.L.'s inception, Jason Wright became the first Black team president when he was hired by the Washington Football Team amid a broader overhaul within the organization. Two N.F.L. team presidents are Asian, according to the data: Paraag Marathe of the San Francisco 49ers and Kim Pegula of the Buffalo Bills. The Jets' Hymie Elhai identified as Hispanic. The rest are white. The W.N.B.A. had almost as high of a disparity between the percentage of players and head coaches who were nonwhite as the N.F.L in 2019, the most recent year for which data was available. Three out of 12 head coaches were people of color compared with 119 out of 144 players: a difference of 58 percentage points. All three coaches of color were Black.
Compared with the racial makeup of the U.S. population, however, the W.N.B.A. has the best marks among the North American professional leagues in the analysis for Black coaches. Twenty-five percent of the league's head coaches were Black and 13.4 percent of the U.S. population was Black, according to the United States Census Bureau. The only other league with representation that exceeded 13.4 percent was the N.B.A., for which 23 percent of head coaches identified as Black. The N.F.L. trails at just above 9 percent.

Richard Lapchick, the director of The Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sports, praised the W.N.B.A. for its diversity compared with the U.S. population. He determines the grades for his annual Racial and Gender Report Cards based on how closely the racial makeup of each league compares with society at large.
"The W.N.B.A. is the best period -- consistently when you look at any category," Lapchick said.
Percentage of each racial group in the W.N.B.A.The W.N.B.A. is often described as one of the most diverse sports leagues. But the racial imbalance between players and management has changed little over the past decade.
But the W.N.B.A. lacks representation across all races. Only two individuals who did not identify as white or Black have held a role of assistant coach, head coach or general manager since 1998, the league's second season. An assistant coach hired in 1998 identified as Asian; another assistant coach in 2019 identified as "other." ("Other" includes individuals who identified as Native American, Pacific Islander, Native Hawaiian or Alaskan and, in later years, biracial, depending on the league.)
And there are no female head coaches of color in the W.N.B.A. since the Indiana Fever parted with Dana "Pokey" Chatman last year.
Neither the W.N.B.A. nor N.B.A. have a guideline like the N.F.L.'s Rooney Rule.
"We need to work with the teams more when there are openings, like a general manager or a head coach, that they're looking at all candidates, including diverse candidates, in a very constructive way," W.N.B.A. Commissioner Cathy Engelbert said before the 2020 finals. Despite Lapchick's praise for the W.N.B.A., Major League Soccer actually had a higher percentage of head coaches who are people of color than any of the five leagues we assessed: 41 percent in 2020. It also had the smallest disparity between head coaches and players of color. And M.L.S. players make up one of the most racially diverse sets of athletes.
M.L.S. matches census data for the number of white coaches. Just over 59 percent of coaches identified as white while 60 percent of the U.S. identified as white. Other leagues had a much higher complement of white coaches.
This is largely because a high percentage of M.L.S. head coaches identified as Hispanic or Latino in 2020 -- 29.6 percent, compared with 18.5 percent of the U.S. population who identified as Hispanic or Latino.
Few players are Black and even fewer managers identify as Black. Data shows that no Black coaches were hired between 2013 and 2018; Robin Fraser changed that in 2019 when the Colorado Rapids hired him.
M.L.S. has had a Coaching Diversity Initiative since 2007, which is similar to the Rooney Rule. This October, the league announced a commitment to increase Black representation in management. In consultation with its new diversity committee, the league intends to create "policies and an educational ecosystem to increase Black representation in executive and sporting positions at the league office, the member clubs and other North American soccer organizations," the announcement said.

One leader pushing for more executives of color is Ali Curtis, Toronto F.C.'s general manager, who became the league's first Black sporting director at the end of 2014 for the New York Red Bulls. (Sporting directors are equivalent to general managers in this data.)
Curtis acknowledged that inclusion in M.L.S. has improved since he played in the early 2000s, but said there is more to be done.
"I'm incredibly fortunate that I am where I am," he said in a phone interview. "I know that I have to open that door for other people. And I have to work as hard as possible and be as successful as possible so that there's more than just me out there." Just as athletes in the W.N.B.A. and other sports leagues have for years, N.B.A. players have championed social justice initiatives in several highly visible forms recently. This summer, the Milwaukee Bucks sparked a walkout across American pro sports this summer by refusing to play after the police shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man in Kenosha, Wis.
While the N.B.A. has co-opted its players' protests, it has not adopted a hiring strategy like the N.F.L. or M.L.S. As of July, about 30 percent of N.B.A. head coaches from the 2020 season identified as people of color, while 83 percent of players identified as nonwhite.

The N.B.A. has a training program called the Coaches Equality Initiative, but it does not specify guidelines for racial inclusion. It also has a Global Inclusion Council, which recommends inclusion strategies for the N.B.A. and W.N.B.A., offering guidance on policies, benchmarks and "serves as a catalyst for diversity and inclusion efforts worldwide."
"We've looked at what might be an equivalent to a Rooney-type rule in the N.B.A. and I'm not sure it makes sense," Commissioner Adam Silver said in a media address before the 2020 N.B.A. Finals.
Conversation about the N.B.A.'s hiring policies reignited when Steve Nash, in his own words, did "skip the line" when he became head coach of the Brooklyn Nets without any coaching experience. Nash, who is white, is a Hall of Famer recognized as one of the greatest point guards in professional basketball history. Sean Marks, the team's general manager said he hired Nash for his name, record and ties to players.
Choosing him over the team's interim coach, Jacque Vaughn, who is Black and had experience as a head coach, renewed questions about the league's lack of structure for interviewing nonwhite candidates, a standard practice in several other leagues. A lot of league reshuffling of head coaches has occurred since then: Now there are nine head coaches of color.

The N.B.A. has seven Black head coaches, one Latino head coach (James Borrego of the Charlotte Hornets) and one Asian head coach (Erik Spoelstra of the Miami Heat). Five general managers were Black and two identified as "other" through July 2020.
Spoelstra, who is of Filipino descent, became the first Asian American coach in one of the "Big Four" North American leagues in 2008. In fact, a lack of Asian players in most major pro sports led to a disproportionate number of leaders who identify as Asian compared with athletes, especially in the N.F.L, M.L.S. and N.B.A.
Still, Asian Americans were underrepresented in all five leagues compared with the population of the United States, according to census data. Much like other leagues, M.L.B. has had players who identified as African American, Latino and Native American since its founding years, according to the league's historian, John Thorn. Despite some early firsts, similar opportunities were not afforded to upper level staff until much later: Frank Robinson became baseball's first Black manager in 1975, nearly 30 years after Jackie Robinson broke the color line after playing in the Negro leagues. (In baseball, head coaches are called "managers," and assistant coaches are called "coaches.")
"I don't think I was hired because I was Black," Frank Robinson, who died in 2019, told The New York Times when he was hired. "I hope not. I think I've been hired because of my ability."

Baseball has the Selig Rule, which requires teams to consider nonwhite candidates when hiring for several specific management roles. The guidance proposed in 1999 by Bud Selig, a former league commissioner, hasn't changed since its inception. The number of general managers, managers and coaches of color hasn't changed much either.
It has by far the smallest percentage of players (40 percent) and the second smallest percentage of managers (20 percent) who identified as people of color as of January 2020, making baseball the whitest of the sports surveyed. Since the data was compiled, the White Sox' Rick Renteria, who is Latino, was replaced by Tona La Russa and the Red Sox' Ron Roenicke was replaced by Alex Cora, who is Puerto Rican.
M.L.B. was the only league that had a higher percentage of coaches of color (44 percent) than players of color in 2020. A growing number of Latino coaches in assistant roles bolster that difference: Thirty-four percent of coaches identified as Hispanic or Latino in 2020. All other races remained underrepresented.
And baseball has the least racially diverse set of majority owners. Only one person of color was the majority owner of an M.L.B. team this year: Arte Moreno, who acquired the Los Angeles Angels in 2003. Moreno is the first Latino to own a majority stake of a franchise in any major league sport in the United States. Hiroshi Yamauchi became the first Asian person to own a major U.S. team when he bought the Seattle Mariners in 1992.

M.L.B. had another "first" this fall when Kim Ng became the first female general manager in any of the North American major men's sports leagues. She was hired by the Miami Marlins in November. Ng, who is Asian American, joins Kenny Williams (White Sox), who is Black, Farhan Zaidi (Giants), who is of Pakistani descent, and Al Avila (Tigers), who is Cuban, in the ranks of baseball executives of color overseeing similar operations, according to the data.
"When I got into this business, it seemed unlikely a woman would lead a major league team, but I am dogged in the pursuit of my goals," Ng said in the Marlins' announcement.

Texto completo: Headnote JUSTICE IN GEORGIA FOR THE WEST END ATLANTA
ATLANTA, Ga. - I caught a morning flight to Atlanta on Sunday, the 4th of October, and headed to the WEST END, about a 15-minute ride from the airport. This is the Community masjid location and home of Imam Jamil Al-Amin, formerly known as H Rap Brown.
This is a brother who has dedicated his life to the African American struggle for freedom, justice and equality. On this day, he would be 77 years old, and his supporters led by the "Students for Imam Jamil" and their organizer Wasiq Javed, known as WISEIQ, held a rally in the West End on behalf of Imam Jamil.
Khairi Al-Amin, the son of Jamil Al-Amin, was present and MC'd the program. Bro. Khairi opened the rally with the Thur prayer. He has followed in his mother's, Sis. Karima Al-Amin, footsteps and became a lawyer as a result of the struggle to free his father. For the latest on the ongoing effort, please go to: whathap-pened2rap.c0m.
Imam Jamil was the longstanding Imam for more than 20 years and as such had returned the drug infested West End community to the residents and rid the area of corruption and vice. He was erroneously accused, tried and convicted of killing Fulton County Sheriff's deputy Ricky Kinchen and wounding of Kinchen's partner, Deputy Aldra-non English.
The rally would be in support of the Jamil Al-Amin family's efforts to get a retrial based on evidence contrary to the original findings, including a signed confession of the perpetrator.
The movement to free Imam Jamil has been ongoing for more than 20 years, and there has been little or no support from the Muslim community in general and the African American Muslim community specifically.
In 2014, a grassroots effort was implemented resulting in a transfer from the most treacherous "supermax in AmeriKKKa." Imam Al-Amin's health was in such a state that he needed more care than they could give him at the federal institution in Florence, Colorado.
As a result of the applied pressure, he was transferred to a medical facility in Pennsylvania. He has since been redirected to another super maximum facility in Tucson, Arizona.
It was with some apprehension that I approached the rally, but to my surprise, the gathering was well attended with speakers from across the country. The fact that the rally had garnered support from a broad spectrum of speakers indicated that things were moving in a positive direction.
Wasiq Javed, a native of Houston and the son of Pakistani immigrants, in conjunction with Khairi Al-Amin, had assembled an impressive lineup.
Masood Abdul Haqq spoke of the "cocoon" that the Imam afforded the believers in the West End, despite being surrounded by the drug boys of Atlanta in the 1990s. "There was an honor associated with being a member of Jamil's community, a VIP hood pass that made us immune to the usual ills of this sort of environment," he said.
"This street credibility outside the Muslim community stemmed from Imam Jamil's days as H. Rap Brown, a Black revolutionary fighting for human rights."
Bro. Masood added, "For all of his international acclaim and notoriety, he will always be the man that paved the way for me to grow up proud to be Black and Muslim."
Although raised as a child in the West End, Masood now resides in Oklahoma with his wife and three children. He teaches Qur'an in the local mas-jid there.
"Killer Mike," the rapper, was next to speak. A native of Atlanta and a member of Mayor Keisha Lance-Bottoms' transition team, as such he will work closely with the new District Attorney, Fani Wills, a Howard University graduate who came on board this August.
The rapper exhorted the gathered supporters to demand that the national and local leadership get involved. A businessman and a mover and shaker in the ATL, Mike has just joined Andrew Young, former U.N. ambassador and former mayor of Atlanta, in a business venture to start Greenwood, an online bank catering to Black and Latino clients.
Ambassador Young has gone on record seeking JUSTICE for Imam Jamil. And "standby," says Killer Mike, who insists, "We will AGITATE, AGITATE, AGITATE."
T.I. Harris spoke of his days as a child in the West End and the sense of security that came with the arrival of Imam Jamil and the Muslim community when he visited family in the End. He also spoke of the opposition that came with being a man and specifically a strong Black man in America.
T.I. spoke about the history of the African in America and how we were opposed by the system from then until now. He indicated that the African American people had the deck stacked against them from birth and knew that it was not the first time that one of us had been railroaded.
T.I. demanded that the leaders lead by example, which is contrary to fact at the highest level of leadership in this country.
Yusef Salaam, formerly of the Central Park 5 and currently the Exonerated 5, spoke of his wrongful imprisonment for a rape he did not commit. Prior to exoneration based on a confession by the rapist, Salaam did six years and eight months before his conviction was ultimately overturned in 2014.
Salaam related poetically:
"It's the strangest thing in the world to me,
"I was telling the officers the truth,
"And they took my words and twisted it,
"I said, I'm going to go to the cops,
"And I'm gonna tell them what I saw,
"And I'll be home before my Mom gets back,
"I came home seven years later. "My name is Yusef Salaam
"I am one of the Central Park 5."
(Excerpt from his transcript in a New York Times article)
Dr. Salaam gave this soul-stirring rendition of a poem he wrote about his wrongful conviction and the affect it has had on his life. One line that sticks with me: "ISLAM La illah il ALLAH, being supreme over satan as a man of ALLAH, the Sahaab. Steadily striving to stay on a righteous path. So how in the hell could I take a rapists' path?"
The "Exonerated 5" goes back to 1989 when the current President Trump was a big-time realtor in New York City, who purchased a full page ad in the New York Times, calling for the death penalty for the five youth and insisted on stronger policing in the city.
This is the same rhetoric we are hearing now, over 30 years later, and the same bigotry - only now it is inciting the country: "Power tends to corrupt and Absolute Power corrupts absolutely."
"Trae tha Truth" gave up the truth, as he spoke of Imam Jamil and his compassion for his people. His love of the believers and African Americans. The rapper from Houston journeyed to Atlanta, as many had, to do what we could to support one who was the original "RAP."
Sis. Linda Sarsour hit the ground running, as she just arrived from Lexington, Kentucky, here in support of Sister Breonna Taylor's family. She pulled no punches, as she called out the Muslims who were not there versus the ones who had come to the rally.
She implored the Ummah to set aside their differences and come together to seek justice for Imam Jamil. When I began this journey, the main theme that resounded from Muslim leaders was that the Imam was not from this community or that community; therefore they were reluctant to assist the brother.
The only community is the 2 billion-plus Muslims in the community of Muhammed the Prophet (saw). Until we accept this as truth, we will continue to be played and slayed as easily as froth on the sea.
Richard Rose, President of the Atlanta NAACP, let us know it is the duty of the oppressed to resist. Mr. Rose sits as a member of the board on the Conviction Integrity Unit (CIU) developed to bring transparency to the conviction process in the ATL.
The CIU was newly created on April 26, 2019, for the purpose of reviewing previous cases with an eye for obvious contrived convictions.
Bro. Mauri' Saalakhan schooled the audience on the history of the struggle for freedom over the last 40 years and the role of Imam Jamil in that struggle. Over the years, Bro. Mauri' has been a constant voice in the ear of injustice - not just for the Imam but for the oppressed and downtrodden Muslims and brothers and sisters around the world.
CAIR's state of Georgia President Abdullah Jaber spoke about the plight of minorities in America and the inherent fallacies of a biased system in administering justice to "other than...." He encouraged support for the CAIR offices around the country, so to get them involved in the process of demanding justice for Imam Jamil and others wrongfully incarcerated.
CAIR Texas DFW has joined the effort to free Imam Jamil in just the past few days.
So many speakers came out to plead the Imam's case and to support the ongoing effort. Sis. Hanifa, a product of the West End, expressed her heartfelt appreciation of Imam Jamil and the effect he had on her growth and development as the leader of the Muslim Ummaatt in SW Atlanta.
The Imam Jamil Action Network (IJAN) has been ever vigilant and always on the case. Their presence is felt whenever there is a call or rally to support Imam Jamil. IJAN's support is evident in their efforts to keep the world informed about the Imam.
Visit: WWW.imamjamilac-tionnetwork. org
Kairi Al-Amin and Wasiq Javed closed the program, encouraging us all to get involved in the process by any means necessary. No one can do everything, but we all can do something. And, "Thanks in advance for your support and your commitment to FREEDOM, JUSTICE and EQUALITY."
ALLAH has decreed that all these people and organizations come together to seek justice for humanity, not JUST US. Yet, historically it is JUST US that has been dispropor-tionally abused by the criminal justice system.
"The arc of the moral universe is bending...," as Dr. King prophesied it would. In fact, the colony of Georgia originally prohibited the enslavement of African people, until it became profitable to do so. The original slaveholders or slave owners or indentured servants were criminals from the penal institutions of Europe, exiled to America and forced to work off their sentences. They were given the state of Georgia as their colony.
Southern states in general have extremely high prison rates, and Georgia checks in at 4th in the country regarding highest prison populations.
Another case, keep your eyes on "the Ahmaud Arbery murder trial," as it evolves in southern Georgi. And there is the upcoming Georgia senate runoff. The grassroots movement by the people turned Georgia from red to blue for the first time in 28 years. Change is inevitable! But we must work for the change we seek.
Abu Said al-Khudri reported that Prophet Muhammed, PEACE be upon him, said, "Whoever amongst you sees an evil, he must change it with his hand. If he is not able to do so, then with his tongue. If he is not able to do so, then with his heart. And that is the weakest form of faith."

Texto completo: The youngest victim of the 2007 massacre in Baghdad’s Nisour Square, committed by Blackwater mercenaries whom Donald Trump pardoned Tuesday, was a 9-year-old boy named Ali Kinani.
In a 2010 documentary, journalist Jeremy Scahill interviewed Ali’s father, Mohammed Hafedh Abdulrazzaq Kinani, who spoke of how he’d welcomed the U.S. invasion of his country and brought along his son to greet U.S. soldiers. “The first day the American Army entered Baghdad, I handed out juice and candy in the street to celebrate our liberation from Saddam,” said Kinani. Scahill called him “that rare personification of the neoconservative narrative about the U.S. invasion.”
On Sept. 16, 2007, Kinani was driving toward the traffic circle at Nisour Square with his sister, her children and Ali when guards from Blackwater opened fire with machine guns and grenade launchers. (Blackwater, a private security company, has since changed its name to Academi.) Ali was one of 17 people killed. According to The Washington Post, a U.S. military report found that there had been no provocation. “It was obviously excessive, it was obviously wrong,” a military official told the paper. An FBI investigator reportedly described it as the “My Lai Massacre of Iraq.”
The U.S. Embassy offered Ali’s family a $10,000 condolence payment. After initially refusing the money, they donated half of it to the family of a U.S. soldier killed in Iraq. “They wanted to do that to honor and acknowledge the sacrifice of those men and women that had come over to Iraq to fight for them and free them from Saddam Hussein,” Paul Dickinson, a lawyer who represented Kinani and others in a civil suit against Blackwater, told me.
Gen. Raymond Odierno, then the commander of U.S. forces in Iraq, wrote to Ali’s mother, “In the face of your family’s own personal tragedy, your act of kindness and compassion for grieving American families is truly remarkable.”
Until Tuesday, the American system worked to give Ali’s family a modicum of justice. Blackwater settled with the family. The guards were prosecuted criminally. The process was torturous, with several roadblocks, but powerful figures in the United States were determined to see it through. After a judge dismissed the charges on procedural grounds, Vice President Joe Biden promised, in a 2010 news conference in Baghdad, that there would be an appeal. “The United States is determined, determined to hold accountable anyone who commits crimes against the Iraqi people,” he said.
Eventually three of the Blackwater guards — Paul Slough, Evan Liberty and Dustin Heard — were convicted of voluntary manslaughter and other charges. A fourth, Nicholas Slatten, was convicted of murder and last year sentenced to life in prison. Kinani moved to America and became a citizen, though he was back in Iraq when the BBC reached him Wednesday. Until just days ago, he’d felt that the legal system in the United States had been “very fair with me,” he said.
Then came Tuesday’s pardon spree, which included the Blackwater killers along with some Russiagate felons, corrupt ex-congressmen and others. It was perhaps not surprising that the president acted to free the mercenaries; Trump’s enthusiasm for war crimes is well known, and last year he pardoned three men accused or convicted of them. Because of Biden’s words in 2010, some conservatives called the perpetrators of the Nisour Square massacre the “Biden four,” giving Trump an extra incentive to let them go. Erik Prince, who founded Blackwater, is a close Trump ally and the brother of his education secretary, Betsy DeVos.
Neither the predictability of these pardons, however, nor our dulled capacity for shock lessens their grotesqueness. The last days of Trump’s reign have been an orgy of impunity as he hands out indulgences like party favors and rubs America’s face in his power to put his supporters beyond ordinary law. On Wednesday, Trump pardoned even more cronies, including, most egregiously, his former campaign chair Paul Manafort, a likely reward for Manafort’s help undermining Robert Mueller’s investigation. But even in this low moment, the pardons of the Blackwater killers stand out for their depravity.
They also exemplify a core tenet of Trumpism: absolute license for some and absolute submission for others. Nowhere is that truer than in Trump’s conception of the relationship between U.S. soldiers and paramilitaries and foreigners.
Last year, Trump intervened to reverse a demotion of Eddie Gallagher, a Navy SEAL special operations chief who took a celebratory photo with a corpse and was described by men under his command as “freaking evil” and “toxic.” But the president didn’t just spare Gallagher. He lionized him, and his movement made him an icon. The New York Times described Gallagher “making appearances at influential conservative gatherings and rubbing elbows with Mr. Trump’s inner circle at Mar-a-Lago.”
You could argue that Trump has simply stripped pretense from the dynamics that always drove the “war on terror.” As Spencer Ackerman wrote in The Daily Beast, “Blackwater fed from the same American logic of occupation — the same impunity — that turned even those Iraqis willing to work for the U.S. into ‘local nationals’ who had to enter dining halls on U.S. military bases through separate doorways.”
But if the approach to Iraq that preceded Trump was infested with hypocrisy, that hypocrisy at least revealed an aspiration to a humane foreign policy. That aspiration did more than flatter the sensibilities of liberals and neoconservatives. It could be leveraged to allow a man like Kinani to make demands of the country that occupied his.
Trump’s pardon, Kinani told the BBC, made him feel as if Ali, who should now be 22, had been killed again. Before, he said, he felt that no one was “above the law.” No more.
“I feel I’m nothing today. I feel I’m nothing. I lost my son, and I feel I’m nothing,” Kinani said. By all indications, the president of the United States agrees.

Ross Douthat: A middle-aged Christmas in America

Texto completo: Marching toward middle age is sequence of older-than moments, when you realize that you’ve passed some famous age that seemed impossibly distant as a child. First you pass the prodigies: Older than William Pitt the Younger when he became prime minister, older than Donna Tartt when she published “The Secret History,” older than Alexander the Great when he conquered Persia. Then come the athletes: When you reach your later 30s, you realize that if you had actually become a baseball star, you would now be Kirk Gibson gimping to the plate, an old man in baseball years.
This year, at 41, I picked up “A Child’s Christmas in Wales,” the great exercise in Yuletide nostalgia, which I’ve always read in an edition with terrific Trina Schart Hyman illustrations to accompany Dylan Thomas’ poetic prose. The first of those illustrations depict the book the way it reads — as an old man’s reminiscences, delivered to a grandson in the mythopoetic style: “Years and years and years ago, when I was a boy, when there were wolves in Wales … it snowed and it snowed.”
But this year, I realized that I’m now older than Thomas was when he wrote “A Child’s Christmas,” just before his untimely death at the age of 39.
The kind of nostalgia the Welsh poet summoned in his little book is likely to be uniquely powerful this year. For many people, the experience of Christmas is always measured against a memory palace handed down from childhood — different scenes from different years piled together in a vision of what the holiday should be, compared to which the exhausting grown-up reality usually falls short. In 2020 that falling-short may feel particularly painful, because separation and isolation shadow so many Christmases this year.
But who feels this nostalgic pain most sharply? I had grown so used to thinking of “A Child’s Christmas” as a grandfatherly book that it’s striking to recognize it as the work of a man of my own age, like me a writer and a father of young children (though unlike me a literary celebrity living a wild and dissolute New York life). His Christmas classic poses as a fond glance backward from old age, but really its nostalgia belongs to the chaotic, high-stress middle of life’s journey — the most unhappy phase of life, at least if you believe the social scientists.
So what should the middle-aged, in particular, make of their Christmas nostalgia, their annual December ache? One answer is that it’s a gift: A glowing coal carried through cold grown-up nights, a memory of innocence and a counterpoint to the compromised selves that we become with age. In middle age, you start to recognize that the choices you’ve made in adulthood can’t be easily unwound, that you might become a person you didn’t mean to be — waking up in another 20 years as the villain of your own story, Ebenezer Scrooge before the visitation.
In that case, the memory of a Christmas childhood can hold open the door leading back. In “A Christmas Carol,” the first thing the ghosts show Scrooge isn’t Tiny Tim or his own gravestone. They show him his younger self at Christmastide, and his memories serve as a powerful rebuke to everything that he has let himself become — so powerful, in fact, that Scrooge is made repentant just by seeing those few scenes of Christmas past.
But maybe that transformation is a little bit too pat. Maybe there are ways that sentimental Christmas memory is less a gift than a kind of temptation, a way of telling yourself that you’re still fundamentally an innocent when you’re anything but, a way of stealing from the past to ease your conscience while you misbehave as an adult — as the poet who wrote “A Child’s Christmas” was definitely known to do.
From this perspective, real Christmas wisdom requires recognizing that there’s no going back to any childhood Eden, and accepting the fall into adulthood as Christians are supposed to accept the Fall of Man: as a felix culpa, a potentially happy fall, that offers the possibility for something even better than the original innocence — if, that is, you can keep to the narrow way, bear up and run the race.
So the Christmas classic for the middle-aged might be neither Thomas’ nostalgia trip nor Charles Dickens’ ghost story, but the harsher medicine of Frank Capra’s “It’s a Wonderful Life.” Capra’s movie trades on nostalgia but fundamentally critiques it: The lesson it imposes on George Bailey is that he should be grateful that the possibilities of youth have narrowed into what seems to him like disappointment — because that life can actually be a better life, with richer rewards, than the paths his boyhood self might have chosen.
If he can only see it, that is. Such, then, should be the middle-aged prayer at Christmas: not for the overwhelming rush of childhood memory — there will be time for that later — but for the clarity to see the present time, even 2020 with all its brutal impositions, as its own period of grace.
Merry Christmas.

NEW YORK — Of all the ways the pandemic reshaped New York City’s streetscape, the most profound example might have been found on Vanderbilt Avenue as it cut through brownstone Brooklyn.
On weekends, jazz bands played on the corners. Friends reunited on the median. Children zigged and zagged on their bikes as diners sat at bistro tables atop asphalt. The faint sound of cars could be heard in the distance.
Just as the early days of the coronavirus forced New Yorkers inside, it eventually pushed them outdoors — for fresh air, for exercise, for eating, for relief — in what became an organic takeover and reimagining of the city’s streets across its five boroughs.
City officials handed over 83 miles of roadway to cyclists, runners and walkers, allowed nearly 11,000 restaurants to stretch onto sidewalks and streets and let retailers expand their storefronts beyond their front doors. People reclaimed the pavement and are, by and large, unwilling to give it back.
Mayor Bill de Blasio has heralded the programs — known separately as Open Streets, Open Restaurants and Open Storefronts — as a bright spot in an otherwise dark moment for the city. Once a skeptic, de Blasio believes that some of these pandemic-era experiments will be woven permanently into the fabric of New York.
But how exactly will the city look?
The New York Times asked people who have taken advantage of Open Streets what they want to see endure. The Times also asked a noted urban planner and architect, Claire Weisz of WXY Studio, to explore what would be realistic but also to offer a more ambitious vision and share what has worked elsewhere.
The Times selected three streets that were part of the Open Streets and Open Restaurants programs and that represent possibilities applicable to all parts of the city. While the Open Restaurants program has been made permanent, the city has said less about the future of Open Streets, most of which recently ended because of colder weather, beyond that the mayor wants to see it stay in some form.
There is Vanderbilt Avenue in Prospect Heights, a grand mixed-use, European-style boulevard. There is 34th Avenue in Jackson Heights, Queens, a wide street lined with apartment buildings and townhouses. And there is Avenue B on the Lower East Side, which, like other Manhattan residential neighborhoods, is anchored by a park.
THE EUROPEAN BOULEVARD
Vanderbilt Avenue, Brooklyn
Vanderbilt Avenue could become a destination for the surrounding areas by taking advantage of the existing median, expanding it with curves that force drivers to slow down and building a performance stage.
What New Yorkers Think
On Halloween morning, Dayna Rosen stood in the middle of the major thoroughfare connecting Fort Greene to the north and Prospect Park to the south, snapping photos of Monty, her Boston terrier mix. Monty wore a jean jacket and a magenta mohawk.
Rosen, 40, felt for a moment as if she had been whisked away to another continent.
“It reminds me of all the squares in Europe,” she said.
Until Thanksgiving, Vanderbilt Avenue — which stretches 60 feet curb to curb — was transformed into a central hub in the Prospect Heights neighborhood. Restaurants stretched into the street. One block of the avenue has a concrete median with a few planted trees, a splash of greenery in the middle of the two-way street.
The transformation started on Saturday mornings with volunteers moving blue barricades onto the avenue, blocking all cars except emergency vehicles.
“Since we live right on this block, we are able to bring our chairs,” Molly Marcotte said as she carried a barricade.
When we asked people who have flocked to Vanderbilt what it needs most, almost everyone mentioned more benches and tables. The existing bike lane should be more clearly marked and improved to try to separate faster cyclists from others, especially children, who are traveling more slowly.
Above all, local residents said they wanted to be able to dictate the future of Vanderbilt and not cede decision making to City Hall.
Jaykuan Marrero, who has cut hair at two barbershops on the street, said he would love to see Vanderbilt converted into an ambitious events space, with a stage for musical and theatrical performances.
Andy Bachman, a rabbi who was getting his hair cut by Marrero, agreed.
“This is a borough of writers, painters and poets,” Bachman said.
What’s Practical
The future of a road like Vanderbilt, Weisz said, begins with the median — a 10-foot-wide by 300-foot-long elevated concrete block broken up by nine Japanese zelkova trees.
On many city streets, the median is “purely a kind of visual safety barrier and nothing else,” she said.
Weisz said Vanderbilt’s median could be extended along additional blocks and expanded outward, becoming a small park.
The islands in the middle of Vanderbilt, she said, could also provide something sorely needed across the entire city: public bathrooms, which make places more welcoming and allow people to linger longer.
In some countries, users of public bathrooms pay a small fee — 25 cents in U.S. currency, for instance — with the proceeds used to hire workers to keep bathrooms clean and stocked with supplies. (The city has five public, climate-controlled restrooms that cost 25 cents to use for 15 minutes.)
Medians could also be used as loading and unloading zones for deliveries. New kinds of bike lanes — one dedicated to fast bicyclists, commuters and delivery workers — could be added next to the median. There could be a separate lane for leisurely riders.
That is a model embraced by Copenhagen, the cycling-friendly city in Denmark, which has nine so-called supercycle highways crisscrossing the city and its metropolitan area.
THE RESIDENTIAL PROMENADE
34th Avenue, Queens
In Queens, 34th Avenue could become a long pedestrian promenade by expanding the existing median, which would allow space for features like a workout area and gardens, and would move the existing bike lane away from traffic.
What New Yorkers Think
Twice a day, Laurie Gold takes her pit bull mix, Shani, on a long walk — more than 2 miles along 34th Avenue. The straight roadway, whose lanes are separated by an elevated median with plants and trees, is full of people day and night, running, walking or biking.
“I love it,” Gold, 29, said about the Open Streets portion, which extends more than a mile from near the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway to Junction Boulevard. “I wouldn’t change anything.”
During the pandemic, the avenue has become a family destination. Neighbors stop to chat. Parents push strollers, while children bounce basketballs or zip around on bicycles. Ashley Cedeno, 8, loves playing tag or hide-and-seek.
The street, Ashley said, is “for having fun and playing together.”
A gathering area on the western half is Travers Park, a 2-acre playground and green space surrounded by apartment buildings and schools. While wanting to maintain the avenue’s residential appeal, some people said they would like more commercial activity, like fairs, food trucks and sidewalk vendors.
On some weekends, farmers and winemakers have set up tents to sell goods. Edwin Cordero, who has lost 5 pounds in the past month walking his yellow Labrador retriever, Lucy, said there should be more choices.
“We don’t get street festivals up here at all,” Cordero said.
What’s Practical
A street like 34th Avenue is ripe with opportunities, Weisz said. The roadway stretches about 55 feet across from curb to curb, enough room for the median to be extended to the sidewalk on one side and create a one-way road on the other.
The extended area would create a large section for pedestrians and for more greenery, she said.
While the avenue has a bike lane, it runs between the roadway and parked cars. Weisz said it would be safer to move it next to the sidewalk to prevent drivers from hitting cyclists with the door when they get out of their vehicles.
“It does feel dangerous,” she said.
Travers Park could serve as an anchor, a place to add public bathrooms as well as carve out space for vendors and a workout area.
New York could take inspiration from the Tokyo Toilet, architecturally appealing and wheelchair-accessible restrooms found across Shibuya, a major commercial center in Tokyo.
“You need some sort of public facilities here,” Weisz said.
THE NEIGHBORHOOD SIDE STREET
Avenue B, Manhattan
Avenue B could be made more inviting to pedestrians by converting the road into a one-way strip near Tompkins Square Park, which would lose its fencing but gain public bathrooms.
What New Yorkers Think
Holding a paintbrush lathered in red wood stain, Darrin Arremony knelt on Avenue B on a recent Sunday, applying the first coat on a newly built outdoor dining structure at Barnyard, his wife’s cheese restaurant.
As he spread the stain, Arremony kept an eye on the narrow lanes behind him, watching for traffic. He said it might be safer to convert the open street section of Avenue B, between East Sixth and East 14th streets, into a one-way street.
Today, with parked cars and some restaurants operating on the roadway, there is roughly a 20-foot wide gap on the street for people, bicyclists and some vehicles. Only local car traffic is allowed through.
“We definitely need automobile traffic here,” Arremony said. “The businesses will need the support of deliveries.”
The focal point of the neighborhood is Tompkins Square Park, developed into a landscaped oasis more than 150 years ago on former swampland.
Many residents said the park’s best features — a place to sit or relax amid greenery — should be adopted along Avenue B. Debora Williams, who has lived in the neighborhood for 25 years, said the sidewalks should have more trees and plants.
Converting Avenue B into a permanent open street, she added, would allow schools to use it as a big playground.
“Just more greenery would be great,” Williams said.
What’s Practical
The park is 10.5 acres but most of it is off limits to people. Fences ring its perimeter, except for paved entryways into the park. Benches line the paths but are not surrounded by trees and shrubs, which are protected by more fencing within the park.
Weisz said the fences were a relic of a different era when residents worried about farm animals roaming into the parkland. Then, “it turned into a weird 1970s security thing,” she said. But imagine, she said, what the area would look like without fences.
It would be easy to enter the park with paths weaving amid the trees and landscapes, allowing people to escape in the greenery and stay socially distanced.
A template for Avenue B could be Barcelona, Spain, which has superblocks — islands of car-free streets. The avenue could be made one-way as an open street, while reverting to a two-way elsewhere.
A wider street would also make room for public bathrooms, she said.
Breaking up the flow of traffic would force drivers to slow down, increasing safety. Avenue B would also benefit from bike lanes and discrete areas for deliveries.
“It looks like the perfect shared street,” Weisz said.

Martha Duke, who has been sober since Jan. 1, 2018, didn’t set out to become an abstinence guru during the “what does it matter anyway” drinking frenzy of 2020.
Until it started to matter.
All of a sudden, Duke, a vocal critic of “mommy wine culture” and a member of the Sober Mom Squad, a virtual community created during the pandemic, was fielding questions about alcohol from friends and acquaintances. Was two bottles of wine a night a bit over the top? How much was too much? Many of the women seeking her out were high school connections she hadn’t spoken with in years, and with whom she mostly communicated through social media.
“No one is talking about glasses of wine anymore,” said Duke, who works for a dog grooming app and lives in New York City with her two teenage sons. “People are measuring by the bottle,” she continued. “That scares me. I know too many women who went from one or two glasses to two bottles of wine to vodka in your coffee cup.”
During the pandemic, alcohol has become an easy way to self-medicate, aided by the fact that liquor and wine stores were deemed essential services from the start. Many even offer delivery, with apps like MiniBar filling in the gaps. New Yorkers who ache for fresh air and company have been able to order cocktails to go from restaurants and enjoy them on the sidewalk.
But as a new year approaches, many New Yorkers are reevaluating their relationship with alcohol, whether it’s by cutting down, joining support groups or stopping completely.
Loosid, a sober social and dating network, saw more than a 3,000% increase in messages and posts this year, rising from about 500 in February to over 16,000 in November. Its hotline has been just as active. In February, the hotline received 84 messages. Last month, it received 3,205.
Women in particular have been vocal about curbing their heavy drinking, the frequency of which increased by 41% this year, versus 7% for men, according to a RAND Corp. study published in September.
“It’s been understood that women are more likely to drink to cope with isolation issues or problems with relationships,” said Sharon Wilsnack, a retired professor of psychiatry and behavioral science at the University of North Dakota School of Medicine. “The pandemic prevented us from connecting with others. If we’re deprived of these relationships, which causes more stress, it might make women turn to drinking as a way to deal with that deprivation.”
This might be one reason Wellbridge Addiction Treatment and Research in Calverton, New York, on Long Island, has already seen a surprisingly large number of women seeking treatment since opening in May. Dr. Harshal Kirane, the medical director, said that in his experience, only around 15% of addiction patients are women in their 40s and 50s. Yet three months into the pandemic, 70% of those admitted to Wellbridge came from this demographic.
These days, there is a general, distorted sense of what healthy and acceptable drinking is, Kirane said. “Responsible drinking is reinforced by structure in people’s lives — going to work, taking their kids to school, interacting and maintaining a home,” he explained. “The pandemic has turned such boundaries on their head and created more space for alcohol.”
That’s what happened to Natalie Silverstein, a marketing manager in media, who is planning an alcohol-free January. Before the pandemic, she was a self-described social drinker, who mostly had a glass of wine on a date or on the weekend. But this year, she started drinking every day.
“Being inside all these months was extremely confining,” said Silverstein, who lives in the East Village neighborhood of New York City. “I needed something to relax. I looked forward to drinking because it broke the barrier.”
For her, a glass of wine signaled the end of the day. Anxious, tired and stressed, it helped her sleep. It also helped her socialize and connect.
“In New York, drinking was an activity. In isolation it helped us gather,” she said. “My team would do Zoom happy hours, and everyone had wine or a cocktail. That became habitual. It felt like drinking was the one thing holding us up.”
For Andrea Morgan of Long Island, a publicist and mother of two children who have been in remote school this year, drinking helped ease boredom. She knew it was becoming an issue, so she stopped drinking for November, as did her husband. “No one wants to teach their kids virtually with a drink in their hand,” she said. Now Morgan is considering doing a dry January. “It was great to have the discipline during this time, when so much is out of my control, to prove to myself I can control this.”
For her own dry January, Silverstein is thinking up ways to continue the ritual of pouring a drink at the end of the day, just one without alcohol. “That’s easier than removing the habit,” she said. “I’m excited to try alternatives. I want to develop positive behaviors.”
For some, the solution to stop self-medicating with alcohol is actual medication.
“I was never a big drinker — I had one or two glasses of wine at dinner — then I became a pandemic drinker, having three to four glasses of wine a day,” said Jennifer Rubenstein, an annual fund manager at a synagogue who lives in Stuyvesant Town on the East Side of Manhattan. “I was depressed and anxious. I missed my colleagues. I started drinking nightly, then it was drinking at 5, and before you know it was a Bloody Mary at 10 a.m. I was having hangovers and little blackouts.”
In September Rubenstein asked her therapist for help.
“I started Naltrexone, which reduces alcohol cravings, in an effort to severely cut back on my drinking, which I’m taking in tandem with an antidepressant,” she said. “The effects were immediate. It’s made a profound difference. My head feels clear in the morning. Now I only have 4 ounces of red wine at night. The craving for more is gone.”
Hilary Sheinbaum of Queens, the author of “The Dry Challenge: How to Lose the Booze for Dry January, Sober October, and Any Other Alcohol-Free Month ,” offered a few practical suggestions on how to cut back or stop completely. “Remove it from your home by giving it to a neighbor or friend to hold,” she said. “Or pour it down the drain.”
She also emphasized the importance of a support network when quitting alcohol, and of speaking honestly with friends and family about the process: “The ones who care about you will support your efforts.”

It’s almost time to bid goodbye and good riddance to 2020, one of the worst years most of us have ever lived through. Though the end of the pandemic is in sight, this holiday season remains a lonely, difficult one, with renewed lockdowns keeping many separated from their loved ones, their communities and their festive traditions.
If you’re feeling unmoored this December, or just burned out from the past year, these podcasts will keep you company and help you feel connected, even in isolation.
‘Beautiful Stories From Anonymous People’: The premise of Chris Gethard’s innovative interview show is deceptively simple, rooted in the comedian’s many years in talk radio. Each week, Gethard has a phone conversation with one anonymous caller, whom he’ll speak to for an hour about any subject the person chooses. When the show began in 2016, Gethard figured the end result would be a mostly comedic series of prank calls; instead, it’s a remarkably intimate series of confessionals. Some calls do offer fun slice-of-life musings, but others are bracingly intense — a recent caller revealed she had barely slept all week after discovering that a close friend had murdered someone. Empathetic and thrillingly unpredictable, “Beautiful Stories” makes ordinary life as captivating as any scripted drama. (Starter episode: “Love in the Time of Coronavirus”)
‘This Is Love': After four years of telling engrossing, disturbing stories about the worst of humanity in the hypnotic true crime podcast “Criminal,” Phoebe Judge and her colleagues in 2018 began applying the same rigor and nuance to telling stories about love. As warm as “Criminal” is chilly, the offshoot podcast, aptly called “This Is Love,” explores its central concept through wide-ranging narratives that are sometimes about romance but sometimes about subtler kinds of love. One episode details the bond between a blind man and his guide dog; another, the extraordinary saga of two wolves at Yellowstone; another, the story of a dive team venturing inside an iceberg. Other episodes explore acts of collective love, like the Italian city that voluntarily fell silent to preserve the sound of a treasured violin. A soothing and inspiring counterweight to doomscrolling. ( Starter episode: “Roselle and Michael”)
‘Griefcast’: This year has been full of grief in different forms: for those who have died of the coronavirus, for the industries that have been decimated and for life as we know it. For anyone grappling with loss, “Griefcast” is a cathartic listen. The host, Cariad Lloyd, lost her father to pancreatic cancer at 15 and for many years was unable to express the effect it had on her. That experience inspired her to create a show that’s all about speaking the unspeakable. Lloyd sits down with fellow comedians and performers to “talk, share, and laugh about the weirdness of grief and death.” Blending gallows humor and searing compassion, the show cuts through the isolating haze that often makes grief unbearable. ( Starter episode: “Aisling Bea”)
‘Stuff You Should Know’: There’s no shortage of “explainer” podcasts that play like a kind of audio encyclopedia, delivering 101 summaries on a variety of topics. But the appeal of “Stuff You Should Know,” one of many shows from the prolific HowStuffWorks brand, lies mainly in the amiable and genuine rapport between co-hosts Josh Clark and Chuck Bryant. Each week, the duo delve into the inner workings of subjects as varied as sneezing, Black cowboys and the Bay of Pigs disaster, peppering their curious conversations with pop culture references, life anecdotes and the odd dad joke. Even in episodes that explore unsolved mysteries like the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 or the Dyatlov Pass incident, the tone is always level headed. A down-to-earth treat that’ll also teach you something. ( Starter episode: “The Disappearance of Flight MH370”)
‘Comedy Bang Bang: The Podcast’ : Laughter is a scientifically backed antidote to the stress and anxiety, and with live comedy still out of reach for the foreseeable future, listening to this long-running podcast can prove a helpful coping mechanism. Having started life as a radio show in 2009, “Comedy Bang Bang” has evolved into a podcasting institution whose enduring appeal is rooted in its deliberately unpredictable format. Each week, Scott Aukerman welcomes comedians and celebrities for what are ostensibly interviews, but quickly descend into a surreal blend of character skits and improv segments. Regular guests include Paul F. Tompkins, Jason Mantzoukas and Lauren Lapkus, whose long-standing rapport with Aukerman helps the show feel grounded, even in its most absurdist moments. ( Starter episode: “Small Claims Cyborg”)
‘This American Life’: This beloved titan of audio journalism celebrated its 25th anniversary this year and marked the occasion by rebroadcasting some of its most memorable episodes. The reruns were a reminder of just how timeless the show is, illuminating different nooks and crannies of the American experience and drawing unexpected lines between them. Anchored by Ira Glass’ inimitable wry, halting voice, each episode — usually a prologue and three acts — introduces a central theme that is explored through different types of nonfiction storytelling, including reportage, monologue and verse. “This American Life” (which now has a “creative and strategic" relationship with The New York Times) is not a news show, but it excels at taking a timely story and boiling it down to an essential theme. One recent example was the election-themed episode “Personal Recount,” which explored different scenarios in which people changed their minds. ( Starter episode: “129 Cars”)
‘Kind World’: It’s no secret that bad news travels faster (and further) than good news, and as its title suggests, this show from Boston-based WBUR is all about redressing the balance. Each episode of “Kind World” focuses on an instance of human decency — an act of charity, a chance encounter that sparks a connection, somebody going above and beyond for their community. As lockdowns descended in the spring, the show ran a series of bite-sized episodes titled “A Moment of Kindness,” in which listeners nationwide called in to share their own memories of everyday empathy. The podcast officially wrapped up in the summer, but the back catalog has enough life-affirming gems to keep your faith in humanity strong for months. ( Starter episode: “Glimmers of Light Amid Darkness”)

NEW YORK — Jasmine, a student at Brooklyn College, sprints across the platform to catch an idling train. She had lingered on the No. 2 a second too long, distracted by a performer-cum-mystic doling out free advice that felt eerily relevant. Now she is moments away from missing her transfer.
“Don’t close the door, don’t close the door, don’t close the —” she prays under her breath, just as the subway car’s metal doors snap shut in front of her.
So ends the first episode of “The MTA Radio Plays,” a new series of audio dramas created by playwright Ren Dara Santiago and directed by Natyna Bean, among others. The series, presented in collaboration with Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, brings listeners inside a No. 2 train as it snakes from the Bronx to Brooklyn.
Conceived as a love letter to city life in pre-pandemic times, each 10- to 15-minute episode is set at a stop on the No. 2 and tells the story of various New Yorkers as they navigate chance encounters with strangers, arguments with lovers or conversations with friends aboard the train.
There are subway buskers who storm train cars like tornadoes. There are eavesdropping riders who offer unsolicited advice and, often, welcomed camaraderie. There are strangers who will not stand clear of the closing doors, the spirited child staring through a train window with glittering eyes and the omniscient voice of a conductor who keeps the train, and the city, moving through it all.
Taken together, the plays elevate those once ubiquitous moments from the mundane trials of a daily commute that bind the city’s collective DNA.
“When you claim New York, then naturally everyone who exists here is community,” Santiago said in a phone interview one recent morning. “You can exist in a neighborhood that is very specific, ethnically or otherwise, and feel like that is all of New York. But it’s on the subway where we get to encounter all these other identities.”
For New Yorkers, the series may feel like a nostalgic embrace. In the scrum of a rush-hour train, everyone from executives to office cleaners were pushed and shoved in a daily reminder that the New York hustle leaves few unscathed. Here, too, were the round-the-clock performances of Manhattan’s least expensive show, in which New Yorkers were at once audience members and leading actors performing scenes from their private lives on a public stage.
That choreography is one Santiago knows well. The 28-year-old Harlem native spent her middle school days squeezing into packed No. 1 trains each morning and her early 20s slipping into No. 2 cars for her daily three-hour round-trip commute to work. (Like many of the playwrights involved in the series, she still relies on the No. 2 today).
The first three episodes, which are available online at the Rattlestick website, begin at the northern tip of the line at the Wakefield-241 Street station in the Bronx. There, in a play by 29-year-old Julissa Contreras, listeners meet the character named Jasmine as she is consumed by thoughts of a recent breakup and a subway performer offers her seemingly prophetic advice.
The next episode, written by Alexander Lambie, 29, picks up 15 stops later at the Intervale Avenue station, where a single mother bumps into a friend and abandons a plan to visit a questionably committed lover. And at the Prospect Avenue station, writer Dominic Colón, 44, introduces a young man whose angry call with his boyfriend prompts another rider to offer some sage advice.
In a nod to the New Yorkers who make up the bulk of subway ridership today, every play also features at least one essential worker.
Implicit in each vignette are the lofty life questions the playwrights wrestled with as the shrinking of urban life turned their gaze inward: What does a healthy relationship look like? How can you tell when to let go of love? How do we survive a love lost?
“A lot of the inspiration are the unspoken love stories that we pass by as commuters each day,” Contreras said. “We wanted to focus on millennial lovers who are in this complicated space of finding themselves.”
Of course this spring, those connections felt even more distant. With a suddenness as stunning as its deadly wake, the pandemic brought the city to a standstill.
As theaters went dark in March, Santiago’s own Rattlestick debut production, “The Siblings Play,” was shut down days before its world premiere. By April, the subway had emptied of riders. Lives that were lived in multiple boroughs were suddenly confined to single neighborhoods.
“We’ve lost perspective,” said Bean, 28, one of the series’ directors. “Being in our homes every day, we are left to our own assumptions and prejudices. We aren’t forced to engage with people we might not have otherwise if we hadn’t gotten on the train.”
That is exactly the void that she and Santiago, approached by Rattlestick, set out to fill. In May they enlisted 17 playwrights to craft stories that reflected the people living in the communities served by the stations.
By then, many theaters had moved online, with prerecorded performances and virtual play readings, many of which translated awkwardly on-screen.
“There was no creation of community,” Santiago said. “It felt like we were pretending it wasn’t through a screen, instead of embracing that the person watching online also exists and we can write new plays for a new medium.”
But if intimacy is where those on-screen productions fall short, it is where radio thrives.
The ambient sounds alone can transport a New Yorker into the sprawling underground: The familiar clink-clink-clink of a turnstile grinding forward. The earsplitting screech of a train as it winds across metal tracks. The crackle of a conductor’s voice broadcast inside a subway car.
“The voices are in your ears, you can walk around, close your eyes and feel like you’re inside the story. You can see these characters or you put their voice on people walking by you,” Santiago said. “That feels more like true theater to me because it allows the person to be immersed.”
The next set of episodes in the series will be available online in February, with the remaining plays released every few weeks through May.
As this season nears its end, listeners arrive at the Church Avenue station in Brooklyn, where two friends debate whether or not to help a sick fellow passenger. And just before the train ends its run, Jasmine’s ex-boyfriend enters the car and encounters the same mystical performer whose spiritual counsel opened the series.
Santiago plans to continue the series in subsequent seasons devoted to every train line that winds across the city.
“I hope the stories will resonate with people,” she said. “They’ll think ‘Oh, I had a moment like that on the train!’ Those small interactions make people feel recognized and now, listening to them, maybe less alone.”

Nancye Radmin, a pioneer of plus-size fashion who for two decades ran an upscale chain of stores, the Forgotten Woman, that served a group of women who had otherwise been overlooked by high fashion, died on Dec. 8 at her home in Lakeland, Florida. She was 82.
The death was confirmed by her son Brett Radmin.
For most of her life, Nancye Radmin hovered around a size 8 and preferred wearing fine fabrics like cashmere and jacquard. But by her second pregnancy, in 1976, she had gained 80 pounds and was a size 16. When she went shopping at her favorite stores in Manhattan for some new clothes, she was shocked to find that there were only polyester pants and boxy sweaters in her size.
“Fat,” she told Newsweek in 1991, “was the F word of fashion.”
“Absolutely nothing stylish was available,” she added. “I just knew I wasn’t the only fat woman in New York.”
With $10,000 she borrowed from her husband, Radmin looked to start her own business — a boutique stocked with the kind of upscale clothes she wanted to wear.
In 1977 she opened the Forgotten Woman at 888 Lexington Avenue on the fashionable Upper East Side. The store’s name was a reference to her clientele, women who wore larger sizes than most fashion designers manufactured — and, perhaps, to a culture that overlooked them, too.
Prices were high: A Persian lamb fake-fur coat by Searle was $595, and an iridescent rose silk Kip Kirkendall gown was $1,850.
By 1991 she had 25 shops around the country, with annual sales of $40 million.
“People forget that the older and larger woman usually leads a dressy social life,” she told The New York Times in 1983. “She’s the mother of the bride, she goes to formal dinners with her successful husband, and she can carry off beads and bright colors that might swamp a small woman.”
Plus-size clothing generally starts at size 14, and today the average U.S. women’s dress size is between 14 and 16. The women’s plus-size apparel market was valued at $9.8 billion in 2019, according to the market research firm Statista.
But in the late 1970s, the concept of plus-size fashion was an anomaly. Still, Radmin’s store spoke directly to the nascent idea of body acceptance, a product of the women’s liberation movement of that decade.
“If you look at the history of fashion for larger women, it was either invisible or ghettoized or unbelievably frumpy,” Natalia Mehlman Petrzela, an associate professor of history at the New School in New York, said. “The Forgotten Women as a store for attractive high-end plus-size clothing was a radically inclusive concept at the time from the perspective of fat women deserving to think of themselves as feminine, fashionable people who would be deserving of going on a splurgy shopping trip.”
Radmin approached Seventh Avenue manufacturers, many of whom referred to her as “crazy Nancye,” to have some of her favorite clothes made for plus sizes.
She also urged designers to create more plus-size clothing. Some, like Oscar de la Renta, took a bit of convincing, but even he created evening dresses for her stores, as did Geoffrey Beene, Bob Mackie and Pauline Trigère.
The Forgotten Women boutiques had a “Sugar Daddy Bar” for the female shoppers’ male companions to amuse themselves, stocked with Korbel champagne, tea sandwiches and miniature muffins. Celebrities like Oprah Winfrey, Roseanne Barr, Nell Carter and Tyne Daly shopped there. Stores were strategically opened on shopping streets like Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills to show customers that they were just as entitled to spend money as their thin counterparts.
“We wanted to make the customer feel important, not embarrassed,” said Dane O’Neal, who worked in merchandising for the chain.
Nancye Jo Bullard was born on Aug. 4, 1938, in Nashville, Tennessee, to Joe and Jane (Johnson) Bullard. She grew up on her father’s farm in Cochran, Georgia, where he harvested peanuts and cotton. Her mother was a registered nurse.
Even as a child, Nancye was entrepreneurial, selling peanuts on the street corner to earn extra money.
She attended Middle Georgia College (now Middle Georgia State University), but left before graduating to travel. She then worked as a secretary and moved to New York City in the late 1960s.
In 1967 she met Mack Radmin, a widower 23 years her senior who was in the kosher meat business. She converted to Judaism for him (she had been raised Southern Baptist), and they married in 1968.
Radmin often called the first years of her marriage her “Barbie doll days,” because she weighed 110 pounds, wore a size 4 and spent a lot of time shopping and dining out in Manhattan.
Mack Radmin died in 1996. In addition to her son Brett, she is survived by another son, William Kyle Radmin; two sisters, Michelle Moody and Cheryle Janelli; and four grandchildren.
In 1989, Radmin sold a portion of the Forgotten Woman chain to venture capitalists. In 1998, the Forgotten Woman filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The remaining nine stores were closed by the end of that year.
By then, larger department stores had caught on to the plus-size market and begun selling clothing in more sizes.
Radmin didn’t think much of them. “I don’t have competition,” she told People magazine in 1988. “I only have imitators.”

Robert Thacker, who found himself caught in the middle of Japan’s surprise attack on Pearl Harbor when he was piloting an unarmed B-17 bomber to Hawaii for refueling, but managed to make a hair-raising landing and went on to a distinguished flying career in war and peace, died Nov. 25 at his home in San Clemente, California. He was 102.
Thacker’s daughter, Barbara Thacker, confirmed his death to The New York Times on Friday. She said she had not provided confirmation until last week to The San Clemente Times, which published an obituary Thursday.
Thacker, who arrived on the island of Oahu as Japanese warplanes devastated the U.S. naval base there, would soon be dropping bombs of his own. He flew some 80 missions during World War II, seeing action in both the Pacific and European theaters. He later became a record-setting test pilot and flew in the Korean and Vietnam wars.
But it was on the morning of Dec. 7, 1941, that he faced his first test in battle.
His plane was among a flight of newly built B-17s arriving from California en route to the Philippines. As he began his descent to the Army Air Corps’ Hickam Field, at first unaware of anything amiss, he was astonished to see bombers and fighters roaming the skies and black smoke rising from the U.S. base and adjoining military installations.
One of the fighters shot out the front landing gear of his Flying Fortress as he approached the runway. But he careened to a landing and led his crew to a swamp alongside the runway to escape the inferno.
In February 1947, about 18 months after Japan surrendered, he was back at Hickam Field, this time to make aviation history. Now a lieutenant colonel, he piloted a North American Aviation P-82 fighter plane on the first nonstop flight from Hawaii to New York City in what remains the longest nonstop flight, 5,051 miles, ever made by a propeller-driven fighter, according to the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force, near Dayton, Ohio.
Developed at the end of World War II, the twin-fuselage, twin-propeller P-82 had been envisioned as a long-range escort for the giant B-29 Superfortresses on missions to Japan. The fighter had two cockpits, one for the pilot and the other for the co-pilot/navigator, so they could take turns flying. But the war was over before the P-82 was combat ready.
Early in the Cold War, the P-82 was viewed by the Pentagon as a potential escort in the event bombers like the B-29 were called upon to attack the Soviet Union. The pioneering test flight by Thacker and his co-pilot, Lt. John Ard, provided evidence that the fighter could carry out such a mission.
During the 14 1/2-hour flight from Hickam, a mechanical glitch prevented the plane from jettisoning three empty fuel tanks, and the P-82 fought drag from the unwanted weight and strong headwinds. By the time it touched down, it had only enough fuel left for another 30 minutes of flight.
But Thacker handled his plane with aplomb. The P-82, named Betty Jo after his wife, landed at La Guardia Field in Queens shortly after 11 a.m. on Feb. 28, 1947, greeted by a host of reporters and news photographers and hundreds of onlookers.
Since “nothing else happened in the world that day,” he told the Arrowhead Club, a California military research organization, in a 2014 interview, “I was front-page news.” The New York Times ran its own Page 1 article on the flight and an editorial hailing the Army Air Forces’ growing readiness for postwar combat. It viewed the flight as providing “further proof of how rapidly the globe is shrinking.”
Robert Eli Thacker was born on Feb. 21, 1918, in El Centro, California, one of three children of Percie and Margaret (Eadie) Thacker.
When he was 8, his father, who owned a moving company, bought him a kit to build a twin-pusher model plane, a craft with two propellers that rides air currents with the aim of achieving maximum distance in competitions.
“I was hooked on aviation from that age on,” he recalled in the 2014 interview.
He attended a two-year community college in El Centro, hoping to become an aeronautical engineer. But his family did not have the money for him to complete a four-year college education, so in 1939 he joined what was then known as the Army Air Corps. He received his wings as a lieutenant in June 1940.
He flew World War II bombing missions out of New Guinea, Italy and England. He later joined the nation’s leading test pilots in experimental flights over California’s high desert at Muroc Army Air Field in California, later renamed Edwards Air Force Base.
In addition to flying B-17 Flying Fortresses in World War II, Thacker piloted Superfortresses in the Korean War and high-altitude missions in the Vietnam War.
The P-82 (renamed the F-82) flew combat missions in the Korean War, when it was given radar capability, but jet fighters soon rendered it obsolete.
Thacker retired from the Air Force as a full colonel in 1970. His awards included two Silver Stars and three Distinguished Flying Crosses.
He was later an adviser to the aviation industry and pursued his hobby of flying radio-controlled model planes.
Thacker’s daughter is his only survivor. His wife, Betty Jo (Smoot) Thacker, died in 2011.
Although the record-setting propeller fighter that Thacker flew has faded into obscurity, it has not been entirely forgotten.
That silver plane is on display at the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force, inscribed “Betty Jo” in red script.

Boris Johnson Delivered on Brexit. It May Not Soothe His Unruly Party.

LONDON — An “exceptional victory,” the result of “fantastic work” and a deal that “delivered” for the British people.
Even before the text of the post-Brexit trade agreement was published, lawmakers loyal to Prime Minister Boris Johnson lavished praise on him for resolving an issue that has convulsed British politics for almost half a decade.
When Parliament convenes next week to ratify the document, the question will only be the size of Johnson’s majority for a deal that severs close economic ties to continental Europe on Jan. 1 after almost 50 years. Even the opposition Labour Party will officially support it, arguing that it is better than nothing.
Yet this is unlikely to be the final word in the Conservative bloodletting over Europe that has, at least in part, led to the downfall of the party’s last four prime ministers.
Hard-line Brexit supporters have yet to examine the agreement, and they probably will not like every word of an estimated 2,000 pages of dense treaty text and annexes. A small group did not want any trade deal at all, never really trusted Johnson and might still be inclined to make trouble for him.
Already, an organization representing British trawler fleets has expressed disappointment at compromises over fishing rights, and the Scottish government has attacked the deal, arguing it strengthens the case for Scotland’s independence.
“In the short term, the Tory Party is pretty united around the very hard Brexit that Boris Johnson pushed Britain toward but which many Britons never thought they were voting for,” said Charles Grant, director of the Center for European Reform, a research institute.
But the agreement provides only limited economic benefits for Britain, and friction with the European Union is likely to remain, added Grant, who said the country’s post-Brexit relationship with the European Union may not be much more stable than what preceded it.
“In the longer term, the rift may reopen,” he said, adding that pressure might grow once the deal’s limitations become clear.
The pandemic has plunged Britain into the worst recession in three centuries, so post-Brexit politics remain highly volatile, said Anand Menon, professor of European politics at King’s College, London.
And the Brexit debate has poisoned the workings of the Conservative Party, which had long been known for a pragmatic and successful pursuit of power rather than an adherence to political doctrine.
Now, despite achieving his aim of getting “Brexit done,” Johnson cannot assume that the divisions are over.
“Europe has turned the Conservatives into an ideological party, and it has basically got in the way of Conservative governments governing,” Menon said.
Others have tried and failed to end this internecine feud, including David Cameron, one of Johnson’s predecessors.
Cameron once famously pleaded with his party to stop “banging on” about Europe. Yet after being harried by internal euroskeptic critics, he took the fateful gamble of calling the 2016 referendum on EU membership in an ill-fated effort to put the matter to rest.
Johnson was a beneficiary of that miscalculation, and the lesson he appears to have drawn from recent history is that it is dangerous for any Conservative Party leader to be outflanked on the euroskeptic right.
He campaigned for Brexit, became prime minister thanks to it, and last year kicked out of his party lawmakers who opposed the idea of a clear rupture with the European Union, uniting his Tories behind his hard-line stance.
But in striking a trade deal, Johnson is taking a calculated risk in disappointing a cohort of purist Brexit supporters who helped him win power and who wanted no agreement at all.
An influential caucus of pro-Brexit Conservative lawmakers known as the European Research Group has yet to weigh in on the agreement, and Johnson has been working hard to bring them on his side. How many of those lawmakers oppose him and who they are will be very significant, Menon said.
“If you have 20 to 40 of them screaming ‘betrayal,’ that changes the dynamic,” he said.
Waiting in the wings is Nigel Farage, the populist anti-EU politician who has now rebranded his Brexit Party as Reform UK and has shown his skill in the past at peeling off Conservative supporters.
On Thursday, Farage cautiously welcomed Johnson’s deal but with the important caveat that he had yet to read the fine print.
Some Brexit supporters have always scented that betrayal would lie somewhere within any treaty negotiated with the European Union and, even before the agreement was struck, it was being denounced as another in a long series of British surrenders to Brussels. One commentary article in the pro-Brexit Daily Telegraph argued that the government had been “outsmarted at every turn.”
Others agree with that analysis, but from a more pro-European perspective, noting that even official forecasts suggest Britain will lose out on significant economic growth under Johnson’s deal.
Many businesses will notice the limitations of Johnson’s agreement as soon as Britain leaves the European Union’s giant single market and customs union on Jan. 1. The accord failed to secure much of anything for the services sector, for example, which accounts for around four-fifths of the British economy.
And the deal increases barriers rather than eliminating them for the manufacturing sector and agriculture. So while there will be no taxes on the import and export of goods, there will be additional checks on them — so-called nontariff barriers.
Delays at ports — of which Britain just got an ugly foretaste, when France briefly blocked all travelers and freight from Britain — will add significant costs to companies, which will have to make an estimated 20 million new customs declarations each year and face other compliance costs.
“In the long run, it is such a bad deal that the more moderate wing of the Tory Party may try to get a better deal,” said Grant of the Center for European Reform, noting the Conservatives’ traditional link to business.
Yet perhaps the biggest danger for Britain is that it is now stranded awkwardly, half-in, half-out of the European economic system, leaving its relationship with the bloc as fraught and politically combustible as ever.
As a big economy that shares a land border with Ireland, an EU country, Britain will be unable to escape the huge trading bloc’s gravitational pull, any more than other neighbors that stayed aloof from it, experts say.
Switzerland, for example, is in constant, fractious negotiation with the European Union over their relationship.
Pro-Brexit lawmakers will be likely to press the British government to break away from Europe’s standards and laws and to test the limits of regained national sovereignty. That is possible under the agreement, but if the European Union believed any such measures were designed to undercut it, the issue could go to independent arbitration and tariffs could be imposed as a penalty.
Johnson might judge it in his interests to press ahead with contentious rules, either to promote his industrial strategy or to reignite the politically divisive debate over Europe that brought him to power.
Either way, the mechanism established by his deal for resolving trade disputes over diverging economic rules is likely to provide a future flash point. These or other cross-Channel conflicts are certain to be inflamed by the more jingoistic parts of the British tabloid media.
“It means a process of almost permanent negotiation between Britain and the EU,” Grant said, “and every time that happens, it will pump up the emotion and the rhetoric.”

LONDON — There were a few places Roland Le felt comfortable sleeping in London: the doorway of shops he knew were closed and a wooded area near the city’s canal. Still, Le, who became homeless after he lost his job as a cleaner during the pandemic, never quite relaxed.
On Wednesday, Le found himself at ease and in a hotel room of his own, with a bathroom and three meals delivered a day, all courtesy of Crisis U.K., a charity funding the stay.
“I don’t need to watch over my shoulder all the time,” he said on a phone call from his room, adding that interacting with volunteers reminded him of his humanity. “It warms your heart up. They treat us as if we were like any other person.”
Thousands of people sleeping in Britain’s streets have found homes during the coronavirus pandemic, with the government offering 90% of them a place to stay, fulfilling a long-held goal of charities to reduce rising levels of street homelessness. But whether that reprieve will last, charities say, will depend on how much more money the government will give and if it is spent to target systemic barriers to ending homelessness.
On Monday the government pledged another 310 million pounds, about $420 million, to local councils to help support those without homes.
In Newham, which has one of the worst rates of homelessness in the country, money is still available to house those offered temporary accommodations in the first wave of the virus, said Anneke Ziemen, lead outreach manager for the Thames Outreach homeless charity.
But now, the local government was offering less housing, she said, and it did not address barriers to accessing welfare benefits and mental health services.
“It’s a Band-Aid,” she said. “We still have some people on the streets in the moment. We’re just hoping we can take that momentum forward and make some long-term changes.”
This month, with a fast-spreading variant of the coronavirus sweeping the nation, charities who usually offer communal temporary homes at churches and schools have stepped up their efforts, paying for accommodations like hotel rooms to help people avoid the virus.
Crisis U.K. has independently paid for about 500 rooms in four London hotels, and the City Hall of London said it had provided another 500. Combined with the efforts of other groups, it means many of the thousands of so-called rough sleepers in Greater London — about 3,400, according to a summer census — will spend the Christmas and New Year holidays, if not longer, under cover.
Tighter restrictions spurred by the new variant of the coronavirus have made it even more urgent to get people inside, said Steve Douglas, chief executive of St. Mungo’s, another charity that has supported more than 3,000 people sleeping on the streets since the pandemic began. “If you are rough sleeping on the streets and looking at 0 degree temperatures and the threat of COVID — it is difficult to see hope,” he said.
Aid workers and advocates said that even though there remained concerns about keeping people housed long term, they see reason for some optimism.
“Clearly we’ve seen the government take action, and the number of people experiencing homelessness has reduced because of that,” said Jon Sparkes, chief executive of Crisis U.K. “It certainly shows what can be achieved if there’s political will.”
At the hotels booked by Crisis U.K., guests can stay for two weeks and choose to self-isolate in their rooms if they wish, and meals are delivered three times a day. They also have access to technology and virtual activities, from yoga and fitness classes to sessions on living with drug and alcohol addiction and resume writing.
Sparkes said that during their stay, volunteers would work to help secure guests more permanent housing. “Some people will end up still rough-sleeping after Christmas, but we will do absolutely everything we can to help avoid that,” he said.
For Paul Redford, 52, who was offered housing by Crisis U.K. during the first wave of the pandemic and has since moved to a studio funded by the government, accepting temporary accommodation helped him get his bearings. He is now working as a volunteer in the Crisis warehouse and applying for jobs.
“It’s the happiest I’ve ever been in my life,” he said. “It’s a step in the ladder.”
Le said a nervous breakdown four years ago led him to move out of a shared apartment. He had been living in communal housing, working as a cleaner in Cardiff, Wales, when the coronavirus hit. “I just couldn’t keep it together mentally,” he said.
Since arriving at the hotel this week, Le said he has spent his time watching anime and science-fiction films on Netflix. He wants to write poetry and has asked for pencils to draw with. He has unpacked his clothes and other memorabilia, usually stuffed in one rucksack.
Le said previous organizations had tried to get him housed when he lived on the street, but he had refused out of pride. Age, however, had humbled him.
“I’m trying my best to be a better person each day,” he said.

ATLANTA — The Rev. Raphael G. Warnock and Jon Ossoff, the Democratic challengers in the Senate runoffs in Georgia, have each raised more than $100 million since October — enormous sums that surpassed their Republican opponents by a significant margin and underscored Democrats’ confidence after recent gains the party has made in the state and their hopes that they might capture the Senate.
The contests have drawn a surge of attention and investment from outside of Georgia, given the stakes, and the campaigning has only intensified in the final weeks before the runoff, which is scheduled for Jan. 5.
Sen. David Perdue, one of the Republican incumbents, raised $68 million in the period from Oct. 15 to Dec. 16, according to reports to the Federal Election Commission made public Thursday. Sen. Kelly Loeffler, the other Republican, raised close to $64 million during that period.
Ossoff, who is running against Perdue, became the best-funded Senate candidate in history after pulling in $106.7 million, according to the filings, and Warnock, who is challenging Loeffler, has raised $103.3 million.
The Democrats’ haul was powered in large part by a flurry of smaller donations collected from across the country, filings show, with nearly half of the funds coming from people who donated less than $200.
For Perdue and Loeffler, the smaller donations accounted for less than 30% of what they raised.
Ossoff, who runs a media production company, spent $93.5 million during that period and had $17.4 million in cash on hand, and Warnock, the pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, spent $86.1 million and had $22.7 million in cash on hand. Perdue spent $57.8 million and had $16 million in cash, and Loeffler spent $48.6 million and had $21.2 million in cash on hand.
Loeffler, one of the wealthiest members of the Senate, was the only candidate to give to his or her own campaign, donating $333,200 — far less than the $23 million of her own money she spent on the general election run.
The numbers in the filings only affirm a level of investment that has been plainly visible to Georgia voters for months. Campaign ads fill virtually every commercial break on television and radio. The spending has even spilled over state lines, as the candidates and outside groups have bought time in markets like Jacksonville, Florida, and Chattanooga, Tennessee, to reach Georgia voters living nearby.
The amounts brought in by both Democrats exceeded the $57 million raised by Jaime Harrison in his campaign in South Carolina against Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, which had been the highest quarterly fundraising total for any Senate candidate in U.S. history. Yet the race ended up as a disappointment for Democrats, demonstrating that record-breaking hauls do not necessarily translate to electoral success.
But in Georgia, Democrats have been buoyed by a string of recent success in a state that had until recently been reliably Republican. President-elect Joe Biden was the first Democratic presidential candidate to win in Georgia since 1992.
Biden and President Donald Trump have traveled to campaign for their party’s candidates. Vice President-elect Kamala Harris and Ivanka Trump, the president’s eldest daughter, both made campaign stops in Georgia last week.
The Democrats have focused on stock trades their opponents made while serving in the Senate and their support of Trump in his efforts to overturn his loss in Georgia.
The Republicans have largely homed in on Warnock, with Loeffler calling him a “radical liberal” more than a dozen times in a recent televised debate. Her campaign has also circulated select quotations from his more than two decades of sermons, including an instance where he said “nobody can serve God and the military,” a theme that has roots in biblical passages.
A coalition of African American pastors issued an open letter to Loeffler last week condemning her campaign for what they saw as an attack on the Black church. Political observers in Georgia have also argued that she has damaged the relationship Republicans had fostered with Ebenezer, the congregation that was once led by Martin Luther King Jr.
Yet in messages on Christmas, a day mostly free of campaigning, Loeffler and Warnock sounded a similar note, describing the turbulence of the past year and envisioning a turn for the better.
“With Christmas comes new light and new hope,” Loeffler said in a video she posted on social media.
“I know too many are brokenhearted tonight,” Warnock said in his own post on Twitter, “and the holidays don’t seem to make it any better. It’s been nighttime for a long time, and it may feel like Christmas may never come. But fear not. Dawn is coming. Good news and hope are on the horizon.”

LOS ANGELES — If this were any other year, members of the Los Angeles Opera would have been singing Christmas carols this week in the wards of Martin Luther King Jr. Community Hospital, which serves the largely poor and Latino communities of South Los Angeles. Instead, a street choir from Skid Row stepped in with a video to bring holiday cheer to the growing number of dying coronavirus patients and traumatized staff.
Inside the hospital, so many patients are streaming in that gurneys have been placed in the gift shop, and the entire lobby is now a space to treat patients. The waiting room is a tent outside.
“Everything is backed up all the way to the street,” said Dr. Oscar Casillas, medical director of the hospital’s emergency department, which is set up to serve about 30 people at a time but over the last week has seen more than 100 patients per day.
In the High Desert region northeast of Los Angeles, health care workers at one hospital are getting their first shots of a coronavirus vaccine in a cheerful conference room decked out in holiday decorations. There is Christmas music and “Home Alone 2” playing on a screen. Yet as soon as the needle is out of their arms, there is the next “code blue,” or the next FaceTime goodbye to arrange between a dying patient and a grieving family.
“Every day is scary,” said Lisa Thompson, an intensive care nurse at the hospital, Providence St. Mary Medical Center in Apple Valley. “We’re all stressed before we even come to work. Tons and tons of patients. We can’t even keep up with the amount of patients coming into the hospital.”
In increasingly urgent tones this week, health officials and political leaders in Southern California have called on people to stay home for the holidays, desperately hoping to forestall another surge in infections, on top of the current crisis that came after Thanksgiving.
Barbara Ferrer, director of the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, said the only way to “pay tribute to the fundamental spirit of the holidays” was to stay home.
But so far very little has slowed the spread of the virus.
Each day in California, which this week became the first state to reach 2 million recorded virus cases, brings a mind-numbing new accounting of the tragedy underway — more cases, more sickness, more death. Southern California, the most populous area of the most populous state, is on the edge of catastrophe. In Los Angeles County, a vast region whose population is roughly the size of Michigan’s, there are roughly 6,500 people hospitalized with COVID-19, a fourfold increase over the last month. The number of patients in intensive care units is close to 1,300, double what it was a month ago.
And the county Thursday reported 146 new deaths, according to a New York Times database, the equivalent of about one every 10 minutes and its highest total of the pandemic. Nearly every hospital has surged past its capacity, putting new beds in any space it can find and preparing for the possibility it will have to ration care — essentially making wrenchingly difficult decisions about who dies and who lives.
But the availability of beds is not even the most urgent concern. With so many employees falling sick or taking leave after months of treating coronavirus patients, hospitals are struggling to find enough workers.
“In the beginning, especially, you saw all these pictures and videos from New York and you think, ‘Oh my God, it can never get that bad here,’ ” said Mendy Hickey, quality director at St. Mary’s. “And while we have all the supplies we need, it is that bad here, and we have no staff to take care of patients."
Hickey, a former nurse, has lately taken on shifts caring for patients in intensive care, on top of her administrative duties, sometimes working 23 hours in a day. She was planning to work late Christmas Eve and hopes to spend at least Christmas morning with her three daughters before returning to the hospital.
As the holiday season has collided with the height of the pandemic in Southern California, there is little joy for the health care workers on the front lines, who are bracing for the near certainty that things will only get worse. California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, has projected that hospitalizations would reach close to 100,000 in January if residents do not lock down for the holidays. On Thursday, California reported 351 deaths.
“I can only imagine what is going to happen after Christmas and New Year’s if we don’t get the community educated on how to stay home and be safe,” said Thompson, the nurse at St. Mary’s.
Judging by what she sees in her community after another traumatizing day in the intensive care unit, she is not optimistic.
“We’re all talking about the middle of January for when we’re expecting to see a major surge from both holidays,” she said. “It’s kind of scary.”
California was the first state to impose a lockdown in the spring and for a while seemed to be managing the pandemic much better then other places. But as it faces the crisis it has long feared, the pain is being spread unevenly.
In South Los Angeles, where Martin Luther King Jr. Community Hospital serves low-income communities populated with grocery clerks and bus drivers who live in crowded households and are forced to mix with the public every day, infection rates are far higher. In Los Angeles County, roughly 15% of coronavirus tests in recent days are positive; at a testing site on the hospital’s campus, the rate is about 25%.
As a result, the burden of the surge is much heavier at that hospital than those in wealthier areas of Los Angeles. According to recent statistics, 66% of the hospital’s capacity was taken up by COVID-19 patients — making it, in effect, the epicenter of the epicenter. Across town, on the whiter and richer West Side, 11% of Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center’s bed capacity was filled with coronavirus patients.
Officials at Martin Luther King Jr. Community Hospital, where most patients are on Medicaid or uninsured, say they are struggling to transfer patients to bigger hospitals when they need a high level of care, such as neurosurgery or a cardiac procedure.
“What we see is a significant difference between patients who have commercial insurance versus Medicaid,” said Dr. Elaine Batchlor, the hospital’s chief executive. “Those with commercial insurance get out faster.”
She added: “We’ve had a lot of talk about systemic racism and social justice, and everybody says they want to do something about it, but our health care system is a huge reflection of separate and unequal. And the COVID pandemic is highlighting the same patterns.”
Thompson, who some days has been working from 7 a.m. until midnight, is thankful to have Christmas Day off and will spend it with her four children. Her parents, who live nearby but whom she has not mingled with during the pandemic, will be on Zoom.
But the holiday will only be a brief respite, and she is scheduled to work over New Year’s, handing a surge with no end in sight.
“Trying to work all this overtime and then trying to keep up with all the death and dying and trying to keep a straight face and keep moving forward, it’s exhausting,” she said.

LONDON — It was one more reminder, delivered before dawn on Christmas morning, that Britain is not only an island nation, but one that finds itself increasingly alone.
A decision by the United States to require all airline passengers arriving from Britain to test negative for the coronavirus within 72 hours of their departure, starting Monday, was not so much a shock as it was another bitter pill in a somber holiday season.
There is the fast spread of a coronavirus variant feared to be more contagious. Dozens of nations have barred travelers from Britain from entering. Expanded lockdowns in the country will include 48 million people by Saturday. And thousands of trucks remain stranded along England’s coast even after France lifted a brief border blockade imposed over virus concerns.
Adding to the volatility was a last-minute Brexit deal with the European Union, which kept Britain from crashing out of the bloc without an agreement in place but was all the same a painful reminder of a decision that has divided the country.
Then there was Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s holiday message, which warned against “snogging under the mistletoe.”
Although a refrain of Brexit supporters was that they were driven by a desire for Britain to “take back control,” the nation’s immediate destiny is being shaped by forces beyond any individual’s control — and perhaps none more so than the coronavirus.
The rapid spread of the virus variant — which government statistics indicate accounts for half of all cases currently in England — led to the lockdown of London and southern England this week. Starting Saturday, it will include an even wider swath of the country, and a national lockdown has not been ruled out.
“I know that it’s been very, very tough over the last few weeks, and, I must tell people, it will continue to be difficult,” Johnson said Thursday.
Many countries already require a negative coronavirus test for entry, and the new U.S. restrictions are less severe than the near-total bans that about 50 nations have placed on travelers from Britain. But with the country typically serving as a connection hub for passengers traveling between Europe and the United States, it was another blow to its battered airlines, which have slashed flight after flight as governments suspended travel.
The usual flood of traffic between the United States and Britain had already suffered a precipitous decline. More than 4.8 million British residents visited the United States in 2019, according to the Office of National Statistics.
And whereas in February Heathrow Airport attributed over 1 million passengers to the North American market, since then the figure has plummeted, falling to 81,713 last month, according to data compiled by the airport.
Britain’s Foreign and Commonwealth offices updated their travel advice Friday to include the new testing requirement. Those looking to travel will have to provide the result of either a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test — which must be sent to a lab and can take several days to process — or the rapid antigen test, a relatively new tool that gives a result in about 30 minutes.
With many private clinics and labs closed for Christmas on Friday, testing within the 72-hour window may prove difficult for those looking to travel immediately after the holiday. Price may also be a factor: Heathrow Airport charges about $130 for PCR results with 48 hours and about $60 dollars for antigen tests with results within 45 minutes, and private clinics charge even more for both tests.
Both tests are offered at many major British airports, including Heathrow, Gatwick, Manchester Airport and London Luton. But because passengers need to register in advance for tests, it was unclear how many would be able to get one — and then get a result — in time.
Nonessential travel will also be banned within much of Britain starting Saturday.
Despite the restrictions, there is concern that the variant, which mounting scientific evidence indicates is more contagious, is probably spreading far more widely than previously known. And because few countries employ the level of genomic surveillance that Britain does, it could have already been spreading undetected for weeks.
A woman who flew into Germany on Sunday — hours before the country put in place a travel ban — tested positive for the variant, German health officials said Thursday. It was the first case identified in the country, but because the variant has been spreading since at least September, experts said it was probably not the first case there.
Singapore also announced that it had detected a case Thursday.
And Denmark, which has wider genomic surveillance than many other countries, detected 33 cases of the variant between Nov. 14 and Dec. 14, according to Danish health authorities.
The concern about the variant that led to bans on travel also prompted France to blockade the English Channel for 48 hours. Although that order was lifted Wednesday, a subsequent push to test thousands of drivers for the virus as a condition to enter France has proved a logistical nightmare.
By Thursday, the transportation secretary, Grant Shapps, said that of the 2,367 drivers tested, three were positive. Thousands more remain to be tested, and Britain’s military has sent an additional 800 soldiers to assist the 300 already there to aid health workers conducting the screenings.
As concern deepened in the drivers’ home nations, including Poland, that country’s defense minister said in a tweet that a team of soldiers would be sent to England to help get citizens home.
For an exhausted and exasperated British public, the usual amusements of the holiday season were hard to come by.
Even the queen’s annual Christmas speech became the subject of controversy when one national broadcaster, Channel 4, used the holiday to offer a “warning” about the dangers of “deepfake” videos by presenting a five-minute fake version of the address.
In it, the fake queen bemoans the departure of Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, for the United States and alludes to the Duke of York’s decision to step down from royal duties this year after giving an interview to the BBC about his connection to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
The BBC’s royal correspondent, Nicholas Witchell, was not impressed.
“There have been countless imitations of the queen,” he said. “This isn’t a particularly good one.”
The real Queen Elizabeth II was separated from most of her family Friday, spending Christmas at Windsor Castle with her husband, Prince Philip, rather than Sandringham, as is their usual tradition.
When she did address the nation, she offered some historical perspective, citing the example of Florence Nightingale, born two centuries ago this year.
“Florence Nightingale shone a lamp of hope across the world,” the queen said. “Today, our front-line services still shine that lamp for us — supported by the amazing achievements of modern science — and we owe them a debt of gratitude. We continue to be inspired by the kindness of strangers and draw comfort that even on the darkest nights, there is hope in the new dawn.”

OLYMPIC VALLEY, Calif. — A trickle of skiers recently zigzagged down the slopes at the Squaw Valley Ski Resort. Couples and families wandered through the resort’s village, which was decorated with golden Christmas lights and frosted with snow.
It looked like the beginning of a merry season. But a closer inspection revealed it was anything but.
Restaurant patios were nearly empty as masked workers swept through with lime green disinfectant sprayers strapped to their backs, part of the $1 million that Squaw Valley has spent on sanitizing equipment and other safety measures. At ski lifts, sparse groups waited in socially distant lines. The resort felt “so dead,” said a skier, Sabrina Nottingham, partly because it was limiting ticket sales to fewer than 50% of the norm.
Squaw Valley, a marquee destination for winter sports enthusiasts, is one of many ski resorts across the country bracing for a highly unpredictable season. Forced to rethink how to operate in the coronavirus pandemic and with vaccines still rolling out, resorts have made a plethora of changes in places such as Aspen, Colorado; Park City, Utah; Taos Ski Valley, New Mexico; and Killington, Vermont. Many are setting visitor restrictions and requiring ticket reservations; New Mexico has limited resorts to 25% of capacity.
Resorts are also minimizing in-person interactions by installing kiosks for ticket pickups, adding space between people in line for ski lifts and gondolas, requiring masks, limiting the number of people on a lift at once and, in some places, shutting down indoor dining.
While the pandemic has dealt a heavy blow to the entire travel industry, ski resorts may feel a disproportionate impact this winter because of their short window of business. The ski industry already took a hit in the spring when the pandemic struck and many resorts had to close early, leading to $2 billion in losses and causing layoffs or furloughs of thousands of employees, according to the National Ski Areas Association, a trade group. The industry saw its lowest number of visits, 51 million, since the 2011-12 season, the association said.
Now resorts such as Squaw Valley are setting their expectations low for the new ski season.
“I don’t think that anybody in the business is looking to have this be their best year ever,” said Ron Cohen, president of Squaw Valley and neighboring Alpine Meadows, which laid off 2,000 seasonal workers in the spring. “We want to preserve our businesses so that when COVID’s over, we have the opportunity to not have suffered so much damage that maybe we can’t stand back up.”
Mike Pierce, a spokesperson for Mount Rose Ski Tahoe, a resort in western Nevada, said the mindset was “to just maintain status quo and survive.” He declined to provide any financials but said, “If we break even, that’s almost considered a success.”
Even before the pandemic, the ski industry was laboring to build interest in the sport. The number of skiers has stagnated in the past decade, according to the National Ski Areas Association. Adrienne Isaac, a spokesperson for the trade group, said resorts have tried to make skiing and snowboarding more accessible for newcomers but have grappled with perceptions that they primarily cater to the rich and white. Climate change also continues to affect snowfall, she said, which can lead to shorter seasons.
How the ski resorts do this winter will have a domino effect on tax revenues for state economies. In New Mexico, the truncated ski season last winter and this spring generated $41 million in taxes, but George Brooks, executive director of the state’s ski association, said he expected no more than 40% of that number in the coming months.
Vail Resorts, the world’s largest ski company with 37 resorts around the globe, including 34 in the United States, reported in an earnings call Dec. 10 that it lost $153 million from August through October, wider than the loss of $106.5 million in the same period a year ago. Rob Katz, chief executive of Vail Resorts, said that season pass sales were up about 20%, but he expected fewer visitors and less revenue this winter than in previous seasons.
For smaller resorts, the pain may not be as severe. The Diamond Peak Ski Resort in Incline Village, Nevada, said it came out about $1 million ahead of projections after the spring shutdown. Mike Bandelin, the resort’s general manager, said smaller resorts often operate at a loss in the final weeks of the season, so closing early actually saved money.
Many resorts said they still expected some die-hard skiers and powderhounds to show up this winter, along with locals and those who have relocated to second homes nearby. At the Winter Park Resort west of Denver, a crush of eager skiers on opening weekend this month caused crowding at lift lines. The resort quickly enacted measures to allow more spacing, said Jen Miller, a spokesperson.
But the visitors who will not come, the resorts and other ski experts said, are most likely casual skiers and those traveling from long distances.
“We’re going to lose the mom and pop that want to bring their kids up,” Brooks said.
In Colorado, the Aspen Skiing Co., which operates four ski areas, has had steady business since reopening Nov. 25 but will miss out on the 20% of its yearly visitors who come from other countries, a spokesperson, Jeff Hanle, said. He said Aspen might also see fewer out-of-state travelers, especially if they live in places where they have to isolate upon their return.
“You’ve got to be a pretty dedicated skier to say, ‘I’m going to go ski, and I know when I go home, I’ve got to quarantine,’” he said.
Even if resorts make it through the winter, smaller businesses that rely on skiers coming to town — like restaurants, hotels and retail stores — might not be so lucky.
At the Stratton Mountain Resort in Stratton, Vermont, an Irish pub called Mulligan’s has laid off half its staff. Since visitors to Vermont, which gets 80% of its ski traffic from other states, have to quarantine for either one or two weeks before they can go anywhere, the owner of Mulligan’s, Tom Rose, said he expected to lose up to 60% of his normal winter sales.
“We survived Hurricane Irene. Our sales took a real dive after 9/11. We’ve made it through the Great Recession,” Rose said. But “this pandemic is by far the worst.”
There are some bright spots. Backcountry skiing, or ski touring — which often involves climbing secluded, snowy mountain ranges — is booming. Backcountry equipment sales jumped 76% from August through October compared with the same time a year ago, according to the NPD Group.
“The COVID environment that favors outdoor, socially distant recreation activities, coupled with the restrictions in place at ski resorts, has accelerated the interest in backcountry skiing this season,” said Eric Henderson, a spokesperson for Snowsports Industries America, a trade group.
Those who have made the trips to the resorts said they were glad they made the effort. At Squaw Valley recently, Nottingham, 21, who was visiting with other students from California State University, San Luis Obispo, said that even though the resort was quiet, the experience “felt more safe than going into a grocery store because everyone’s all covered up anyway.”
Squaw Valley, which opened in 1949 and hosted the 1960 Winter Olympics, has undergone significant changes in recent years. In 2010, it was bought by a private equity group called KSL Capital Partners and merged with neighboring Alpine Meadows the following year. Combined, the two resorts stretch for 6,000 acres, the most of any in the Lake Tahoe area, and have 42 lifts and more than 270 trails.
In August, Squaw Valley said it would change its name by 2021 because “squaw” is considered a racist and sexist term for Native American women.
But nothing the resort has been through has rivaled the chaos of the pandemic, Cohen said. While he declined to disclose the financials for Squaw and Alpine, he described the losses in the spring as “devastating” and said the resorts were “operating at lower profit margins” this winter, with weaker sales.
The disruption became doubly evident this month when a new stay-at-home order took effect in the area, forcing resorts to cancel hotel stays and adding another wrinkle for potential visitors.
For ski resorts, the mantra right now is “stay alive and survive,” Cohen said.

Texto completo: Nearly a decade of hype led to a troubled release riddled with glitches, a livid fan base, refunds for potentially millions of players and a possible class-action lawsuit.
The hype around Cyberpunk 2077 had been building for nearly a decade.
When CD Projekt Red, the Polish studio behind the video game, announced the title in 2012, it was billed as a gripping, free-flowing saga that would immerse players in a lifelike sci-fi universe. Since then, fans have been treated to impressive teaser trailers, buy-in from celebrities including Keanu Reeves, Grimes and ASAP Rocky, and headlines heralding it as the most anticipated title of the year, if not the century.
The game is set in a dystopian future where digital nomads navigate a high-stakes world of corporate espionage (with Mr. Reeves as their guide) and augment their bodies with high-tech weaponry. Players, especially those using next-generation consoles from Sony and Microsoft, were promised a revolutionary experience, with extensive character customization options and an expansive world to explore. Eight million people pre-ordered copies, sight unseen, ahead of its December release.
In July 2018, as anticipation for the game neared a crescendo across Twitter, one user tweeted at the official Cyberpunk 2077 account: "Will there be memes in the game?" The account responded: "Whole game is going to be a meme."
The tweet was somewhat prescient -- but not in the way developers had hoped.
Since the release of Cyberpunk 2077 on Dec. 10, thousands of gamers have created viral videos featuring a multitude of glitches and bugs -- many hilarious -- that mar the game. They include tiny trees covering the floors of buildings, tanks falling from the sky and characters standing up, inexplicably pantless, while riding motorcycles.
These videos depict a game that is virtually unplayable: rife with errors, populated by characters running on barely functional artificial intelligence, and largely incompatible with the older gaming consoles meant to support it. Fans are livid.
So many gamers demanded refunds from distributors this week that they overwhelmed Sony's customer service representatives and even briefly took down one of its corporate sites. In response, Sony and Microsoft said they would offer full refunds to anyone who purchased Cyberpunk 2077 through their online stores; Sony even pulled the title.
Cyberpunk's rollout is one of the most visible disasters in the history of video games -- a high-profile flameout in the midst of the holiday shopping season by a studio widely considered an industry darling. It shows the pitfalls gaming studios can face when building so-called Triple-A games, titles backed by years of development and hundreds of millions of dollars.
But it is also a tale that insiders said they saw coming for months, based on CD Projekt Red's history of game development and warning signs that Cyberpunk 2077 might not live up to its sky-high expectations.
The View From Warsaw
CD Projekt Red was founded in Warsaw in the 1990s by two high school friends, Marcin Iwiński and Michał Kiciński, during a time of transformation and growth in the gaming industry. (CD-ROM discs were a novel innovation back then.) The two began importing games from the United States, and essentially repackaging and republishing them in Poland.
"By the time school was out we had both become truants, skipping classes to play games," Mr. Iwiński said in an oral history of the studio.
Early employees who spoke to The New York Times described the company's leaders as deft marketers, storytellers and artistic visionaries. They said that their enthusiasm for their games often ran ahead of their engineering and technical prowess. The employees spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal.
The company's ambitions were astronomical early on, as were some of its failures. In the early aughts, CD Projekt Red made a play to develop The Witcher, a popular series of books by the Polish writer Andrzej Sapkowski, into an immersive video game franchise.
But the first Witcher game, released in 2007, was buggy and stuffed with more features than it could support. Former employees who worked on the game said it would take three to five minutes to load basic screens.
Employees said that during game development, there was a general attitude of building more things themselves rather than sometimes licensing other so-called "middleware" -- or supporting software -- from other companies with greater expertise. As a result, the developers created worse versions of features that had been perfected by other companies.
Still, the Witcher series gained the studio an early following and fan base. The studio received the most acclaim for The Witcher 3, which won awards for its detailed universe and rich storytelling. Like earlier titles, it was buggy from the outset, frustrating players. But most fans accepted what they saw as a kind of test-and-release culture around CD Projekt Red games: a willingness to put out projects that were not yet problem-free.
Smoke and Mirrors on the Marketing Front
Then came Cyberpunk 2077. First announced in 2012 and based loosely on a tabletop role-playing game created in 1988, the title was CD Projekt Red's first attempt at creating a new, futuristic world.
It was to be set in Night City, a darkly dystopian megacity where humans and machines were fused together and repackaged as mercenaries, carrying out sabotage missions against evil corporations. The game would combine elements from some of sci-fi's greatest hits: Strange Days meets Blade Runner meshed with The Matrix.
To hammer that point home, CD Projekt Red cast a familiar famous face in the game: Keanu Reeves. At a development conference in 2019, the actor burst onto the stage in a cloud of smoke after a video revealed his character.
"Let me tell you, the feeling of being there, of walking the streets of the future, is really going to be breathtaking," Mr. Reeves said at the event. (A spokeswoman for Mr. Reeves did not respond to a request for comment.)
Inside CD Projekt Red, it was a very different story. Developers were increasingly concerned with some of the grand promises being made by management on the promotional marketing tour. Far into the game's development, former employees said, the hyper-customizable and endlessly explorable world being sold to players was nowhere close to manifesting.
By 2019, chatter began to circulate in Polish game development circles that CD Projekt Red was way behind schedule with Cyberpunk 2077, even with a release date set for the following April. Some saw the departure of top executives -- including key board members -- as major warning signs.
On Glassdoor, a site where people can rate their previous employers, current and former CD Projekt Red workers said there was chaos behind the scenes: Office rumors spreading on Discord servers, misleading deadlines set by managers, infighting among the company's top brass, and incompetence and poor planning leading to unnecessary "crunch," a term for overworking employees to produce games under a tight deadline. Longtime engineering staff left the company as a result of overwork.
"The owners treat the company as a machine to earn money, and do not see employees as people but more like data in the table," one former employee wrote on the site.
Delay, Delay, Delay
This January, CD Projekt Red tweeted that the game's release had been delayed until Sept. 17, because there was "still work to be done." Then, in March, the coronavirus pandemic caused CD Projekt Red to send its work force home.
Though the company said remote work would not hurt Cyberpunk's chances of a September release, executives eventually announced further delays. The game was pushed to Nov. 19 in order to "fix a lot of bugs." It was the same story in October, when the game's release date was pushed to Dec. 10, at the height of the holiday shopping season.
Inside CD Projekt Red, as executives and communications staff geared up for a wide release, the problems were evident. While developers had created a functioning game for PC users, Cyberpunk was glitchy and crashed frequently on next-generation consoles like the PlayStation 5 and the new Xbox devices. Even worse, the game barely ran on older consoles like the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
Typically, game developers send early copies of new titles to reviewers with ample lead time. But CD Projekt Red kept Cyberpunk 2077 under wraps for as long as it could. The company only shared advance copies of the PC version with gaming publications and news organizations, previewing the best possible version of Cyberpunk to reviewers who would post their ratings online just days before the game's release.
For months, reviewers, including those at The New York Times, tried to obtain review copies for the new game consoles released by Sony and Microsoft this year. Stephanie Bayer, a spokeswoman for CD Projekt Red, said in a previous email correspondence that the company would "hold off sending our console codes until close to launch" so that they could "send them securely." That never happened.
Early reviews mentioned some issues with bugs, but the impressions were largely positive. Excitement continued to build until the game was released on Thursday, Dec. 10.
Eager fans were thrilled to finally be playing the game for the first time. Ashley Shoate, a D.J. in Northville, Mich., said she was amazed at the detail on her PlayStation 5, and loved the ability to customize her character, literally, to the teeth.
Then came the bugs. Ms. Shoate said it was impossible for her character to complete basic tasks like running, dodging and picking up weapons. Steering a car was so challenging that she felt like she was "drunk driving." On one mission, Ms. Shoate had to sneak up and kill an enemy with a katana sword.
"I'm bringing a knife to a gunfight, so I've got to be on my P's and Q's. I can't even do that," she said. "It's almost unplayable." For the time being, she's shelved the game.
"I really thought it was going to be to that level of top-three game ever on a new console," she said. "It's very disappointing."
Billy Marte, an account executive at a software company in Austin, Texas, said he bought into the high expectations and the commercials with Mr. Reeves. Playing on his PC, he loved the story line and missions, but was often frustrated by glitches that made his character stand up while riding a motorcycle, or forced him to backtrack to an earlier saved game. Some of his friends, he said, had decided to return Cyberpunk.
"There was so much there, but they just didn't pay attention to the details," he said. "It's evident that this game was rushed."
'You Get What You Pay For'
Almost as soon as the game arrived, players began posting screenshots of the most glaring glitches on social media. Entire subreddits are now devoted to the frequent, nonsensical bugs users observed as they traversed deeper into Night City.
One frequent glitch includes characters going into "T-Pose" -- standing with their arms raised to either side -- and suddenly losing their pants. Users on Reddit described the phenomenon as "straight Donald Duckin' it."
Other bloopers include characters being flung through buildings seemingly out of nowhere and cars exploding for no reason. The non-player characters, or N.P.C.s, act so unnaturally that they can ruin the gaming experience.
One Reddit user posted a video of him throwing a grenade into the middle of a freeway at rush hour, only to see every N.P.C. open their car doors, leave their vehicles and crouch for cover simultaneously, as if choreographed by a professional dance troupe. (Someone else quickly edited the video to mimic the opening scene from "La La Land," in which drivers abandon their vehicles to dance in the middle of the freeway.)
"I don't think I've ever seen a game have this many gaffes, this often, this early into a release," said Chris Person, a video producer who runs Highlight Reel, a YouTube show dedicated to video game bloopers and glitches. "Broken games can be super charming when they're funny, like you're seeing the strings on a puppet in a bad movie." Two of Mr. Person's most recent shows have been dedicated almost entirely to Cyberpunk glitches.
Most players, though, are pretty unhappy. On Thursday, Sony said it would refund players who wanted to return the game and pulled Cyberpunk from the company's digital storefront. A PlayStation spokesman said the company had nothing further to add beyond its decision. Microsoft also said on Friday that it would issue refunds, but did not remove the game from its online store.
CD Projekt Red said Friday that it would refund disappointed players "out of our own pocket if necessary." The company's stock has dropped 41 percent since early December. Ms. Bayer, the company spokeswoman, declined to comment on a detailed list of questions provided by The Times.
Inside the studio, there has been infighting and finger-pointing. In a contentious meeting with board members on Thursday, CD Projekt Red staffers pressed executives on the game's unrealistic deadlines and false promises. Management was tight-lipped about its tense discussions with Sony, Bloomberg reported on Friday, though people at Sony are upset at CD Projekt Red's initial handling of the situation, people close to the company said.
The immediate future looks dark for Cyberpunk's makers -- perhaps even darker than the future they built in Night City. Refund requests are pouring in by the thousands. Lawyers and investors in Warsaw are circling the situation, contemplating a class-action lawsuit against the company for what one attorney described as potential criminal "misrepresentation in order to receive financial benefits." Many gamers are swearing off playing Cyberpunk entirely until the company fixes all of the problems.
The coming weeks will determine whether CD Projekt Red can make good on a promise it made back in 2017, when players wondered whether the title would ever come out. "Worry not," the company tweeted, assuring fans that Cyberpunk 2077 would be "huge" and "story-driven."
"No hidden catch, you get what you pay for."

Texto completo: Even without a deadly virus, finding the right place for her felt like facing a slate of rotten choices.
I never imagined that my sister, who has long had trouble with her mobility, would move to a nursing home in a global pandemic. At 37, she is relatively young. But this fall, she developed a serious infection that worsened her health problems. So I found myself shopping for a facility that can provide her with the care she needs to recover.
Like many Americans, I had long been under the optimistic delusion that I was years away from needing to consider nursing home care. I always thought, I'll cross that bridge when I get to it.
Well, I'm here. In a pandemic.
At the pandemic's onset, my family worried about my 78-year-old father, with his emphysema, high blood pressure and history of cancer. But like so many others , we now fear that the place that provides my sister with round-the-clock skilled nursing and physical therapy could also put her at risk for dying from Covid if another outbreak were to occur. As it is, since March, my sister's 120-bed facility in New York City has reported five confirmed and seven presumed Covid-19 deaths.
I'm not normally a fan of euphemism, but calling her nursing home a "facility" somehow makes me feel better. Euphemism also dulls my terror of pandemic math: The virus has killed over 313,000 Americans, more than 106,000 of whom were nursing home residents and staff members.
Even without a deadly virus, finding the right facility for my sister felt like facing a slate of rotten choices. My sister's medical issues, including serious mental illness and morbid obesity, complicated her placement. None of the facilities in Manhattan, closer to home, would take her. So her hospital social worker applied to every nursing home in the city, as if she were entering my sister into some bizarre college admissions process.
Facing some pressure to expedite her discharge from the hospital, we had a day and a half to select a facility, sight unseen, where my sister might live for weeks, months or years. Any relief I felt when her acceptances rolled in evaporated when I scrolled through Medicare inspection reports and online reviews from family members, residents and workers. Another sister helped me sift through complaints ranging from abusive and neglectful (sexual abuse, scores of miserable workers) to lower-grade (dirty floors, bad food).
We eventually selected a facility in Queens, in the Rockaways, with mostly lower-level complaints -- with the exception of one resident who was charged with murdering his roommate in 2013, an incident we had no choice but to hope was an isolated tragedy. After I had a good conversation with the director, the hospital social worker processed the paperwork. My sister was admitted the day before Halloween.
In the time since, I have made the long subway ride from Manhattan to the Rockaways, with its old-school pizzerias and salty breeze, to drop off things for her: underwear, art supplies, shampoo, fuzzy socks. With three staff Covid cases since her admission, I've been able to see my sister only through her bedroom window.
My sister's comfort with this transition has made the situation more bearable. She says repeatedly, "I think I want to stay a while." She cannot leave the building because of Covid restrictions but keeps "very busy" with her art, physical therapy and friendly chats with other residents and staff. I smile at her newfound sociability, a welcome reprieve from the debilitating isolation she experienced earlier in the year.
In early December, I brought a small Christmas tree and a few items my sister wanted to give to "people who don't have anyone to bring them anything" -- holiday cards, perfume, chocolate coins for an old man who celebrates Hanukkah. We talked on the phone as I stood outside under my umbrella, waves churning behind me. From her second-floor window, she chuckled that I look like a forecaster from the weather channel and entertained me with dispatches from her new world, telling me about a nurse's patience with an agitated Russian-speaking woman. It was hard to wave goodbye.
Walking past a line of nursing homes along the boardwalk as I headed back home, I wished I could deliver to my sister more than meager holiday cheer.
What I really want for my sister, and the 1.3 million or so nursing home residents in America, is large-scale reform that can help improve care, reduce infection spread and save lives. I want increased funding for Medicare and Medicaid, major payers for long-term care. I want better pay and benefits for workers, sufficient personal protective equipment and staffing.
Based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations for vaccine priority, my sister could be among the first to receive a shot. But the vaccine isn't a cure-all for the long-term care crisis. This pandemic has emphasized just how little we value the lives of the old, sick and disabled, and the increasingly burned-out workers -- many, people of color -- who care for them.
From the difficult choices we faced searching for a nursing home to the strain many nursing home workers face, I've seen how our health care system runs more like a business that in its quest to pinch pennies, hemorrhages dollars and precious lives.
Health care ought to be a sacred and inalienable right. Above all, I wish we'd treat it that way.

Texto completo: Long before I worked at The New York Times, my friends and I leaned on the Books section for holiday cheer. We still do.
For the past few years, four of my friends and I have taken part in a Secret Santa book swap, turning to The New York Times's annual 100 Notable Books list for selections. We comb the titles, flagging a few we might like and imagining which ones we would pick for one another.
In college, when we were all still in the same city, we would steal an hour between writing final papers to celebrate and share. This year, as I helped my colleagues on The Morning newsletter prepare the issue that was devoted to The Times's list, I wondered once again which books my friends would want.
The pandemic didn't disrupt our plans. As we've done for the gift swap since we splintered across the country after graduation, we met on video chat. A little late for Eastern time, a little early for Pacific, we were busts floating in our little squares.
"A gift for you," the note in my package read. "Who could I be?"
In a way, our book swap takes me back to childhood.
On many weekends, I went to my grandmother's house, a few blocks from my school. She would pull out the Books section from her print edition of The Times and pass it along to me. As she read through the main sections, I lay on the floor, flipping through the new titles. In part, that was just ergonomics: My little hands could more easily manage the tabloid-size Books section than the me-size broadsheet.
But reading about new books also felt like assessing new friends. Throughout my childhood, Alanna of Trebond and Anne of Green Gables often felt more familiar than the girls who shared my lunch table. I'd listen to their conversations and not understand how to jump in -- I didn't watch television, and I was taller than all of the boys. When I looked at albums of other people's sleepovers in the early years of Facebook, I'd wonder, What did they possibly talk about for that long?
In college, everything changed for a simple reason: My friends loved books, too. Like me, they turned to novels to understand themselves, and to nonfiction to make sense of the world.
We did our first book swap in my junior year, when three of us moved into an apartment together. One night, in the midst of finals, we exchanged unwrapped volumes that we had loved that semester. This is what I've been thinking about, our choices said. This is how I'm trying to see the world right now.
After college, we kept up the gift swap. Across oceans and time zones, through new relationships and new jobs, we slipped right back whenever we picked up the phone. Sometimes: How are you? Sometimes: Read this and tell me what you think of it.
This year, when the Notable Books list came out, we drew up our wish lists as we have always done. I asked for "Kim Jiyoung, Born 1982," an English translation of a slim text about sexism and misogyny in South Korea. (I read it in two big gulps and highly recommend it.) We unwrapped "A Children's Bible," a novel by Lydia Millet, and "Obit," a poetry collection from Victoria Chang. Two of us asked for "Memorial Drive," a memoir by the poet Natasha Trethewey. We had all requested and given books written by women -- an accident, but a happy one.
After we unwrapped our gifts and guessed our Santas, we spiraled off into recollections of our childhood bookshelves, recalling the characters who were our first friends, before we grew up.
"I don't remember talking about books with anyone that I was friends with, until maybe high school," my friend Elena said. "It was just such an individual little thing."
I nodded along with my friends, who had all read on school bus rides and under covers, too. But I realized that wasn't quite true for me. As a child, and through college and beyond, I discussed nearly every book I read with my grandmother, who gave me the Books section for a reason. She knew that books were a way to bring others closer to you.
From her, I learned that one of the best ways to tell a friend you love her is to ask what she's reading. Or, maybe, just give her a book that might delight her in return.

Hospital Workers Start to 'Turn Against Each Other' to Move Up in Vaccine Line

Texto completo: "I am so disappointed and saddened that this happened," a New York hospital executive wrote to his staff after workers who did not have priority cut the line for the vaccine.
At NewYork-Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital, one of the most highly regarded hospitals in New York City, a rumor spread last week that the line for the coronavirus vaccine on the ninth floor was unguarded and anyone could stealthily join and receive the shot.
Under the rules, the most exposed health care employees were supposed to go first, but soon those from lower-risk departments, including a few who spent much of the pandemic working from home, were getting vaccinated.
The lapse, which occurred within 48 hours of the first doses arriving in the city, incited anger among staff members -- and an apology from the hospital.
"I am so disappointed and saddened that this happened," a top executive at NewYork-Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital, Dr. Craig Albanese, wrote in an email to staff, which was obtained by The New York Times.
The arrival of thousands of vaccine doses in New York City hospitals last week was greeted with an outpouring of hope from doctors and nurses who had worked through the devastating first wave in March and April. But for now, the vaccine is in very short supply, and some hospitals seem to have stumbled through the rollout.
Most of the vaccinations in the New York region to date have involved hospitals giving shots to their own employees, a relatively easy process compared with what is to come as part of the largest vaccination initiative in the nation since the 1940s.
The dynamics playing out at hospitals in New York City may be emblematic of what may happen across the country in the near future, when all adults will be given a place in the vaccination line by either the government or their employers.
In interviews for this article, more than half a dozen doctors and nurses at New York area hospitals said they were upset at how the vaccine was being distributed at their institutions. They described what had happened to The New York Times but most asked that their names not be used because hospitals have shown a willingness to fire or punish employees for speaking to the news media during the pandemic.
At some major hospitals in Manhattan, doctors and nurses have recalled scrolling through social media and pausing to make a snap judgment each time they saw a selfie one of their colleagues had posted of getting vaccinated: Did that person deserve to be vaccinated before they were?
"We feel disrespected and underappreciated due to our second-tier priority for vaccination," a group of anesthesiologists at Mount Sinai Hospital wrote to administrators over the weekend.
Health care workers said rumors were proliferating in WhatsApp groups and amid the banter of the operating room. Stories have begun to circulate of a plastic surgeon who managed to get vaccinated early, of doses being thrown out at one Manhattan hospital because of poor planning. On group chats, doctors debate how -- and whether -- to try to get vaccinated ahead of schedule.
At Mount Sinai Hospital, some doctors told others that you could talk your way into receiving a vaccine just by getting in line and repeating that you do "Covid-related procedures," one Mount Sinai doctor, who requested anonymity for fear of retribution, recalled.
One doctor at the Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital said, "Clearly, we're ready to mow each other down for it."
Many of the rumors have not been true. Still, they illustrate a growing distrust and "every man for himself" attitude, another Mount Sinai doctor said.
Dr. Ramon Tallaj, who serves on a state task force advising the governor on the vaccine's roll out, said that ill-will and resentment would fade as the vaccine became more widely available.
"People are going to fight over who goes first, or who doesn't go first, but the important thing is that it's happening," Dr. Tallaj, the chairman of SOMOS Community Care, a network of clinics across New York City that treat many patients from Hispanic and Asian immigrant communities, said of the vaccinations.
Health care workers and nursing home residents and staff members form what is called Phase 1 of New York State's vaccine distribution plan. About two million people are in this group, and the state's initial allocation of the vaccine most likely means that Phase 2, which includes essential workers, won't begin until late January. (Widespread distribution isn't likely to begin until the summer, officials have said.)
But the state has left it mostly to each health care institution to devise a vaccination plan during the first phase. In the first week of vaccinations, many hospitals chose a wide variety of health care workers -- nurses, doctors, housekeepers -- from emergency rooms and intensive care units to be the first at their institutions to receive the vaccine. But in the days after the celebrations accompanying the first shots, the moods at hospitals have shifted.
Asked about workers cutting the vaccine line at Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital, NewYork-Presbyterian said in a statement, "We are proud to have vaccinated thousands of patient-facing employees in just over a week, and we will continue to do so until everyone receives a vaccine. We are following all New York State Department of Health guidelines on vaccine priority, with our initial focus on I.C.U. and E.D. staff and equitable access for all."
Still, The Times interviewed four health care workers at Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital, all of whom expressed resentment at colleagues and dismay that hospital administrators had allowed the vaccine distribution system to devolve.
One nurse at Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital said she had gone as far as to confront a social worker who she believed had jumped the line about why the social worker thought she deserved the vaccine ahead of others.
"She said, 'We have to go to E.R. sometime,' but that's not true," the nurse said of the social worker.
At some places, doctors and nurses who work in dedicated Covid-19 units were not included in the priority group.
Ivy Vega -- an occupational therapist who has been treating Covid-19 patients at another NewYork-Presbyterian hospital, the Columbia University Irving Medical Center -- said she grew frustrated waiting to be vaccinated while others received the shot. She received her first dose on Wednesday.
"There has been a sense of camaraderie -- that's what's helped us carry on during the pandemic," she said. "And now this thing we should be celebrating -- the arrival of this much anticipated vaccine -- it's turning into a rivalry. There is competitiveness and skepticism and mistrust."
At Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital, some of these nurses said they had yet to be vaccinated a week after vaccinations began.
"I think the sad thing is people are starting to turn against each other," one doctor who works at the hospital said. "Can you honestly say this clerk deserves it before I do? No, but nobody deserves it before anyone else."
Another doctor working in an intensive care unit at the children's hospital recalled the scene last week: A group of staff members were striding energetically toward the elevator banks, where a vaccination station awaited. One of them even explained in passing that they were on their way to get the vaccine.
"It was a free-for-all," said the doctor, who requested anonymity for fear of retribution from the hospital.
Dr. Albanese, the chief operating officer of the children's hospital, addressed the free-for-all in the email, placing some blame on the vaccination team for not limiting vaccinations to people on their list.
"We need to prioritize the highest risk teams," he wrote.
At Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan, the vaccine rollout has unfolded in plain view, in the hospital's atrium, which staff members crisscross throughout the work day or visit to grab a snack or coffee. Many doctors and nurses said they would glance over to see who was standing in line -- and whether that person fit the government's recommendations for those who should be prioritized.
"Despite our strict and stringent vaccination policies and procedures, we are aware of a handful of accusations of improprieties," Mount Sinai said in a statement. "Due to confidentiality, we cannot speak to any specific individual issue, however, any allegations of any missteps will be appropriately and thoroughly investigated."
This weekend, anesthesiologists -- who have played a crucial role in treating the sickest patients during the outbreak in New York -- complained as they say they have watched others get vaccinated before them.
That led to the anonymous letter sent to hospital administrators.
"A boiling point was reached when we witnessed vaccines being administered, seemingly at random, to employees who were not a part of the originally-planned cohort," read the letter, which was sent anonymously in the name of "Concerned Faculty Members" of the department of anesthesiology, perioperative and pain medicine. The letter was first reported by Politico.
In interviews, several anesthesiologists at Mount Sinai noted that their colleagues at some other hospitals had already been vaccinated.
The anesthesiologists said they expected to play a major role in the second wave if hospitalizations kept rising, and in recent days some in the department have gotten vaccinated.
But just last week, an email from the head of the anesthesiology department, Dr. Andrew Leibowitz, asked for volunteers willing to work full time in a unit for critically ill Covid-19 patients if the outbreak worsened. Some in the department felt they were being told there might be an upside to volunteering.
"I am looking into the possibility of having persons volunteering to perform this duty possibly vaccinated earlier than they might otherwise be," Dr. Leibowitz wrote.
Dr. Leibowitz did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
One anesthesiologist said he recognized it was reasonable to vaccinate the volunteers first.
But also, he said, it "felt that they were using the vaccine as a bargaining chip."

Biden, Facing Bitterly Split Congress, Vows to Succeed Where Predecessors Failed

Texto completo: The president-elect insisted that his skills and his history would enable him to secure bipartisan support for bold initiatives.
WASHINGTON -- When he takes office next month, President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. will confront a sharply divided Congress where many Republicans argued that his election was fraudulent.
But Mr. Biden expressed optimism on Wednesday that his decades-long brand of centrist deal making would empower him to move beyond the bitter partisanship of the past four years and advance his agenda.
"My leverage is, every senior Republican knows I've never once, ever, misled them," Mr. Biden said during a telephone conversation with several columnists, including David Leonhardt of The New York Times. "I'll never publicly embarrass them."
As vice president, Mr. Biden had a front-row seat to the eight years of obstruction that Republicans waged against President Barack Obama. In his second term, Mr. Obama all but abandoned hope for large-scale legislative victories, turning to executive actions instead. President Trump adopted a similar approach as he battled Democrats in the House.
But Mr. Biden insisted on Wednesday that his skills and his history gave him an opportunity to break the cycle.
He said the country was in a different place now. As an example, Mr. Biden argued that Americans had come to more of a consensus on climate change, with people of all political stripes saying they recognize the need for more aggressive action.
"I'm going to be able to get stuff done on the environment you all are not going to believe," he told the columnists. "I couldn't have gotten it done six years ago."
Mr. Biden expressed a similar hope for bipartisan work on confronting the coronavirus pandemic and restoring economic health to a country battered by job losses and business closures.
He acknowledged a widespread weariness with coronavirus restrictions around the country, especially during the holiday season. Nonetheless, the president-elect described a broad willingness among Americans to do what was needed to reduce transmission of the virus and save lives.
"There's a new sense of urgency on the part of the public at large," he said. "The American public is being made painfully aware of the extent and damage and incredibly high cost of failing to take the kind of measures we've been talking about."
Mr. Biden's optimism is sure to be quickly tested once he takes office. Polls show the public is sharply divided, often along partisan lines, about pandemic restrictions. Regardless of which party controls the Senate after a pair of early-January runoffs in Georgia, Congress will be more closely split than at any time in recent memory.
And as president, Mr. Biden will need to build bridges to Democrats as well as to Republicans. Once again, progressives who hoped for a champion of more liberal policies in the White House feel burned by the 2020 election. They have already promised to pressure Mr. Biden against cutting deals with Republicans.
Asked by the journalists on the call, which also included Gerald F. Seib of The Wall Street Journal and Jonathan Capehart of The Washington Post, whether he was up to the fights with Republicans and the more combative members of his own party, Mr. Biden bristled.
"I respectfully suggest that I beat the hell out of everyone else," he said, noting that he won the Democratic presidential nomination and seven million more votes than Mr. Trump. "I think I know what I'm doing, and I've been pretty damn good at being able to deal with the punchers. I know how to block a straight left and do a right hook. I understand it."
But he added: "I'm ready to fight. But one of the things that happens is when you get into one of those kinds of blood matches, nothing gets done, nothing gets done."

Texto completo: Roger Berlind, who left his mark on two New York institutions — Wall Street and Broadway — as a co-founder of a storied investment firm and a producer of shows including “Amadeus” and “Book of Mormon,” has died. He was 90.
He died on Dec. 18 at his home in Manhattan, the New York Times reported. The cause was cardiopulmonary arrest, the Times said, citing his family.
Before he became a Tony Award-collecting theater producer, Berlind helped found Carter, Berlind, Potoma & Weill, which would propel the careers of, among others, Sanford Weill, who went on to create Citigroup Inc., and Arthur Levitt, who led the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
In the late 1950s, Weill and Arthur Carter, neighbors in East Rockaway who commuted together to Wall Street, began plotting how to start a new financial firm. Carter recruited Berlind, his childhood friend from nearby Woodmere, New York. Berlind in turn signed up Peter Potoma, his colleague at Eastman Dillon, Union Securities & Co.
On May 2, 1960, Carter, Berlind, Potoma & Weill opened at 37 Wall Street.
“The partners were young, primarily Jewish guys from Brooklyn and Long Island -- true outsiders in the clubby world of Wall Street,” Eric J. Weiner wrote in “What Goes Up,” his 2005 book on Wall Street history. “Arthur Carter was the clear leader of the group, and Roger Berlind served as his cerebral counterweight.”

Berlind “never had the same ego as the rest of us and probably secretly yearned to return to his first love of songwriting,” Weill wrote in “The Real Deal,” his 2006 memoir. “Still, Roger built a solid book of retail, institutional and family business.”
Weill, as chairman of the firm -- which became Carter, Berlind, Weill & Levitt -- led it through a series of mergers and acquisitions that transformed it into Wall Street giant Shearson Loeb Rhodes that he sold to American Express Co. in 1981 for about $930 million. Berlind stayed long enough to serve as vice chairman of Shearson Hayden Stone Inc., one of the firm's interim iterations.
His career change was prompted by the June 24, 1975, crash of an Eastern Airlines 727 on arrival at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York. The 107 passengers killed included his 39-year-old wife, the former Helen Polk Clark, and three of their children: Helen, 12; Peter, 9; and Clark, 6.
Their youngest child, 2-year-old William, had remained home in New York with Berlind while the others visited Helen's mother in Mississippi.
New Beginning
Berlind sought a new start. “The whole idea of building a business and making money didn't make sense anymore,” he told the New York Times in 1998. “There was no more economic motivation.” Harkening back to his love of music and theater from his college days at Princeton University, he put his wealth to work as a producer, starting with the Richard Rodgers musical “Rex,” which ran for 48 performances in 1976.
He had his first hit four years later with “Amadeus,” which he imported from the U.K. with the Shubert Organization and McCann & Nugent Productions. It was named best play for 1980-1981, winning Berlind the first of about two dozen Tonys. He followed that with the hit musical “Sophisticated Ladies,” which ran from March 1981 to January 1983.
On Broadway, Berlind was known for an “easygoing nature” at odds with “the old, traditional archetype of the producer as a control-hungry despot,” Iris Dorbian wrote in her 2008 book, “Great Producers: Visionaries of American Theater.”
Berlind told the author that theater producers try “to make sense out of a basically senseless business,” adding, “The only real interest for me is helping create what goes onstage. To get to that point, there are lots of problems to deal with.”
Princeton Productions
Roger Stuart Berlind was born on June 27, 1930. His parents were Peter Berlind, executive director of Unity Hospital in Brooklyn, and the former Mae Miller, a painter. The second of four sons, he grew up in Woodmere, and from age 11 would travel into Manhattan to see shows on Broadway, according to a 2006 profile in Princeton's alumni magazine.
At Princeton, from which he graduated in 1952, he studied English and directed and composed music for productions with the Triangle Club. He then spent three years in the U.S. Army's counter-intelligence corps. After being turned down by a raft of Wall Street firms, he finally was hired by Eastman Dillon.
Berlind's role at Carter, Berlind, Weill & Levitt was the trigger for a messy split in 1968.
It began, according to Weill's account, when the hard-driving Carter proposed reducing Berlind's ownership share. The other partners resisted, and Carter left. The firm became Cogan, Berlind, Weill and Levitt, with Berlind serving as the compromise choice for chief executive officer.
“Of course, I thought I could run the company best,” he told Weiner. “But in reality I think I was the least-threatening partner to the other three.”
Berlind's other Tonys were for productions including the musicals “The Book of Mormon” and “Jerome Robbins' Broadway” and plays “The Real Thing,” “Proof” and “Doubt.”
His $3.5 million gift to Princeton helped fund construction of the Roger S. Berlind Theater, a 350-seat addition to the McCarter Theatre Center.
In 1979 he married the former Brook Wheeler. She survives him, along with his son, two granddaughters and a brother, Alan, the Times reported.

Texto completo: A New York Times reporter was slammed for suggesting President Trump was punishing the press by setting a 7:30 a.m. call time for journalists on Christmas Eve.
“A way to stick it to the WH press corps he hates is a 7:30 AM call time on Christmas Eve for a currently empty public schedule,” Maggie Haberman, the New York Times’s White House correspondent tweeted on Wednesday, after the president’s schedule was released.
Tweet
Haberman’s comments were met with derision from those accusing her of being out of touch and childish as millions of people face unemployment due to COVID-19 lockdowns.
Richard Grenell, the former acting director of national intelligence under Trump, told Haberman to “learn to code,” a jab conservatives often direct at journalists.
“Write the story early. We already know what you are going to say anyway. And please stop whining about showing up for work - or learn to code.”
Tweet
“Millions of Americans are unemployed and have been for months now. Thousands of Americans are sick. Millions of small business owners have been forced to stay home from work for months. @maggieNYT thinks that showing up to work at 7:30 AM is a horrible punishment,” Reagan Battalion, a popular conservative account, posted.
Tweet
Benjamin Weingarten, a writer at the Federalist called Haberman’s comments “childish.”
“Some characteristics of the Ruling Class comms arm known as the media demonstrated here: 1) It loves to make itself the center of the story 2) It lacks total self-awareness 3) It is childish.”
Tweet
“Reporters complaining about working near the beach in 70° sunshine while millions of Americans can’t work is about as out of touch as it gets," Jon Street, the managing editor of Campus Reform, wrote. Tweet
“People who've never missed a paycheck, who spent the year lecturing people to stay home and shut up as they went broke, whining about someone having to show up to their overpaid job early is my favorite Twitter. #Caring,” radio host Derek Hunter tweeted.
Tweet
The first family decamped to the president’s Mar-a-Lago club for the Christmas holidays, where it is expected to stay until January. While the White House didn’t list any official events listed on Trump's public calendar, the president’s schedule noted his “schedule includes many meetings and calls.”
Michael Cohen, the president’s former lawyer, said Trump may not return from Florida after Christmas.
“I would not be shocked if there is no concession speech at all," Cohen said. "My theory is that at Christmastime, he goes to Mar-a-Lago. I think he will stay there through the inauguration. I would not be shocked if he will not show up to the inauguration either.”

Farhad Manjoo: All I needed to survive lockdown was sourdough

Texto completo: For a few innocent weeks about 10,000 years ago, at the dawn of the quarantine era of 2020, my Instagram feed and perhaps yours, too, was suddenly overrun with images of impossibly lovely loaves of homemade bread. It was one of the first social-media show-off fads of the pandemic; with everyone stuck at home, cut off from gym mirrors and airplane wings at sunset, bread-making virtuosity emerged in certain circles as the hottest new way to show everyone online how much better you were than everyone else.
Naturally, I jumped on the bread wagon. I remember the precise moment my sourdough FOMO kicked in. I was at the supermarket on one of those blissful last days of the Before Times, and I’d been amused at the fevered run on toilet paper (one word, folks: bidets!). Then I rounded the corner into the baking aisle and I went cold. The endless rows of empty shelves made the lockdown real to me: If we were facing a shortage of flour — you know, wheat, the staff of life — should we fear for the rest of civilization, too?
Right there, in the empty aisle, I pulled out my phone and found a wholesaler in New York selling flour in 50-pound bags meant for bakeries. I could get one delivered to my house in California, along with a few smaller bags of specialized bread flours, for about $100, which seemed both outrageous and totally reasonable. A couple weeks later, this ludicrous heave of flour dropped onto my doorstep, and I’ve been baking ever since — baguettes, challah and burger buns, but mostly, and most therapeutically, loaves and loaves of sourdough.
It has been revelatory. On Instagram, shots of rustic boules and rubber-banded Mason jars of fermenting starter have long since grown passé, but in my kitchen, sourdough has become an unexpected savior — a hobby, a challenge, an escape, a deceptively complex puzzle, and the deepest of comforts amid so much misery and stress. Through political strife and economic uncertainty, wildfires and toxic air, through Zoom-schooling and every anxiety-provoking cough and sneeze, sourdough has been the duct tape holding together the fraying last threads of my sanity.
I flew through the first 50-pound bag in about three months; now I’m elbow-deep into the second.
For me, the restorative magic of sourdough begins and ends with its tactility. Unlike work, school, friendships and so much else in lockdown, the blessing of sourdough is that it lives completely apart from digital screens.
Sourdough is a real thing in the real world — some bubbly goop in a jar, a jiggly mass in a bowl, a fragile loaf to be gently scored and coaxed into the oven, then sliced and eaten. In the very beginning, one attempts to make sourdough from a recipe, but that inevitably proves futile; explaining how to make sourdough is like explaining how to dunk a basketball — you can describe the process to a T, but you’ll get nowhere without taking a shot for yourself. Sourdough then becomes a pursuit of feel and touch, of timing and accumulated intuition, of endless practice approaching unattainable perfection.
There is much cliché here, I’ll grant you. The office-bound digital worker who discovers new purpose in an antiquated pastime is a stock character in everyone’s social feed. And sourdough is not my first domestic enthusiasm. I meditate, I pickle, I have even made my own cheese and churned my own butter.
And yet, banal as this sort of digital-detox hobbyism has become, I still believe there is much to recommend it — even more so now that the sourdough craze has passed. In the last decade, as most of us began carrying the internet along with us wherever we went, it’s become increasingly difficult to divorce oneself from the online clamor.
Escape has become especially difficult in the pandemic. The internet is no longer optional for anyone — in the past, I tried to enforce screen-time limits for myself and my children, but now that the screen is our sole portal to everyone else on the planet, limiting it feels cruel and, anyway, unworkable.
Quarantine has also limited many other nondigital outlets. A few years ago, I began attending a weekly ceramics class, and I found it thrilling for some of the same reasons I’ve come to appreciate sourdough — throwing clay on a wheel requires patience, focus and practice, and if your hands are covered in mud, you can’t touch your phone.
But pottery required lots of expensive and impractical equipment found in a specialized studio — which shut down just as the pandemic began. Sourdough, by contrast, is eminently accessible. You can do it at home with inexpensive ingredients, few specialized tools, and now that flour is abundant again, no big upfront investment.
Best of all, sourdough fits seamlessly into the work-from-home life. Bread is made over time, in snippets. You can take breaks between emails to fold your dough. You can attend a meeting, shape your boules, then attend another while the dough rests. As your colleague drones on about this or that office quandary, you can take in the warm aroma of freshly baking bread, and when you take a bite, you might be transported, for just a moment, far away from this terrible year, to a happier time in a more serene place.
Sourdough will not solve all your problems; the earth is still ailing, the country remains an ungovernable mess and pessimism still feels more appropriate than optimism. But we have bread, and that’s not nothing; sometimes, it might even be enough.

Two days after a police officer in Columbus, Ohio, fatally shot a Black man within seconds of encountering him, the mayor and police chief moved to fire the officer.
Mayor Andrew J. Ginther and Chief Thomas Quinlan said in statements Thursday that Officer Adam Coy, a 19-year veteran, should be terminated for not immediately turning on his body camera and not providing aid to Andre Maurice Hill, whom he shot early Tuesday.
“Enough is enough,” Ginther said in a brief video statement, adding, “We as a community need to come together and hold folks accountable.”
Later, Quinlan said in a video statement, “I have seen everything I need to see to reach the conclusion that Officer Coy must be terminated immediately.” He also referred to Coy’s “unreasonable use of deadly force.”
Quinlan wrote in his report on the episode, “Known facts do not establish that this use of deadly force was objectively reasonable.”
The recommendation has been sent to Ned Pettus Jr., the director of public safety for Columbus, who will make a final determination on whether to fire the officer, Quinlan said. Pettus, an appointee of Ginther, has scheduled a hearing on the matter for Monday morning, according to the chief.
In Quinlan’s video statement, he called the shooting of Hill, 47, “preventable violence, senseless violence.” He added, “This didn’t have to happen and it never should have.”
It was the second deadly shooting of a Black man by a law enforcement officer in Columbus in three weeks. “Our community is exhausted,” Ginther said during a news conference Tuesday.
The latest deadly encounter began about 1:30 a.m. Tuesday when two police officers responded to a call from someone concerned about an SUV parked in a residential area.
On a recording of the call, which has been made public, a man told a police dispatcher that the vehicle had been there for about 30 minutes, and that the car had been running for much of that time.
Coy was one of the officers who responded to the call. He did not activate his body camera until after firing his weapon, a policy violation, but the department’s body cameras are equipped with a feature that records the 60 seconds before they are turned on. When Coy did turn on his camera, the playback feature captured the shooting.
That video, which was released Wednesday, shows Coy approaching a garage with another officer, shining a flashlight inside. A vehicle and Hill are in the garage. Hill walks slowly toward the officers, holding a cellphone in his left hand. His right hand is not visible in the footage, which did not capture audio of any verbal exchange before the shooting.
Within seconds, Coy pulled his gun and opened fire. Hill fell to the ground, and then the audio recording started. Coy, still pointing his gun, ordered Hill to put his hands to his side and roll onto his stomach. “Don’t move, dude,” Coy said as he patted down a groaning Hill. “Roll over, dude.”
It is unclear exactly how long it took police officers to provide first aid to Hill, who died at a hospital shortly after.
Quinlan said he was able to expedite the normal investigatory process because of that footage. “Like all of you, I witnessed his critical misconduct firsthand via his body-worn camera,” the chief said.
Efforts to reach Coy by phone Thursday night were not successful.
In addition to the investigation of Coy, Quinlan said a second departmental investigation is underway into whether “additional officers” either failed to activate their body cameras or render aid to Hill.
In Quinlan’s written recommendations to Pettus, the chief said the police dispatcher “did not provide Officer Coy any indication there was criminal activity occurring or a present danger in the neighborhood. Radio merely advised to check the area for a suspicious vehicle.”
The Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation is also investigating whether Coy’s shooting of Hill violated state law, the chief said.
The shooting came three weeks after a county sheriff’s deputy fatally shot Casey Goodson Jr., 23, in the doorway of his home in Columbus. That shooting, on Dec. 4, was not captured on video but touched off a round of protests against police brutality.
According to the U.S. marshal for the Southern District of Ohio, Peter Tobin, officers on a fugitive task force saw Goodson waving a gun in his car. Jason Meade, the sheriff’s deputy, chased and confronted Goodson, who was returning home with sandwiches after a dental appointment and was not the target of the search.
The deputy’s lawyer said Goodson had pointed a gun at the officer. A lawyer for Goodson’s family said the only things in his hands were a coronavirus mask and some Subway sandwiches.
Goodson had a license to carry a firearm. The Columbus police, who are investigating the killing, said they recovered a gun from the scene but did not specify where.
Meade was placed on administrative leave after the shooting, which is being investigated by the police in Columbus, the FBI and the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division.

Kelly Kenney was taking a late-night walk to clear her thoughts in her Los Angeles neighborhood this spring when a colorful pinwheel caught her eye. She stopped and found herself gazing down at an elaborate fairy garden at the base of a tree, complete with painted rocks and tiny trinkets.
Pinned to the tree was a picture of the garden’s creator, a young girl named Eliana, and a poem using a medieval-looking storybook font that told her neighbors how to use the garden: “Our 4-year-old girl made this to brighten your day / Please add to the magic, but don’t take away / These days can be hard, but we’re in this together / So enjoy our fairy garden and some nicer weather.”
Kenney hatched a plan, and on the next night, she left a note at the garden pretending to be a fairy named Sapphire, after Kenney’s September birthstone, who had taken up residence in the tree. She promised she’d leave glittery magical resin dice (a pandemic hobby for Kenney) if Eliana completed three tasks she listed that were etched in kindness. And the next day, they were finished.
The note kindled a friendship tied to the fairy garden that would last through some of the darkest months of the pandemic and hardships of 2020 for both a little girl and her grown-up neighbor. Kenney chronicled the experience in a wildly popular Twitter thread this month.
“I felt like immediately when I found it, the whole family wedged themselves into my heart,” Kenney, a photographer, said about the fairy garden. “I was so alone at the time, physically and mentally, and I felt like these people were kindred spirits.”
Eliana made the fairy garden April 28 using materials from her grandmother. The garden started with fairy-size doors on the tree, a couple of fairies and a gnome. It grew with contributions from neighbors, like a tiny purple vanity with a quotation from “The Lord of the Rings” inside, Eliana’s mother, Emily Pauls, said.
Kenney found a new purpose as she went through a harsh breakup by orchestrating elaborate notes and photoshopping herself as a tiny fairy next to her cat, Nova. She gave Eliana’s parents her phone number, to reassure them, when the letters became more frequent.
She pondered ideas for imaginative gift boxes to leave behind, with the goal of making each better than the last one. Kenney tapped into what she said she loved when she was a child and texted Pauls for help.
Kenney gave Eliana a stuffed pig and a goat; a pop-up version of one of her favorite childhood books, “The Little Prince”; and Crayola markers with paper so Eliana would stop draining her parents’ supply of copy paper when she draws.
As a child, Kenney said, she was bullied because of how her creative personality manifested itself. She felt ashamed, and it wasn’t until later in life, with her uncle’s support, that she tapped back into her imaginative side.
Noticing that she and Eliana had similar personalities, Kenney wanted to nurture Eliana’s creative inspiration and provide a positive influence, something she had lacked growing up.
Eliana’s parents found that she changed over the past nine months, too. Through Sapphire’s encouragement, she was becoming more imaginative and kind during a time when she needed a role model since the pandemic halted her year in preschool.
Kenney encouraged Eliana to write stories, which led to “Sapphire the Explorer.” It included illustrations and a song that only fairies can sing (and read). Pauls helped with punctuation and turning her text into pages.
Eliana often thought about Sapphire and wrote to her, asking what the skin of fairies felt like and what things Sapphire owned. Pauls said that Eliana would pick up items like a rock and think about how Sapphire could use it as a table or dreamed of ways to catch the fairy.
“She’d never seen me, but this relationship we have is definitely love,” Kenney said about Eliana. “She’s just as magical to me.”
Then the adventure encountered a plot twist. Pauls let Kenney know in mid-November that they had closed on a house in south Los Angeles and would be moving from the West Side, leaving the neighbors to tend to the fairy garden.
Pauls asked Kenney to help support Eliana, who was having difficulty coping with the move. Kenney told Eliana in a letter that she would also move — out of the garden to a bigger tree for Sapphire and her growing cat.
“Sometimes, we outgrow homes because we have too much love and need a place we can hold it all,” Kenney wrote. “But it is so fun to find new trees and imagine what new adventures are in store for us!”
Eliana’s mother and Kenney planned to meet as the family said goodbye to their neighborhood Dec. 11. Kenney and Eliana’s parents were tested for the coronavirus days earlier in an effort to ensure the visit was safe. In another letter, Kenney hinted to Eliana that she would be coming to get her final things and that fairies grow to be human-sized when they are moving.
Dressed in character, with pointy fairy ears, Kenney walked up to the tree and, as she rummaged around the garden, pretended to look startled by Eliana. But Eliana was the one who was stunned and overcome with emotion. Kenney crouched down and they began to chat about Nova the cat and what life is like as a fairy.
“Every time, it was always this sweet, sweet moment where I felt so strangely known by the stranger,” Pauls said about the letters. “Through this whole exchange, she’s become family in a way. It’s a really unexpected way to find a friend.”
Kenney continues to bring the magic to Eliana through letters and video chats. But there is more to be found when Eliana makes another fairy garden at her new home, and hopefully, another fairy will move right in.

5 Takeaways From the Post-Brexit Trade Deal

Britain and the European Union struck a trade deal Thursday, setting the terms of their commercial relations after Britain completes its hard-fought split from the European Union on Dec. 31.
British lawmakers had haggled for years over the divorce, known as Brexit. Britain formally left the European Union on Jan. 31, closing the book on nearly half a century of close ties with Europe, but it continued to follow the bloc’s rules during a transition period intended to give the two sides time to negotiate the trade deal struck this week.
Here are the basic terms of that deal.
It saves Britain from crashing out of the EU.
British companies have long been able to move goods to and from the European Union without paying taxes or tariffs. Had the two sides failed to reach a deal before the Dec. 31 deadline, tariffs would have been imposed, raising the price on cars considerably and making it much more difficult for British farmers to sell meat, for example, to the European market.
A no-deal separation also looked likely to create gridlock at British ports and strand trucks on either side of the border.
The new agreement means that Britain avoids onerous tariffs or quotas on goods. But problems at the border could still emerge, with checks increasing and traders having to complete new customs declarations.
And commercial relations face more restrictions. The Office for Budget Responsibility has estimated that gross domestic product in Britain could be 4% lower cumulatively over the next 15 years than it would have been had Britain remained in the European Union. Without a deal, that drop was projected to be even larger.
The agreement was not entirely a surprise. To some commentators, a no-deal Brexit had always looked more like useful leverage for political purposes than a probable outcome of negotiations.
Both sides compromised on fish, a major sticking point.
The number of people employed in Britain’s fishing industry has fallen in recent decades, and the British government cast its split from the European Union as a chance to revive the industry by cutting European companies’ access to British waters. Britain originally sought an 80% reduction in the share of fish that European Union boats would be allowed to catch in British waters.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain made significant concessions on that point: The European Union’s fishing quota in British waters will be cut by 25%. But Brussels also compromised: That quota reduction will come into effect over 5 1/2 years, roughly half as long as the European Union originally wanted.
British workers, unhappy not to have exclusive access to fish in British waters, may complain about the deal. But analysts have said that British boats would not have the capacity to catch everything that once went to European boats, even if they had the opportunity to do so.
A no-deal scenario would also have forced tariffs on British fishing companies, making it more difficult for them to sell what they caught to the European Union at competitive prices.
Pro-Brexit lawmakers got many of their wishes.
Citizens of European Union member states can look for jobs elsewhere in the bloc, work there without needing special permits and stay after they have left their jobs. But the trade deal ends the free movement of people between Britain and the continent. And it also ended Britain’s involvement in the popular Erasmus student exchange program, which since 1987 saw hundreds of thousands of people each year traveling abroad for study, work experience and apprenticeships.
As both a single market and a customs union, the European Union also agreed to adopt the same rules and regulations so that goods, services and capital can move freely across borders of countries within the bloc. And it agreed to apply the same taxes on goods from outside the bloc, meaning that they can be shipped within the European Union without facing additional tariffs.
But Britain will now leave both the single market and the customs union and can pursue trade deals with other countries. Those points were among the demands made by the most aggressive anti-Europe lawmakers in Britain.
But the European Union won assurances, too.
In return for allowing British companies to avoid tariffs, the European Union wanted to ensure that those companies would not gain unfair advantages over their European rivals. The bloc’s leaders worried that Britain would give its own companies a leg up through additional state aid or by lowering environmental or labor standards.
Britain did not want the European Union to be able to automatically impose sanctions if it decided to depart from European rules. So the two sides worked to devise a mechanism by which either could raise a complaint if it had evidence that one had changed regulations in a way that put the other’s businesses at a disadvantage.
As a last resort, if Britain and the European Union could not find common ground in such a scenario, tariffs could be imposed to ensure that one side did not have too big of an advantage.
The British economy faces enormous hurdles.
The trade deal was primarily concerned with goods crossing borders. But the British economy is enormously reliant on its services sector, and the deal did not immediately make it easier for British companies to sell financial and other services to its European neighbors.
Once the transition period ends Dec. 31, traders in London will leave the European Union’s single market for financial services.
Both have said they each wanted to be able to evaluate in the future whether the other side’s financial services regulations were equally stringent, and whether they could continue to easily buy and sell services across borders.
But that system will not be as straightforward for banks and traders as the current one.

Answering Trump, Democrats Try and Fail to Jam $2,000 Payments Through House

WASHINGTON — The fate of $900 billion in pandemic aid will remain in limbo over the Christmas break after House Democrats tried and failed Thursday to more than triple the size of relief checks, then adjourned the House until Monday, when they will try again.
President Donald Trump’s implicit threat Tuesday to reject a relief compromise that overwhelmingly passed both chambers unless lawmakers agreed to raise the bill’s $600 direct payment checks to $2,000 has continued to roil Congress while rattling an already teetering economic recovery. Trump decamped for his Florida home in Mar-a-Lago on Wednesday without saying another public word on the relief bill’s fate, leaving both parties to guess whether he really intends to veto the long-delayed measure, which includes the pandemic aid as well as funding to keep the government open past Monday.
The Democrats’ Christmas Eve gambit on the House floor was never meant to pass, but the party’s leaders hoped to put Republicans in a bind — choosing between the president’s wishes for far more largess and their own inclinations for modest spending.
Republicans rejected the request by the House majority leader, Rep. Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, for unanimous consent to pass a measure fulfilling Trump’s demand for $2,000 checks. Without support from both Republican and Democrat leadership, such requests cannot be entertained on the House floor. Republicans then failed to put forward their own request to revisit the foreign aid provision of the spending legislation that Trump has also objected to, although most of the items came almost dollar for dollar from his own budget request.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, in a statement Thursday, vowed to hold a roll-call vote on the direct payments legislation Monday, declaring that voting against it would "deny the financial hardship that families face and to deny them the relief they need.”
With government funding set to lapse at the end of day Monday, House lawmakers are also considering the possibility of another stopgap spending bill — which would be the fifth such spending measure this month — to prevent a shutdown, Hoyer said.
On Thursday, the Government Publishing Office was expected to finish physically printing the nearly 5,600-page package and send it to Capitol Hill for the signatures of congressional officials. By the afternoon, the legislation was to be flown to Mar-a-Lago for Trump to sign, according to a person familiar with the plan.
But in the meantime, Republican leaders were left wondering aloud why Congress was still dealing with a matter on Christmas Eve that they thought had been finally put to rest Monday night.
“There’s a long list of positive things that we’d be talking about today if we weren’t talking about this,” Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri, a member of the Republican leadership, told fellow Republicans on Capitol Hill. “And I think that would be to the president’s advantage if we were talking about his accomplishments rather than questioning decisions late in the administration.”
The pandemic relief and government spending bill, which passed both chambers this week with overwhelming bipartisan support, contains the first significant federal relief since April. If the president doesn’t sign it, millions of Americans on Saturday are set to lose access to two federal unemployment programs that were expanded under the $2.2 trillion stimulus law which passed in March.
A series of additional relief provisions, including an eviction moratorium, are set to expire at the end of the month, and other temporary relief protections shielding millions of Americans from the brunt of the pandemic’s economic toll will lapse shortly after the new year without action.
Ahead of two runoff Senate elections in Georgia, Trump has also forced a fraught situation for his party, setting up another loyalty test for his most devoted voters that hinges on rejecting a $2.3 trillion package negotiated in part by top White House officials.
The president “doesn’t give a damn about people,” said Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Mich., who grew emotional as she recounted calls from constituents pleading for federal support during the holiday season. “He sowed more fear. He threw kerosene on a fire.”
Rank-and-file Republicans are expressing frustration as well. On Wednesday evening, Rep. Anthony Gonzalez, R-Ohio, argued that House Republicans had stood by Trump for four years.
“If he thinks going on Twitter and trashing the bill his team negotiated and we supported on his behalf is going to bring more people to his side in this election fiasco, I hope he’s wrong, though I guess we’ll see,” Gonzalez wrote on Twitter.
On behalf of Republicans, Rep. Rob Wittman of Virginia tried and failed Thursday to gain consideration of a separate request to revisit the annual spending for foreign policy matters, given that Trump had also objected to how those funds were being spent. (That legislation had also secured the support of 128 Republicans when it passed the House on Monday.)
But Republican leaders were not particularly eager to renegotiate the spending portion of the bill either. Blunt said he believed Trump was confused about the separation between the pandemic relief part of the bill and the foreign aid proposed by his own administration in the government spending portion.
“Certainly, the negotiated foreign aid provisions would not benefit by opening that part of the bill up, and frankly if you start opening part of the bill up, it’s hard to defend not opening the whole bill up. It took us a long time to get to where we are. I think reopening that bill would be a mistake,” Blunt told reporters at the Capitol on Wednesday.
“The best way out of this is for the president to sign the bill, and I still hope that’s what he decides.”
At a news conference following the unsuccessful motions, Hoyer said House Democrats only agreed to the $600 checks in the stimulus compromise because Republicans negotiating the deal, including the president’s representative, Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, insisted on that number.
“Mr. Mnuchin suggested a lower figure might have been appropriate,” Hoyer told reporters. Asked if it had been a mistake to tie the relief package and the spending omnibus together given the conflation of various spending provisions, Hoyer noted “perhaps the only mistake was believing the president and Mnuchin when we were told that the bill to be passed would be signed by the president of the United States.”

NEW YORK — At NewYork-Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children’s Hospital, one of the most highly regarded hospitals in New York City, a rumor spread last week that the line for the coronavirus vaccine on the ninth floor was unguarded and anyone could stealthily join and receive the shot.
Under the rules, the most exposed health care employees were supposed to go first, but soon those from lower-risk departments, including a few who spent much of the pandemic working from home, were getting vaccinated.
The lapse, which occurred within 48 hours of the first doses arriving in the city, incited anger among staff members — and an apology from the hospital.
“I am so disappointed and saddened that this happened,” a top executive at NewYork-Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children’s Hospital, Dr. Craig Albanese, wrote in an email to staff, which was obtained by The New York Times.
The arrival of thousands of vaccine doses in New York City hospitals last week was greeted with an outpouring of hope from doctors and nurses who had worked through the devastating first wave in March and April. But for now, the vaccine is in very short supply, and some hospitals seem to have stumbled through the rollout.
Most of the vaccinations in the New York region to date have involved hospitals giving shots to their own employees, a relatively easy process compared with what is to come as part of the largest vaccination initiative in the nation since the 1940s.
The dynamics playing out at hospitals in New York City may be emblematic of what may happen across the country in the near future, when all adults will be given a place in the vaccination line by either the government or their employers.
In interviews for this article, more than half a dozen doctors and nurses at New York area hospitals said they were upset at how the vaccine was being distributed at their institutions. They described what had happened to The New York Times but most asked that their names not be used because hospitals have shown a willingness to fire or punish employees for speaking to the news media during the pandemic.
At some major hospitals in Manhattan, doctors and nurses have recalled scrolling through social media and pausing to make a snap judgment each time they saw a selfie one of their colleagues had posted of getting vaccinated: Did that person deserve to be vaccinated before they were?
“We feel disrespected and underappreciated due to our second-tier priority for vaccination,” a group of anesthesiologists at Mount Sinai Hospital wrote to administrators over the weekend.
Health care workers said rumors were proliferating in WhatsApp groups and amid the banter of the operating room. Stories have begun to circulate of a plastic surgeon who managed to get vaccinated early, of doses being thrown out at one Manhattan hospital because of poor planning. On group chats, doctors debate how — and whether — to try to get vaccinated ahead of schedule.
At Mount Sinai Hospital, some doctors told others that you could talk your way into receiving a vaccine just by getting in line and repeating that you do “COVID-related procedures,” one Mount Sinai doctor, who requested anonymity for fear of retribution, recalled.
A doctor at Morgan Stanley Children’s Hospital said, “Clearly, we’re ready to mow each other down for it.”
Many of the rumors have not been true. Still, they illustrate a growing distrust and “every man for himself” attitude, another Mount Sinai doctor said.
Dr. Ramon Tallaj, who serves on a state task force advising the governor on the vaccine’s rollout, said that ill-will and resentment would fade as the vaccine becomes more widely available.
“People are going to fight over who goes first, or who doesn’t go first, but the important thing is that it’s happening,” Tallaj, chair of SOMOS Community Care, a network of clinics across New York City that treat many patients from Hispanic and Asian immigrant communities, said of the vaccinations.
Health care workers and nursing home residents and staff members form what is called Phase 1 of New York state’s vaccine distribution plan. About 2 million people are in this group, and the state’s initial allocation of the vaccine most likely means that Phase 2, which includes essential workers, won’t begin until late January. (Widespread distribution isn’t likely to begin until the summer, officials have said.)
But the state has left it mostly to each health care institution to devise a vaccination plan during the first phase. In the first week of vaccinations, many hospitals chose a wide variety of health care workers — nurses, doctors, housekeepers — from emergency rooms and intensive care units to be the first at their institutions to receive the vaccine. But in the days after the celebrations accompanying the first shots, the moods at hospitals have shifted.
Asked about workers cutting the vaccine line at Morgan Stanley Children’s Hospital, NewYork-Presbyterian said in a statement, “We are proud to have vaccinated thousands of patient-facing employees in just over a week, and we will continue to do so until everyone receives a vaccine. We are following all New York State Department of Health guidelines on vaccine priority, with our initial focus on ICU and ED staff and equitable access for all.”
Still, The Times interviewed four health care workers at Morgan Stanley Children’s Hospital, all of whom expressed resentment at colleagues and dismay that hospital administrators had allowed the vaccine distribution system to devolve.
A nurse at Morgan Stanley Children’s Hospital said she had gone as far as to confront a social worker who she believed had jumped the line about why the social worker thought she deserved the vaccine ahead of others.
“She said, ‘We have to go to ER sometime,’ but that’s not true,” the nurse said of the social worker.
At some places, doctors and nurses who work in dedicated COVID-19 units were not included in the priority group.
Ivy Vega, an occupational therapist who has been treating COVID-19 patients at another NewYork-Presbyterian hospital, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, said she grew frustrated waiting to be vaccinated while others received the shot. She received her first dose on Wednesday.
“There has been a sense of camaraderie — that’s what’s helped us carry on during the pandemic,” she said. “And now this thing we should be celebrating — the arrival of this much anticipated vaccine — it’s turning into a rivalry. There is competitiveness and skepticism and mistrust.”
At Morgan Stanley Children’s Hospital, some nurses said they had yet to be vaccinated a week after vaccinations began.
“I think the sad thing is people are starting to turn against each other,” one doctor who works at the hospital said. “Can you honestly say this clerk deserves it before I do? No, but nobody deserves it before anyone else.”
Another doctor working in an intensive care unit at the children’s hospital recalled the scene last week: A group of staff members were striding energetically toward the elevator banks, where a vaccination station awaited. One of them even explained in passing that they were on their way to get the vaccine.
“It was a free-for-all,” said the doctor, who requested anonymity for fear of retribution from the hospital.
Albanese, chief operating officer of the children’s hospital, addressed the free-for-all in the email, placing some blame on the vaccination team for not limiting vaccinations to people on their list.
“We need to prioritize the highest risk teams,” he wrote.
At Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan, the vaccine rollout has unfolded in plain view, in the hospital’s atrium, which staff members crisscross throughout the work day or visit to grab a snack or coffee. Many doctors and nurses said they would glance over to see who was standing in line — and whether that person fit the government’s recommendations for those who should be prioritized.
“Despite our strict and stringent vaccination policies and procedures, we are aware of a handful of accusations of improprieties,” Mount Sinai said in a statement. “Due to confidentiality, we cannot speak to any specific individual issue, however, any allegations of any missteps will be appropriately and thoroughly investigated.
Last weekend, anesthesiologists — who have played a crucial role in treating the sickest patients during the outbreak in New York — complained that they had watched others get vaccinated before them.
That led to the anonymous letter sent to hospital administrators.
“A boiling point was reached when we witnessed vaccines being administered, seemingly at random, to employees who were not a part of the originally-planned cohort,” read the letter, which was sent in the name of “Concerned Faculty Members” of the department of anesthesiology, perioperative and pain medicine. The letter was first reported by Politico.
In interviews, several anesthesiologists at Mount Sinai noted that their colleagues at some other hospitals had already been vaccinated.
The anesthesiologists said they expected to play a major role in the second wave if hospitalizations kept rising, and in recent days some in the department have gotten vaccinated.
But just last week, an email from the head of the anesthesiology department, Dr. Andrew Leibowitz, asked for volunteers willing to work full time in a unit for critically ill COVID-19 patients if the outbreak worsened. Some in the department felt they were being told there might be an upside to volunteering, the email noted.
“I am looking into the possibility of having persons volunteering to perform this duty possibly vaccinated earlier than they might otherwise be,” Leibowitz wrote.
Leibowitz did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
One anesthesiologist said he recognized it was reasonable to vaccinate the volunteers first.
But also, he said, it “felt that they were using the vaccine as a bargaining chip.”

Liu Fengfeng had more than a decade under his belt at one of the world’s most prominent technology companies before he realized where the real gold rush in China was taking place.
Computer chips are the brains and souls of all the electronics the country’s factories crank out. Yet they are mostly designed and produced overseas. China’s government is lavishing money on anyone who can help change that.
So last year Liu, 40, left his job at Foxconn, the Taiwanese giant that assembles iPhones in China for Apple. He found a niche — high-end films and adhesives for chip products — and quickly raised $5 million. Today, his startup has 36 employees, most of them in the tech hub of Shenzhen, and is aiming to start mass production next year.
“Before, you might have had to beg Grandpa and call on Grandma for money,” Liu said. “Now, you just have a few conversations, and everyone is actively bidding and hoping you get started as soon as possible.”
China is in the midst of a mass mobilization for chip mastery, a quest whose aims can seem just as harebrained and impossible — at least until they are achieved — as sending rovers to the moon or dominating Olympic gold medals. In every corner of the country, investors, entrepreneurs and local officials are in a frenzy to build up semiconductor abilities, responding to a call from the country’s leader, Xi Jinping, to rely less on the outside world in key technologies.
Their efforts are starting to pay off. China remains far from hosting real rivals to U.S. chip giants like Intel and Nvidia, and its semiconductor manufacturers are at least four years behind the leading edge in Taiwan. Still, local companies are expanding their ability to meet the country’s needs, particularly for products such as smart appliances and electric vehicles, which have more modest requirements than supercomputers and high-end smartphones.
The turbocharged chip push could prove one of the most enduring legacies of President Donald Trump’s pugilistic trade policies toward China. By turning the country’s dependence on foreign chips into a cudgel for attacking companies like Huawei, the administration made Chinese business and political leaders resolve never to be caught out that way again.
But as Beijing broadens its ambitions in semiconductors, it is also setting itself up for larger potential failures — and dialing up the amount of money it might lose in the process. Several chip projects have run aground recently because of frozen funding and mismanagement. A state-backed chip conglomerate, Tsinghua Unigroup, warned this month that it was in danger of defaulting on nearly $2.5 billion in international bonds.
In a way, China is hoping to achieve the same kind of liftoff that helped it progress from making plastic toys to crafting solar panels.
With semiconductors, though, “the model starts to break down a little bit,” said Jay Goldberg, a tech industry consultant and former Qualcomm executive. The technology is eye-wateringly expensive to develop, and established players have spent decades accumulating know-how. Europe, Goldberg noted, once had many “incredible” chip companies. Japan’s chipmakers are leaders in certain specialized products, but few would call them bold innovators.
“My point is, there is a ladder — China’s moving up it,” Goldberg said. But it’s “unclear which outcome they go to.”
Beijing’s recent love of chips began with the creation of a giant, chip-focused investment fund in 2014. The government set a lofty goal: China would produce 40% of the chips it consumed by 2020. That didn’t happen. Morgan Stanley analysts estimate that Chinese brands bought $103 billion in semiconductors last year, of which 17% was from local vendors. They predict the share will rise to 40% in 2025, far short of the government’s target of 70%.
China has charged ahead with renewed urgency because of the U.S. assault on Huawei, the Chinese tech champion, which has been choked off from buying U.S. chips or even chips made using U.S. software and tools. The U.S. Commerce Department imposed similar curbs this month on exports to China’s most advanced chip manufacturer, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., citing concerns over military ties. SMIC has denied its products have any military use.
And so, China this year has rolled out new tax breaks for chips, including a 10-year exemption from corporate tax and duty-free imports of materials. State-backed funds have invested in both startups and publicly traded companies, including when SMIC listed shares in Shanghai in July.
At a top-level meeting on the economy last week, the Communist Party’s leaders enshrined technological self-reliance as one of the country’s “Five Fundamentals” for economic development.
Complete self-sufficiency in chips, however, would mean recreating every part of the lengthy supply chains for some of the most complex technology on earth — a mission that would seem to lead, if not to madness, at least to waste.
According to an analysis by China Economic Weekly, a magazine affiliated with the Communist Party’s official newspaper, People’s Daily, the number of chip-related companies in China climbed by 58,000 between January and October this year, or roughly 200 a day. Some of these, the magazine noted, were in Tibet — not a place traditionally associated with cutting-edge tech.
“Up until very recently — this year — the goal had been: With state backing, move up the value chain, specialize where China has a comparative advantage, but don’t really try and fall down the rabbit hole of trying to build everything yourself,” said Jimmy Goodrich, vice president for global policy at the Semiconductor Industry Association, a group that represents U.S. chip companies.
Now, “it’s very clear that Xi Jinping is calling for a redundant domestic supply chain,” Goodrich said. “And so the rules of economics, comparative advantage and the supply-chain efficiencies have basically been thrown out the door.”
The government is conscious of the dangers. State-run news outlets have amply covered the recent semiconductor flameouts. The message to other startups: Don’t mess it up.
When the state broadcaster China Central Television visited one stalled project in the eastern city of Huai’an recently, it found dozens of giant machines idling on the factory floor, many of them still sheathed in plastic.
“There have been some stunning absurdities that defy logic and common sense,” China Economic Weekly said.
Yet there has also been progress. Two companies, Yangtze Memory Technologies and ChangXin Memory Technologies, are gearing up to put China on the map in memory chips, which store data. Local manufacturers of logic chips, which perform computations, are expanding production, largely for Chinese customers.
Those manufacturers might not have much choice but to serve domestic clients. Some multinational chipmakers are starting to think twice about working with Chinese suppliers and partners out of concerns about intellectual property theft, said Randy Abrams, a tech analyst with Credit Suisse.
“International companies are becoming more wary about the IP leakage in China,” he said.
Liu, the startup founder in Shenzhen, does not deny being motivated by a certain patriotic purpose. Emblazoned atop the website for his company, Tsinghon, is a proud reference to the Mao-era project that produced China’s first atomic bomb, ballistic missile and satellite: "Inherit the Spirit of 'Two Bombs, One Satellite.' Be Self-Reliant and Bold in Forging Ahead."
Liu says the sense of national mission does not conflict with his work serving customers and putting out competitive products. He does acknowledge, when he looks at the sky-high valuations for some chip startups, that irrationality has crept into the market.
“There is definitely a bubble in China,” he said. “But you can’t overgeneralize.”
The government, he said, is trying to hold local authorities more accountable for bad investments. And the torrent of money might at least persuade more skilled engineers in China to work on chips instead of video games and food delivery apps.
“Something is bound to accumulate, whether it’s equipment, talent or factories, right?” Liu said. “If not you or the other guy, then it will be someone else who ends up using it. I think this might be the government’s logic.”

NEW YORK — In the months leading up to the election, as the restaurant where she has worked for 18 years in Corona, Queens, struggled to survive, Juliana Rodriguez wavered over her choice for president.
President Donald Trump’s immigration policies and the way he spoke about Latino immigrants stung Rodriguez and pushed her toward Joe Biden. But, she reasoned, it was the president’s administration that oversaw the delivery of the stimulus check that had arrived last spring, just as she had felt the pandemic might crush her.
She chose Trump.
“I don’t like when someone talks about our people,” Rodriguez, 55, who is Dominican, said. “But when I saw everything he did during the first four months of the pandemic, I said to myself, ‘Maybe he changed.’”
In casting her vote, Rodriguez joined a surge of support for Trump in New York City. And while he once again lost his native city by wide margins, he increased his share of votes in nearly all of the city’s 65 assembly districts.
Some of the president’s biggest gains came in pockets of Brooklyn neighborhoods that are home to the city’s Hasidic community, where Trump was expected to run strongly.
But he also improved greatly on his 2016 showing in immigrant-heavy districts in Queens and the Bronx, mirroring gains among Latino voters in Florida, Texas and elsewhere amid surging turnout.
The president’s gains still left him far behind Biden in these sections of the city. But the shift was pronounced, reflecting the reality that New York City’s diverse group of Hispanic American voters is far from monolithic.
In a heavily Dominican section of the West Bronx, where more than three-quarters of the population is Latino, Trump won just 5% of the vote in 2016. In 2020, he carried more than 15%. In the neighborhood where Rodriguez lives and works, Trump’s support grew from under 15% to around 27%.
Experts said some voters were drawn to Trump by a mixture of economic policy, religious values and their belief that he is a strong leader. And though Biden still overwhelmingly won the city, collecting 72% of the total vote across the five boroughs on his way to winning the election, the president’s improved performance startled some Democrats.
Even now, weeks after the election, it remains unclear whether some Latino voters’ apparent shift toward a Republican candidate represents a lasting reshaping of traditional political allegiances or a phenomenon unique to an unconventional president.
“With Trump, there is a kind of eclectic mix of policies — anti-trade, and easy money, and you have a very good economy — which can play into, ‘This seems to be working for me,’” said Daniel DiSalvo, a professor of political science at City College of New York, and author of “Engines of Change: Party Factions in American Politics.”
“Trump did have a basket of policies that were potentially appealing to those groups in a way that maybe some people couldn’t see,” he said.
George L. Rosario, 48, who runs a real estate company, and is from Ridgewood, Queens, believes Trump’s economic policies helped Latino small-business owners like him. And he agrees with the president’s stance on immigration — even though, Rosario said, some peers accuse him of turning his back on his own community by supporting the president.
“When there are people standing in line to get here legally, and when you have people jumping the line and hurting the community, that is a big issue for anyone, including a small-business owner,” said Rosario, who also runs a public speaking and marketing agency. Rosario said he had been registered as an independent and voted for Barack Obama, but in 2016 he switched to the Republican Party and voted for Trump.
He added that the president’s rhetoric about Latinos does not affect him. “I don’t listen to the sound bites,” he said. “I look at the policies, and I look at how those policies will affect me, my family and my business.”
Certified results released this month by the New York City Board of Elections show that in nearly 90% of the city’s Assembly Districts, even where he lost, Trump’s share of the vote increased over four years ago. And while precise demographic voter results are not available, a review of election district results shows that he ran considerably stronger in heavily Dominican and Mexican American areas like Elmhurst and Corona in Queens.
The results bucked conventional perceptions of Latino voters’ loyalty to the Democratic Party. Yet for some, the improved support for the president is hard to reconcile with the Trump administration’s policies and Trump’s own words, which for four years were widely criticized as racist.
“Even if he is racist, they believe that what he is delivering is more important than how he acts,” said José Rámón Sánchez, a professor of political science at Long Island University Brooklyn and chair of the National Institute of Latino Policy.
Sánchez attributed the president’s appeal to a number of factors, including religious conservatism among Latinos and a culture of reverence toward Trump-like machismo in Latin American countries. He said the Trump campaign also made more concerted efforts to cultivate Latino voters, while Democrats largely assumed their fealty.
“There is a tendency to think about Latinos as mostly concerned about immigration, and they are, but not as much as they are about jobs, security, things like housing, that all people are concerned about,” Sánchez said. “And Democrats haven’t done much to make it clear to the Latino community that they are going to do something about those issues.”
He pointed to the Democratic Party’s down-ballot losses as an example of the risk to the party going forward, should Democrats fail to cultivate Latino voters.
The shift has caused tension within the community, particularly between younger Latinos and older and first-generation immigrants, who tend to be more conservative, according to studies of voting behavior.
In the months leading up to the election, Jonathan Acosta, 25, who is Latino and voted for Biden, began to notice a shift among his neighbors in Corona toward Trump. They were wooed, he believes, by their religious values, but also the stronger-than-expected economy, and in particular the stimulus relief during the pandemic.
The support for the president dismayed him. “All the stuff that he has said about not only us, but all types of minorities, it’s just racism,” said Acosta, an airplane maintenance technician.
What was particularly galling, he added, was when he learned that this mother, who is deeply religious, planned to vote for Trump, based on what she saw as his support of religious conservatism — and, according to her son, a steady social media drip of misinformation.
He still has not asked her if she cast her ballot for Trump on Election Day. “I don’t want to know that was her vote,” he said. “If that’s what it was.”
Trump’s support also grew in more expected places: the few pockets of the city where he has always been popular with voters.
Results from election districts show that Trump’s margins of victory grew in the Hasidic Jewish enclaves of Crown Heights, Brooklyn, and in overwhelmingly white communities like Breezy Point.
Trump made gains among the Hasidic community because they believed he was strongly pro-Israel and shared their conservative views on social issues, according to political scientists.
Some Hasidic New Yorkers cleaved tighter to Trump because of his approach to the pandemic. Some in the Hasidic community view New York state’s virus controls, which include limiting the size of religious gathering, as a form of religious persecution.
“The same kind of energy that inspired evangelical Christians to really cast their lot in with Trump, I think that you would find that same type of sentiment among the religious Jews,” said Seth Barron, an associate editor of City Journal, a publication of the Manhattan Institute, which is a center-right leaning think tank.
But the gains in the five boroughs are perhaps a cold comfort for Trump in a city and country he resoundingly lost. Overall in New York City, Biden received 2,321,759 votes, according to the New York City Board of Elections. Trump received just 691,682.

BRUSSELS — The European Union emerges from fraught negotiations with Britain over its exit from the bloc with a sense of satisfaction — that it has maintained its unity and its core principles, especially the integrity of the single market of now 450 million consumers that is the foundation of its influence.
And it is now looking ahead to its life without Britain.
Ursula von der Leyen, the trilingual German who is the head of the European Commission, the bloc’s powerful bureaucracy, emerged from the wrangling with her political profile and reputation enhanced.
Normally at the end of a negotiation she felt joy, von der Leyen said Thursday. But today, she said, “I only feel quiet satisfaction and, frankly speaking, relief.”
It was time “to look to the future,” she said. “It is time to leave Brexit behind. Our future is made in Europe.”
It has been a satisfying end to a difficult year for von der Leyen and the EU as a whole. The bloc was buffeted by serious challenges ranging from the pandemic to securing a new seven-year budget and a sizable virus recovery fund to help those countries most badly hit. That fund embodies a collective European debt for the first time.
The EU also has had to cope with internal challenges to the rule of law and continuing antagonism from President Donald Trump, craft a tougher stance toward China and Turkey, agree on sanctions against Belarus, try to find a coherent response to calls for strategic autonomy and more European defense, come together on climate goals, and prepare positions for the administration of President-elect Joe Biden.
Compared with many of those issues, Brexit was always a “third-order problem,” said Guntram Wolff, director of Bruegel, a Brussels research institution.
Still, he said, “the deal is quite an achievement” — one that he and many others had thought unlikely even a week ago.
But Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, whose country holds the revolving presidency of the bloc until the end of the year, “really wanted a deal,” Wolff said. The Germans, with Europe and NATO as core national interests, see Britain as too close, too big and too important to be allowed to drift away without one.
Von der Leyen, who had served in Merkel’s Cabinets, is close to her and got this job at the instigation of President Emmanuel Macron of France, was ideally situated to do the final compromises — checking back with European capitals — that have finally produced a deal.
“I’m sure the Germans made their desires clear” to von der Leyen, Wolff said. “But you need the president of the commission to directly call the Elysée and the Chancellery and do the deal.”
The final deal is a free-trade agreement that recognizes Britain’s desire to leave the single market and the customs union while preserving tariff-free, quota-free trade in goods with the EU.
To that end, Britain agreed to a mechanism, with arbitration and possible tariffs for violations, that would keep its regulations and subsidies roughly in line with those of Brussels, to prevent unfair competition. But the deal will require inspections of goods to prevent smuggling, especially of live animals.
The deal also covers many mundane but crucial matters of visas, health insurance and air, rail and road travel. It treats Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom, as within the EU customs area to prevent the need for a hard border on the island but requires some checks on goods going from Britain to Northern Ireland.
And the deal reallocates fishing areas and quotas, given that Britain is now an independent coastal state.
Real power in the EU rests with the member states, but they authorized the commission and the chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, to hammer out the complicated treaty while laying down their red lines.
Barnier, working with a varied series of counterparts as British governments changed, brought the member states together. By constantly briefing them and the European Parliament, he managed to keep the bloc unified despite British efforts to deal directly with various capitals.
When the hardest political decisions had to be made, the British prime minister had to speak to von der Leyen. Although their relationship is cool — she seems vaccinated against the shambling charm of Boris Johnson — she delivered.
If Henry Kissinger used to complain that the EU had no phone number to call, the Lisbon Treaty, which went into force 11 years ago, did much to clarify matters and to personalize the bloc into three presidents: Charles Michel of the European Council of member states, David Sassoli of the European Parliament, and von der Leyen.
So while Johnson’s predecessors used to complain bitterly about the power and whimsy of von der Leyen’s predecessor, Jean-Claude Juncker, Johnson did have a number to call.
In the end, this is a narrow free-trade deal, but one that grants Britain more trading rights within the EU than any other third country. But it does create a lot of paperwork and delays and does not include services, which make up some 80% of the British economy.
And it will inevitably have a larger and more negative impact on Britain, given the comparative size of the two entities. Britain earns about 13% of its gross domestic product from exports to the EU, which earns just 3% of its GDP from exports to Britain.
But the deal lays the groundwork for more talks and better relations. Denis MacShane, a former Europe minister for Britain, calls this “Brexiternity,” given the many years of talking still to come.
Von der Leyen’s tenure began rockily, with a concentration on migration as the virus took hold in Europe and began to paralyze the movement of goods and people, even within the Schengen zone of free movement. Health was never a central competence of Brussels, left to the states, and von der Leyen and the commission often seemed at a loss.
She was also criticized for being too aloof, for working with too small a coterie of advisers and for engaging a private company to improve her public relations.
But greatly aided by her close relationship with the German and French leaders, she pulled the commission together to improve the movement of goods and people and to organize collective purchases of personal protective equipment and then of possible vaccines, at a favorable price.
She also basked in the glow of the German-French compromise that finally allowed collective debt to be created for the virus recovery fund. It also led just this month to agreement on the seven-year budget, the fund and the ability to condition some future spending on adherence by member states — Hungary and Poland in particular — to the rule of law.
There was also agreement in long discussions over climate goals, to more realistically hope to become carbon neutral by 2050. Much of that groundwork had been done by the commission.
As usual with the EU’s 27 member states, the victories are hard-fought and not always easily explained. But a Brexit deal was either going to be done by the end of the year or not. And von der Leyen delivered.
“Does that mean that she has become a strong commission president?” Wolff, the Bruegel analyst, said. “I’m not sure I would go so far. But this was important, it was delivered, and it would have been a mess if it had not been delivered, and European citizens would not have understood a failure on top of the economic damage already done by the virus.”

What if you went on a road trip, and never came back?
Two couples called the road their home for years, logging hundreds of thousands of adventurous miles. Their refuges? For one couple, a Mitsubishi Delica four-wheel-drive van, small when compared with an RV or even other vans, let alone a faddish tiny house. For another, a Ford Festiva, small compared with just about anything on four wheels.
The coronavirus pandemic has idled both couples and their vehicles, for now, as they all wait for their next chapters.
That 1988 two-door Festiva came to be known as the Peace Love Car. It was Sam Salwei’s home for eight years, and Raquel Hernández-Cruz joined him four years in. After a chance meeting and then traveling together for a month in 2012, they reunited in 2013 — and have been together ever since.
“While I was working on my bachelor’s degree, a friend gifted me the car,” said Salwei, a 39-year-old native of Crystal, North Dakota, who got his degree in social entrepreneurship at the University of North Dakota. “A free car that was also gas-efficient was a dream. I really didn’t need anything else.”
He started with short road trips, then figured he could stay places longer if he didn’t need to return home. “Little by little I started adapting the car to allow me to sleep in it,” he said, pointing to “a slow five-year conversion.”
As the car rests at Salwei’s mother’s North Dakota home, the couple have continued their travels. They have spent recent winters in Thailand, but after the coronavirus outbreak early this year, they left to ride out the pandemic with Hernández-Cruz’s family in Puerto Rico. In September they headed to California, where they, too, bought a Delica and have been outfitting it while living a hermit lifestyle in Long Beach.
For Hernández-Cruz, who is 40 and grew up in rural Puerto Rico, “my life seemed pretty ordinary as I followed the road previously laid by my parents — school, college, marriage, grad school, maybe have children and work at one job for the rest of your life.”
That was not her path. She started practicing yoga, and wanted something different. She met Salwei and they were soon traveling the world as the YogaSlackers, teaching “slackline yoga,” on what is basically a tightrope.
Their car was, of course, heavily adapted to the nomadic life. It had at least 10 USB charging ports, seven 12-volt power ports and six 110-volt plug-ins. It took two RV-type batteries and 400 watts’ worth of solar panels to power the hatchback, a small fridge, various electronics and a ceiling fan.
The windows had screens, the body panels were insulated, and the bed slept two adults (snugly). It has a DIY rear lift kit, with an upgraded suspension and steering system. Two rooftop boxes functioned as the attic, holding adventure equipment, backpacks, cameras and accessories.
The car’s kitchen consisted of a Craftsman tool bag and “a random combination of camp kitchen and home kitchen items,” Hernández-Cruz said, everything as small and light as possible. When hunger hit, they pulled over and cooked: free campgrounds, rest stops, gas stations or the side of the road. Empty, the car weighed just over 2,500 pounds, but full it pushed over 3,700 pounds.
Everything in the car “has a place, and usually you can reach it in less than three movements,” Salwei said. “Parking is a breeze, it’s easy to squeeze into small campsites, and most importantly you can pick it up and move it by hand if necessary.”
The Festiva’s odometer reads 524,000 miles, and since 2008 it has crossed the United States about 20 times. Since 2013, the couple have toured and taught their way through three countries and 49 states (Hawaii the exception). The Festiva got a farewell tour in 2014, and since 2017 they have been trying to find it a new home, seeking “a worthy pilot in need of an adventure,” Salwei said.
In the slightly bigger quarters (53.8 square feet) of their 1991 Mitsubishi Delica Star Wagon, Pablo Rey and Anna Callau have wound their way through 60 countries.
Their vehicle has a nickname, too: La Cucaracha, and it was home to the couple for 16 years. It was even the guest of honor in their Las Vegas wedding — they said their vows in a drive-through ceremony in 2011.
What started as a four-year-long jaunt, one continent per year, turned into a never-ending journey. “Life outside of our usual boundaries was far more rich and exciting,” said Rey, 54, who grew up in Buenos Aires.
The couple’s travels with the van are paused, however, and it’s parked near Reno, Nevada, awaiting post-pandemic times. Rey and Callau, 48, are staying near her family’s home in Europe in the meantime.
The couple paid around $10,500 for the van on Christmas Eve in 1999 in Barcelona, Spain, with about 52,000 miles on the odometer. (They later suspected it had been illegally rolled back considerably.) They have made plenty of adjustments over the years, including an extra 20-gallon fuel tank and a solar panel.
Across their 245,000 miles of journeys, they encountered challenges and breakdowns. In Sudan, “we lost the cover of the air filter and half of the sand from the Sahara Desert went into the engine,” Rey said. “We were in an area where nobody speaks English, only Arabic.”
The local mechanics fixed only tractors. The couple had no phone, no embassy and no AAA to ask for help. Still, they managed.
In Kenya, bandits with AK-47s attempted a robbery. Rey and Callau were attacked by thieves in Trinidad and Tobago, and in Kitum Cave, Kenya, Ebola cases were being diagnosed as they traveled through. The Andes Mountains in Chile posed another threat: The Delica’s engine quit at 15,000 feet and had to be replaced.
The Festiva had its share of troubles, too. In the 400,000-plus miles Salwei has put on it, bad transmissions were switched out on the side of the road and in grocery store parking lots. Nothing, however, was more challenging than being sick while living in 28 rolling square feet together.
“Our body is the most intrinsic machine we own,” Hernández-Cruz said. “We have to do our best to keep it going for a long time.”
Adversity or challenges can lead to reward and happiness. “Interesting stories usually come when you go out of your comfort zone,” said Callau, who is from Barcelona and identifies as Catalan. The couple share their travels online via Viajeros 4x4x4 and related social media channels.
“To live on the road is to live with much more freedom,” Callau added. The couple have worked in a bar in Chile and a ski resort as “piste” police. They printed and sold T-shirts, postcards and books they wrote about their journey to help fund their travels. They even developed a comic strip with a friend from Boston about living on the road.
One of the most rewarding parts has been “being the owners/masters of our time,” Callau said. “The magic now is in the unexpected,” Rey added.
For Kathryn Joyce, a fellow YogaSlackers teacher and postdoctoral researcher at Princeton’s University Center for Human Values, the Peace Love Car was “fun, inviting, unapologetic.” It even symbolized freedom, she said: “Freedom from consumerism, societal standards, burdensome obligations, but also freedom in the sense of self-reliance.”
That Festiva was laden with over 2,000 stickers, which they said contributed to countless police stops and border inspections, but relatively few tickets. It was “much more than a car or a house,” Salwei said. “It is the ultimate smile maker.” He added, “Everyone that sees the car reacts to it, most of the time with a beaming smile.”

Texto completo: INDIANAPOLIS – A Black doctor who died of COVID-19 after weeks of battling the virus had said she was mistreated and delayed proper care at an Indiana hospital because of her race.
Dr. Susan Moore, 52, died Dec. 20 following multiple hospitalizations for complications from COVID-19, first at IU Health North and later at Ascencion-St. Vincent in Carmel, Indiana.
Her frustrations with the care provided at IU Health were chronicled on Facebook in multiple updates. The first came Dec. 4 when she said delays in her treatment and diagnosis were motivated by the color of her skin.
In a 7½-minute video posted to her Facebook page, Moore described frustrating back-and-forths with a white hospitalist with the IU Health system.
She described having her complaints of severe neck pain disregarded, despite drawing from her years of medical expertise to make a self-assessment.
"I was crushed," a tearful Moore said of the doctor's refusal to provide her pain medication. "He made me feel like I was a drug addict. And he knew I was a physician. I don't take narcotics. I was hurting."
'An unbelievable chain of oppression': America's history of racism was a preexisting condition for COVID-19
She said she had to plead with and convince her physician she was having trouble breathing before receiving a CT scan. When the scan revealed that what she was saying was true, she was given medication to manage her pain. But only after hours of waiting.
“I put forth and I maintain," she said in the video, "if I was white, I wouldn’t have to go through that.”
'Clearly everyone has to agree they (discharged) me way too soon'
From her hospital bed, Moore, who is remembered as someone who loved helping others, said she was speaking out so that the treatment she endured would not be overlooked.
“This is how Black people get killed, when you send them home and they don’t know how to fight for themselves,” she said into the camera. “I had to talk to somebody, maybe the media, somebody, to let people know how I’m being treated up in this place.”
After being sent home, Moore was back in a hospital bed within 12 hours, according to her Facebook updates. This time she was being treated at Ascencion-St. Vincent and was experiencing better care.
Shortly after being discharged from IU Health on Dec. 7, Moore said she experienced a spike in temperature and a drop in her blood pressure.
"Those people were trying to kill me. Clearly everyone has to agree they (discharged) me way too soon," she wrote of IU Health before giving an assessment of her care at Ascencion-St. Vincent. "They are now treating me for a bacterial pneumonia as well as Covid pneumonia. I am getting very compassionate care. They are offering me pain medicine."
Citing patient privacy, an IU Health spokesperson declined to speak specifically to the case, but shared a written statement on behalf of IU Health North:
“As an organization committed to equity and reducing racial disparities in healthcare, we take accusations of discrimination very seriously and investigate every allegation," the statement reads. "Treatment options are often agreed upon and reviewed by medical experts from a variety of specialties, and we stand by the commitment and expertise of our caregivers and the quality of care delivered to our patients every day.”
IndyStar, part of the USA TODAY Network, is reaching out for comment from the doctor that tended to Moore.

Despite the change in care, Moore's condition continued to deteriorate. She died in the hospital three weeks after her Nov. 29 diagnosis.
Moore's experience and death sparked outrage and sadness across social media. Many pointed to it as the latest example of racism and discrimination in health care, as well as the disproportionate toll COVID-19 has taken among Black patients.
It also led to an outpouring of support for the loved ones she leaves behind.
Moore is survived by her 19-year-old son and recent high school graduate, Henry Muhammed. In an interview with the New York Times, Henry said his mother was still thinking of others to the very end.
During their last conversation, Moore said she was going to help her son go to college.
Moore's family told the New York Times that she was born in Jamaica but grew up in Michigan. She studied engineering at Kettering University and earned her medical degree from the University of Michigan Medical School, according to her family.

Brexit Is Finally Done, but It Already Seems Out of Date

LONDON — It took 11 grueling months for negotiators from Britain and the European Union to hammer out the terms of a post-Brexit trade deal. But in many respects, the deal is already 4 1/2 years out of date.
The world has changed radically since June 2016, when a narrow majority of people in Britain voted to leave the European Union, tempted by an argument that the country would prosper by throwing off the bureaucratic shackles of Brussels.
In those days, the vision of an agile, independent Britain — free to develop profitable, next-generation industries like artificial intelligence and cut its own trade deals with the United States, China and others — was an alluring sales pitch. The buccaneers of Brexit promised to create a “Global Britain.”
That was before the anti-immigrant and anti-globalist-fueled rise of President Donald Trump and other populist leaders who erected barriers to trade and immigration and countries turned inward. It was before the coronavirus pandemic exposed the vulnerabilities of far-flung supply chains, fueling calls to bring strategic industries back home and throwing globalism into retreat.
In the anxious dawn of 2021, buccaneers are out of fashion. The world is now dominated by three gargantuan economic blocs — the United States, China and the European Union. Britain has finalized its divorce from one of them, leaving it isolated at a time when the path forward seems more perilous than it once did.
“The whole ‘Global Britain’ model doesn’t reflect the more protectionist, nationalistic world we’re living in,” said Thomas Wright, the director of the Center on the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution. “Becoming a global free trader in 2016 is a bit like turning into a communist in 1989. It's bad timing.”
As Prime Minister Boris Johnson leads Britain into a post-Brexit future, he also risks being out of step politically.
The Brexit agreement with the European Union comes at the very moment that President-elect Joe Biden is replacing Trump’s “America First” credo with a message of mending alliances and collaborating to tackle issues like global health and climate change.
While the deal averts tariffs and quotas on goods crossing the English Channel, it is at heart about disentangling neighbors who had become deeply integrated over four decades. That estrangement, analysts say, is bound to weaken ties between the two sides in other areas, like security and diplomacy.
“Biden wants to see alliances and multilateralism and cooperation, and Brexit runs completely against that,” said Mujtaba Rahman, an analyst at the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy. “Brexit is graduating into a more difficult political context where it is running against the grain.”
Trump cheered Britain’s drive to sever itself from the European Union. As a reward, he promised to negotiate a trade agreement with Johnson, whom he cultivated personally. But Biden opposed Brexit and has ruled out negotiating new trade agreements until the United States improves its own competitive position. That nullifies one of the prime selling points of Brexit.
Johnson has pivoted by highlighting other ways that Britain can work with the United States. It is increasing military spending to reinforce NATO and playing host at a U.N. climate summit next year, which will give Biden a platform to reengage the United States in the climate challenge.
Britain has also promoted itself as a champion of democratic values in places like Hong Kong, standing alongside the United States. But in a less hospitable world, it may not find many allies for that kind of work.
“Who are the obvious partners for them?” Wright said. “Four years ago, they could have said Brazil, but Brazil is now run by Bolsonaro,” he added, referring to the populist president, Jair Bolsonaro.
There are also limits to how muscular a partner Britain can be in the confrontation with autocratic states like China and Russia. Its changing relationship with China illustrates its diminished stature.
Britain once hoped its free-agent status would allow it to develop a thriving commercial relationship with Beijing, unencumbered by the baggage of the European Union or the United States. But under pressure from Trump on the role of Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei in 5G networks, Britain has largely abandoned its cultivation of China, falling in line with the United States’ more antagonistic position.
The European Union, by contrast, has continued to negotiate a landmark investment treaty with China, a goal of the Germans, who want greater control over the Chinese operations of their companies. Last-minute objections raised by aides to Biden are giving the Europeans second thoughts, but Germany’s drive to finish the deal before the end of the year attests to its more confident position.
In 2016, Brexit was embraced by three distinct factions in British politics, said Matthias Matthijs, a professor of international political economy at Johns Hopkins University: right-wing anti-immigration figures like Nigel Farage; orthodox free traders in the Conservative Party; and some on the left, who hoped the move would free up money to subsidize factory jobs in the country’s industrial north and, in any event, regarded the European Union as a bankers’ club that Britain was well out of.
“It’s not clear that signing this EU trade deal will give them more freedom to do that,” Matthijs said of the subsidies, noting that Britain had agreed to abide by constraints on how much state aid it can dole out to industry.
The paradox, he said, is that Britain is casting off from the European Union at a time when its two largest economies, Germany and France, are embracing some of the tenets of industrial policy that inspired Brexit.
The pandemic has forced Brussels to reconsider policies it once shunned — initially in the form of a $2.8 trillion coronavirus rescue package — that bring it closer to the ideas pushed by Brexiteers, like Johnson’s former chief adviser, Dominic Cummings. He was an architect of a plan to use public money to “level up” Britain’s economically disadvantaged north with its more prosperous south.
Liberating itself from the constraints of Brussels had been one of the biggest attractions of Brexit. Instead, Britain faces a much larger competitor that seems bent, like Britain itself, on transforming its economies with digital and “green” technology — and more open to using state aid to do so.
Another irony of Brexit is that Europe, alienated by the unilateral policies of Trump, has begun echoing some of the language used by Brexiteers in 2016. President Emmanuel Macron of France and others have spoken of the need for “European sovereignty” in the face of a less reliable United States. Johnson made reclaiming British sovereignty the leitmotif of his negotiations with Brussels.
Britain still has indisputable advantages as it charts a new course. Despite being devastated by the pandemic, its economy is flexible and resilient, at least relative to those on the European continent. It was the first Western country to approve a virus vaccine, while the European Union has been bogged down by the need for its members to move together.
Matthijs predicted that Britain’s economy would snap back faster after the pandemic than those of Germany or France, which he said the Brexiteers would attribute to the freedom gained by shaking loose of Brussels.
Britain’s independence also affords it the chance to be experimental in its relations with other countries. Wright, for example, said the Biden administration might be interested in negotiating a different kind of economic understanding with Britain than an old-fashioned free trade agreement.
“They’re well positioned to be the guinea pig for this,” he said.
Britain, after all, just negotiated a deal unique in the annals of trade diplomacy — one that separates, rather than brings together, partners. Its ability to get that done, analysts said, is a hopeful sign for its ability to reshape itself yet again.
Nevertheless, “the world of June 2016 is not the world of today,” Wright said. “They know that as well, deep down.”

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
When the Rev. Timothy Cole learned he had COVID-19 in early March, it was the first known case of the virus in Washington, D.C. Cole, rector of Christ Church Georgetown, was hospitalized for three weeks.
Now fully recovered, the Episcopal priest is leading his church through what is typically one of the busiest and most festive seasons of the Christian calendar. In a normal year, up to 800 people might attend just one of the church’s Christmas Eve services. There would be a children’s pageant and carols and pews packed with worshippers.
This year, pandemic restrictions cap attendance in the sanctuary at 100. Singing is now known to be one of the most dangerous activities for virus transmission, so the annual carol service moved online. Children took photos in their pageant costumes at home.
“The darkness seems pretty dark at the moment,” Cole reflected a few days before Christmas.
But he finds hope in the spiritual significance of the Christmas story: a small event, the birth of a child, that proved to be a turning point in human history.
On Christmas Eve he will preach about hope in the face of fear and sadness, drawing on his experience as a chaplain in the British army.
“Just as wars come to end, so do pandemics,” his sermon reads. “Until then we are sustained and made strong by what we celebrate this day.”
When Easter arrived in April, the United States was about a month into widespread shutdowns. Then, many pastors were still adjusting to pandemic restrictions and working out the technological kinks of services streamed on Zoom or Facebook. But relatively few had been touched personally by the virus.
Eight months later, the virus is more than a mere symbol of fear. At least 18 million Americans have been infected, and more than 325,000 have died, equivalent to nearly 1 out of every 1,000 people in the country. Almost everyone knows someone who has had the virus.
“What was formerly an abstraction is now very real,” said the Rev. George Williams, who will preside over Christmas Eve Mass at St. Agnes Catholic Church in San Francisco.
The priest got the virus in June while he was serving as a chaplain at San Quentin State Prison, where more than 25 inmates have died of the virus. Watching it spread through the prison was an experience of “real terror,” he said.
And now comes Christmas. Culturally, it is a time for family gatherings, cross-country travel, intergenerational gift exchanges and sprawling group meals — rituals made challenging or impossible by the pandemic. Spiritually, it is a moment to celebrate the arrival of God in human form on Earth.
“How do we reconcile the hopeful theme of Christmas with the desolate year we just experienced?” Williams wondered. His homily at his new parish Thursday night will focus on “the heart of the Christmas message: the incarnation,” where God enters into the mortal experience of pain, grief and death.
Across the country, other Christian leaders were making similar attempts to reconcile spiritual hope and situational despair.
“In my heart it really doesn’t feel like Christmas because it didn’t feel like Thanksgiving, and it didn’t feel like Labor Day or the Fourth of July,” said the Rev. James Riley, senior pastor at House of Prayer Baptist Church in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. “It’s hard to muster up that joy.”
Still, he plans to preach on God’s faithfulness even in bleak times at a brief Christmas service Friday.
Attendees will wear masks and be spaced out in the small sanctuary as they sing “Joy to the World.” Large white cardboard letters at the front of the pulpit, visible to those watching from home on Facebook, spell out “HOPE.”
In Dallas, Abundant Life African Methodist Episcopal Church has been worshipping online since March. The church held its main Christmas service Sunday, as well as a virtual children’s program with songs, dancing, poetry and a play, all digitally stitched together from children in their homes.
The Rev. Michael Waters, the church’s founding pastor, preached a sermon inspired by the biblical account of Mary and Joseph’s arduous journey to Bethlehem, where they were told there was “no room for them in the inn.” Waters compared Mary and Joseph’s perilous situation to recent news of low intensive care capacity in Southern California and to a potential wave of evictions if a national moratorium is not extended.
“‘No room’ are frightful words and frightful experiences” that have deeper resonance at the end of this exhausting year, he said in an interview. The sermon was titled “Make Room.”
The pandemic has prevented pastors from preaching to crowded pews, but it has also kept them from other duties: sitting with the sick and comforting mourners.
“This loss is just huge and cavernous because you have not only the death but the inability to connect,” said the Rev. Carol Howard Merritt, pastor at Bedford Presbyterian Church in Bedford, New York. “You’re not able to hold those hands or give those hugs or cry with people in the same way.”
Merritt became pastor at the church in September and has still not met all of her congregants in person.
On Thursday afternoon, Merritt’s church will put on a Christmas Eve “pop-up pageant,” where children will receive costume masks on the spot and join a small procession outside. The church windows will be open, and organ music will waft through the air. In the evening, Merritt will preach outside, with a small group of parishioners gathered in front of the church.
The holiday centered on childbirth reminds her of being a new mother, gazing down at her infant daughter and feeling overwhelmed by the potential of new life — hopefully 90 years of life in one 6-pound infant.
This year, “there’s so much death and horror all around us, yet somehow we have the audacity to come together and remember life and hope and the beauty of potential,” she reflected. “We see glimmers of that with the vaccine coming. We can see enough around the corner to know that there will be life.”
Across the country, in California, First Presbyterian Church of Palo Alto has not met in person since March and does not expect to reconvene in person before the end of next summer.
In the Advent season leading up to Christmas, the Rev. Bruce Reyes-Chow, the senior pastor, found himself returning to the word “Immanuel,” a name for Jesus that means “God with us.”
“‘God with us’ this year takes on a whole new meaning,” he said. “He’s with us experiencing the grief and lament, but also the joy and hope and the peace.”
Reyes-Chow’s grandmother died of the virus Dec. 11. She was buried Wednesday, the day before Christmas Eve.
In preparation for the livestreamed Christmas Eve service this week, the church mailed candles and the words to the carol “Silent Night” to congregants, some now in far-flung locations.
At 5 p.m. and again at 11:30 p.m. Thursday, members will gather on Zoom, dim the lights in their homes, and sing “Silent night, holy night / All is calm, all is bright.” On the screens in front of them, a grid of rectangles will glow with candlelight, a glimpse of warmth in the long, dark night before Christmas morning.

Texto completo: Leslie West, the guitarist of Mountain, died of cardiac arrest on Wednesday.
West, 75, was known for his classic rock hit with the band, "Mississippi Queen," which was released in 1970. His spokesman, Steve Karas, told the Associated Press that West died Wednesday in Palm Coast, Florida of cardiac arrest, after being rushed to the hospital.
USA TODAY has reached out to West's rep for further information.
He had a number of health problems throughout the years, notes The New York Times. He faced bladder cancer in the early 2000s and needed to have his right leg amputated in 2011 due to diabetes complications.
Fellow musicians paid tribute to West on social media.
"So sad to hear the news of Leslie West’s passing. He was a great guitar player and his band Mountain were one of the first band that Sabbath supported on our early tour of America. We struck up a great relationship on that tour - they were a really good band and Leslie’s playing and sound was just superb and he was a great singer too!" Tony Iommi of Black Sabbath wrote in a series of tweets.
Nils Lofgren wrote: "Rest In Peace, friend. Grin opened for Mountain and West, Bruce and Lang through early ‘70’s. Sweet, bad ass blues man. Got to play together first Rock n Roll Fantasy Camp. I’ll always remember his smile as he looked me in the eye, inspired and shared his gifts."

To improve balance, take a hike If you can't hit the trails, body-weight exercises also build postural muscles

Texto completo: Several times a day, whether I'm indoors or out, my bone doctor's mantra reverberates in my head: "Do not fall!"
That might seem like telling the sun not to shine, but it does remind me that my balance is not what it used to be. I can no longer take for granted my ability to remain erect when moving about among a plethora of unexpected tripping hazards - broken sidewalks, fallen branches, a dog on the loose. How can I keep from falling when I stumble?
Surely, I thought, there'd be helpful advice on the web. But after checking out dozens of postings on how I might improve my balance, I was more confused than enlightened. Most emphasized improving core and leg strength, which for me are already in good shape. Now what?
Then I learned of a new book with a title that echoed my bone doctor's warning: "Falling Is Not an Option: A Way to Lifelong Balance." The author, George Locker, a lifelong student of martial arts and teacher of tai chi, adapted the lessons of these ancient arts into an approach he has trademarked as "Postural Retraining."
The goal is stability by increasing one's downward force, and the examples Locker gave of surfers, skaters and skiers made perfect sense to me. I can easily recall my stable posture when I skated on ice or pavement or skied on water or snow: a semi squat with knees and ankles bent. Although I no longer attempt these sports at age 79, my ability to remain balanced and stable is more important than ever.
As reported last year in The New York Times, between 2000 and 2016, the mortality rate from falls among those older than 75 more than doubled. Locker calls this "a medical problem without a medical solution." Rare is the doctor who prescribes postures and movements that enhance balance and stability. Yet, these are health- and life-saving abilities that can be improved regardless of a person's age by strengthening the body's postural muscles.
But unlike building up arm or leg muscles, increasing the strength of postural muscles to improve balance is not something visible. It's internal, something the body, not the mind, must learn to do, like learning how to balance on a bicycle.
"Balance," Locker wrote, "is not a skill," and it "is not attained by aptitude, memory or repetition." In an interview, he said, "Balance is not about moving, thinking about it, being athletic or strong." Nor is it subject to willful control. Rather, it is something the body learns to do automatically by engaging the postural muscles. Given the amount of sitting most of us do these days, "the postural muscles literally forget how to maintain balance, even on steady, level surfaces," he wrote.
No weights or machines are needed to strengthen postural muscles. Rather, the body's own weight is engaged, as in skating when, with bent knee and ankle, the body's weight is transferred from the back leg to the front leg, or in paddle boarding, when body weight is evenly distributed between bent legs.
As Locker, now 70, explained, "The exercises in Postural Retraining use the body's own weight to prompt the postural muscles to balance the body." The exercises are isometric; there is no movement. Rather, postural muscles are tensed and the tension is sustained as long as possible, which builds the strength of both muscles and bones.
While I'd normally be highly skeptical of such advice from a nonprofessional without a degree in physical therapy, kinesiology, rehabilitation medicine or athletic training, one paragraph in Locker's book won me over:
"Walking on an even surface is not weight-bearing," at least not as Locker defines it, because it does not train postural muscles. "The knee tends to lock when the foot contacts the ground, and the foot does not remain on the ground for more than a moment. Therefore walking, while wonderful and healthy, does not improve balance. Walking on a rocky Adirondack trail, where both legs are constantly bent to maintain balance, is weight-bearing."
I spent most of last summer in the lower Catskills, where I trekked with my dog on uneven paths over rocks and roots for an hour or more every other morning. During the first two weeks of July, I felt very unsteady and fell twice. But I became more secure with each outing, and by summer's end, my balance and stability had noticeably improved. Even when jostled by a dog while standing on a rocky surface, I easily remained stable and erect.
While many people are not in a position to train their postural muscles by hiking in the woods, Locker describes exercises that people can do safely at home using their own bodies for equipment. Basically, the feet learn to be more firmly connected to the ground while the body weight moves within a base of support.
"In tai chi," Locker noted, "we don't move to achieve balance; first we balance, then we move." Balance is not subject to conscious control, but it can be enhanced by use and diminished by disuse, he explained. "The key to balance and stability in humans is the ability to create downward force in excess of body weight. Thus, neither a statue nor a surfer standing stiff as a statue can remain upright on a surfboard."
A sample lesson: You've likely heard advice to improve balance by standing on one leg when brushing your teeth. A far better plan is to bend the knee and ankle of the leg you're standing on to engage the postural muscles. At the same time, the pelvic muscles remain relaxed.
Another simple exercise involves standing straight with thigh and buttocks muscles relaxed, then bending knees and ankles as if you're about to sit on a high stool. Keep the spine straight and pelvis relaxed. Hold this position for as long as you can, increasing the time gradually as your postural muscles get stronger, up to 15 minutes.
The ultimate goal, Locker said, is to achieve "a tremendous connection to the ground so that when you get pushed, instead of lifting up your shoulders and falling forward, your knees and ankles bend and the body naturally pushes into the ground."

Texto completo: This month, the conservative media personalities Diamond and Silk falsely claimed on their Facebook page that people who were not eligible to vote were receiving ballots in Georgia's special elections next month. Their post was shared more than 300 times.
A week later, right-wing commentator Mark Levin shared a post on his Facebook page falsely suggesting that the Rev. Raphael Warnock, one of the two Democrats running in the Georgia Senate runoffs, once welcomed Fidel Castro to his church. The misleading claim was shared more than 3,000 times.
At the same time, a drumbeat of misinformation about the presidential election count in Georgia droned on. Lara Trump, President Donald Trump's daughter-in-law, and the Hodgetwins,a bodybuilding duo who have turned to pro-Trump political comedy, shared several false stories on their Instagram and Facebook pages that claimed suitcases filled with ballots were pulled out from under tables during the November vote count. Tens of thousands of people shared their posts.
As Georgia prepares to hold special elections that will determine which party will control the Senate, the state has become the focus of a misinformation campaign that is aimed at discrediting the results of the November elections and convincing voters that Democrats are trying to steal the upcoming vote.
A small group of "superspreaders" is responsible for the vast majority of that misinformation, according to new research by Avaaz, a global human rights group. Not only are those accounts responsible for most of the misinformation swirling around the vote, but they are drowning out accurate reporting by mainstream media outlets on Facebook and Instagram.
The research indicates that, despite efforts by social media companies to curtail misinformation, the viral nature of false news continues to take advantage of the algorithms that gin up what people see on those platforms. The algorithms often reward outrage over accuracy, and telling people what they want to hear or what gets them angry can easily overwhelm the truth.
Americans are "being drowned in misinformation in Georgia by these superspreaders," said Fadi Quran, a director at Avaaz.
The Avaaz study also calls into question Facebook's recent decision to roll back a change that elevated news from authoritative outlets over hyperpartisan sources. The change, which the company said was intended to be temporary, had resulted in an increase in Facebook traffic for mainstream news publishers including CNN, NPR and The New York Times, while partisan sites like Breitbart and Occupy Democrats saw their numbers fall.
Many of the misinformation spreaders have previously been named by researchers as playing central roles in spreading misinformation about voter fraud in the November presidential election.
"Facebook has gotten a lot of pressure over claims that they are censoring the right or conservatives, but what the data shows is that they may be favoring these actors," Quran said. "These accounts regularly spread misinformation. The question is: Why doesn't Facebook demote their reach per their policies?"
Other misinformation spreaders included Eric Trump, the president's son, and Sebastian Gorka, the president's former deputy assistant. Trump also continued his barrage of misinformation about Georgia's elections, according to the research by Avaaz.
The top 20 Facebook and Instagram accounts spreading false claims aimed at swaying voters in Georgia accounted for more interactions than mainstream media outlets. Using CrowdTangle, a Facebook-owned research tool, Avaaz examined social media posts between Nov. 8, when most news outlets called the election for President-elect Joe Biden, and Dec. 18. They found that the top 20 "superspreaders" averaged 5,500 interactions on their Facebook posts, while the 20 largest news outlets averaged 4,100 interactions per post.
These users saw more people interacting with their posts, despite having fewer followers on Facebook than the mainstream news outlets. Combined, the news outlets had more than 208 million followers, while the top "superspreaders" had 85 million followers.
Quran said the numbers showed how Facebook's algorithms favored the sensational, and often false, posts.
A Facebook spokesman, Kevin McAlister, said the company was still cracking down on misinformation, despite the recent rollback.
"We're taking every opportunity to connect people to reliable information about the election," McAlister said. He said the company was also "deploying the teams and technology we used in the general elections to fight voter suppression, misinformation and interference in the Georgia runoff elections."
None of the top misinformation spreaders responded to requests for comment.
Their claims ran the gamut from insults -- that the Democratic Senate candidates, Warnock and Jon Ossoff, are corrupt -- to the often-repeated false claim that voting machines that run on software from the company Dominion Voting Systems flipped votes from Trump to Biden.
Quran said the accounts also appeared to be "professionalized" in how they spread misinformation.
Misinformation that successfully targeted Latino voters during the November presidential election, for example, was also being repurposed for Georgia, he said.
One claim, that Warnock, a pastor in an Atlanta church where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. once preached, "celebrated Fidel Castro and welcomed him to his church," was not accurate. The claim refers to Castro's appearance at a New York City church where Warnock was a pastor 25 years ago, and there is no evidence that Warnock was involved in arranging the visit. There is also no evidence that he welcomed Castro.
It was a variation of claims that circulated in Florida during the presidential election that linked Democratic candidates to the Communist Party in Cuba. Some of those claims have also been translated into Spanish to target the more than 300,000 voters with Latino backgrounds in Georgia, Quran said.
Voters in Georgia are also being targeted with misleading information by new media startups. A conservative local news network, Star News group, which already runs news sites in Tennessee, Virginia and Minnesota, announced in November that it was opening a venture called the Georgia Star, according to the liberal media watchdog group Media Matters for America. The network did not respond to a request for comment.
Since then, the website has published misleading news about the presidential election and the coming runoff election, according to an assessment by NewsGuard, a startup that examines false stories.
A Dec. 5 headline promised a "bombshell" story, claiming an audit of election results in a Georgia county revealed Dominion voting machines flipped ballots from Trump to Biden, in spite of overwhelming evidence to the contrary.
The article was shared more than 2,000 times on Facebook, according to CrowdTangle data.

Texto completo: British authorities put more areas of England under the tightest restrictions Wednesday as officials struggled to slow the spread of a coronavirus variant that is potentially more infectious than those that have already wreaked havoc around the world.
The French government lifted a 48-hour blockade of the British border that was aimed at preventing the new variant from spreading. But the effort Wednesday to get traffic moving descended into chaos as officials struggled to carry out the tests required for thousands of drivers stuck at English ports to leave the country.
By Wednesday night, traffic began to move again, according to the BBC. But more than 5,000 Europe-bound trucks were still jammed near the port of Dover. Frustrated drivers fumed over the prospect of a fourth night sleeping in their vehicles. One transport company said its drivers had to throw away more than 100,000 pounds of spoiled food.
The most pressing concern, British officials said, was slowing the rapid spread of the virus, which they attributed to the efficiency of the new variant. Britain reported 39,237 cases Wednesday, up 56% from a week ago, according to a The New York Times database.
The number of people in the hospital -- nearly 19,000 -- is close to where it was at the peak of the outbreak in the spring. And 744 deaths were reported Wednesday.
Areas in southern and eastern England are set to move to the highest level of restrictions starting Saturday, joining London and much of southeastern England.
The rules require people to stay at home except for urgent travel, medical appointments and outdoor exercise.\

With a Beloved Cafe Threatened, Broadway Stars Put on a Show

NEW YORK — When Tom D’Angora got the news that the West Bank Cafe — a popular show business hangout whose basement theater hosted the first “Sunday in the Park With George” rehearsals and Joan Rivers’ final performance — was in danger of closing, he sprang into action.
“You’re not closing,” D’Angora, a theater producer, told the restaurant’s owner, Steve Olsen, in an early December text. “Over my dead body.”
But Olsen could see no way out: His outdoor dining revenue had dropped to almost nothing since Thanksgiving as temperatures plunged, and even before the city moved to ban indoor dining, his new air filters and constant cleaning efforts had failed to draw many eaters into the 42-year-old restaurant. He was already thinking about how to empty out the space and considering where to put the artwork.
D’Angora wouldn’t hear of it. He and his husband, Michael, a fellow producer, put their heads together about trying to save the restaurant, a Hell’s Kitchen mainstay on 42nd Street just west of Ninth Avenue.
“I was like, ‘Between the 6 billion famous, talented, brilliant people who also love this place, we're going to figure this out,’” D’Angora said.
Actor Tim Guinee overheard their conversation while picking up an order of chicken enchiladas at the restaurant, and together they came up with the idea for a virtual Christmas Day telethon that would feature musical performances, skits and West Bank Cafe stories from as many actors as they could find. In the meantime, D’Angora created a GoFundMe page, and within 10 days, more than 1,400 donors had raised more than $168,000 of the $250,000 goal.
“We’d seen ‘It’s a Wonderful Life,’” D’Angora said, referring to the film in which a community comes together to save an endangered family banking business. “And we just told Steve, ‘OK, it’s your George Bailey moment.’”
The telethon, which will begin streaming at noon Friday, will include appearances by around 200 artists, among them Matthew Broderick, Pete Townshend, Debra Messing, Nathan Lane, Alan Cumming, Isaac Mizrahi and Alice Ripley. Joe Iconis, the composer and lyricist of the Broadway musical “Be More Chill,” is producing the fundraiser, which he said would last at least five hours.
Broderick, the star of “The Producers” and “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off” and a cafe regular, said he was sad to see another New York City business with a rich history on the verge of closing forever.
“There are whole swaths of places that have closed since March, not just in Hell’s Kitchen or Times Square, but everywhere,” said Broderick. “It’s terrifying. These places are what make New York New York.”
Broadway stars including André De Shields and Nathan Lane have gathered at the restaurant to celebrate Tony Award wins and commiserate over losses, and Bruce Willis, Tennessee Williams and Arthur Miller all dined there.
The cafe’s 100-seat basement theater, which opened in 1983, a few years after the restaurant, has had its own memorable moments: Warren Leight’s Tony Award-winning play “Side Man” had its debut there, Lewis Black spent more than 10 years as its playwright in residence, and it staged early Aaron Sorkin plays and occasional drag shows.
Olsen, 66, has spent his entire adult life running the restaurant, which he opened in 1978 in a Hell’s Kitchen that was considerably grittier, and more dangerous, than it is today. “This location was considered Siberia,” Olsen said. “42nd Street and Ninth Avenue was as far west as anyone was willing to venture.”
Members of an Irish gang, the Westies, were among the fledgling restaurant’s clientele. He resisted pressure to hire one of their men as a bartender and to bring in their female friends as waitresses. “Everyone said it was because I was courageous,” he said, laughing. “But I just didn’t know. I was in my early 20s. I was immortal.”
When Broadway theaters shut down in March, D’Angora remembered, Olsen was the one worrying about his clientele. “He was concerned about how I was holding up,” D’Angora said. “He’d hand me a bottle of champagne or wine. He was never worried about himself.”
Now that clientele wants to return the favor. After closing the second week of March and laying off all but six of his 53 employees, Olsen reopened with outdoor dining last summer. The restaurant also began delivering out of the neighborhood, which brought in a few thousand dollars a week. “I was making deliveries down to Tribeca in eight minutes,” Olsen said. “There were no cars on the streets. I racked up four speeding tickets from the cameras in the first three months.”
“But after Thanksgiving, business went down to nothing,” he said. “I don’t know very many people who can put up $10,000 a week indefinitely to keep a business going out of their own pocket.”
Olsen said the $250,000 goal for the GoFundMe campaign would pay off the debt the restaurant has taken on because of the pandemic and make a dent in future expenses. “At first, I was a little bit embarrassed to admit I needed help,” he said. “But my family and friends have stepped up, and I’m grateful.”
He’s given himself some homework. “I owe the 1,400 people who’ve donated so far thank you letters,” he said. “Those will come out — individually — after the holidays.”

The soundtrack to Maya Montoya’s year was white noise. Specifically, a track on Spotify called “Celestial White Noise”: three whole hours of warm, soothing fuzz.
Montoya, who is 27 and lives in Everett, Washington, had been a nanny up until the pandemic. But when she found herself out of work in April, she began indulging in daytime naps, which ruined her sleep schedule. “I’ve been listening to the white noise all the time,” she said.
Despite playing the track most nights for the better part of 2020, Montoya was still surprised when “Celestial White Noise” appeared at the top of her Spotify Wrapped chart this month. She posted a screenshot from the app on Instagram, which was met with a deluge of affirmation from her followers.
“So many people messaged me saying they got the exact same thing,” she said. “It was nice to know I wasn’t the only one blasting white noise into the ether so that I could sleep throughout all this.”
In an average year, Spotify Wrapped is a sharing-optimized novelty hinging on nostalgia for a time that’s barely passed. But in 2020, this data mirror instead presented many users with unexpected empirical evidence of their pandemic coping mechanisms: a strange hit parade of ambient music, background noise and calming sound effects that soothed them through an unusually anxious and sleepless time. (Spotify declined to comment on this trend.)
While thousands of users posted in disbelief about their stress-inflected results, the situation made sense to Liz Pelly, a cultural critic who has written extensively about how Spotify and its competitors work to shape our listening habits. “It says a lot about the ways that corporate streaming services have ingrained themselves into our lives and facilitated music listening becoming more of a background experience,” she said.
Some listeners have used sound as a coping mechanism for years but became more reliant on it over the last nine months. Isobel Snellenberger, a 21-year-old in Fargo, North Dakota, has anxiety and is neurodivergent (a category that includes a range of neurological differences including autism spectrum disorder and dyslexia), both of which she manages in a variety of ways, including with music.
“Especially toward the beginning of COVID, my mind was riddled with intrusive thoughts about my friends and family’s safety, and my brain would go into panic mode,” Snellenberger said. So, she began playing rain sounds almost round-the-clock, which helped her turn off the cognitive noise.
When her Spotify roundup arrived, nine of her top 10 tracks were rain sounds. “Even though I listen to them a lot, I was still caught off guard,” she said, noting that Harry Styles and David Bowie typically dominate her list. Like Montoya, she found the results both sad and funny.
The findings of some forthcoming research about pandemic coping mechanisms suggest ambient listening may be part of a larger pattern. Pablo Ripollés, a professor at New York University who studies music and the brain, was part of an international team of researchers that surveyed lockdown habits in Italy, Spain and the United States.
Of 43 activities mentioned in a survey the team conducted, like cooking, prayer, exercise and sex, listening to or playing music had one of the biggest increases in engagement during lockdown, as well as the highest number of respondents who said it was the activity that helped them the most.
“People realizing from their Spotify Wrapped that they were listening to a lot more background music to cope with the pandemic fits with what we saw,” Ripollés said.
But not everyone wants to have the darkness of this year reflected back at them. With the pandemic expected to endure, at least in some countries, well into 2021, a few savvy subscribers are using a workaround to ensure that next year’s recap is a little less grim.
Dylan River Lopez, a 29-year-old video editor who uses nongendered pronouns, has relied throughout the pandemic on a track called “Brown Noise — 90 Minutes” to drown out many distractions, including their partner’s phone calls in a newly shared office and nighttime restlessness similar to Montoya’s. “I pretty much developed a relationship with the noise,” Lopez said.
When it appeared as their No. 1, Lopez searched online about how to block Spotify from counting those minutes. The answer: a feature called Private Session, which they now turn on along with the brown noise.
“The main thing I learned from this experience,” Lopez said, “is how to stop Spotify from tracking it.”

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
ROME — Carlo Collodi’s “Pinocchio” is one of the world’s best-loved children’s books, translated into over 280 languages and dialects, and the subject of countless films and television series.
When Italian director Matteo Garrone decided to put his spin on “Pinocchio,” which opens in cinemas in the U.S. on Christmas Day, he took an unusual path: fidelity to the original “The Adventures of Pinocchio,” first published as a book in 1883.
The result is a far more realistic, at times darker, telling of the tale. Gone are the cute kitties, goldfish and cuckoo clocks that enlivened Disney’s 1940 version. There are no catchy songs destined to become classics.
Instead, Garrone has immersed his “Pinocchio” in the landscape — and the poverty — of mid-19th-century Tuscany so accurately that when the film meanders into the fantastical — and it often does — it feels wondrous.
After all, Collodi, whose real name was Carlo Lorenzini, wrote the book to be a cautionary tale. Initially, it was serialized in a children’s magazine and Collodi abruptly ended the puppet’s adventures after chapter 15, leaving Pinocchio hanging — and very much dead — from a tree. After readers objected, Collodi’s editor persuaded him to prolong the story, with its many twists and turns, to the proverbial happy ending.
To American audiences, Garrone’s foray into the whimsical may come as a surprise. The director is probably best known for his starkly unsentimental 2008 film “Gomorrah,” which explores Neapolitan organized crime and which a Times critic described as being “a snapshot of hell.”
In fact, Garrone had already ventured into the realm of fairy-tales in his 2015 “Tale of Tales,” a mashup of folk tales collected by 17th-century Neapolitan author Giambattista Basile, who in turn influenced the Brothers Grimm. Garrone has attributed his interest in the fantastical to his background as a painter.
But “Pinocchio” is something else. The story of the puppet who yearns to become a real boy has tickled the fancy of many directors, sometimes with unexpected results. Pinocchio has traveled into outer space, become a sidekick to Shrek and has shown a more nefarious side in a 1996 slasher film. There’s even a 1971 soft-porn movie.
And there’s no sign that the story’s popularity is waning. Disney’s live-action version with Tom Hanks is scheduled to debut on the company’s streaming service, and Guillermo del Toro is working on a stop-motion “Pinocchio” for Netflix.
For Garrone, 52, the book had inspired what he described as his first storyboard, a cartoonish retelling that he drew when he was 5 or 6. He framed the picture, which he keeps in front of his desk as inspiration.
“You’re pure when you’re a child, and the things that you do have a freshness that you struggle to find as an adult,” he said during an interview this month in his office on a Roman movie studio lot. “I always have that drawing in front of me as a model.” Here are edited excerpts from the conversation.
There are so many film versions of “Pinocchio.” So why make one more?
When I reread the book as an adult, six or seven years ago, I noticed that there were many things that I hadn’t remembered and above all many things that I hadn’t seen in movie versions. So I thought, if I was surprised reading the text, maybe I can make a film about a book that people think they know but in fact don’t. That was the big gamble, to surprise people by remaining as faithful as possible to the book.
But did that also mean being faithful to the atmosphere of the original book, with its emphasis on the poverty of rural Italy in the 19th century?
In Collodi’s story, you can feel the hunger, you can feel the poverty. A lot of research went into the preparation of “Pinocchio.” There’s great attention to realism and at the same time there’s a fable-like abstraction, which is one of the things that fascinated me the most when I read the book.
(Garrone pointed to an enormous storyboard for the movie, pinned with a jumble of handwritten notes, photographs from that era, actor headshots, images of phantasmagorical animals and copies of the original drawings for “Pinocchio” by Enrico Mazzanti.)
For each scene, we looked for pictorial references and illustrations, we wanted to recreate the flavor of that world. We shot part of the film in Tuscany and then moved to Puglia because Tuscany has changed so much in the past century, and we wanted to remain faithful to the peasant atmosphere of the late 19th century.
In the film, Roberto Benigni plays Geppetto, the carpenter, after making his own “Pinocchio” movie in 2002, in which he starred as the puppet. Why did you cast him?
Roberto is Geppetto. In the sense that Roberto is a witness of an Italy that is disappearing. He comes from a family of peasants, they lived through moments of great poverty, living five or six to a room, he has experienced hunger. So there was no one better than Roberto to give authenticity and humanity to this character. It was a great fortune for us to have him.
In the book, Pinocchio is often obnoxious. Your Pinocchio, played by Federico Ielapi, is much more likable. Was that on purpose?
I tried to soften his personality. At the beginning he clearly makes a ton of mistakes, and that can come off as irritating. But I tried to mitigate that by drawing on the naïveté of the boy who plays him, who is Pinocchio’s exact opposite. We know that Pinocchio wants to evade responsibility, hardships and work to pursue pleasure. But Federico had the will and discipline to sit for four hours every day while Mark Coulier applied his makeup. Federico was really extraordinary, and it made the character more empathetic.
How did you balance your desire for realism with the special effects that transport the viewer?
It’s because of the special effects that I was able to make a live-action film where Pinocchio is actually a wooden puppet. Most of the characters are anthropomorphic, animals that speak. We worked a lot on special effects that were tangible, prosthetic, with Coulier, who is a two-time Oscar winner, and then we integrated with computer-generated effects. Personally, I don’t love special effects that are only digital. I prefer to have a mix and to work with concrete figures even on a green screen.
The real challenge of a film like this was to appeal to children, who are so spoiled by special effects. We wanted to make a film that could capture their attention and transport them into another world for a couple of hours. That was the real challenge.
Is there a contemporary message?
Collodi meant the book to be pedagogical, he meant to warn children about the dangers of the surrounding world and its violence. That remains true, today more than ever. I was thinking of Collodi constantly as I made the film. We know it’s set at the end of the 19th century, but I felt as though I was shooting a film tied to the present.
I remember that when I began researching the film, I went to see the grandson of Pinocchio’s original editor. We had lunch and he told me: “Pinocchio is such a difficult book because Pinocchio is always running.” And I replied: “Yes, that’s true, but I don’t want to catch him, I just want to run behind him and see where he takes me.” That was the approach I took.

Misinformation becomes epidemic 'Superspreaders' are targeting Senate runoff races in Ga.

Texto completo: This month, the conservative media personalities Diamond and Silk falsely claimed on their Facebook page that people who were not eligible to vote were receiving ballots in Georgia's special elections next month. Their post was shared more than 300 times.
A week later, right-wing commentator Mark Levin shared a post on his Facebook page falsely suggesting that the Rev. Raphael Warnock, one of the two Democrats running in the Georgia Senate runoffs, once welcomed Fidel Castro to his church. The misleading claim was shared more than 3,000 times.
At the same time, a drumbeat of misinformation about the presidential election count in Georgia droned on. Lara Trump, President Donald Trump's daughter-in-law, and the Hodgetwins,a bodybuilding duo who have turned to pro-Trump political comedy, shared several false stories on their Instagram and Facebook pages that claimed suitcases filled with ballots were pulled out from under tables during the November vote count. Tens of thousands of people shared their posts.
As Georgia prepares to hold special elections that will determine which party will control the Senate, the state has become the focus of a misinformation campaign that is aimed at discrediting the results of the November elections and convincing voters that Democrats are trying to steal the upcoming vote.
A small group of "superspreaders" is responsible for the vast majority of that misinformation, according to new research by Avaaz, a global human rights group. Not only are those accounts responsible for most of the misinformation swirling around the vote, but they are drowning out accurate reporting by mainstream media outlets on Facebook and Instagram.
The research indicates that, despite efforts by social media companies to curtail misinformation, the viral nature of false news continues to take advantage of the algorithms that gin up what people see on those platforms. The algorithms often reward outrage over accuracy, and telling people what they want to hear or what gets them angry can easily overwhelm the truth.
Americans are "being drowned in misinformation in Georgia by these superspreaders," said Fadi Quran, a director at Avaaz.
The Avaaz study also calls into question Facebook's recent decision to roll back a change that elevated news from authoritative outlets over hyperpartisan sources. The change, which the company said was intended to be temporary, had resulted in an increase in Facebook traffic for mainstream news publishers including CNN, NPR and The New York Times, while partisan sites like Breitbart and Occupy Democrats saw their numbers fall.
Many of the misinformation spreaders have previously been named by researchers as playing central roles in spreading misinformation about voter fraud in the November presidential election.
"Facebook has gotten a lot of pressure over claims that they are censoring the right or conservatives, but what the data shows is that they may be favoring these actors," Quran said. "These accounts regularly spread misinformation. The question is: Why doesn't Facebook demote their reach per their policies?"
Other misinformation spreaders included Eric Trump, the president's son, and Sebastian Gorka, the president's former deputy assistant. Trump also continued his barrage of misinformation about Georgia's elections, according to the research by Avaaz.
The top 20 Facebook and Instagram accounts spreading false claims aimed at swaying voters in Georgia accounted for more interactions than mainstream media outlets. Using CrowdTangle, a Facebook-owned research tool, Avaaz examined social media posts between Nov. 8, when most news outlets called the election for President-elect Joe Biden, and Dec. 18. They found that the top 20 "superspreaders" averaged 5,500 interactions on their Facebook posts, while the 20 largest news outlets averaged 4,100 interactions per post.
These users saw more people interacting with their posts, despite having fewer followers on Facebook than the mainstream news outlets. Combined, the news outlets had more than 208 million followers, while the top "superspreaders" had 85 million followers.
Quran said the numbers showed how Facebook's algorithms favored the sensational, and often false, posts.
A Facebook spokesman, Kevin McAlister, said the company was still cracking down on misinformation, despite the recent rollback.
"We're taking every opportunity to connect people to reliable information about the election," McAlister said. He said the company was also "deploying the teams and technology we used in the general elections to fight voter suppression, misinformation and interference in the Georgia runoff elections."
None of the top misinformation spreaders responded to requests for comment.
Their claims ran the gamut from insults - that the Democratic Senate candidates, Warnock and Jon Ossoff, are corrupt - to the often-repeated false claim that voting machines that run on software from the company Dominion Voting Systems flipped votes from Trump to Biden.
Quran said the accounts also appeared to be "professionalized" in how they spread misinformation.
Misinformation that successfully targeted Latino voters during the November presidential election, for example, was also being repurposed for Georgia, he said.
One claim, that Warnock, a pastor in an Atlanta church where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. once preached, "celebrated Fidel Castro and welcomed him to his church," was not accurate. The claim refers to Castro's appearance at a New York City church where Warnock was a pastor 25 years ago, and there is no evidence that Warnock was involved in arranging the visit. There is also no evidence that he welcomed Castro.
It was a variation of claims that circulated in Florida during the presidential election that linked Democratic candidates to the Communist Party in Cuba. Some of those claims have also been translated into Spanish to target the more than 300,000 voters with Latino backgrounds in Georgia, Quran said.
Voters in Georgia are also being targeted with misleading information by new media startups. A conservative local news network, Star News group, which already runs news sites in Tennessee, Virginia and Minnesota, announced in November that it was opening a venture called the Georgia Star, according to the liberal media watchdog group Media Matters for America. The network did not respond to a request for comment.
Since then, the website has published misleading news about the presidential election and the coming runoff election, according to an assessment by NewsGuard, a startup that examines false stories.
A Dec. 5 headline promised a "bombshell" story, claiming an audit of election results in a Georgia county revealed Dominion voting machines flipped ballots from Trump to Biden, in spite of overwhelming evidence to the contrary.
The article was shared more than 2,000 times on Facebook, according to CrowdTangle data.

Since then, the website has published misleading news about the presidential election and the coming runoff election, according to an assessment by NewsGuard, a startup that examines false stories.
A Dec. 5 headline promised a "bombshell" story, claiming an audit of election results in a Georgia county revealed Dominion voting machines flipped ballots from Trump to Biden, in spite of overwhelming evidence to the contrary.
The article was shared more than 2,000 times on Facebook, according to CrowdTangle data.

Texto completo: Roiled by concerns about the pandemic? Lifting weights might help, according to a timely new study of anxiety and resistance training. The study, which involved healthy young adults, barbells and lunges, indicates that regular weight training substantially reduces anxiety, a finding with particular relevance during these unsettling, bumpy days.
We already have plenty of evidence that exercise helps stave off depression and other mental ills, and that exercise can elevate feelings of happiness and contentment. But most past studies of exercise and moods have looked at the effects of aerobic exercise, like running on a treadmill or riding a stationary bike.
Scientists only recently have begun to investigate whether and how weight training might also affect mental health. A 2018 review of studies, for instance, concluded that adults who lift weights are less likely to develop depression than those who never lift. In another study, women with clinical anxiety disorders reported fewer symptoms after taking up either aerobic or weight training.
But many of these studies involved frequent and complicated sessions of resistance exercise performed under the eyes of researchers, which is not how most of us are likely to work out. They also often focused on somewhat narrow groups, such as men or women with a diagnosed mental health condition like depression or an anxiety disorder, limiting their applicability.
So for the new study, which was published in October in Scientific Reports, researchers at the University of Limerick in Ireland and other institutions decided to see if a simple version of weight training could have benefits for mood in people who already were in generally good mental health.
To find out, they recruited 28 physically healthy young men and women and tested their current moods, with a particular emphasis on whether the volunteers felt anxious. All the participants scored in a healthy range on detailed anxiety questionnaires.
The scientists then divided these well-adjusted volunteers into two groups. Half were asked to continue with their normal lives as a control group. The others began to weight train, a practice with which few were familiar.
The scientists had devised a helpfully simple resistance training routine for them, based around health guidelines from the World Health Organization and the American College of Sports Medicine. Both those organizations recommend muscle strengthening at least twice a week, and that's what the volunteers began doing. After initial instruction from the researchers, the volunteers took up a basic program of lunges, lifts, squats and crunches, sometimes using dumbbells and other equipment.
Their training continued for eight weeks. Throughout, both groups periodically repeated the tests of their anxiety levels, including at the end of the full program. (After the study ended, the control group was given the option of starting the weight training routine.)
As expected, the control group, for the most part, retained their original low levels of anxiety. They still felt about as tranquil as eight weeks before.
But the weight trainers scored about 20% better on the tests of anxiety. They had started with low levels of anxiety to begin with, but felt even less anxious now.
This effect was "larger than anticipated," says Brett Gordon, a postdoctoral scholar at the Penn State Cancer Institute at Penn State College of Medicine, who was a co-author of the study with Matthew Herring, Cillian McDowell and Mark Lyons. The benefits for mental health were greater, in fact, than those often seen in studies of aerobic exercise and anxiety. But Gordon cautions that such comparisons are limited, since the various experiments use different amounts of exercise and measures of moods.
The new study also did not delve into how weight training can affect anxiety. But Gordon and his colleagues suspect increased physical and psychological potency figure in. The lifters became stronger over time and able to lift heavier weights. "Feelings of mastery may have occurred" then, he says, leaving people feeling generally more capable of coping. Molecular changes in the lifters' muscles and brain likely also occurred and contributed to improvements in their moods, he says, noting that future studies may help to detail some of those changes.
Of course, this experiment featured only healthy young people performing one version of training, so the findings cannot tell us if lifting likewise eases anxiety in older people. Nor can it tell us which regimen might be enough, too much or just the right amount to bolster mental health. Finally, it also does not prove that heading to the gym today can acutely soothe any mental turmoil we may be feeling, since the improvements in the study showed up after weeks of training.
But if you are feeling tense and uptight, as so many of us are these days, becoming stronger is probably a worthwhile goal and need not be intimidating, Gordon says. "There are numerous ways to strength train with little to no equipment," he says. "Try common body weight exercises, such as pushups, situps or squats, or use household items as weights."

Pfizer Seals Deal With Trump Administration for Millions More Vaccine Doses

Texto completo: The company agreed to deliver the additional doses of its coronavirus vaccine by the end of July, helping address a looming shortage.
The Trump administration and Pfizer announced a deal on Wednesday for the pharmaceutical company to provide an additional 100 million doses of its coronavirus vaccine by the end of July, easing a potential shortage.
The agreement, along with orders for another vaccine made by Moderna, means the United States has now secured commitments for enough doses to vaccinate all but about 60 million of the roughly 260 million adult Americans who are eligible to be inoculated.
Pfizer had agreed this summer, before its vaccine had even been proven effective, to provide an initial 100 million doses to the United States. Under the new agreement, Pfizer will provide an additional 70 million doses by the end of June and another 30 million by the end of July, doubling the deliveries it promised in the initial contract.
So far, Pfizer and Moderna, the only two producers whose vaccines have been approved for emergency distribution to Americans, together have pledged to ship 400 million doses in the next seven months. Both vaccines require two doses.
The U.S. government will pay $ 1.95 billion for the second order, or $ 19.50 per dose, according to a statement from the company. Pfizer's vaccine was developed with a German partner, BioNTech.
As part of the deal, the government agreed to invoke the Defense Production Act to help Pfizer get better access to around nine specialized products it needs to make the vaccine. Under the Korean War-era law, the government can secure critical supplies more quickly by assigning a contract a priority rating, forcing suppliers to bump orders from that contractor to the front of the line.
The government's promise to free up supplies is not mentioned in statements issued by Pfizer or the government, but was critical to the deal, according to people familiar with the negotiations.
As early as September, Pfizer began asking for the government's help in obtaining supplies, according to documents reviewed by The New York Times. At that time, the administration had already granted priority status to orders from Moderna and other companies that had been working with it more closely to develop their vaccines, putting Pfizer at a disadvantage. That included two companies -- Sanofi and Novavax -- that have yet to begin large-scale clinical trials in the United States.
A senior Trump administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk freely about internal discussions said the government was unwilling to intervene on Pfizer's behalf earlier because the company refused to promise that it would use raw materials procured with the government's help to produce vaccines solely for Americans.
Others familiar with the negotiations said the government expressed concern that prioritizing Pfizer could squeeze the supply chain, hindering the other vaccine makers that the government was backing through its vaccine development program, called Operation Warp Speed.
The new agreement with Pfizer includes options through which the government could purchase an additional 400 million doses. But the conditions for exercising those options were unclear. The earlier contract from July gave Pfizer the ability to "reasonably" refuse a request by the federal government for more doses.
The administration has been negotiating with Pfizer for additional doses for more than a month. Among the obstacles were Pfizer's commitments to other nations that had moved faster than the United States to lock in large orders, according to people familiar with the situation.
Federal officials including Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services, have repeatedly said that the administration has secured pledges for enough doses to cover all Americans who want to be vaccinated by June. But even with Pfizer's new contract, the government is still short doses for about 60 million Americans eligible to be inoculated.
A third vaccine maker, Johnson & Johnson, is expected to announce results from its clinical trials next month and could cover a shortfall. Other vaccine makers participating in Operation Warp Speed could also come through, but so far have encountered significant delays.
At a briefing on Wednesday, Moncef Slaoui, one of the leaders of Operation Warp Speed, said Johnson & Johnson's product looked like "a wonderful vaccine" and could add significantly to the nation's supply by the spring. Instead of a shortage, he said, "the likelihood is that there is a significant redundancy" in doses for Americans in the first half of next year.


According to one document that a European official posted and then deleted on social media, Pfizer completed a deal last month to sell the European Union 200 million doses at a cost of $ 14.50 each. But it is unclear whether that price is accurate. In both of its contracts, the United States agreed to pay Pfizer $ 19.50 per dose.
Pfizer has only said that its pricing was based on volume and delivery dates, and the European Union placed the biggest order first.
The Pfizer contracts alone will now cost the government nearly $ 4 billion dollars. On Monday, Congress approved a stimulus package that set aside $ 20 billion for the government to purchase vaccines.
But in a surprise turnaround on Tuesday night, President Trump railed against the bill, hinting he might not sign it in its current form.

Texto completo: As the Trump presidency heads into the sunset, kicking and screaming, one of the most important questions that will shape American politics at the local, state and national levels is this: Can Donald Trump maintain his iron grip over the Republican Party when he is out of office?
This is what we know for sure: He damn well intends to try and is amassing a pile of cash to do so. And here is what I predict: If Trump keeps delegitimizing Joe Biden’s presidency and demanding loyalty for his extreme behavior, the GOP could fully fracture — splitting between principled Republicans and unprincipled Republicans. Trump then might have done America the greatest favor possible: stimulating the birth of a new principled conservative party.
Santa, if you’re listening, that’s what I want for Christmas!
Wishful thinking? Maybe. But here’s why it’s not entirely fanciful: If Trump refuses to ever acknowledge Biden’s victory and keeps roasting those Republicans who do — and who “collaborate” with the new administration — something is going to crack.
There will be increasing pressure on the principled Republicans — people like Mitt Romney, Lisa Murkowski and the judges, election officials and state legislators who put country before party and refused to buckle under Trump’s demands — to break away and start their own conservative party.
If that happens, the unprincipled Trump Republicans — like the 126 House members who joined with the Texas attorney general in a shameful Supreme Court case to nullify Biden’s victory — could have a harder time winning office. That would be a good thing in its own right.
More important, even if just a few principled conservatives came together and created a kind of third party in Congress, they could be kingmakers. With the Senate so finely balanced, moderates on each side have significant leverage.
We just saw that with the relief bill negotiations, which Trump, on cue, is now threatening to undo. It was the bipartisan House Problem Solvers Caucus — coalesced by the centrist movement No Labels — and an informal bipartisan group of senators that produced the deal from the bottom up.
Imagine Biden’s center-left Democrats and principled center-right conservatives working together on fixes for infrastructure, immigration, Obamacare or climate — without Trump around to disrupt any progress.
Wishful thinking? Maybe. But one thing I learned covering the Middle East is that there is only one reliable thing about extremists — they don’t know when to stop. So, in the end, they almost always go over the cliff, taking a lot of people with them.
Donald Trump is a political extremist. He does not stop at red lights. He does not abide by norms, ethics or the truth. As a result, his huge disinformation campaign against Biden’s election, and his attacks on Republican officeholders and right-wing media that won’t parrot his lies and conspiracy theories, is already fracturing the party at the state level in places like Georgia and Arizona.
It’s drawing a sharp distinction between principled Republicans who chose to put their constitutional obligations before Trump’s interests and the unprincipled ones who either are too cowardly to speak up or eagerly hopped into the Trump clown car to secure his blessings for their next election.
Think of two recent images. The first is of the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, on Dec. 15 briskly walking past a CNN reporter who was asking him a simple question: Would he acknowledge that Joe Biden was the president-elect? McCarthy was too cowardly or too unprincipled to answer.
If you’re a Republican lawmaker, do you really want to spend the next four years running away from CNN every time you’re asked to opine about the latest demented thing Donald Trump has said or done — because you’re afraid that he’ll launch a primary attack against you with his devoted base if you show integrity?
The contrasting image is of Arizona’s Republican governor, Doug Ducey. It’s Dec. 1 and Ducey is literally signing the papers certifying his state’s election results and officially awarding Biden its 11 electors — ignoring Trump’s baseless claims of voter fraud in Arizona.
Ducey’s cellphone rings, but it is no ordinary ring tone. It is “Hail to the Chief,” a ring tone Ducey installed in July so that he would never miss a call from Trump. But this time Ducey simply takes the phone out of his pocket, silences it, puts it aside and goes on signing the papers.
According to a report in The Hill, “Trump later called into a hearing with state Republicans that was happening during the certification” and “tore into Ducey,” declaring, “Arizona will not forget what Ducey just did.” Trump was right, but not in the way he predicted.
On Saturday, CNN described the civil war that has broken out in Arizona: “GOP party leaders and elected officials who’ve gone all-in for Trump, backed by right-wing media, have relentlessly attacked those who can’t bring themselves to go along with the lame-duck president’s refusal to concede. To be sure, similar splits exist across the GOP nationwide. But the infighting in Arizona offers a clear picture of why some Republicans fear that if Trump continues stirring up and directing his followers once he’s out of office, the party may cripple itself at the state and local level.”
The story added: “‘Some Republicans have decided to file for divorce from reality, facts be damned,’ said Barrett Marson, a publicist who worked for Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey’s political action committee. … Perhaps most notable in the subsequent salvos was a tweet from the governor’s chief of staff, Daniel Scarpinato, to ‘Freedom Caucus’ chair Rep. Andy Biggs calling him nuts and ending, ‘Enjoy your time as a permanent resident of Crazytown.’”
To be sure, calling Ducey a “principled Republican” is a low bar, considering that he had no problem backing Trump all the way until now. Unlike other Trump-friendly Republicans, though, he was ready to draw a constitutional redline he would not cross.
But every day that goes by Trump shows us that as his power decreases, he surrounds himself with more and more unprincipled crackpots, who fan his delusions and propose more and more extreme actions, like Michael Flynn’s neofascist suggestion of declaring martial law and rerunning the election in some states Trump lost.
Therefore, the stress that Trump creates will surely get only worse after he leaves the White House, when, to stay relevant, he’ll need to say ever more extreme things that keep his base — now fully marinated in his conspiracy theories — energized and ready to attack any principled Republican who deviates from Trump. Also, all those Fox News commentators who prostituted themselves to Trump (and their ratings), helping to make his extreme base even more extreme, can’t stop now. They’ll lose their audience.
They’re all extremists who can’t stop, and principled conservatives understand that. Listen to Evan McMullin, the former CIA operations officer and later chief policy director for the House Republican Conference, who resigned in 2016 to run for president as an independent:
“Even though Mr. Trump has been defeated, there is still no home for Republicans committed to representative government, truth and the rule of law, nor is one likely to emerge anytime soon,” wrote McMullin in this newspaper. “So what’s next for Republicans who reject their party’s attempts to incinerate the Constitution in the service of one man’s authoritarian power grabs? … The answer is that we must further develop an intellectual and political home, for now, outside of any party. From there, we can continue working with other Americans to defeat Mr. Trump’s heirs, help offer unifying leadership to the country and, if the Republican Party continues on its current path, launch a party to challenge it directly.”
Call me mad, but my gut tells me that when Trump is just the monarch of Mar-a-Lago — just spewing venom — some Republicans will say “enough.” Somewhere in there a new party of principled conservatives might just get born.
Wishful thinking? Maybe. But what a blessing that would be for America.

Texto completo: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is charged with safeguarding American lives. But in the 10th month of the coronavirus pandemic, as infections surge to new highs, the agency’s advice about what citizens should do remains confusing — right at a time when we need clarity most.
While local governments set their own quarantine rules, officials take their cues from the CDC For months, the agency has advised that people who have been exposed to someone with the virus should quarantine for 14 days.
This instruction arose from data that showed that people might not become symptomatic and infectious for as long as two weeks after being exposed to the coronavirus. People could not “test out” of quarantine, shortening their confinement period by producing a negative test result. This was a clear and effective message, since we don’t want people who might be infectious leaving home and potentially exposing others while they’re getting tested repeatedly in an attempt to secure an early release from quarantine.
While a 14-day quarantine remains the CDC’s preferred strategy, the agency recently revised its guidelines to add two other options: People without symptoms can quarantine for only 10 days, or take a test at least five days after exposure, and if that test is negative, end their self-isolation seven days after exposure.
Yes, the CDC does cite recent research to justify the revision of its original guidance, but in the end it does not offer a clear conclusion about the length of quarantine that is useful to ordinary people. Instead, federal health officials punt the ultimate decision to local public health officials, who are advised to choose a path based on trends in their area. But in much of the country, transmission is already a huge problem. Given that cases have risen 50 percent in the past month and hospitals are filling up, it’s puzzling that anyone would think that now is the time to be more relaxed.
Leaving these decisions up to individuals and local officials increases confusion. At my university and health care system, many people who’ve read about the changes in guidance have asked me what we are doing in response. Most people I hear from don’t understand which pathway is ideal, which one their local officials might prefer, or why.
Experts attribute the change in policy to a strategy of “harm reduction,” which I almost always support. This concept acknowledges that many people would not or could not quarantine for 14 days if they were exposed; it also addresses the very real possibility that a 14-day quarantine requirement might drive people to mislead contact tracers about potential exposure.
Knowing this, some experts back a shorter, more palatable quarantine period, noting that a seven- or 10-day quarantine is still better than no quarantine at all. All of this is correct. As I have argued, more is better than perfect when it comes to this pandemic.
But the role of the CDC is not to tell us what we might tolerate. It’s to tell us what we should do, regardless of whether we want to do it. It’s the agency’s job to evaluate the science and provide its best read on how we should respond. If the science supports a 14-day quarantine, the CDC should make that unequivocally clear, without clouding the picture by adding second and third options.
The public’s trust in scientific evaluation, and this kind of accuracy in scientific communication, will be critical in the coming months as more vaccines are approved. The CDC should continue to speak in clear language about vaccines’ efficacy, their safety, and who should get one and when. If officials defer to a “choose your own adventure” approach for fear that people won’t follow guidelines, chaos will follow. If governments waffle, or do not keep their pronouncements tied to data and evidence, the public will lose faith in the vaccination process.
To help states and counties come up with recommendations for quarantine that will be more tolerable, the CDC should be more clear about the risks and benefits of all pathways. The agency recommends its test-out-of-quarantine option be used only when local testing resources can meet demand for those who are symptomatic, but the CDC doesn’t explain how individuals can determine this. It shouldn’t take advanced degrees and a willingness to review the medical literature to understand CDC guidelines on a major public health issue.
For too long, the CDC has failed in its mandate to protect and guide us during this pandemic. Much of that was thanks to political interference, but this isn’t about blame. A new administration is imminent, and there’s little reason to fear further retribution for being forthright. The guidance of the CDC, and other groups, must be sure, specific and scientific. Our public health depends on it.

Texto completo: While we were all stuck at home this year, it was an exceptional time to listen to podcasts, as their hosts also adjusted to a different way of life.
Along the way, there were episodes of podcasts that made me laugh, think and cry. None of the podcasts listed require any kind of knowledge of their lore. You can jump in these episodes completely cold.
Reply All ‘The Case of the Missing Hit’
Reply All typically operates by taking a call from someone and exhaustively researching a question. In this brilliant episode, it dives deep into the phenomenon of getting a melody stuck in your head, but not figuring out what it is.
A man from California calls the hosts with the melody of a ‘90s-type of pop-rock song that only he remembers. His wife, friends and even the hosts have no idea what it is. So they go to extreme lengths, including trying to recreate in a studio, to remember it. The result is amazing.
Reply All ‘Country of Liars’ 2020 saw the mainstream-ification of the conspiracy theory group QAnon. While it took over the world, its origins have been fairly nebulous. The podcast takes a deep dive to uncover how it happened, who is likely behind it and how the group remains popular.
Switched On Pop “Baz Luhrmann’s ‘Sunscreen Song’ — The 90s’ Most Unlikely Hit (with Avery Trufelman)’ Director Baz Luhrmann’s sole hit song is likely categorized in the cultural zeitgeist under a Buzzfeed-like label “Only ‘90s Kids Will Understand This.” It’s a weird, spoken-word song that inexplicably became the anthem of graduations for years to come.
Its journey from a Chicago Tribune newspaper column to an incorrectly attributed Kurt Vonnegut quote to a dance song to a mid-tempo hit is fascinating. In about an hour, the podcast captures its journey in a funny, enthralling fashion.
The Daily ‘Delilah’ I grew up on evening family car rides, listening to corny love songs presented by the overly cheery voice of radio personality Delilah Rene. While I always shrugged her show off as dumb cheese for sentimental adults, it hits differently now.
On a special episode of the New York Times ’ “The Daily” podcast, guest hosts Andy Mills and Bianca Giaever reconnect with their roots, also having grown up on Delilah’s show (which is still going!) and talk with the host herself. Maybe her show is still emotional mush, but the episode made it surprisingly touching and personal. It made me say something I never thought I would think in 2020 (or even 1998, when I last listened to the show): I think I have an appreciation for Delilah.
The Daily ‘Why They’re Protesting’ It’s easy for some people to write off the protests for George Floyd in summer 2020 as anarchy or some type of conspiracy. The New York Times’ Daily podcast makes it personal. In interviews with many people of color, both young and old, they talk about the first time they experienced racism, the deep emotional scars they carry and why they’re fed up with injustice. It’s a heavy, essential piece of storytelling.

Texto completo: Headnote Learning Black History Year-Round
It was January of 1951. Henrietta Lacks (1920-1951) was experiencing abnormal abdominal pain and bleeding. Johns Hopkins physician Howard Jones gave Lacks his diagnosis: cervical cancer.
Examining physician George Gey removed cancerous cells from Lacks' cervix during radiation treatment. The Roanoke, Va., native had no idea that the procedure was taking place in the Baltimore hospital. He discovered that Lacks' cells, later named HeLa cells (derived from the name Henrietta Lacks) could not only be kept alive, but would also grow indefinitely.
Lacks' cells have since been cultured and used in medical experiments ranging from determining the long-term effects of radiation to testing the live polio vaccine. HeLa cells were commercialized and, according to medical writer Rebecca Skloot, have generated millions of dollars in profit for the medical researchers who patented her tissue.
Lacks' cells have "now been living outside her body far longer than they ever lived inside it," Portland Community College professor of biology Donald Defier said in "The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks." "If we went to almost any cell culture lab in the world and opened its freezers, we'd probably find millions, if not billions, of Henrietta's cells in small vials on ice."
HeLa cells have been a vessel in key discoveries in many fields, including cancer, polio, immunology and infectious disease,Uccording to the Harvard University web site. The cells were cloned in 1955, and are being used today in research for vaccines against COVID-19. Yet despite the ways in which the HeLa strain revolutionized biomedical research, the legal and ethical debates over the rights of an individual to his or her genetic material and tissue remain.
Lacks' family had no knowledge of the cell cultures existence until more than 20 years after her death. Many argue that this inaction sheds light on the racial inequities embedded in the U.S. research and health-care systems. For example, Johns Hopkins was one of the few medical facilities that treated African Americans, and no other company that profited from Lacks' cells passed any money back to her family.
Lacks' name was revealed publically and her medical records were shared with the media. Later, her cells' genome (the complete set of genes or genetic material present in a cell or organism) was published on the Internet. Stih, for decades, not one doctor or scientist stepped forward to ask Lacks' family for permission.
Johns Hopkins has said it claims no ownership rights of the cells "because the cells cannot legally be patented," according to the New York Times. Today, Johns Hopkins consistently obtains consent from donors of tissue or cells for use in scientific research.
It's impossible to guess the number of Lacks' cells that are alive today. According to the New York Times, one scientist estimates that "if you could pile all HeLa cells ever grown onto a scale, they'd weigh more than 50 million metric tons."
Lacks however, who died nine months after the procedure at age 31, stood a little over 5 feet.

Hunter Biden investigations to test father's vow of prosecutorial independence

Texto completo: President-elect Joe Biden has long accused President Trump of wanting the Department of Justice to act like a team of personal lawyers.
Now, Biden is under political pressure to practice what he's preached as he prepares to take office on Jan. 20, while his son Hunter, 50, is under federal investigation.
The Bidens released explosive statements through the incoming president's transition aides this month acknowledging federal prosecutors from the United States Attorney's Office in Delaware were working with the IRS and FBI to look at Hunter's foreign business dealings and potential tax law violations.
Then the New York Times reported two days later that Hunter Biden was also being scrutinized by federal prosecutors in Pittsburgh, but with a line of inquiry based on materials supplied by Trump ally Rudy Giuliani.
While Trump supporters complain the investigations were kept secret until after the Nov. 3 election, the timing still isn't ideal for Joe Biden. He's in the middle of his search for an attorney general as he staffs up his administration before his inauguration.
"No. I guarantee you; I'm going to do what I said. The attorney general of the United States of America is not the president's lawyer. I will appoint someone who I expect to enforce the law as the law is written, not guided by me," Biden told reporters Tuesday in Wilmington, Delaware, when asked whether he'd raised the topic of his son during his conversations with his candidates.
But for Bud Cummins, a former Arkansas U.S. attorney appointed by President George W. Bush, it's really only Biden's word and DOJ norms that are binding the two-term vice president to his promise not to interfere in the investigations, which could lead to the criminal prosecution of his son.
"I don't know that there's mechanisms in place that would make it impossible for them to kill the investigation into, let's forget Hunter Biden, any investigation," he told the Washington Examiner.
Cummins explained how U.S. attorneys and their DOJ colleagues had "tremendous authority" to stop an inquiry if they so wished.
"If a president were able to persuade an attorney general to send the order downstream to cease a certain investigation, I think in a lot of circumstances that investigation would cease," he said.
Resignations could signal dissent, according to Cummins. Or they could be evidence of pressure being exerted on people unwilling to follow the order because "everybody in the chain of command pretty much serves at the pleasure of the president," he added.
"It's just, how much criticism is a president willing to absorb for ordering people to do something that they may not want to do and risking people stepping up and resigning out of principle?" Cummins said, citing former President Richard Nixon's infamous Saturday Night Massacre of Justice Department officials during the Watergate scandal.
Traditionally, new U.S. attorneys inherit old investigations from their predecessors. Trump's 2017 dismissal of Preet Bharara, for example, didn't halt inquiries into Trump associates in New York. But in some cases, the replacement can "reestablish priorities" or "examine ongoing investigations and make discretionary calls" about it, or whether it should even continue, Cummins went on.
David Weiss is Delaware's Trump-appointed U.S. attorney. His team's investigation into Hunter Biden started in 2018, before his father announced his 2020 White House campaign. It initially focused on the younger Biden's dealings in China and Ukraine through natural gas company Burisma Holdings. While his exposure to money laundering charges seems to have waned, the inquiry is reportedly homing in on possible tax law violations. Neither Biden has been charged with a crime.
Scott Brady's parallel investigation in Pittsburgh was prompted by outgoing Attorney General Bill Barr, the New York Times found. Barr asked Brady in January to vet information Giuliani had on Hunter Biden after the former New York City mayor spent the previous year looking for dirt on Trump's political rivals, specifically the Bidens in Ukraine. Trump's interest in Giuliani's findings provoked him to urge the Ukrainian government to launch its own inquiry, a request that eventually led to his impeachment.
Both investigations had been covertly conducted until the Nov. 3 election, in line with DOJ guidance that advises against overt actions before an election that could affect the vote if they ever became public. But now that Nov. 3 has passed, subpoenas have been issued and interviews sought.
Jen Psaki, the next White House press secretary, was pressed about the investigations during an interview with Fox News and declined to commit on Biden's behalf to keeping Weiss in place amid his inquiry.
"It will be up to the purview of a future attorney general and his administration to determine how to handle any investigation," she said.
Some Republicans have suggested Barr's interim successor, Jeff Rosen, appoint a special counsel to shield the investigations from Biden's influence.
Regardless of what Joe Biden does, Senate Republicans are expected to pursue any allegations with respect to Hunter Biden if they hang onto their majority after Georgia's Jan. 5 runoffs. Biden has dismissed his opponents' questions about his son.
"We have great confidence in our son. I'm not concerned about any accusations that have been made against him. It's used to get to me. I think it's kind of foul play, but look, it is what it is," he told CBS last week.

Immigrant voters trended toward Trump

Texto completo: Like Sherlock Holmes’s dog that didn’t bark in the night, so in politics: Uncharacteristic behavior can turn out to be crucially significant. Uncharacteristic behavior in politics being defined as one demographic group unexpectedly trending one way when most of the electorate trends the other.
Such behavior was the subject of the New York Times’s graphic team’s report headlined “Immigrant Neighborhoods Shifted Red as the Country Chose Blue.”
Readers scrolling down through the story encounter maps of metropolitan Chicago, Miami, Orlando, Houston, San Antonio, Philadelphia, New York, Los Angeles, San Jose, and Phoenix, plus the Rio Grande Valley, with Latino and Asian neighborhoods clearly marked. Red arrows show election precincts’ increases in President Trump's percentage for 2020 over 2016, with blue arrows sometimes showing increased Democratic margins in areas with mostly affluent white voters.
The story highlights the big Trump increases among Miami area Cuban Americans — a trend so large, and so pivotal in giving Trump Florida’s 29 electoral votes, that it was noticed on election night. But what was considered an exception then turns out to have been a particularly vivid example of the rule.
Trump still didn’t carry most heavily Hispanic areas. But he got big percentage increases in almost all of them, from Los Angeles and the Rio Grande Valley to Upper Manhattan and the Bronx.
And, though this was not noticed at all right after the election, Trump also made gains among Asians — Vietnamese in Orange County, California, Chinese Americans in Silicon Valley and Brooklyn, South Asians and Arabs in Chicago’s northern suburbs.
Almost nothing in preelection media coverage anticipated this countercyclical trend. One reason is that preelection polls typically understated Trump’s support. Another is that subgroups in statewide polls have a big margin of error.
A third reason is that the mostly liberal press corps was confident that “people of color” were permanently alienated by Trump’s (usually unenumerated) “racist” remarks and by his policies to restrict immigration.
Apparently, many voters of recent immigrant stock disagree. Some large and apparently increasing number apparently share Trump’s view that heavy and often illegal low-skill immigration has held down wages of people like them, or they were convinced of that as immigration levels fell and low-credential workers’ wages and incomes increased in 2017, 2018, 2019 and the first two months of 2020.
It may also be that new citizens don’t see the U.S. as a nation whose central heritage is “systemic racism,” as the New York Times’s 1619 Project has insisted. Or that they haven’t encountered discrimination and bigotry against “people of color” as their central and defining experience.
Fear of socialism, inspired by some Democratic candidates’ calls for Medicare for All and the Green New Deal, may have played a role. More than most Americans, many Hispanic and Asian voters know how socialist regimes in Latin America and East Asia have restricted liberty and stifled economic growth. Asians especially may have watched China’s clampdowns on Hong Kong and Xinjiang.
Governments’ responses to the two major events of 2020 (the COVID lockdowns and the Black Lives Matter “mostly peaceful” protests) may have affected immigrants and the upscale whites in nearby affluent neighborhoods differently. Gentry liberals have mostly been able to work from home offices or move to their summer homes, and they are mostly insulated against the sharply increased number of post-Memorial Day homicides and violent attacks.
Voters in heavy immigrant neighborhoods, in contrast, have been more likely to lose their jobs, to have their kids barred from school, and to be at risk of violent crimes. Democratic governors’ and mayors’ lockdowns, Democratic teacher's unions’ demands for school closings and Democratic politicians’ calls for defunding the police may not sound like such good ideas to them.
In the short run, immigrant voters’ move toward Trump didn’t prevent the election of Joe Biden (though it reduced his margin of victory in the three crucial states to 42,918 votes). But in the long run, it points toward a fracturing of the emerging Democratic majority predicted in Ruy Teixeira and John Judis’s book of 2002 and effectuated by Barack Obama’s victory in 2008.
That was a top-and-bottom coalition of gentry liberals and “people of color,” together with a remnant of blue-collar union members. That last group moved toward Trump in 2016 and moved only a bit toward Democrats this year. Now, as the New York Times article and graphics show, Hispanics and Asians, and to a lesser extent blacks, are voting a bit less like like the “people of color” of 2008.
So Democratic strategists, the Washington Post reports, “worry about the potential emergence of a mostly male and increasingly interracial working-class coalition for Republicans that will cut into the demographic advantages Democrats had long counted on.” Sounds like they’ve heard the dog not barking in the night.

Texto completo: With the Trump administration on the way out, it seems that Russian President Vladimir Putin is getting in his last attacks on America while he still can. The White House acknowledged that hackers attacked many parts of our federal government computer and email systems, several national security agencies, and many private businesses. Experts believe that Russia is responsible and described the hack as “the most sophisticated, and perhaps among the largest, attacks on federal systems in the past five years” according to David Sanger in The New York Times. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo stated, “we can say pretty clearly that it was the Russians.”
It seems that Putin is bookending Trump’s four years in office with major cyber-attacks on our nation. President Trump, however, continues to protect Putin and suggested it could be China, without any evidence. I’m still waiting for my Republican friends to explain why they support a president who protects Putin over American infrastructure, troops, and diplomats.
Trump recently fired the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) within the Department of Homeland Security, Christopher Krebs, because Krebs reported that the 2020 presidential election was secure and rebutted Trump’s claims of election fraud. Was this just a coincidence?
Putin seems to know that while his friend is still in the White House, there will not be counter-attacks against him or Russia. And so, once again, Putin gets away with another attack on our nation without paying a price; not even a minor reprimand from the president.
Putin did finally decide to congratulate President-elect Joe Biden on his election. He was one of the last foreign leaders to reach out to Biden, staying loyal to Trump for as long as possible.
“Vladimir Putin wished the president-elect every success and expressed confidence that Russia and the United States, which bear special responsibility for global security and stability, can, despite their differences, effectively contribute to solving many problems and meeting challenges that the world is facing today,” according to a statement from the Kremlin.
But Putin was not the last person to congratulate Biden. That would be dozens of Republican officials who seem to have less faith in our American democracy and election system than the Russian president.
Sen. Mitch McConnell did finally congratulate the president-elect, one day after Putin’s congratulatory statement. One must wonder what Putin knows about American democracy that the senate majority leader doesn’t.
“The fact that it took six weeks for my colleagues to recognize reality and stop undermining our Democratic process is sad and disappointing,” stated Senator Dick Durbin. CNN’s Anderson Cooper added, “So, six weeks, dozens of court cases, two Supreme Court rejections, one fascist rally, four stabbings, countless threats against election officials who were just doing their jobs and more than $200 million in deceptive Trump fundraising since the election: A slow clap, everyone, for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.”
Russia is also thought to be behind microwave attacks on dozens of American diplomats and their families in Cuba and Russia. Many of these diplomats have long-lasting brain injuries and are no longer able to work. Mission accomplished and no response from Trump.
Also, according to The New York Times, “American intelligence officials have concluded that a Russian military intelligence unit secretly offered bounties to Taliban-linked militants for killing … American troops.” “The intelligence finding was briefed to President Trump” in March. And while officials “developed a menu of potential options — starting with making a diplomatic complaint to Moscow and a demand that it stop … the White House has yet to authorize any step.”
Why is Trump afraid to criticize Putin? The question is not if Trump is compromised, but how he is compromised.
For four years, Trump has placed his friendship with Putin over his oath to protect Americans, even our diplomats and troops. In the years to come, we will find out why Trump is so beholden to Putin. For four more weeks, however, Trump is leaving the candy store open for his Russian friend while he picks off American targets.
As stated by Sanger: “Mr. Putin’s long delay in offering congratulations, while President Trump has refused to accept the election results, was widely viewed as a prelude to a frosty relationship between the Kremlin and Mr. Biden’s White House.”
Well, yes, finally, we will have a president who can and will stand up to Putin and defend our nation against these attacks on our infrastructure, troops, and diplomats. The only person Biden will be sending love letters to is his wife.

Texto completo: We all learned something new in 2020, whether we meant to or not.
After nearly 10 years of keeping a starter alive, I finally made a decent loaf of sourdough (it took four months, but who's counting?). Last year, I thought I cooked all the time. This year, I saw just how fast the fridge empties when we're not eating out at all.
I finally acknowledged that how much I enjoy takeout is inversely proportional to how much plastic comes with it. And I learned my love of cooking does have limits.
Daily cooking creates its own feedback loop. Thanksgiving was a case in point: I can roast a chicken with my eyes closed, but duck is expensive ($48 for a farm-raised bird at the farmers' market).
Because I never cook it, when I do roast a duck, I'm not very good at it. I misjudge temperatures and cooking times. I fret over the butchery. The glorious, expensive main dish on our holiday table was so overcooked and tough, I could have cried.
For Christmas, we're doing a takeout feast (thanks in advance, Heritage Tavern!). But in the spirit of the season, I want to offer some holiday cooking inspiration anyway, so here are a few recipes that have worked lately. Many of them are cookies. That is on purpose.
Smashed green beans with lemony sumac dressing by Sohla El-Waylly in Bon Appetit - Among the things I loved about this fresh, zippy green bean side dish was that you can and should make it ahead. I love sumac, a lightly sour spice found in za'atar, and I loved the addition of fresh pear and toasted pepitas to finish.
bonappetit.com/recipe/smashed-green-beans-with-lemony-sumac-dressing
Focaccia - After a stretch of not being able to find yeast in stores, I got a little cocky. Using instant or active dry yeast to make bread felt weirdly like cheating! When I finally got some, my friend Lauren talked me into trying this quick focaccia by sending mouth-watering photos over Messenger.
I am really glad she did, because focaccia took so well to the last of my fresh rosemary and I drowned it in olive oil. It was great for breakfast and on sandwiches. Use this recipe (cupcakesfordinner.com/2018/02/08/gbbo-focaccia) if you just have yeast, or this (kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/sourdough-focaccia-recipe) if you have both starter and yeast.
Roasted and raw Brussels sprouts salad from Susan Spungen in The New York Times - I picked up Spungen's new cookbook, "Open Kitchen," earlier this year but I haven't cooked out of it much yet. This recipe gives a glimpse of how masterful she is with texture and flavor. Almonds, pecorino and a sherry vinaigrette are a perfect match for the earthiness of the sprouts.
cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020553-roasted-and-raw-brussels-sprouts-salad
Triple-ginger chocolate chunk cookies by Susan Spungen in "Open Kitchen" - Do as Susan says and not as I did when baking these intensely chocolaty, lightly spicy molasses cookies. I didn't freeze the dough balls. I cooked two sheets at a time. I didn't let the pans cool between batches. Ergo, my cookies came out flat as little pancakes. Bake along on Food52's podcast if you want the real blow-by-blow on these:
food52.com/recipes/84445-best-molasses-cookies-recipe-with-chocolate
Dorie Greenspan's sables from "Baking" and "Dorie's Cookies" - My sables are unbeautiful. They are knobby and misshapen and of uneven thickness. Thankfully I used fancy cultured butter and didn't overwehrk them (as Paul Hollywood says on the British Bake-Off), so dangit, they're delightful. I recommend searching YouTube if you are new to butter cookie baking.

Brandied fruit by Yewande Komolafe in the New York Times - I baked a bunch of different holiday cookies (obviously) but to date, this is the most festive thing I assembled. I've now got a Mason jar full of liquored up cranberries, cherries, apricots, currants and sultanas in the front of my fridge. On day six, the cocktail they made (with more brandy, naturally) was simply divine. I cannot wait to put them in scones.

A COVID Christmas Comes to Bethlehem

BETHLEHEM, West Bank — The Church of the Nativity was closed, and most souvenir shops shuttered. Hotels that are usually sold out months in advance were deserted.
Among the few signs of life on the main street in Bethlehem’s Old City last Friday were the chirping of a few birds and stray cats scavenging an overflowing garbage can.
Earlier in the month, only a few people attended the tree-lighting ceremony in Manger Square, an event that usually heralds the metamorphosis of the quiet West Bank town of Bethlehem into one of the main seasonal attractions of international Christendom.
The coronavirus pandemic has put a damper on Christmas at the place where it is said to have all begun.
“Great sadness,” Father Ibrahim Shomali, the chancellor of the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem, said of this year’s celebrations. “We are very frustrated, but what can we do? We need to accept the reality and do the right thing.”
Midnight Mass at the Church of the Nativity is usually one of the social events of the year on the occupied West Bank. The ancient limestone church takes on the atmosphere of a glittering movie premiere as diplomats and Palestinian officials emerge from motorcades of shiny BMWs and Mercedes in tailored suits and elegant dresses.
This year, the ceremony will be limited to church officials, a handful of European diplomats and Bethlehem’s mayor. The Palestinian Authority imposed tough antivirus restrictions on Bethlehem on Dec. 10, setting up checkpoints around its perimeter, ordering the closing of restaurants, cafes, schools and gyms, and forbidding nearly all large gatherings.
Bethlehem has about 1,000 confirmed, active cases of COVID-19, according to official data, although the true number is thought to be much higher. All intensive care beds at hospitals are occupied, the Health Ministry said.
During a recent visit, the expansive lobby of the 222-room Bethlehem Hotel was silent. The leather couches and chairs were empty, the lights and heating were turned off, and a fine coating of dust was collecting on coffee tables.
“There’s usually nowhere to sit during this time of year,” said Elias al-Arja, the hotel owner, wearing a winter coat and a large black mask. “It ordinarily gets so crowded that there’s little room to move.”
Since March, when authorities discovered the first cases of the virus in the Bethlehem area, al-Arja said, the hotel has struggled to pay its debts. He had to lay off all but two of his 80 employees. He said he has sold his second home in Ramallah and a plot of land in Jericho to pay off debts.
“It’s been devastating,” he said.
Until the pandemic, the tourism industry in the West Bank, which relies heavily on the Christmastime business in Bethlehem, was anticipating its best year in two decades. The West Bank had more than 3 million visitors last year, tourism officials said.
And despite competition from Israeli tour providers and the challenges of doing business under occupation, Palestinian travel and tourism companies were hiring, offering new itineraries and predicting continued growth for 2020.
“We went from our highest to lowest point,” said Tony Khashram, the head of the Holy Land Incoming Tour Operators Association. “Everything fell apart in the snap of a finger.”
Tens of thousands of people in the tourism industry — including tour guides, tour operators, souvenir shop owners, and restaurant and hotel workers — have lost their jobs, the Tourism Ministry estimates. Tour operators are struggling to pay off debts and to collect hundreds of thousands of dollars in payments due from partners abroad.
Retailers, too, have been devastated. The few merchants who opened their shops said the absence of tourists this year has sharpened their feelings of exasperation over the pandemic’s economic fallout.
“The whole world came during Christmas last year,” said Sami Khamis, whose hole-in-the-wall tea shop near Manger Square offers a specialty tea with whole pieces of fresh sage, ginger, mint, rosemary and cinnamon. “But I’m now hardly making enough money to put food on the table. This is a disastrous situation.”
The seven or eight nearby souvenir shops — which usually do a brisk trade in kaffiyehs, baby Jesus dolls on beds of straw, and olivewood crosses embedded with a vial of soil from the Mount of Olives — were all closed.
In his office overlooking the Church of the Nativity, Mayor Anton Salman said he was sad that Bethlehem would not celebrate Christmas as it normally does, but he emphasized that public health was paramount. He contracted the virus last month.
“We’ve experienced difficult circumstances during Christmas in the past,” he said, alluding to previous violent conflicts with Israel. “But the pandemic is something quite different — there are so many unknowns.”
He said the city would not abandon its traditions, just scale them down.
The Christmas Market in Manger Square, he said, was held for a single day, on Sunday, instead of the usual two. The audience for the annual scouts parade, in which dozens of boys and girls march through Bethlehem on Christmas Eve playing Palestinian anthems and Christmas songs, will be limited to local residents.
“We don’t feel like Christmas is happening,” said Lorette Zoughbi, 66, who watched the tree-lighting on television although it took place just up the street from her apartment. “There’s no special atmosphere. These days feel like any other days that come and go.”
Bethlehem’s Christians, who are mostly Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox, were once the majority. But the Christian population has dwindled through emigration while the Muslim population has grown. Now Bethlehem, like all Palestinian cities in the West Bank, is predominantly Muslim.
Zoughbi, a member of a prominent Christian family in Bethlehem, has felt so bereft of Christmas spirit that she and her husband did not even bother to pull their full-sized tree out of storage. Instead, they stuck a small metal one in a corner of their apartment.
For many Palestinian Christians, the worst part of this Christmas season is having to cancel extended-family gatherings.
Zoughbi’s clan usually gathers for a dinner of qidreh, a rice and lamb dish, at a large restaurant with 150 of her relatives, often followed by an evening of drumming and singing Arabic Christmas songs.
“These are some of the only times we all come together,” she said.
Nihaya Musleh, a resident of Beit Sahour, immediately east of Bethlehem, said she had planned to host Harumiya, a local tradition in which men — or, as in her case, the family matriarch — invite their married daughters and sisters home for a special meal 40 days before Christmas.
Musleh said she and her son had invited 28 family members to her home for a luncheon, promising to enforce social distancing.
But after she spent two days cooking, Musleh said, her daughter-in-law tested positive for the virus, so she called it off.
“I would be lying if I told you I wasn’t unhappy about missing out on Harumiya,” she said. “But I’m glad we found out about the positive test the day before — it was a gift from God.”

Walter Tevis Was a Novelist. You Might Know His Books (Much) Better as Movies.

The wildly popular Netflix series “The Queen’s Gambit” has done for chess what Julia Child once did for French cooking. Chess set sales have skyrocketed; enrollment in online chess classes has surged. The series has been the subject of hundreds of articles and interviews. The novel that inspired the show, first published in 1983, has been on The New York Times’ trade paperback bestseller list for five weeks.
Yet little attention has been paid to Walter Tevis, the author whose creation has stirred all the commotion.
Tevis once pegged himself as “a good American writer of the second rank.” But Allan Scott, the screenwriter who first optioned “The Queen’s Gambit” in the 1980s, disagrees. Scott co-created and executive-produced the current Netflix show.
“I think very highly of Tevis,” he said in an email. “I think he was one of the best American writers of the 20th century. ‘The Queen’s Gambit’ lays out a terrific story very simply. Child, mother killed, orphanage, touch of genius, addiction. It’s Dickensian.” (It took decades to bring the book to the screen, Scott said, because studios thought the subject of chess was a commercial dead-end.)
Born in 1928, Tevis wrote six novels, a surprising number of which made high-profile leaps to the screen: “The Hustler,” about a young pool shark played by Paul Newman; “The Man Who Fell to Earth,” starring David Bowie as a lonesome alien; and “The Color of Money,” a follow-up to “The Hustler ,” which won Newman his first Oscar. Tevis’ 1980 science fiction book, “Mockingbird,” a commentary on humanity’s dwindling interest in reading, has long had a modest cult following.
Tevis was a family man who played board games and fished with his kids; a popular professor of writing and literature at Ohio University in Athens; a cat-lover and movie aficionado; and a talented amateur chess and pool player. He was pale and gangly; some of his students called him “Ichabod Crane.” He was also a three-pack-a-day smoker, a serious gambler and an alcoholic who made several suicide attempts. His fiction often plumbs his psyche, metaphorically.
“He’s the hero of all his own books,” said his son, Will Tevis, 66, before correcting himself: “He’s the antihero.”
Walter Tevis considered his terrain to be the world of underdogs.
“I write about losers and loners,” he told The New York Times in 1983. “If there’s a common theme in my work, that’s it. I invented the phrase ‘born loser’ in ‘The Hustler.’ In one way or another I’m obsessed with the struggle between winning and losing.”
Tevis was born in San Francisco, into what he called a “feelingless, uptight” home. His parents moved to Kentucky when he was 10. Because young Walter had a heart condition, his parents left him behind in a convalescent home, where he spent months drugged on phenobarbital, like Beth Harmon, the main character in “The Queen’s Gambit.” In an essay published in 1990, Tevis’ first wife, Jamie, wrote: “He never got over the scars of the early experience with narcotics.”
Tevis believed that early experience fueled his later alcoholism.
When he left California to rejoin his family, Tevis found his new environment bewildering. In a 1981 interview, he said that “The Man Who Fell to Earth,” about an alien who lands in Kentucky and can’t adjust to life on this planet, was “disguised autobiography.”
“[It] has to do with my having moved from what I thought was the city of light, San Francisco, when I was 11, to Lexington, Kentucky, where I went to a tough Appalachian school in the fifth grade and was beaten up regularly,” Tevis said. (Tevis gave the movie version of the book a C-plus, calling it confusing, but when he met David Bowie found him to be “a wonderful man.”)
The day he turned 17, Tevis joined the Navy. On a ship home from Okinawa, he met Hilary Knight, who went on to illustrate the Eloise books. The two connected instantly, Knight, now 94, recalled, because both were “total misfits.”
“We were two people in a dream world, though his was much more logical than mine,” Knight said. “The other crew paid little or no attention to us. They didn’t want to know these weirdos. Walter was too smart, and the ship was full of dumbbells. We had a great time laughing about everything.”
“The Hustler,” drawn from Tevis’ rough-and-tumble pool hall experiences before and after the war, came out in 1959, followed by “The Man Who Fell to Earth” in 1963. Then, Tevis published almost nothing until 1980. He and his wife, whom he met when they taught at the same high school, raised two children while Tevis was at Ohio University. He played chess and shot pool, often with his colleague Daniel Keyes, who wrote “Flowers for Algernon.” Tevis drank heavily and his marriage suffered. Even so, his children remember Tevis as a devoted parent.
His daughter, Julia McGory, 63, said that his kids had experienced some of “the sadness and complexities of our father,” but “never doubted how much he loved us and enjoyed being with us.”
In the mid-1970s, Tevis sobered up, partly with help from Alcoholics Anonymous. Deeply frustrated by his writer’s block, he got a divorce and decided to try his creative luck in Manhattan. He began a relationship with, and eventually married, Eleanora Walker, who worked for his agent. He reconnected with Knight: “We became great friends again,” Knight said.
Tevis also regained his writerly mojo, finishing four more novels and a collection of short stories. He helped convince Paul Newman to star in the movie version of “The Color of Money.” He also wrote “The Queen’s Gambit” during those years. The writer Tobias Wolff called it an “overlooked masterpiece.”
“Tevis has a gift for vivid characterization and propulsive narratives,” Wolff said in an email. “His style is direct and efficient, never calling attention to itself; yet it grows in power through the course of a novel by its very naturalness.”
Describing young Beth learning a chess move in “The Queen’s Gambit ,” Tevis wrote: “She decided not to take the offered pawn, to leave the tension on the board. She liked it like that. She liked the power of the pieces, exerted along files and diagonals. In the middle of the game, when the pieces were everywhere, the forces crisscrossing the board thrilled her. She brought out her king’s knight, feeling its power spread.”
More lyrically, as Beth sits bored in class, Tevis wrote that her “mind danced in awe to the geometric rococo of chess, rapt, enraptured, drawing in the grand permutations as they opened to her soul, and her soul opened to them.”
In the book, Beth is a harder-edged, less obviously triumphant character than in the Netflix series. Tevis once explained why he made the choice to portray a female chess champion. “Sometimes I was really more wrapped up in the idea of intelligence in women, for which I have an enormous respect and a kind of awe, more wrapped up in that even than the game of chess itself,” he said.
In a 1981 interview, Tevis said he’d realized in middle age that “life is worth living.” He hoped to write one book per year for the rest of his life. Just three years later, he died of lung cancer, at 56.
Tevis’ publishing career may not be over. His estate holds two unpublished children’s books, said Susan Schulman, the agent who represents it. “Gangster Cat” is the story of a New York City cat and his gang. “Turnip Island” is the story of a family who live on an island of nothing but mud.
“They are completely delightful,” Schulman said.
If he were still alive, Will Tevis said, his father would be “basking in glory right now. He had desires for the spotlight. He wanted to be known and noticed.”

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
WASHINGTON — As Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, rang in 2020 in Florida, where he was celebrating his son’s wedding, his work life seemed to be entering a period of relative calm. President Donald Trump’s public attacks on the central bank had eased up after 18 months of steady criticism, and the trade war with China seemed to be cooling, brightening the outlook for markets and the economy.
Yet the earliest signs of a new — and far more dangerous — crisis were surfacing some 8,000 miles away. The novel coronavirus had been detected in Wuhan, China. Powell and his colleagues were about to face some of the most trying months in Fed history.
By mid-March, as markets were crashing, the Fed had cut interest rates to near zero to protect the economy. By March 23, to avert a full-blown financial crisis, the Fed had rolled out nearly its entire 2008 menu of emergency loan programs, while teaming up with the Treasury Department to announce programs that had never been tried — including plans to support lending to small and medium-size businesses and buy corporate debt. In early April, it tacked on a plan to get credit flowing to states.
“We crossed a lot of red lines that had not been crossed before,” Powell said at an event in May.
The Fed’s job in normal times is to help the economy operate at an even keel — to keep prices stable and jobs plentiful. Its sweeping pandemic response pushed its powers into new territory. The central bank restored calm to markets and helped keep credit available to consumers and businesses. It also led Republicans to try to limit the vast tool set of the politically independent and unelected institution. The Fed’s emergency loan programs became a sticking point in the negotiations over the government spending package Congress approved this week.
But even amid the backlash, the Fed’s work in salvaging a pandemic-stricken economy remains unfinished, with millions of people out of jobs and businesses suffering.
The Fed is likely to keep rates at rock bottom for years, guided by a new approach to setting monetary policy adopted this summer that aims for slightly higher inflation and tests how low unemployment can fall.
And the Fed’s extraordinary actions in 2020 were not only aimed at keeping credit flowing. Powell and other top Fed officials pushed for more government spending to help businesses and households, an uncharacteristically bold stance for an institution that tries mightily to avoid politics. As the Fed took a more expansive view of its mission, it weighed in on climate change, racial equity and other issues its leaders had typically avoided.
“We’ve often relegated racial equity, inequality, climate change to simply social issues,” Mary Daly, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said in an interview. “That’s a mistake. They are economic issues.”
In Washington, reactions to the Fed’s bigger role have been swift and divided. Democrats want the Fed to do more, portraying the attention to climate-related financial risks as a welcome step but just a beginning. They have also pushed the Fed to use its emergency lending powers to funnel cheap credit to state and local governments and small businesses.
Republicans have worked to restrict the Fed to ensure that the role it has played in this pandemic does not outlast the crisis.
Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., spearheaded the effort to insert language into the relief package that could have forced future Fed emergency lending programs to stick to soothing Wall Street instead of trying to also directly support Main Street as the Fed has done in the current downturn.
Republicans worry that the Fed could use its power to support partisan goals — by invoking its regulatory power over banks, for instance, to treat oil and gas companies as financial risks, or by propping up financially troubled municipal governments.
“Fiscal and social policy is the rightful realm of the people who are accountable to the American people, and that’s us — that’s Congress,” Toomey, who could be the next banking committee chair and thus one of Powell’s most important overseers, said last week from the Senate floor.
Toomey’s proposal got watered down during congressional negotiations, clearing the way for a broader relief deal: Congress barred the central bank from reestablishing the exact facilities used in 2020, but it did not cut off its power to help states and companies in the future.
Democrats said the new language was limited enough that the Fed could still buy municipal bonds or make business loans via emergency powers; Toomey told The New York Times that doing so would require congressional approval. The divide suggested that the scope of the Fed’s powers could remain a point of debate.
As Powell, 67, faces pressure from all sides in 2021, he could find himself auditioning for his own job. His term expires in early 2022, which means that President-elect Joe Biden will choose whether to renominate him.
Powell, a Republican who was made a Fed governor by President Barack Obama and elevated to his current position by Trump, has yet to say publicly whether he wants to be reappointed. His chances could be affected by the Fed’s coronavirus crisis response, which has been credited as early and swift. Powell was at Group of 20 meetings in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in late February when it began to become clear to him that the coronavirus was unlikely to remain regionally isolated. He checked in with his colleagues in Washington to see what emergency powers the central bank and Treasury Department had at their disposal.
By the time his 14-hour-flight landed at Dulles International Airport on Monday, Feb. 24, stocks were plummeting. He opened his phone to numerous missed calls and emails. From that point, the central bank’s response kicked into gear.
That Friday, Feb. 28 — the same day that Trump called worries about the coronavirus a “new hoax” spread by Democrats — Powell issued a statement conveying the Fed’s concern. On March 3, the following Tuesday, the Fed made its first emergency rate cut since the global financial crisis 12 years earlier — the first of many steps the Fed would take to avert a catastrophic market meltdown.
Some analysts warned that the Fed’s rush to accommodate the economy with lower interest rates might be poorly targeted. What could interest rates do in the face of a pandemic?
A lot, it appears in hindsight. The Fed’s rate cuts set the stage for a refinancing boom and, more recently, a rush to buy houses.
The decision of Penny Achina, a first-time homebuyer just outside of Houston, shows how Fed policy can cascade through the economy. After thinking about buying a house for four years, Achina, a 31-year-old medical technologist, took the leap in 2020.
“I said it’s either you sink or you swim, and the interest rates really enticed me,” she said, and she is set to close next week. With 3% down, she was approved for a 2.5% interest rate on a 30-year mortgage.
When people like Achina buy houses, they often then spend money on new couches and refrigerators to fill them. Higher consumer demand prompts businesses, also attracted by low rates, to borrow money to invest in equipment to produce more.
The central bank’s rescue could yet have side effects. While most economists believe that runaway inflation is unlikely, a minority warn that price increases, which have been quiescent for years, could be kindled by huge government spending and a post-pandemic economic surge. Policymakers have been watching for signs of financial excess as their tools have helped stocks soar and companies to issue debt at a stunning pace.
Jobs remain the Fed’s biggest challenge. While low rates are helping many employed people like Achina, millions of others are out of work. Lower-wage workers, women and minorities have been particularly likely to lose their livelihoods.
The Fed’s low rates and bond purchases may do little to immediately help people who rent, own few stocks and find their jobs eliminated.
Many economists say the $900 billion assistance package passed Monday will need to be followed by more. Some of its key provisions, such as extended jobless benefits, will expire before spring.
“We have a tough period to get through,” Loretta Mester, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, said Friday, pointing out that businesses and households will need help in the next few months as coronavirus cases swell before vaccines are widely distributed.
Even after the recovery takes hold, the Fed is likely to be slow to lift interest rates — and that’s when those left behind in the pandemic may feel the more widespread benefits of its policies.
If its policies work, the Fed could pave the way for the sort of stable, inclusive growth that was taking hold at the start of 2020. Powell has repeatedly called job losses “heartbreaking” and has pledged to use the Fed’s powers to try to restore the job market to its former strength.
“We’re thinking that this could be another long expansion,” he said at a news conference in mid-December as he vowed to boost the economy “until the expansion is well down the tracks.”

Virginia Shackles was painting a foggy scene on canvas one day when she gave her young grandson a lesson in how to make infinite colors with different blends of shades. Colors don’t exist only in a box of crayons, she told him.
Using photos, sketches and postcards from trips, Shackles painted elaborate scenes with oil and watercolors throughout her life. She often included her grandson on her inspiration-seeking travels, part of her effort to expose him to the world.
Shackles died Dec. 16 at the Riverview at the Park nursing home in Ste. Genevieve, Missouri. The cause was complications of COVID-19, her daughter Paula Dustman said.
Shackles celebrated her 99th birthday at the nursing home Dec 4, without family but with cards and her favorite dark chocolate cake. The next day, as she was painting a watercolor landscape, a nurse interrupted to inform her that she had tested positive for the coronavirus. She was transferred to a ward in the home with other COVID-19 patients, where she died.
Virginia Frances Turner was born in 1921 in Wichita, Kansas, to Wyotte Dellavan Turner, a piano salesman, and Frances (Land) Turner. She moved to California with her parents as a young girl.
Shackles, in her 20s, took care of her mother, who had rheumatoid arthritis. Her mother’s ailment moved Shackles to convert to Catholicism, where she found meaning in her mother’s pain and her own experience of it, according to Shackles’ daughter Rosemary Valeska.
Shackles worked in a store that supplied religious items for Catholic churches and met her husband, Frank J. Shackles, there. They married in 1950. Virginia Shackles also worked as an advertising representative for a local newspaper.
After his death in 1976, Shackles felt lonely as she learned to navigate her life without her husband. She never remarried.
After Valeska became a single mother in Monterey, California, Shackles moved in with her in 1983, helping take care of her grandson, Alex Goldberg, while Valeska had a job as an office assistant in Monterey City Hall’s planning department, often working late into the night.
In addition to Dustman and Valeska, Shackles is survived by another daughter, Teresa Cruise; a son, Stephen Shackles; four grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.
Goldberg recalled that his grandmother taught him to appreciate things more often savored by adults, including bitter dark chocolate and opera. She took him on trips to the Monterey Peninsula and on long bus rides to Big Sur, a rugged coast in central California. Shackles was drawn to the Monterey coastline and inspired to paint it, her family said.
“She was painting the scenery of my childhood,” Goldberg said. “It’s all these places and things we experienced together.”
Shackles believed in her artwork and heartily defended it. At a fair, she entered a piece in which she experimented with gloomy colors, using a dark branch as her piece’s subject. The judges tried to disqualify her, telling her that she had entered it in the wrong category. She felt she had been wronged, Goldberg said.
“It was like watching a coach yell at an umpire,” he said.

U.K. Tightens Restrictions as Alarm About Virus Variant Grows

LONDON — British authorities put even more areas of England under the tightest restrictions Wednesday as officials struggled to slow the spread of a coronavirus variant that is potentially more infectious than those that have already wreaked havoc around the world.
The French government lifted a 48-hour blockade of the British border that was aimed at preventing the new variant from spreading. But the effort Wednesday to get traffic moving descended into chaos as officials struggled to carry out the tests required for thousands of drivers stuck at English ports to leave the country.
By Wednesday night, traffic began to move again, according to the British Broadcasting Corp. But more than 5,000 Europe-bound trucks were still jammed up near the port of Dover, across the English Channel from France. Frustrated drivers fumed over the prospect of a fourth night sleeping in their vehicles. One transport company said its drivers had to throw away more than 100,000 pounds of spoiled food.
With uncertainty swirling around the looming Dec. 31 deadline for a post-Brexit trade deal, a virus spreading at astonishing speed, exhausted health care workers struggling with an influx of patients, and millions of people confined to their homes as holiday lights glimmered on deserted streets, the Christmas season was shaping up to be uniquely brutal.
Adding to that pain, Britain relies on importing fresh fruit and vegetables, especially in the winter. Supermarkets have tried to reassure customers that there is enough food, but they cautioned that some fresh goods could run short later in the week if delays continued.
Tesco, one of Britain’s largest grocery chains, emailed customers Tuesday to say that it had “good availability” of items imported from France but that it had imposed temporary purchasing limits on some items, including eggs and toilet paper.
The most pressing concern, British officials said, was slowing the rapid spread of the virus, which they attributed to the efficiency of the new variant. Britain reported 39,237 cases Wednesday, up 56% from a week ago, according to a The New York Times database.
The number of people in the hospital — nearly 19,000 — is close to where it was at the peak of the outbreak in the spring. And 744 deaths were reported Wednesday.
“Against this backdrop of rising infections, rising hospitalizations and rising numbers of people dying of coronavirus, it is vital that we act,” said Matt Hancock, the British health secretary.
Areas in southern and eastern England — including Cambridgeshire, Norfolk, Oxfordshire, Suffolk and Sussex — are set to move to the highest level of restrictions starting Saturday, joining London and much of southeastern England. The rules require people to stay at home except for urgent travel, medical appointments and outdoor exercise, and Hancock said limiting human contact was the only way to protect people.
British officials also expressed concern about the spread of another virus variant identified in South Africa. Hancock said it was even more easily transmitted than the mutation that prompted the lockdowns in England.
Scientists are currently studying both of the newly discovered variants. While early indications suggest they are both more transmissible, more laboratory tests are needed to gain a fuller understanding of the dangers they pose.
Hancock said that British authorities had detected two cases of the South African variant. In both cases, the infected people had been in contact with people who had traveled to Britain from South Africa in recent weeks.
Those infected with the new variant and their close contacts would be quarantined, and Hancock said that travel from South Africa would be restricted. At least five other countries have put in place similar restrictions on travelers from South Africa.
More than 50 governments have barred travelers from Britain since Saturday, when Prime Minister Boris Johnson first raised the alarm over the variant spreading in England and imposed the new lockdown.
French officials also blocked freight shipments for 48 hours, saying the border closure was needed to establish testing protocols given the alarm over the variant.
The British Army was mobilized to help the National Health Service, the country’s health care system, to set up facilities to administer rapid coronavirus tests to drivers and went truck to truck to conduct tests.
But it was slow going.
On Wednesday, with traffic largely at a standstill, drivers who had already spent days in their rigs were left frustrated and confused about how to get a test.
As tensions boiled over, police officers clashed with angry drivers, desperate to get home for Christmas. TV footage showed scenes of pushing and shoving. The police in Kent, which includes the port of Dover, said at least one arrest had been made.
There was concern that the mess Wednesday could be a prelude to the logistical nightmare to come, particularly if trade talks between Britain and the European Union end without a deal.
Tom Binks, the managing director of Peter Green Chilled, a refrigerated and frozen food transport company, said his drivers have had to throw away more than 100,000 pounds of lamb, poultry, cheese and yogurt since Monday. But even before the border was closed this week, he said, his drivers had already waited as long as six hours at the port of Dover this month.
“The port is basically overwhelmed,” Binks said, adding that it lacked the infrastructure to handle the increased shipment volumes as the pandemic and Brexit set off panic buying. “And then the decision from the French on top of it. It’s just unbelievable.”
He said that delivery volumes have been 70% higher this month than other months because of increased orders for Christmas and COVID-19 and Brexit stockpiling. In past years, delivery volumes in December have been up 30% compared to the rest of the year, he said.
Authorities cautioned that it could take days to clear out the more than 5,000 trucks bound for Europe.
“I think it will take a few days to work our way through,” Robert Jenrick, a government minister, said on Sky News on Wednesday.
He also said any drivers who tested positive would be offered a more accurate PCR test, which takes longer to process. If that were also positive, they would be offered hotel accommodation to isolate for 10 days.
Rod McKenzie, the director of policy at Road Haulage Association, which represents the British road transport industry, said probably 8,000 to 10,000 trucks were waiting to cross the border.
“It’s a mammoth task,” he told Sky News.
Some drivers have already spent three nights sleeping in their trucks with limited access to food and toilets and were looking at a fourth Wednesday. Trucks carrying goods to Britain from continental Europe were allowed to pass through ports this week, but their numbers declined amid fears that the drivers would be stuck once they crossed into Britain.
Binks said he was most worried about what happens after Dec. 31, when Britain is no longer part of the European Union’s single market and customs union.
“We’ve got maybe 15 trucks heading out next week, and I don’t know whether to send them or not,” he said.
Food shortages and further disruptions to deliveries are inevitable, he said.

OAKLAND, Calif. — Under a highway overpass in downtown Oakland, Camilla Everette sleeps on a couch, with a blue-and-white-striped summer parasol offering the only protection from the drops of rainwater that fall from the concrete above her.
One of the first things Everette sees when she wakes every morning is a giant billboard featuring happy-looking families in Christmas sweaters and felt-fringed Santa hats. There are glasses of red wine on the table before them and an ominous warning: “Don’t Invite COVID-19 Home for the Holidays. Wear a Mask.”
Everette’s living conditions and those of many others like her — the isolation, and lack of indoor shelter — appear to have helped prevent the most dire predictions about the spread of the coronavirus in homeless populations from coming true.
Early in the pandemic, health officials were terrified that the virus would decimate America’s homeless, the half million people who live in shelters or on the streets. As the year comes to a close, those same specialists say they are relieved that street encampments and homeless shelters did not suffer the same devastation as nursing homes.
Experts caution that the transitory nature of homelessness makes it challenging to gather precise data. And they remain anxious because overall rates of the virus soared throughout the fall. A recent outbreak at a shelter in San Diego served as a reminder that homeless populations, especially those sheltered indoors, are still very vulnerable to the dangers of COVID-19.
“It’s been pretty clear in sheltered settings that when infections enter they spread very rapidly,” said Dr. Margot Kushel, the director of the Center for Vulnerable Populations at the University of California, San Francisco.
Still, researchers and public health officials across the country have conducted testing at encampments and homeless shelters, watching for signs of outbreaks. And in places like Seattle and Los Angeles these tests have turned up relatively low rates of infection.
Dr. Helen Chu, an infectious-disease doctor in Seattle, which has one of the nation’s highest rates of homelessness, has helped conduct 2,500 tests in shelters during the pandemic. Only 15 of the tests, less than 1%, came back positive for the coronavirus.
“I had assumed it would be terrible in the homeless population because of how other viruses circulate,” Chu said. “It pretty much has turned out to be not as bad as I would have thought.”
Experts say that among the reasons for the better-than-expected outcomes are programs in California and New York, the states with the largest homeless populations, to provide thousands of hotel rooms for the most vulnerable homeless people. Hotel rooms are also made available for people experiencing homelessness who exhibit symptoms or come into close contact with those who are infected.
Homeless shelters and encampments are “still a tinderbox for transmission of the virus,” said Dr. Harrison Alter, interim medical director of Alameda County Health Care for the Homeless, across the Bay from San Francisco. “But we set up a system that so far — knock wood — has worked in suppressing viral transmission.”
Of the 3,200 coronavirus tests that the organization has conducted in Oakland, 2.9% were positive.
On a recent morning in Oakland, Alter led a team of outreach workers through homeless encampments offering masks, soap, medications and coronavirus tests.
They approached Jon Bartell Jr., who lives in a tent on the edge of a park.
Bartell said he was not overly worried about the coronavirus because his circumstances allowed for nearly full-time social distancing. He is rarely indoors, avoids crowds and stays off public transportation. “I feel pretty safe in this park,” he said. “I don’t know anyone who has COVID — nobody.”
In California a vast majority of homeless people are unsheltered, a dismal and longstanding crisis that may have been protective during the pandemic.
“Ventilation is good and outdoor is safer,” Kushel said. “It’s a perverse advantage that so many people are unsheltered.”
Preparation has also helped. In March and April, officials in San Diego closed crowded shelters and converted the city’s convention center into a giant socially distanced dormitory. Occupants slept in beds spaced 6 feet apart and were forbidden from eating meals in groups; mask wearing was mandatory and strictly enforced. The oldest and most infirm were given hotel rooms.
“We came together and said, 'How do we protect this population?'” said Ashley Bailey, a spokeswoman for the city of San Diego. “We did a reimagining of a shelter.”
From April until early November, regular testing revealed 27 positive results in the convention center. But after Thanksgiving, officials were blindsided by a spike in cases: More than 150 shelter residents tested positive. Indoor homeless shelters can appear resilient for months — and then suddenly report large outbreaks.
For decades, studies have shown that death rates among homeless people were anywhere from three to eight times higher than the general population. The reasons are numerous, including drug use, lack of medical care and the wear and tear of living on the streets. Studies have also found that homeless people tend to have rates of respiratory infections higher than the general population.
It is difficult to know definitively whether homeless people infected by the coronavirus are dying at higher rates than the general population. In California, where an estimated 150,000 people are homeless, death certificates do not indicate whether someone was housed or not.
But tracking homeless health outcomes in New York is somewhat easier because a much higher percentage of homeless people live in shelters. And data from there appears to show an increased likelihood of death from the coronavirus among homeless people.
Through the end of October, 95 people in homeless shelters died of the virus in New York City, a death rate of 146 per 100,000 people. This is lower than the 231 deaths per 100,000 in the general population for the same time period.
But when the death rate of homeless shelter residents is adjusted for age, which epidemiologists say is necessary because there are many children in shelters, the adjusted rate is 76% higher than the general population. The calculation was made by Dr. Chuck Cleland, an associate professor in biostatistics at the New York University Grossman School of Medicine. Epidemiologists say a higher death rate among homeless people could stem from poor access to health care and preexisting conditions.
Overall, however, there are indications that cases per capita among the homeless population in New York has been lower than the city’s general population.
New York City has recorded 1,815 coronavirus cases among homeless people, a case rate of 180 per 10,000 homeless people, according to the city’s calculations.
The rate for the general population in the city is significantly higher: 447 cases per 10,000 people, according to a New York Times database of coronavirus cases across the country.
Los Angeles, which has the most unsheltered people in the country, has recorded 63 deaths from the virus among homeless people, according to the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health.
“This population, at least in LA, is not dying at startling rates from COVID,” said Dr. Heidi Behforouz, a medical official for the county who focuses on homelessness.
Yet Behforouz describes what she calls the collateral damage of the pandemic.
“We’ve lost so many people, not only to this virus, but to loneliness and anxiety, fear and isolation,” Behforouz said.
Los Angeles, San Francisco and other California cities have reported huge spikes in drug overdose deaths among homeless people on the streets.
Even as worries about infections continue, epidemiologists have acknowledged that distribution of the coronavirus vaccine to homeless people will also present numerous challenges.
Although shelter workers have not been explicitly cited for priority allocation, members of an expert advisory panel to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said recently that local health districts had the discretion to view them as frontline essential workers.
That would put them in a priority allocation grouping with correction officers, emergency workers and grocery store clerks. When a California health official at the meeting asked about the eligibility of shelter residents themselves, committee members said that local authorities had discretion to vaccinate them simultaneously with the workers.
But vaccinating homeless people who do not live in shelters gives health officials consternation. Officials at the meeting worried that homeless people, who face physical and mental health challenges and are generally resistant to governmental authority, might be particularly difficult to persuade to be vaccinated. Long-term planning for vaccinating them had to commence immediately, they urged.
For Everette the main challenge in the days ahead is warding off the dampness and the cold of the streets. She lamented that her favorite blanket had recently disappeared.
“I might not have a building with a roof over my head but this is my home,” Everette said of her couch and belongings arrayed on the sidewalk.

AWKA, Nigeria — In the small family portrait gallery hanging above the television in the cozy home of the Iloanya family, only two framed photographs remain that include the youngest son, Chijioke.
He disappeared eight years ago. His parents, Hope and Emmanuel Iloanya, last saw him in handcuffs in a police station run by the feared unit known as SARS — the Special Anti-Robbery Squad.
They have been searching for him ever since, along the way encountering an industry of merchants peddling hope: lawyers, human rights groups and the churches and pastors who asked for the photographs of Chijioke Iloanya, promising to pray over them and help bring him back.
“They give you a prophecy that he will come back,” said Hope Iloanya, a devout woman of 53, staring at the gaps on her salmon-pink wall. “Whatever they tell you to do, you do it.”
The Iloanyas are just one of many families in Nigeria whose children have disappeared in police custody. For years, police officers in the West African nation have tortured, killed and extorted young people, accusing them of being criminals, according to many testimonies in hearings and studies.
The country’s youth finally had enough, and in October, the biggest protests in a generation erupted. The protests, known as #EndSARS, were against Nigeria’s police and armed forces, against its leaders and the system.
In the Iloanyas’ home state of Anambra, in Nigeria’s southeast, so many have disappeared that some have smelled a business opportunity, wringing money from desperate families who often have already paid large bribes to the police.
Human rights groups offer to get information. Lawyers promise justice. Pastors, spiritual intervention. They wrangled roughly $60,000 from Hope and Emmanuel Iloanya as family members tried everything they could to help their son.
Chijioke Iloanya was 20 when he disappeared.
He had an almost unmanageable roster of friends, who called him “50 Cent”; his sense of style drew comparisons with the rapper. They would duck in and out of his family’s home, where laundry blows on a line in the driveway and lizards run along the walls. Four boys at a time would squeeze into his tiny room, eating cereal and playing cards.
He was good at math and drawing and played drums at church. He teased his little sister, Obianuju Iloanya, giving her nicknames that even today she refuses to repeat. She adored him.
The family had already been through one tragedy. The Iloanyas’ middle daughter, Peace, inexplicably collapsed and died one day in 2010, at age 13. They buried her in her father’s village.
Peace Iloanya’s death left a hole in the Iloanyas’ house and at Hope Relaxation Spot, her mother’s restaurant on a busy street in Awka, their hometown. The children helped out at the restaurant after school. The place was always full.
In November 2012, while Chijioke Iloanya was attending a baby’s naming ceremony, he and six others were arrested, including the mother and the baby being named. The mother and baby and another woman were soon released, but Chijioke Iloanya remained in detention with no reason given.
Emmanuel and Hope Iloanya rushed to the SARS station in the nearby town of Awkuzu. Police officers claimed he wasn’t there. But then Hope Iloanya glimpsed her son in handcuffs.
“Chijioke!” she screamed.
“Yes, Daddy, Ma, I’m here!” he called out.
SARS officers pushed them out the door. They never saw their son again.
Awkuzu SARS, where Chijioke Iloanya was taken, was the “headquarters of human rights violations” including torture and executions, according to reports by Amnesty International.
Officers arrest young men on nonexistent or trumped-up charges, according to many survivors’ accounts, torturing out false confessions and demanding money — sometimes tens of thousands of dollars — to release them. Those who cannot pay often vanish.
Until 2018, the officer in charge of Awkuzu SARS was James Nwafor.
A heavyset man with a big gold watch, a collection of dubious human rights awards and a penchant for flashy cars, Nwafor bragged about personally killing suspects, said those who know him.
“James Nwafor told me simply, ‘I’ve killed him,’” said Justus Ijeoma, a human rights lawyer who first approached Nwafor a decade ago to ask what had happened to a client of his, a bus driver. “He didn’t hide it. The man was so audacious.”
“The killing is wanton,” said Bonaventure Mokwe, a businessman held for two months in Awkuzu SARS in 2013. He described Nwafor killing a prisoner who had contradicted him.
“He pulled a silver pistol and shot the person,” he said. “I saw it with my naked eye.”
Hope and Emmanuel Iloanya kept returning to Awkuzu SARS, begging for information. A week after the arrest, they met Nwafor.
He told them outright that he had killed their son.
“‘I’ve wasted your son’ — that’s the language he used,” Emmanuel Iloanya said. “I’ve wasted your son. You can’t do anything.”
Nwafor did not respond to repeated calls or emails setting out the allegations in this article. When New York Times journalists looked for him at Awkuzu SARS headquarters on a recent afternoon, his former colleagues picked up their guns and ordered us to leave.
Nwafor’s statement that he had killed Chijioke Iloanya was so brazen, so heartless, that the Iloanyas didn’t know whether to believe it.
Then people who said they knew Nwafor approached them, saying, “Oh, he’s lying,” or, “That’s how he talks.” They offered help.
In a dilapidated building in central Awka, at the office of a local human rights group, the Prime Advocacy for Human Rights Preservers Initiative, cartoon posters of angry judges glare down from the walls.
Emmanuel Iloanya, 63, an electrician, said he paid nearly $9,000 to its chair, who said he had military connections and could talk to Nwafor. Nothing happened. The chair’s successor said that he didn’t know about this case but that he charges victims only for the organization’s travel costs.
Pastors and prayer groups asked Hope Iloanya for her son’s clothes as well as his photographs and exhorted her to strengthen her faith. For this, they charged.
“Even to see the priest you have to pay,” she said. “You go to see a prophet, you pay.”
One of those prophets was Gideon Ajekwe, founder of the Good News Of Christ Baptist Church, located in a lush, steep valley full of churches with competing sound systems.
“Prayer is my business,” he said in an interview. For his prayers, he asked Hope Iloanya for a donation for his evangelistic radio show. She gave him $60.
Lawyers came to the Iloanyas' house too.
“A lot of lawyers,” said Obianuju Iloanya, the sister, now a 26-year-old. Until Chijioke Iloanya’s arrest, she had planned to study law but changed direction after seeing how lawyers took her parents’ money. She became a social justice campaigner instead.
“I began to think of lawyers as vultures,” she said.
The family tried everything.
When Emmanuel Iloanya heard about some corpses dumped in a nearby river, he said, he drove there, waded in and used sticks to turn the bodies face up. No Chijioke Iloanya.
Emmanuel Iloanya complained to the state police commissioner, who raised Chijioke Iloanya’s case with Nwafor. He denied killing anyone.
Emmanuel Iloanya returned to Nwafor, offering him $19,000 — all the money he had managed to raise. Nwafor dismissed it as “chicken change,” the family said.
The Iloanyas were not the only ones to raise the alarm about Nwafor and Awkuzu SARS. Human rights lawyers, survivors and researchers released reports, wrote letters to state governors and the president, complained to police headquarters and sued.
But officers at Awkuzu SARS were never prosecuted or sanctioned.
Instead, in 2018, the year he retired from Awkuzu SARS, Nwafor was nominated for a human rights award. And then the state governor, Willie Obiano, promptly hired him as a special adviser on security.
The abuses at Awkuzu SARS did not stop when Nwafor retired.
Sunday Ibeh, 34, a medical equipment supplier and father of three, was arrested this September, accused of planning to buy a stolen car. He said officers tied him up, suspended him from a pole and put heavy weights on his back, almost breaking it.
He was released just before the #EndSARS protests — an explosion of anger that showed how common his experience was in Africa’s most populous nation.
Nigeria badly needs good policing. Boko Haram terrorizes the northeast. Bandits attack in the northwest. Farmers clash with herdsmen in the center.
But the Nigerian police have a long history of violence and impunity. The institution grew out of British imperial forces, and despite decadeslong efforts, reform has been painfully slow. Chronic underfunding — a junior officer’s monthly salary is around $130 — leads police officers to extort the public or serve those with money or power.
The governor fired Nwafor during the protests, and the president dissolved and replaced SARS. But few saw this rebranding as evidence that the government wanted systemic change.
“There are other units twice as deadly as SARS,” said Ijeoma. “SARS is a metaphor for all the violence perpetrated by Nigerian police.”
The police are too useful politically to be held to account, said Okechukwu Nwanguma, the executive director of the Rule of Law and Accountability Advocacy Centre.
Successive governments “want the police to be guided by the dictates of the regime,” rather than by law, he said.
Standing in her turquoise dress behind Hope Relaxation Spot’s counter, Hope Iloanya peeled an onion for moimoi , steamed beancakes.
Before her son disappeared, she served proper meals. But traveling to churches took all her time and energy.
And money. The family sold almost everything, including the land where Peace Iloanya is buried.
The churches never gave Hope Iloanya her photographs back. In the precious few she has left, Chijioke Iloanya studiously avoids looking at the camera or smiling. He flashes a peace sign.
Chijioke Iloanya’s sister, Obianuju, testified before a judicial panel investigating police brutality. Nwafor was summoned but did not show up.
On Twitter, Nwafor claimed that Chijioke Iloanya had robbed a gas station. A police representative told the panel a different story — that he was killed in a shootout. But Chijioke Iloanya’s family says such allegations are absurd.
They have abandoned hope of finding him alive. In 2019, they finally gave away his shoes. They unlocked his room and painted it bright blue. Their youngest, Ruth Iloanya, moved in. Seeking justice is what the family has left.
Obianuju Iloanya, the sister, went just a few weeks ago to Awkuzu SARS to drop off a copy of her testimony. Nwafor was there, she said, sitting under a tree. He didn’t introduce himself, but she recognized him from photographs.
She approached him. He smiled and asked if she would recognize James Nwafor if she ever saw him. Then he said that justice could go either way; it could be for or against her.
“Let the court decide,” she replied, and walked out.

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump on Tuesday unexpectedly threatened to reject a far-reaching, catchall spending package that includes $900 billion in coronavirus relief and funding for the government through Sept. 30. The threat in effect dropped a depth charge on the Republican Party, but beyond politics, the coming days will determine whether his actions actually deny or delay relief to struggling Americans and shut down the government.
What happened?
To guarantee smooth passage for both the pandemic relief package and the $1.4 trillion in funding to keep the government operating, congressional leaders and top White House officials agreed to combine all of the legislation in one behemoth package.
The end product, nearly 5,600 pages, includes a dozen must-pass funding bills and an array of bipartisan legislative priorities that are routinely attached to what is typically the last substantive legislative act of the calendar year.
But in a video posted online Tuesday, Trump conflated the $900 billion relief package with the routine funding portion running along side it, declaring that the coronavirus rescue bill had been larded with provisions that had nothing to do with the pandemic, like foreign aid and federal fish hatcheries. Many of the items he objected to came straight from his own budget proposal.
So what happens to the stimulus aid — and its benefits?
Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, told Americans on Monday that they could receive the $600 direct payments included in the coronavirus relief legislation as early as next week. The bill also would ensure that two federal unemployment programs set to expire after this week are extended.
But the bill’s size means it could take several days for the Government Publishing Office to physically print the bill, have it signed by congressional officials, then bring it to the White House, a process called enrollment. With that process not expected to be finished until Thursday or Friday, some state labor departments — which administer both federal and state unemployment benefits — have already begun to prepare for the programs’ end, meaning that several million jobless workers will still see a lapse in payments after Christmas.
Trump’s indication that he will not sign the legislation without changes, including more than tripling the size of the direct payments to individuals from $600 to $2,000, could further delay both the distribution of any payments and the amount of time it takes for jobless workers to begin seeing their payments again. (The legislation, if signed, does ensure workers will receive back payments for the time missed.)
What is the next step?
Top congressional Democrats, who have been fielding criticism for dropping their demands for a multitrillion dollar relief package and accepting the $900 billion version worked out with the Senate, have happily called Trump’s bluff.
The House is set to convene Thursday, Christmas Eve, in a so-called pro forma session, typically a brief meeting that requires one lawmaker be present and lasts for just a few minutes. In that session, House Democrats plan to bring up a stand-alone bill that would provide for $2,000 direct payments for American families.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, in a letter to Democrats, challenged Republicans to block the measures and said top Democrats were waiting to hear from Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California, the Republican leader, to see if there would be an objection from a House Republican. Any lawmaker willing to return to Washington in person can block the bill from moving forward by denying unanimous consent.
Democrats had included $1,200 direct payments — the original amount approved in March’s $2.2 trillion stimulus law — in their opening offers for another relief package. Within minutes of Trump’s public opposition to the bill, Pelosi declared her agreement with the president’s call for $2,000 checks, as did Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, and some of Congress’ most liberal members.
“We need to send a clean bill with just $2,000 survival checks and a separate spending/covid relief bill,” Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn. and a frequent target of Trump’s ire, wrote Tuesday evening on Twitter, adding, “since Trump wants to sign a bill with survival checks, let’s send one to his desk right away.”
If Democrats in the House pass the bill to increase the direct payments, it moves to the Senate. But it is unclear whether Senate Republicans would take up the measure, given widespread concerns within the Republican conference about the cost of such a provision.
By when does the president need to sign something?
Millions of Americans were enrolled in two unemployment programs in early December, according to the Labor Department. Both programs are set to expire Saturday. That could push nearly 5 million people into poverty virtually overnight, according to an estimate from researchers at Columbia University.
The longer it takes for a final relief bill to be signed into law, the longer unemployed people will remain in limbo without federal relief.
In order to provide time for the $2.3 trillion package to reach the president’s desk, Congress on Monday approved a seven-day stopgap spending bill, which Trump signed. That means government funding will run out at the end of the day Monday, although both chambers are scheduled to have a pro forma session and could approve another short-term funding bill in the absence of Trump’s signature on the full-year funding bills.
What if he just doesn’t sign it?
Trump did not outright say he would veto the legislation if the changes he demanded were not made, but he may not have to. The legislation passed with the support of well more than two-thirds of both the House and Senate, easily surpassing the threshold required to override a veto if he actually did that.
But a quirk in the calendar has scrambled the rules a bit. Legislation can become law 10 days after the bill is enrolled even without a presidential signature. But because the time frame overlaps with the end of the current Congress on Jan. 3 and the convening of the 117th Congress, a “pocket veto” remains a possibility, said Josh Huder, a senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University.
All legislation dies with a Congress, so without Trump’s signature in the next 10 days, the behemoth legislation would have to be reintroduced and voted on a second time, further delaying funding of the government and providing relief to struggling Americans and businesses.
What do Republicans think?
Republicans have long resisted spending more than $1 trillion on another relief package, but they need Trump’s supporters to ensure they win two Senate runoff races in Georgia on Jan. 5. Losing both would cost them control of the Senate.
The two Republican candidates in Georgia, Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, were already proclaiming passage of the coronavirus relief bill as a triumph, but they have also pledged fealty to the president, who called the bill a “disgrace."
Still, a number of Republicans are likely to resist increasing the amount of direct payments after months of insisting that a relief package should be as small as possible. In the days before a bipartisan deal was struck, Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., blocked attempts to raise the payments to $1,200.
“Most working Americans don’t need a check right now,” said Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., on “Fox and Friends” Wednesday morning. “It’s a really foolish, egg-headed left-wing socialist idea to pass out free money to people.”

China and the European Commission appeared close to announcing a landmark agreement this week that would make it easier for their companies to invest in each other’s economies. Then it hit another snag: A tweet by a top aide to Joe Biden signaled that the president-elect was not happy about the deal.
The pact, nearly seven years in the making, remains a top priority of Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany because it would give companies like Daimler and Volkswagen better control over their operations in China.
China, which has long been wary of allowing foreign companies greater access, seems eager to strike a deal now before the new U.S. administration can try to rally a united front against Chinese policies and actions, as Biden has pledged to do.
Merkel and other leaders have been pressing to complete the deal before the end of the year, while Germany holds the rotating six-month presidency of the European Council. Last week they even circulated 126-page draft that was largely completed except for unresolved issues of wording.
Their efforts, and an expected announcement Tuesday, have instead run headlong into the growing animosity toward China and increasingly vocal opposition in the final rounds of talks.
In the European Parliament, the pact faces significant opposition from members who say it does not do enough to open China’s economy or to stop Chinese human rights violations.
In Washington, members of the incoming administration openly flagged that they hoped Europe would wait.
Biden’s choice as national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, wrote on Twitter on Monday that the new administration “would welcome early consultations with our European partners on our common concerns about China’s economic practices.”
The White House also weighed in. A spokesman for the National Security Council, John Ullyot, warned that any commitment from China “that is not accompanied by strong enforcement and verification mechanisms is merely a propaganda win” for the Chinese Communist Party.
The Trump administration has been trying, with mixed success, to encourage allies to follow its example in reducing economic and technological ties with China. As the talks in Europe have gained momentum in recent weeks, President Donald Trump has instead been subsumed with trying to overturn the results of the presidential election, while many top advisers have been focused on the new stimulus bill or the response to the coronavirus.
If a deal comes to pass, it would be an unexpected diplomatic victory for China after a year in which its international standing plummeted over its obfuscation about the pandemic, its aggressive actions in Hong Kong and the South China Sea, and most recently a fierce dispute with Australia.
“The Chinese are keen to weaken any kind of trans-Atlantic alliance by pushing this through,” said Theresa Fallon, director of the Center for Russia Europe Asia Studies in Brussels.
After four years of dealing with a Trump administration that was by turns hostile toward Europe or simply indifferent, leaders in Brussels want to show that they can cope with China on their own. At the same time, they hope to rebuild relations with the United States under a Biden presidency.
Representatives of China and the European Commission, the European Union’s administrative arm, are continuing to negotiate and still hope to reach an agreement by the end of the year.
“Progress has been achieved in a number of areas,” the European Commission said in a statement. “There are still some important outstanding matters, and talks are continuing this week.”
According to the draft of the deal, a copy of which has been reviewed by The New York Times, a number of differences over language remained unresolved as of last week. The two sides had not agreed yet on what to call the pact. Europe favors “agreement,” while China prefers “treaty.”
In a section on investment and sustainable development, China had also asked to insert a phrase that it often uses to argue it should be held to different rules than industrialized nations. It says “the Parties recognize the differences in the Parties’ respective levels of development should be taken into account.”
The agreement also faces opposition for what it does not address. Critics have already complained that the deal does not do enough to open China’s markets, to honor previous pledges on trade and the environment or to address human rights abuses, including forced labor and the mass internment of Uighurs and other Muslims in the far western region of Xinjiang.
An investment agreement with China would require approval by the European Parliament, and opponents may have enough votes to block it.
“From the moment that the deal is signed, Europe will thus lose leverage not only on issues critical for future competitiveness, but also on fundamental value issues, ranging from human rights to the future of coal power plants,” a group of Chinese scholars in Europe wrote in an open letter as the agreement neared completion.
European officials consider the investment agreement as a relatively limited effort to ease commercial relations with China that did not have major geopolitical implications. The pact has strong support among European companies operating in China because it would lift requirements that they operate through joint ventures with Chinese partners and share sensitive technology. The agreement would also open up the Chinese banking market to European Union firms.
Brussels and Beijing have been discussing investment rules since the beginning of 2014 without making significant progress, in part because of China’s wariness about opening its economy to foreign competitors. The efforts faltered again this year, but the talks got back on track after the U.S. presidential election in November.
China’s leader, Xi Jinping, intervened directly, speaking with Merkel and President Emmanuel Macron of France. He told the French leader that relations between China and Europe were “gaining more global and strategic significance under the new circumstances,” according to the official Xinhua account of the call.
Officials and analysts in China and Europe said Beijing recently offered some concessions — enough to move negotiations forward, though not enough to assuage everyone. In China, the progress has been welcomed. A spokesman at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Wang Wenbin, said Tuesday that with the agreement between China and Europe would “inject more stability into the world.”
Any finalized deal could be a significant blow to Biden’s ambitions on trade. He has sharply criticized Trump for antagonizing Europe and other allies with his global trade wars and has promised to work more closely with like-minded governments to counter China’s unfair economic practices.
Although Biden has not clarified what such a partnership might look like, it could focus on extracting more commitments from the Chinese government, including on issues like intellectual property enforcement, state-owned enterprises and discrimination against foreign companies in China.
While a deal with China in the short term would not preclude other partnerships between Europe and the United States, it would undercut some of Biden’s rhetoric and demonstrate that Western companies are still fiercely competing for access to the lucrative Chinese market.
One of the main sticking points in the talks has been China’s willingness to abide by international standards for workers. Beijing has so far agreed only to “promote” better working conditions, without explicitly agreeing to observe standards on minimum wages and health and safety, according to the draft of the deal. Members of the European Green Party and other groups consider such a promise vague and unenforceable.
European views of China are conflicted. While China is an important source of investment and a critical market for industrial goods, acquisition by Chinese companies of assets like Volvo Cars or Kuka, a German maker of industrial robots, has prompted the European Union to give its member states more power to block investments.
As Chinese companies have become more sophisticated, they have also emerged as competitors in industries such as machine tools, previously dominated by German companies. With government backing, Chinese automakers are trying to use the transition to electric vehicles to become players in the international car market, a challenge to European carmakers.
Fallon, of the Center for Russia Europe Asia Studies, said that China would come out ahead even if the European Parliament scuppered the investment agreement by driving a wedge between the commission and the Parliament, and between Europe and the United States.
“They win no matter what,” she said.

The Trump administration and Pfizer reached a deal to bolster the supply of the coronavirus vaccine made by Pfizer and BioNTech for the United States by 100 million doses by the end of July.
The new agreement means the companies will supply the United States with a total of 200 million doses, enough to vaccinate 100 million Americans. The additional shots will cost $1.95 billion, the companies said.
The agreement, announced Wednesday, would help the United States at least partly offset a looming vaccine shortage that could leave millions of adult Americans uncovered in the first half of 2021.
So far, only two pharmaceutical companies — Pfizer and Moderna — have won federal authorization for emergency distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, and most of what they are capable of producing for the next six months has already been allocated through contracts with the United States and other governments.

Why Israel Faces a Fourth Election in Just Two Years

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
JERUSALEM — With Israel heading to its fourth election in two years after the collapse of its government, many Israelis are wondering whether it’s a case of too much democracy.
The last three ballots ended inconclusively, with no single candidate able to muster the parliamentary majority required to form a government. The stalemate allowed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of the conservative Likud party to persuade his main rival, Benny Gantz of the centrist Blue and White party, to join forces in an uneasy coalition.
It lasted just seven months.
Netanyahu now finds himself again fighting for political survival while on trial, charged with bribery, fraud and breach of trust, and amid the coronavirus pandemic, which has devastated the Israeli economy.
Here is what to watch for as Israel gears up for another election, this time set for March 23.
Why is this happening?
The main reason, analysts say, is Netanyahu’s legal and political calculation that he can best fight his criminal case from the prime minister’s office. They say he is ready to take the country to election after election in an effort to cling to power.
Technically, the latest government fell over Netanyahu’s refusal to pass a state budget for 2020 by the legal deadline of midnight Tuesday. His refusal also violated his coalition agreement with Gantz.
Netanyahu is betting on being able to form a more sympathetic government that could grant him immunity from prosecution, analysts say. His corruption trial is scheduled to move into an intensive evidentiary stage early next year, when the country will witness the spectacle of his appearing in court.
Netanyahu blamed Gantz for the breakdown in the coalition government, saying that he and his Blue and White party refused to allow the prime minister any say in a series of coming government and judicial appointments. But opinion polls indicate that most Israelis blame Netanyahu.
“There are a lot of smoke screens, but I think we need to be fair and to be quite explicit about it,” said Yohanan Plesner, the president of the Israel Democracy Institute, a nonpartisan research group. “This won’t end until either Mr. Netanyahu is replaced or if he finds a way, by legislation or political maneuvering, to either put his trial on hold or to suspend it altogether.”
What happened in the last three elections?
The last three ballots were essentially a faceoff between Netanyahu and Gantz, a former army chief who entered politics two years ago.
Netanyahu, Israel’s longest-serving prime minister, came with a strong conservative base and experience. The centrist Blue and White party under Gantz promised national unity and the rule of law.
Banding together with smaller parties that generally divided along right-wing-religious and center-left lines, the two blocs ended up in a chronic tie. After two elections failed to produce a stable government, Netanyahu and Gantz agreed to form a government of national unity the third time around, citing an urgent need to focus on the pandemic’s public health and economic crisis.
But their coalition deal involved taking turns as prime minister, with Gantz due to take over from Netanyahu in November 2021. Few people, including Gantz by the end, believed that Netanyahu would allow that to happen.
Will Round 4 be different?
Perhaps. A few weeks ago, opinion polls indicated that Netanyahu would be well positioned to form a new government made up of right-wing loyalists and his ultra-Orthodox allies. But a new conservative challenger, Gideon Saar, has since entered the ring and rejiggered the electoral map, competing for Netanyahu’s base voters, among others.
Saar, who lost to Netanyahu in a Likud leadership race a year ago, recently defected from the party and set up a rival one called New Hope, taking a few coalition members with him. Osnat Mark, a Likud lawmaker and Netanyahu loyalist, called New Hope “a party of traitors and deserters.”
Gantz lost most of his public support after joining forces with Netanyahu, having previously made an election pledge not to. With his Blue and White party now disintegrating amid infighting, the main battle this time is likely to be for the leadership of the right.
Numerous polls taken since Saar’s move suggest, however, that there is still no party leader with an easy path to forming a government.
Because no single party ever manages to command an outright majority in the 120-seat Parliament, larger parties must join forces with smaller ones to form a viable coalition. That often gives minor coalition partners disproportionate leverage.
If no candidate garners a majority of 61 this time, Israel’s political crisis could go on. And on.
What’s at stake for Netanyahu?
A March election comes with significant risk for Netanyahu, who tried unsuccessfully to postpone Parliament’s budget deadline after Saar broke away.
Israel’s coronavirus vaccination campaign is just getting underway, so a late spring or summer vote might have been more advantageous for him, because an economic recovery might have begun by then.
Instead, the campaign will take place as Israel grapples with a third wave of the virus.
In another handicap for Netanyahu, he will be facing voters this time without the support and last-minute political gifts provided by his closest international ally, President Donald Trump, and will instead have to deal with the Biden administration after it takes over in January.
Yet Netanyahu, popularly known as Bibi, also has plenty to boast about. With the help of the Trump administration, he has delivered deals to establish diplomatic relations with four formerly hostile Arab countries in the past four months.
His administrations have led the country through years of relative security and stability, and he is taking personal credit for having secured millions of coronavirus vaccine doses.
“Israel could definitely become one of the first countries to emerge from the crisis,” he said in a televised address Tuesday night.
What’s at stake for Israel?
The election offers an opportunity for a change of direction. After years of a tight alliance with the Trump administration, the next Israeli government will have to work hard to restore bipartisan support in Washington.
Israel also needs national healing after years of divisiveness. Netanyahu, who denies all wrongdoing in relation to the legal charges against him, has accused law enforcement of plotting to oust him by judicial means because the left failed to remove him at the ballot box.
With politicians at loggerheads over fundamental issues like the powers of the courts, Israelis must now decide what kind of democracy they want rather than focusing only on which candidate can best contend with challenges posed by the coronavirus and with regional threats from Iran and its proxies.
With the Biden administration in the United States, Israel may also come under pressure to curb settlement activity in the occupied West Bank and make concessions to the Palestinians.
Whatever the case, this next election, like the three before it, is set to largely be a contest between the “Only Bibi” and “Anyone but Bibi” camps.

NEW YORK — On March 12, I took my last subway ride home from work. I was listening to John Cale’s “Dying on the Vine” while standing in the middle of a cramped car. I could feel tension in the air — a mix of fear and uncertainty. As New Yorkers retreated indoors, many struggled with a new kind of loneliness.
Loneliness was not new to me. It’s been part of my life since 2014, when I left my friends and family behind in Egypt, and moved to the United States.
But when the pandemic hit, that loneliness was amplified by fear: Fear that I would lose a loved one back home and wouldn’t be there for them. Fear that I would die here all alone.
One windy afternoon in April, I took a walk through a nearly empty Prospect Park. The leaves rustled loudly as I walked near the lake where I saw a lone man sitting on a bench in silence. The scene made me reflect on the experience of feeling lonely in such a densely populated city.
As the holidays approached, I wanted to find others who shared my experience, to see how New Yorkers were handling their own loneliness.
‘I bought 46 plants’
Jennifer
“Being a spreader is my worst fear,” said Jennifer Gagliardi, 27, who lives in a one-bedroom apartment near Prospect Park with Helen, her blind and deaf cat.
Gagliardi tried to cope with the loneliness the pandemic imposed on her life by finding new hobbies: She learned embroidery and adopted 46 plants.
Gagliardi moved to Brooklyn from Long Island in January last year for a teaching job at St. Joseph’s College. In her pre-pandemic life, she would drive to Long Island to spend Thanksgiving with her family.
“We decided against it this year,” she said. “We don’t want to kill each other.”
Instead, Gagliardi ordered Indian food for two and dined while standing in her kitchen with her best friend, Danny Pinghero.
“I usually love the holidays,” she said. “This is the first year I’m very much dreading them.”
Gagliardi said on Christmas Eve her family would usually all gather at a Mexican restaurant and then go to Mass.
This year, she will likely be sitting alone with Helen, watching “The Muppet Christmas Carol.”
“I’m worried about the winter,” she said.
‘I look at myself getting skinny and it annoys me’
Marion
Marion Johnson, 86, sat alone on her couch in her apartment in Coney Island, soaking up the last bit of sunlight.
Being alone is not new to Johnson, who said her life has not been affected much by the pandemic.
“I’m in the house all the time,” she said.
She has vertigo and cannot leave home on her own. Her solitude is only broken by occasional visits from neighbors or friends, who sometimes walk with her when she needs to go outside.
She is not in close contact with her immediate family, and she doesn’t remember the last time she spent the holidays with them, besides hosting one of her grandsons on Thanksgiving last year: It’s been “at least 20 years,” she said.
Johnson tries to maintain her spirits. She decorates her home with Christmas lights. She enjoys visits from her neighbors, who offer hot meals. A photograph on her fridge shows a younger Johnson standing on her head while playing with her neighbor’s children.
But she can’t deny the toll loneliness has taken on her over the years.
“I lost my appetite,” she said.
‘Without structure there is no motivation to study’
Ahnaf
The muffled sound of Ahnaf Islam playing the Velvet Underground’s “Sunday Morning” on his guitar could be heard throughout his apartment in the Midwood neighborhood of Brooklyn.
“It describes how I feel,” he said.
Islam, 24, lives with three other people, immigrants like him, but keeps to himself. Since moving to New York from Chittagong, Bangladesh, in 2015, he has found it difficult to connect with his roommates and classmates at New York University, where he studies physics.
Even though he felt socially isolated, he said being physically in class motivated him. But when the pandemic hit, his struggles with depression intensified.
“The mental isolation I felt before became augmented with physical isolation,” he said.
Alone in his bedroom, Islam had a hard time focusing on his schoolwork, preferring to read and play guitar.
It was like this for months, until Owise Abuzaid moved into the apartment in October.
“I have been feeling better since Owise moved in,” he said.
The two have developed a friendship, occasionally playing music together and chatting on their roof.
Islam is planning to spend the rest of the holiday season catching up on his schoolwork.
“This is the only thing I care about right now,” he said.
‘These aren’t things you should tough out on your own’
Grace
In November, Grace de Oliveira, 66, had gender reassignment surgery. She took an Uber ride to the hospital where she stayed after surgery for four days — alone.
“I wanted this to mean something,” she said. “I wanted my family to look at me and see me. I’m not being seen and that’s what’s making me crazy.”
She said her family — including her five children — has been supportive of her since she came out to them in 2016. But because of the pandemic, they couldn’t be at the hospital with her.
“I imagined that there would be this embrace of my family,” she said. “I feel like all of that was taken from me.”
In the Throgs Neck area of the Bronx, where she lives alone, de Oliveira takes her daily routine seriously: She writes in her journal, meditates, reads and plays the piano.
She said the routine keeps her grounded.
“You’re not just a victim of your stresses and anxieties,” she said.
One day in early December, de Oliveira sat at her piano, playing one of Beethoven’s sonatas. What remained of the daylight faintly lit her red dress.
“It will be a lonely holiday,” she said. “It will be me and some movie, and Bach or Beethoven.”
‘We’ve had a period of suffering and darkness, but there has to be some sort of hope’
Victoria
In an empty sanctuary on a recent Friday, Victoria Remer’s footsteps echoed as she prepared to record another virtual service.
Remer, 25, a Master of Divinity candidate at Luther Seminary in St. Paul, Minnesota, moved to New York in August to intern at the Lutheran Church of Our Savior in Jamaica, Queens. But what was supposed to be a community-based job turned out to be a solitary one.
“I feel like I’m missing out on a huge part of what I’m supposed to be doing here,” she said.
Dec. 24 is Remer’s birthday. She said her family would usually spend the day celebrating and then spend the night as ushers or worship assistants at Christmas Eve service.
This year she will be alone with her dog, Roan, in her basement apartment.
Like the rest of the city, the young pastor’s social life has become nearly nonexistent. She looks forward to passing by the crossing guards on her way to the church every day.
“It’s like the little hope in each day,” she said. “A reminder that we all need these little interactions.”

Texto completo: God willing, Donald Trump will no longer be our president after Jan. 20. But as much as some of us in the media hope we can stop thinking about him and his presidency after that day, we must not allow ourselves to forget. We need to have a major post-mortem on how we covered him, especially in the early days of his campaign and administration.
And that is something a lot of major media players and institutions won't want to do, because of the way their failures helped him become president. Turning the page is easier than admitting mistakes were made that helped a very dangerous person move into the White House.
It is easy to criticize someone like Joe Scarborough, co-host of MSNBC's "Morning Joe," for the fawning and excessive coverage of Mr. Trump that he offered in the early days of the 2016 campaign. But virtually all of mainstream media, myself included, played into Mr. Trump's hands even when we adhered to the traditional values often encapsulated in words and catchphrases like "objective" and "down the middle."
In 2018, I wrote a column headlined, "Covering Trump as media figure challenges my core journalistic beliefs more and more." It began, "I'll be honest, some weeks I don't know if I'm evolving to a higher ethical plane or losing my journalistic religion bit by bit as I struggle to communicate what I see as President Trump's toxic effects on American media and culture."
One of the issues I cited in that column was the debate that started in 2016 and was still going on two years later about whether or not the New York Times should call Mr. Trump a liar. Yeah, we got downright Talmudic on that one acting as if there really were two or more sides to the question. At the time, I facetiously said that he was such a liar maybe we should fact check him backward: Assume everything he says is a lie and point out the few occasions when says something true.
I have come to believe most of us had not systematically thought through what words like fair and balanced really meant. Did they mean anything if Roger Ailes, the right-wing political partisan and late CEO of Fox News, could successfully use them to falsely brand the Rupert-Murdoch-owned channel as a journalistic entity, when in reality it was anything but "fair and balanced"?
Two recent media moments have convinced me of the need for a serious post-mortem on our bedrock values when it comes to covering someone as transgressive as Mr. Trump.
One was the publication of an op-ed piece in the New York Times written this month by Univision anchor Jorge Ramos that included him revisiting a 2016 news conference in which he challenged Mr. Trump's comments about immigrants.
"Excuse me, you weren't called. Sit down, sit down. sit down, sit down," Mr. Trump demanded. "Go back to Univision."
When Mr. Ramos stood his ground, he was forced out of the room by a security guard.
"After my confrontation with Mr. Trump, several journalists expressed their solidarity with me," Mr. Ramos wrote. "And yet, strangely and dangerously, the incident failed to shift the media's obsessive coverage of Mr. Trump, which over time normalized his rude, abusive and xenophobic behavior."
Amen. The racist and fascist behavior that would become hallmarks of Mr. Trump's rallies and his presidency were on display in that exchange. Why didn't we in the press respond more forcefully?
The second development involved the way anchors across TV news have been responding to Mr. Trump's lies the last month about winning the presidential election.
Mainstream news channels have refused to play video of Mr. Trump's false and dangerous claims about the election being "rigged."
On Nov. 6, after Mr. Trump started into a pack of lies about how he won the election, MSNBC's anchor Brian Williams came on screen as Mr. Trump was still talking and said, "OK, here we are again in the unusual position of not only interrupting the president of the United States, but correcting the president of the United States."
On CNBC, Shepard Smith said, "Well, we're interrupting this because what the president of United States is saying is in large part absolutely untrue."
Great, but why wasn't TV news doing that years ago when we knew he was lying?
We need to acknowledge our failures and understand why our traditional journalistic values were not able to spare the nation the chaos of this presidency. We need to be able to say: Never again.

Weight training may ease anxious feelings

Texto completo: Roiled by concerns about the pandemic? Lifting weights might help, according to a timely new study of anxiety and resistance training. The study, which involved healthy young adults, barbells and lunges, indicates that regular weight training substantially reduces anxiety, a finding with particular relevance during these unsettling, bumpy days.
We already have plenty of evidence that exercise helps stave off depression and other mental ills, and that exercise can elevate feelings of happiness and contentment. But most past studies of exercise and moods have looked at the effects of aerobic exercise, like running on a treadmill or riding a stationary bike.
Scientists only recently have begun to investigate whether and how weight training might also affect mental health. A 2018 review of studies, for instance, concluded that adults who lift weights are less likely to develop depression than those who never lift. In another study, women with clinical anxiety disorders reported fewer symptoms after taking up either aerobic or weight training.
But many of these studies involved frequent and complicated sessions of resistance exercise performed under the eyes of researchers, which is not how most of us are likely to work out. They also often focused on somewhat narrow groups, such as men or women with a diagnosed mental health condition like depression or an anxiety disorder, limiting their applicability.
So for the new study, which was published in October in Scientific Reports, researchers at the University of Limerick in Ireland and other institutions decided to see if a simple version of weight training could have benefits for mood in people who already were in generally good mental health.
To find out, they recruited 28 physically healthy young men and women and tested their current moods, with a particular emphasis on whether the volunteers felt anxious. All the participants scored in a healthy range on detailed anxiety questionnaires.
The scientists then divided these well-adjusted volunteers into two groups. Half were asked to continue with their normal lives as a control group. The others began to weight train, a practice with which few were familiar.
The scientists had devised a helpfully simple resistance training routine for them, based around health guidelines from the World Health Organization and the American College of Sports Medicine. Both those organizations recommend muscle strengthening at least twice a week, and that's what the volunteers began doing. After initial instruction from the researchers, the volunteers took up a basic program of lunges, lifts, squats and crunches, sometimes using dumbbells and other equipment.
Their training continued for eight weeks. Throughout, both groups periodically repeated the tests of their anxiety levels, including at the end of the full program. (After the study ended, the control group was given the option of starting the weight training routine.)
As expected, the control group, for the most part, retained their original low levels of anxiety. They still felt about as tranquil as eight weeks before.
But the weight trainers scored about 20% better on the tests of anxiety. They had started with low levels of anxiety to begin with, but felt even less anxious now.
This effect was "larger than anticipated," says Brett Gordon, a postdoctoral scholar at the Penn State Cancer Institute at Penn State College of Medicine, who was a co-author of the study with Matthew Herring, Cillian McDowell and Mark Lyons. The benefits for mental health were greater, in fact, than those often seen in studies of aerobic exercise and anxiety. But Gordon cautions that such comparisons are limited, since the various experiments use different amounts of exercise and measures of moods.
The new study also did not delve into how weight training can affect anxiety. But Gordon and his colleagues suspect increased physical and psychological potency figure in. The lifters became stronger over time and able to lift heavier weights. "Feelings of mastery may have occurred" then, he says, leaving people feeling generally more capable of coping. Molecular changes in the lifters' muscles and brain likely also occurred and contributed to improvements in their moods, he says, noting that future studies may help to detail some of those changes.
Of course, this experiment featured only healthy young people performing one version of training, so the findings cannot tell us if lifting likewise eases anxiety in older people. Nor can it tell us which regimen might be enough, too much or just the right amount to bolster mental health. Finally, it also does not prove that heading to the gym today can acutely soothe any mental turmoil we may be feeling, since the improvements in the study showed up after weeks of training.
But if you are feeling tense and uptight, as so many of us are these days, becoming stronger is probably a worthwhile goal and need not be intimidating, Gordon says. "There are numerous ways to strength train with little to no equipment," he says. "Try common body weight exercises, such as pushups, situps or squats, or use household items as weights."
You can find more information about do-it-yourself weight training in The New York Times' Well Guides "How to Get Strong" and "How to Build Muscle in 9 Minutes."

'Corrupt to the end': Trump faces backlash after pardoning 15, including Blackwater contractors

Texto completo: After President Trump pardoned 15 people and commuted the sentences of five on Tuesday, including former government contractors who were convicted in a 2007 massacre in Baghdad, he faced swift criticism from politicians, legal analysts, members of the media, and veterans.
Though it's common for outgoing presidents to issue pardons near the end of their term, Trump has steadfastly refused to concede the election even as the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden is less than 6 weeks away.
In comparison to past presidential transitions, the shift from Trump to Biden has been anything but smooth. In its last remaining weeks in power, the Trump administration has taken steps that will make Biden's beginning days as president difficult to navigate — from withdrawing troops in Afghanistan to Trump suggesting he would not sign a pandemic relief bill that lawmakers spent months negotiating.
This latest act — pardoning congressional Republicans who were early supporters of Trump, along with a former campaign advisor found guilty of lying to investigators in the Russia probe, among others — exemplifies the president's tendency to reward those who have been loyal to him and punish those who have not, critics like Representative Adam Schiff said.
“Lie to cover up for the president? You get a pardon. Corrupt politician who endorsed Trump? You get a pardon. Murder innocent civilians? You get a pardon,” the California Democrat and chairman of the House Intelligence Committee wrote on Twitter.
He added: “Elect a corrupt man as president? You get a corrupt result.”
Trump is likely to issue more pardons before he exits the White House. Previous media reports have stated that Trump has discussed with advisers the possibility of pardoning members of his own family and personal attorney Rudy Giuliani.
Some of the standout pardons people took issue with on Tuesday included those of former Representative Duncan Hunter, a Californian Republican who was sentenced to 11 months in prison for the misuse of campaign funds in March, and George Papadopoulos and Alexander van der Zwaan, who were both convicted in special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.
John W. Dean, who served as White House counsel for the Nixon administration, said the president's pardons are indicative of three things: that “insiders arranged them,” that they are all political in nature, and that the “underlying conduct is mischaracterized [in most] every instance, particularly Mueller's prosecutions.”
“Undoubtedly, more will follow,” Dean wrote on Twitter.
Dean called Hunter's pardon “an injustice.”
“He was headed to 11 months in prison. His wife got 8 months [of home] confinement. They used his campaign funds to live the high life,” Dean wrote. “When discovered she confessed and cooperated. He denied. Lied. Blamed her. Now he gets a pass, she a smack!”
Nikole Hannah-Jones, a reporter covering racial justice for the New York Times and creator of the award-winning “1619 Project,” put her assessment of the pardons bluntly.
“Trump is spending his last few weeks in office executing poor people and pardoning rich people,” she wrote on Twitter.
The president's niece meanwhile, Mary L. Trump — who has written a book about her uncle and the rest of the family — said the pardons were “grotesque.”
“The corrupt, the criminal, murderers of children — that's who Donald lets off the hook,” she wrote on Twitter. “We can never forget and never forgive the unspeakable cruelty.”
But perhaps the pardons many found most egregious were those of Dustin Heard, Evan Liberty, Nicholas Slatten, and Paul Slough — former contractors at Blackwater Worldwide. The four men were convicted in 2014 for their role in a Baghdad massacre in 2007 that left more than a dozen Iraqi civilians dead.
Representative Seth Moulton, a former Marine, said the men pardoned by Trump are “convicted war criminals who brutally murdered civilians in Iraq.”
“They are disgraces to our country, and they belong in jail,” the Massachusetts Democrat wrote on Twitter.
Moulton, who is also a member of the House Armed Services Committee, added that when the contractors “slaughtered innocent people,” they by default put “a target on the back of every American on the ground at the time.”
“The same thing will happen because of this pardon, because it signals that the conventions that protect our service members and innocent civilians do not matter,” Moulton warned.
He concluded: “Thank God this man is on the way out. Decent people everywhere should speak up against this and show the world America's values are not whatever it is the president is displaying.”
Glenn Kirschner, a former federal prosecutor who served in the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia, said he considered the trials of Slough, Heard, Liberty, and Slatten — and “fighting for justice” for the 31 victims of the Baghdad attack — one of the “proudest accomplishments” of the office.
“Today, Trump killed justice,” Kirschner wrote on Twitter.

Texto completo: On Christmas Day 1991, Mikhail Gorbachev, president of the Soviet Union, gave his farewell speech and more than seven decades of Russian revolutionary socialism came to an end. A generation later, the spirit of the Soviet Union has re-emerged with mass support in the U.S.
When I arrived in Moscow in 1976 to begin a six-year stint as a correspondent, I was struck by the red flags flying from government buildings and the somber streets devoid of advertising except for garish posters showing workers with clenched fists demanding an end to the arms race.
When the Soviet Union fell, it seemed the Soviet attempt to impose a deluded version of reality had died with it. Francis Fukuyama, in his 1989 essay "The End of History," said that Marxism-Leninism was doomed as an alternative to liberal democracy. I argued at the time that the drive to make a religion out of politics had not disappeared.
For the past four years, potted histories have warned about the rise of fascism in the U.S. But the real danger is the transformation of "tolerance" into an ideology with its own courts, informers and punishments, all of them reminiscent of the Soviet Union.
One of the pillars of the Soviet Union was a controlled press in which all coverage was organized to confirm a mendacious ideology.
A friend of mine in Moscow, Vladimir Fyodorov, went to work for the TASS news service, which offered readers not news but a "correct" depiction of events, especially regarding the U.S. and the "ulcers of capitalism" -- racism, crime and unemployment.
On his first day at TASS, Vladimir was handed a United Press International story about a U.S. company that was promoting a high-quality tire and offered to replace older tires free of charge. Vladimir wanted to kill the story but his boss rewrote it. The new version read: "In the crafty capitalist market, firms frequently offer low-quality products. This is why a well-known American firm was forced to replace tires that were of inferior quality." The headline was "Deception of Buyer."
A few weeks later, Vladimir was given a report that prisons in Fiji were so comfortable that people preferred to stay there than to be at liberty. He produced a report that life in Fiji was so unbearable that people preferred to live in prison. His colleagues congratulated him. He told himself: "I'm going to go out of my mind here."
Soviet practices would have once been unthinkable in the U.S. media. But in August 2016, Jim Rutenberg, media columnist for the New York Times, wrote that if journalists believed that Mr. Trump was a "demagogue playing to the nation's worst racist and nationalist tendencies," it was necessary to "throw out the textbook of American journalism." The Times started to characterize Mr. Trump's statements as "lies" in news stories and suppress news that worked to Mr. Trump's advantage, such as the Hunter Biden story this fall.
The Times also advanced an ideological account of U.S. history, according to which the American Revolution was undertaken to defend slavery, and promoted it over the objections of historians and the paper's own fact-checkers.
The Soviet system also relied on the complete liquidation of academic freedom. Marxism-Leninism was treated as a perfect science. But the ideology raised obvious questions: In a "classless society," why were there special stores for officials? If socialism ended war, why did the Soviet Union and China go to war in 1969 over Damansky Island?
If a student tried to raise these questions, he was expelled from the Komsomol, the communist youth league. That ended any hope of a career. I knew a young man in Moscow who refused to be intimidated and continued to ask questions. He was committed to a mental hospital.
The Soviet style has become a reality in the U.S. Speakers are routinely canceled on ideological grounds: In July the College of the Atlantic in Bar Harbour, Maine, canceled a virtual talk with Leonard Leo of the Federalist Society because of "the moment of reckoning our society is going through." At my alma mater, the University of Chicago, the English department announced that it would "only accept applicants interested in working in and with Black Studies."
The Soviet Union finally counted on the readiness of people to betray even family and friends. The regime held up Pavel Morozov (1918-32) as a martyr. He lived in a village in the Urals when the regime was collectivizing agriculture. When Pavel learned that his father was helping peasants hide grain, he walked 35 miles to the nearest town to report him to the secret police. His father was arrested and Pavel was stabbed to death by relatives.
I thought of Pavel Morozov when I read a June op-ed in the New York Times by Chad Sanders, a black writer. He told his white friends that he didn't need their "love texts" and suggested that instead they cut off contact with family members until they sent money to Black Lives Matter or joined their protests.
When Mr. Gorbachev began the reforms that destroyed the Soviet Union, he said, referring to the U.S.: "We're going to do something terrible to you. We're going to deprive you of an enemy." Twenty-nine years later, it's clear he was right. Without the ideological challenge of the Soviet Union, we have become immersed in internal conflicts and have made an ideology out of them.
It is true that Marxism is a more coherent system of thought than "wokeism." But even an intellectual hodgepodge can engender totalitarian habits if it fulfills an emotional need and becomes a device of interpretation.
The antidote is fidelity to higher values. But that requires a moral seriousness that a world at peace and in thrall to superficialities does not inspire. "The West does not know and does not want to know what shaped it," writes Cardinal Robert Sarah, a Guinean prelate. "This self-asphyxiation leads to new barbaric civilizations."
The Soviet Union is dead, but its ghost wanders an unsettled world. Finding a lodestar for society's moral development is the most important challenge facing the U.S. today.

Texto completo: "This assault happened on Donald Trump's watch when he wasn't watching," President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. said.
WASHINGTON -- President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. accused President Trump on Tuesday of "irrational downplaying" of the widespread hack of the federal government and American industries, saying that the current administration was denying him intelligence and warning Russia that he would not allow the intrusion to "go unanswered" after he takes office.
"This assault happened on Donald Trump's watch when he wasn't watching," Mr. Biden said at a news conference in Delaware. "It is still his responsibility as president to defend American interests for the next four weeks, but rest assured that even if he does not take it seriously, I will."
The direct critique was a remarkable departure from tradition, in which incoming presidents are careful about not second-guessing the actions of the incumbent. But Mr. Trump's refusal to recognize Mr. Biden's election victory, and his effort to subvert the results, has clearly poisoned elements of the transition process.
In recent days, Mr. Biden's aides have come to realize that the scope of the cyberattack -- which landed the Russians inside the email system used by top Treasury officials and gave them access to the networks of the Energy, Commerce and Homeland Security Departments and dozens of American companies -- could pose a threat in the first days of the new administration.
Mr. Biden indirectly acknowledged as much when asked about his statement that he could not ensure that government systems could be trusted when he takes office.
"Of course I can't," he said. "I don't know what the state of them is. They're clearly not safe right now."
Privately, members of his staff have said that while they received briefings on the subject, they had been minimal. And the shutdown of recent cooperation between the transition team and the Defense Department has encompassed the National Security Agency and the United States Cyber Command, the quasi-civilian and military sides of the nation's foreign offensive and defensive operations.
"There's still so much we don't know, including the full scale of the breach or the extent of the damage it has caused," Mr. Biden said. He was alluding to the quiet internal warnings that Russia may have been able to place so-called back doors in government systems and, in the worst case, manipulate data or sabotage systems.
"It was carried out by using sophisticated cybertools, and the attacker succeeded in catching the federal government off guard and unprepared," Mr. Biden said.
Unlike Mr. Trump, the president-elect left no doubt that he believed Russia was responsible, noting that both Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Attorney General William P. Barr had said as much publicly, even if Mr. Trump would not. And Mr. Biden said once there was a formal determination of responsibility, a task that could take intelligence agencies weeks, "we will respond, and probably respond in kind."
That vow is likely to prove easier to issue from the stage in Delaware than it will be to execute from the Situation Room. Mr. Biden's first encounter with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia will be on another topic: The two men will have 16 days to negotiate an extension of up to five years of New Start, the nuclear arms control treaty that expires in early February.
That will force Mr. Biden to strike a deal to prevent one threat -- a nuclear arms race -- while simultaneously threatening retaliation on another.
Moreover, while the United States is awash in digital targets, Russia is a far less connected society, making an "in kind" response more difficult.
And it is hardly a state secret that the United States already spies on Russian systems and has turned off computers at the Internet Research Agency, the Kremlin-backed disinformation group that was involved in election interference in 2016. The New York Times reported last year that the United States had implanted malware into Russia's electric power grid as a warning to Moscow after the discovery that Russia had done the same to the American grid.
"Of course the U.S. intelligence community does these every day and twice on Sundays," said Dmitri Alperovitch, the chairman of the think tank Silverado Policy Accelerator and the former chief technology officer of the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, where he specialized in Russian cyberoperations.
"We have all used supply chain attacks, and we can't say it's OK for us and not for others." he said on "Deep State Radio," a podcast.
In fact, the Russians often cite such operations to argue that American outrage over espionage and even more extensive cyberattacks is manufactured.
Mr. Biden said that the United States should be "getting together with our allies to try to set up an international system that will constitute appropriate behavior in cyberspace" and "hold any other country liable for breaking out of those basic rules."
Those efforts are hardly new. President Barack Obama tried a basic agreement with President Xi Jinping of China late in his term, after the Chinese were caught removing 22.5 million security clearance files from the Office of Personnel Management, another hacking that went largely undetected for a year. The accord quickly fell apart after Mr. Obama left office.
A parallel effort inside the United Nations also quickly frayed. While another one is expected to issue a report in 2021, Russia and China have hijacked much of the debate to focus on limiting dissent on the internet and pressing for the "true identity" of everyone online, which would make it easier for them to detect dissidents.
But the more immediate problem for Mr. Biden may be finding and securing vulnerable elements of the software supply chain that Russia exploited when it bored into network management software made by SolarWinds, an Austin, Texas company, and corrupted its updates with malware. That is one of several ways Russia is believed to have entered such an array of agencies and corporations.
During the investigation into the Russian hacking, the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency released a report based on a two-year, still unfinished review of the risks to the United States of a supply chain attack.
The report concluded that supply chain risks "could have far-reaching and potentially devastating impacts," an understatement as the government feverishly digs through its systems for evidence of Russian compromise.

Texto completo: The podcast, which The Times now says did not meet its editorial standards, and a related report on ISIS had been named finalists in the 2019 international category.
The Pulitzer Prize Board said on Tuesday that it would no longer recognize the New York Times podcast "Caliphate" and a related article as a 2019 Pulitzer finalist. The board stripped The Times of its finalist status four days after the news organization announced that the 2018 audio series did not meet its standards for accuracy.
"Caliphate" and the related report, "The ISIS Files," by the podcast's co-host Rukmini Callimachi, had been named finalists in the Pulitzer Prize's international category last year. After an internal investigation that ended on Friday, The Times contacted the Pulitzer board and offered to give up the finalist citation.
"Upon review, the Pulitzer Prize Board has accepted The Times's action and rescinded its designation as a 2019 Pulitzer finalist," the Pulitzer board said in a statement on Tuesday.
A statement from The Times on Tuesday said, "Given our conclusion that core portions of 'Caliphate' did not live up to our editorial standards, we felt the right thing to do was to offer to return the Pulitzer finalist citation."
"Caliphate" won two journalism honors in 2019, an Overseas Press Club prize and a Peabody Award. On Friday, when The Times announced the results of its review, the Overseas Press Club rescinded its award, and the executive director of the Peabody Awards accepted The Times's offer to return the Peabody.
The Times's review found that "Caliphate," a 12-part audio documentary about the Islamic State, gave too much credence to the false or exaggerated account of one of its main subjects, Shehroze Chaudhry, a Canadian who claimed to have taken part in atrocities. The Times started examining the podcast after Mr. Chaudhry was arrested by Canadian authorities on Sept. 25 under a terrorism hoax law.
The Times appended an editors' note to "Caliphate" and added editors' notes describing problems with two articles by Ms. Callimachi in 2014 and 2019. ("The ISIS Files" does not have an editors' note attached to it.)
Every episode of "Caliphate" now begins with a correction read by Michael Barbaro, the host of the podcast "The Daily," who tells listeners that the chapters on Mr. Chaudhry "did not meet our standards for accuracy." A new installment, "An Examination of 'Caliphate,"' has also been added to the series. It includes an interview with Dean Baquet, the executive editor of The Times. In the interview, Mr. Baquet raised the possibility that Mr. Chaudhry had "duped" The Times, but said the news organization was at fault.
"Look, there was a well-known reporter involved in it -- Rukmini Callimachi," he said in the interview. "But this failing isn't about any one reporter. I think this was an institutional failing."
Mr. Baquet said last week that Ms. Callimachi would remain a reporter at The Times, but would no longer cover terrorism. She joined the paper in 2014 after winning journalism awards for her work as a foreign correspondent at The Associated Press.

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
CAMBRIDGE, England — On a recent evening, the 16 boys and 14 men of the Choir of King’s College, Cambridge, stood in the gothic chapel where they perform, spread out in the flickering candlelight.
A few of the choristers gazed at the vaulted ceiling about 80 feet above them. Then Daniel Hyde, the choir’s music director, signaled that he was ready to begin, and all slipped off the masks they had been wearing to sing “I Saw Three Ships,” a sprightly carol that will be heard by about 100 million people Thursday.
Each Christmas Eve, the choir’s “Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols” is broadcast live on radio stations worldwide, including about 450 in the United States. (A separate service, “Carols from King’s,” recorded weeks in advance, is shown on BBC television in Britain.)
In their rehearsal, the boys’ voices soared and echoed off the chapel’s walls. But moments later, Hyde brought the singers to an abrupt stop. “A bit lighter, a bit more flavor,” he said, and signaled for everyone to start again.
The choir is one of the world’s most famous, made up of boys age 9 to 13 who attend King’s College school in the city, along with adult students from the University of Cambridge.
In a typical year, the choir performs in religious services in the college chapel several times a week and tours worldwide. It has sung the Christmas Eve carol service every year since 1918, and the event has become a cherished holiday tradition.
The choir continued singing “I Saw Three Ships” for about 15 minutes, pausing now and again so Hyde could give feedback and fine-tune the sound. Although it seemed like an ordinary choir rehearsal, there was more at stake. Microphones in the chapel were ready to record everything in case a coronavirus outbreak — or another government lockdown, as has since been introduced in London and most of England’s southeast — stopped them from singing live on Christmas Eve.
Hyde reminded them of the evening’s importance several times. “We want people at home to be on the edge of their seats,” he said before one take.
“Let’s hope Grandma doesn’t fall off hers,” he added.
This year, because of the pandemic, the choir hasn’t performed in public since March, when the coronavirus stopped group singing almost entirely in Europe. Scientists warned that choristers risked spreading the disease via airborne droplets, even in small groups.
The safety of group singing has been in question ever since, especially after outbreaks were traced to choir practices worldwide.
“There was one point this summer when I thought singing wouldn’t be possible until there was a vaccine,” Hyde said in an interview after the rehearsal.
The picture improved this fall when scientists and governments issued guidelines advising how choirs could rehearse safely indoors. Most required singers to be spaced at least 6 feet apart, use large well-ventilated spaces and limit rehearsal times.
But such measures have not stopped coronavirus outbreaks. On Nov. 28, a member of the Danish National Concert Choir in Copenhagen tested positive for the coronavirus, and soon 44 other members followed. At the start of this month, 19 members of the Gothenburg Opera Chorus in Sweden tested positive after the ensemble met for two rehearsals.
Unlike in Denmark and Sweden, scientists in the United States have also recommend that choristers wear masks.
Hyde said the first step toward bringing the King’s College choir back together had been to rehearse via Zoom. That was “tedious,” he said: Time delays on the video platform meant being able to listen to only one singer at a time.
In June, some of the choir’s younger members returned to in-person rehearsals when their school reopened, but they had to wear visors as a safety precaution.
“It was so difficult,” said one of them, Rufus Balch, 10. “The sound was just bouncing off the visor back into you,” he added. “You thought you were really loud, but you weren’t!”
The full choir of adults and boys came together again for the first time in October, and since then has been rehearsing five times a week in the empty chapel, with a host of new rules.
The singers arrive at rehearsals at different times to limit mixing, and the two groups stand at least 6 feet apart when singing. The public has not been allowed into the chapel, so the choir has effectively stopped performing its religious role. Instead it has worked, then worked some more, toward the Christmas Eve service.
In interviews, six choir members said the hardest thing about the new rules was the social distancing, which meant they heard one another a fraction of a second later than usual in the chapel’s famously resonant acoustic. “It very much feels like you’re singing a solo a lot of the time, which is slightly daunting,” said Jacob Partington, 21.
“You just have to keep telling yourself we are incredibly lucky to be doing this at all,” added Owen Elsley, 27.
Extra measures were taken to keep the adult members safe from the virus, Elsley added. They took weekly coronavirus tests, and nine of the 14 moved into a large house together to lessen contacts with others.
“There is always that niggling little thought in the back of your mind that if one person goes down, then all of us go down,” Elsley said. “But nothing’s happened yet.”
Four days after the interview, though, on Dec. 8, two members of the house tested positive for coronavirus, and all of the men were pulled from a recording of the carol service for BBC television. The King’s Singers, a vocal ensemble formed by former members of the choir, was called up as a replacement.
That meant Elsley’s only hope of performing this winter would be the Christmas Eve live broadcast — if that went ahead.
At the early December recording, everyone was hopeful about getting to perform. About 40 minutes into the session, the choir turned to “In Dulci Jubilo,” in a version that mixed English and Latin verse.
Hyde shushed the choristers, and a red light came on to show that the microphones were recording. The choir launched into the lilting carol, which sounded bright and joyful, but to Hyde’s ears there were problems. After he gave instructions to correct a few phrases, they tried another time.
When the last chord ended, the singers’ voices reverberated beautifully around the chapel: a perfect Christmas sound, with no audience to hear it.
“Good,” Hyde said. “Let’s take a break.”
Later, he said he thought the recording had been successful, but he hoped it would never be heard, because the choir would perform live on Christmas Eve instead. “Let’s hope we can just keep it in a drawer,” he said.
He didn’t get his wish. On Dec. 18, with coronavirus cases soaring in Britain and rumors circulating that a new lockdown was imminent, the choir canceled the live broadcast. It decided it just couldn’t risk going ahead and contributing to the growth of the pandemic.
This year, listeners around the world on Christmas Eve will hear the December recording instead. Hyde said in a telephone interview after the decision that he had heard the recording and he was sure it would keep listeners on the edge of their seats.
“I feel lucky we had the foresight to make it,” he said. “Given the year we’ve all had, I hope people will feel a special connection.”

Texto completo: Welcome to the latest in my occasional series of conversations about Christianity. Here’s my interview with the Rev. Jim Wallis, an evangelical Christian pastor, author and justice activist.
KRISTOF: Merry Christmas, Jim! You’re an evangelical Christian, but a progressive one. So how, literally, do you take Christmas? Do you believe that Jesus was born to a virgin in Bethlehem?
WALLIS: How I “take Christmas” is defined in the famous prayer by the mother of Jesus — Mary’s Magnificat: “He has brought down the powerful from their thrones, and lifted up the lowly; he has filled the hungry with good things, and sent the rich away empty.” Meaning: The coming of Jesus is intended to turn things upside down. The power of the Bethlehem narrative includes the inn having no room for Mary and Joseph, and the lowly shepherds being the first witnesses of the new baby as hope for the world born in a manger with his homeless parents. This is not the conquering messiah many were hoping for, but one from the bottom of society in a time of political unrest and massive inequality — sort of like now.
KRISTOF: What is it with the modern evangelical movement? Historically, evangelicals were people like William Wilberforce, fighting to abolish slavery. More recently, they included Jimmy Carter. But these days the big cause of many evangelicals has been a philandering politician who rips children from parents at the border.
WALLIS: The word “evangel” comes from Jesus’ opening pledge to bring “good news” to the poor and let the oppressed go free. Trump evangelicals have turned Jesus’ message upside down. That’s called heresy. And, in the United States, this has created a toxic melding between white evangelicals and the Republican Party. We’ve seen the conversion of too many white evangelicals to the narcissistic and nationalistic cult of Trump, where the operative word in the phrase “white evangelical” is not “evangelical” but “white.”
KRISTOF: I struggle with this. I’ve seen conservative evangelicals do heroic work, including Chuck Colson’s work in prisons, and George W. Bush’s leadership in fighting AIDS in Africa that saved 20 million lives. But some of the grossest immorality of my life came when evangelicals like Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson smirked at AIDS and resisted tackling the disease because it was killing gay people. How do we understand a faith that can produce so much good and so much evil?
WALLIS: The religious right leaders you name hijacked the word “evangelical.” Result: White evangelicalism has destroyed the “evangel.” When “evangelical” strays from the radical love of Jesus into hateful partisan faith, we see the worst.
KRISTOF: Do you think about abandoning the term “evangelical” because it has too much baggage?
WALLIS: I understand why so many have moved to “post-evangelical” or “adjacent evangelical” as the old term has become so tainted by right-wing politics and hypocrisy. Many of us call ourselves “followers of Jesus” who want to return to the original definition of a gospel that is good news to the poor. And we believe that any gospel that isn’t good news for the poor is simply not the gospel of Jesus Christ. Period.
KRISTOF: We’ve been denouncing religious intolerance, but I’m afraid many of us liberals have a problem with irreligious intolerance. A Black sociologist, George Yancey, once told me: “Outside of academia, I faced more problems as a Black. But inside academia, I face more problems as a Christian, and it’s not even close.” Do liberals have a blind spot about faith?
WALLIS: I have been fighting “religious fundamentalists” my whole life. But are there also “secular fundamentalists”? I would say yes, and they can be as irrational, ideological and intolerant as the religious ones.
KRISTOF: You founded a magazine and movement, Sojourners, that argues that Christians should push much harder for racial justice. I’m curious: Do you consider Jesus to have been a person of color?
WALLIS: Of course, he was a person of color given where and when he was born. Blue-eyed white Jesuses exist only in American churches. And issues like voting rights, suppression and intimidation, or racialized policing, are not just political but are a direct assault on “imago dei,” the created image of God in each of us that the Christ child reminds us of again.
KRISTOF: But if faith drives your work on behalf of the poor, why does the same Scripture seem to lead others to cut funds for the homeless?
WALLIS: Because they aren’t reading those Scriptures with over 2,000 verses in the Bible about the poor and oppressed! Those white evangelicals have cut all those texts out, and their Bible is full of holes.
KRISTOF: For many evangelicals, the paramount political issue is abortion, which Jesus never directly mentions. What’s your take?
WALLIS: Abortion is used by the political right as a distraction from all the other issues that would entail a consistent ethic wherever human life and dignity are affected. Everyone in the “pro-life” and “pro-choice” polarizations should want to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies and abortions — and there are clear policies to do that, especially in support of low-income women.
KRISTOF: A final question, which I’ve asked others in this Q. and A. series. I consider myself a Christian, for I admire Jesus’ teachings, but I doubt the virgin birth, Resurrection and other miracles, and it does seem complicated to be a Christian who questions the Resurrection. So: Am I a Christian?
WALLIS: That’s not for me but for you to answer. Following Jesus is the core of being a disciple of Jesus, which also implies a personal relationship with Jesus, who was not merely a former Galilean boy scout. Some have said that the opposite of faith isn’t doubt but certainty. And I would say that faith can lead either to deeper reflection or easy certainty; I prefer the former. Our limited human comprehension of the world’s greatest mysteries is less important to me than what can transform our lives and the world. One of my mentors, Desmond Tutu, needed a real resurrection to sustain him in the South African struggle, and I do today as we struggle for a genuine real multiracial democracy based on what Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and John Lewis called us to: a beloved community.
