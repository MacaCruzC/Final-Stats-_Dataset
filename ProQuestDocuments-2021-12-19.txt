Texto completo: After binging on episodes of Grey's Anatomy, many fans of the show think they can successfully duplicate the medical procedures that the doctors perform on the show.
For one Maine teenager, that came true.
What started out as a routine morning for Kristen Iarrobino and her 16-year-old son, Cyrus, turned into an almost catastrophic event.
Kristen fell outside of her home in Glenburn, just north of Bangor, after slipping on some ice that she mistook for rain.
The fall caused the coffee cup in her hand to break, cutting her wrist in the process. "When I looked down at my hand, I immediately told him to call 911," Kristen told CNN. "There wasn't a moment that I thought we could drive to the hospital. I knew we needed an ambulance."
That's when Cyrus quickly called 911 and jumped into action to help his mom.
"I was in fight or flight mode," Cyrus told CNN. He kept checking on the wound as Kristen held her sweatshirt against it to apply pressure while answering questions with the dispatcher.
The dispatcher then instructed Cyrus to find things around the house to form a makeshift tourniquet.
On the first attempt, he used a string from their junk drawer that broke, which worried them both. But Cyrus kept looking around for items.
"I'm there on my knees looking for anything to use and I rip off the laces on my new shoes," Cyrus explained. "I didn't take a second to untie them or anything."
On the side of the house, he found a small piece of plywood and began making the tourniquet. He made a knot with the shoelaces on her arm, put the stick on the knot and began twisting.
"It was one of the most painful things I've ever felt, and I've broken bones and had children," Kristen told CNN.
"Between the fight or flight mode and the adrenaline, I just kept thinking 'Don't stop, don't think about it,'" Cyrus said. "The whole time we were trying to keep each other calm," Kristen added.
Shortly after, the ambulance arrived to take over and they speedily rushed to Eastern Maine Medical Center.
Kristen told CNN that a tourniquet was on her arm for a total of 40 minutes, between the homemade one and the hospital one.
Her wrist and arm suffered from severed arteries and nerves which led to two surgeries, lasting about seven hours total. "The hand surgeon said I was a quarter of an inch going through my entire wrist," Kristen said.
The wound is about two inches wide on her wrist and goes down another two inches on her forearm. Luckily the stitches are now out, but she has a long road to recovery with therapy.
Kristen explained how grateful she is for the EMS and the hospital staff, but especially for Cyrus for being there and jumping to help.
"It was one of those things where you may see a procedure done on TV and you're like 'Oh yeah whatever,' but then you see it in real life or it happens to you and it's a completely different thing," Kristen noted.

Restaurants began the year in darkness. Dining rooms in New York had been closed, again, by order of the governor. Is it any wonder that some of my strongest memories of the year in eating are takeout and delivery dishes? Or that, once restaurants were allowed to serve indoors again in February, the things that tasted best tended to be enduring classics like chicken soup from Eastern Europe and egg rolls from the streets of Saigon? Here are the 10 dishes — in no particular order — that dance in my vision when I close my eyes, all of them taken from establishments in the city that for one reason or another did not make my list of the year’s best new restaurants.
Estelle’s Chicken Soup at Mark’s Off Madison
Estelle was the grandmother of the chef, Mark Strausman, and this was her soup. It got my attention not because I’d never had anything like it before — it’s the classic once found at every diner and deli, and still pretty common in New York — but because it is rarely made so well these days. Broth this full-bodied takes more chicken and more time than most people are ready to spend ($13).
41 Madison Avenue (East 26th Street), Flatiron district; 646-838-8300; marksoffmadison.com
Egusi at Nneji
As found nearly every day at the steam table in this bright and welcoming shop in Astoria, Queens, roughly crushed egusi seeds provide the nutty and crunchy substance of this West African stew, cradling spinach and red peppers cooked just long enough to be tender. The palm oil that gives the stew a brilliant flame-orange color also makes it smooth, rich and luxurious ($8).
32-20 34th Avenue (33rd Street), Astoria, Queens; 917-832-7338; nneji.business.site
Lahmacun at Burchak Pide
It’s almost laughably basic, this circle of dough, about as thick as a linen napkin, spread with spiced lamb and baked. So is the salad that comes with it — lettuce, tomatoes and white onions under a purplish shower of sumac. Somehow, though, when you scatter the salad over the lamb, squeeze lemon on everything and roll it up, the long cigar of meat and vegetables evokes all of Turkish cuisine at once ($5).
1614 Sheepshead Bay Road (Jerome Avenue), Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn; 315-207-7080; burchakpide.com
Spicy Chicken at Pecking House
To lockdown-era New Yorkers who were struggling to keep their heads above water, having a bag of Eric Huang’s Southern-fried, Sichuan-seasoned chicken brought to the doorstep was like having somebody throw you a life preserver that you could eat. The chicken is still available for delivery, but it’s also sold on the weekends at the Huang family’s restaurant in Queens ($35 for three pieces with three sides).
185-23 Union Turnpike (186th Street), Fresh Meadows, Queens; peckinghouse.com
Dad’s Egg Rolls at Falansai
Ground pork and wood-ear mushrooms fill these Vietnamese egg rolls. And you’ll be convinced those ingredients make one of the world’s greatest marriages for as long as it takes you to finish one — less than two minutes, if you’re anything like me. Dad is the chef’s father, and he used to make them on the streets of Saigon ($12).
112 Harrison Place (Porter Avenue), Bushwick, Brooklyn; 718-381-0980; falansai.com
English Muffin Kits From Seabird Bakery
Shuna Lydon, a pastry chef in pandemic exile from restaurants, bakes a variety of sweet and savory treats for home delivery. Her lineup changes weekly with one exception: the EMK, or English muffin kit, is a constant. It deserves to be. The muffins are small but substantial, more chewy than crumbly; if you’ve had only mass-produced muffins, the deep flavor Lydon builds in her sourdough is almost shocking. Each kit comes with four muffins, salted butter and, the real treasure, a small jar of fresh jam, just barely cooked to keep the fruit tasting bright and juicy ($15).
seabirdbakery.com
Mixiotes at Under the Volcano
In a perfect New York, Under the Volcano would cook its lamb mixiotes underground, in a fire pit. In actuality, the lamb is cooked in an oven, but some of the missing smoke is supplied by a shot of mezcal added to the spices and garlic — not enough to get you drunk, but enough to set your senses reeling ($14).
12 East 36th Street (Madison Avenue), Midtown; 646-448-4442; utvnyc.com
Fish and Chips at Dame
There are technical explanations for the weightless, shattering shell on the fish and the more heavy-duty crunch on the chips at Dame, having to do with air pockets and boiling points. And if you want to talk about that science with a plate in front of you, go right ahead. The fish, for once, won’t get soggy, though if you don’t shut up and eat, it will eventually get cold ($29).
87 Macdougal Street (Bleecker Street), Greenwich Village; 929-367-7370; damenewyork.com
Remember the Maine at Sunken Harbor Club
The virtue of the manhattan is its simplicity; even a distracted bartender can knock together a decent one. The downside is that it is generally lacks polish, like a rough draft. An old variation called Remember the Maine, resurrected by Sunken Harbor Club, is both more velvety (thanks to cherry liqueur) and more spiky (absinthe). It has the combination of elegance and raw power that enables our most heroic cocktails to set a drifting world spinning on its axis again ($16).
372 Fulton Street (Smith Street), Downtown Brooklyn; 347-689-3677; gageandtollner.com
Aguachile Negro at Mariscos El Submarino
Aguachile is a raw-seafood cocktail straight out of Sinaloa. Most often it bathes raw shrimp in a red or green liquid that tastes fresh and vegetal, like something you might get from your local juice bar if it was trying to use up some extra serrano and Fresno chiles. The addition of soy sauce makes Mariscos El Submarino’s aguachile negro taste brawnier, almost meaty, while the chiles make it one of the most head-clearingly spicy bowls of raw shrimp in the city ($19).

Supreme Court Allows Vaccine Mandate for New York Health Care Workers

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Monday refused to block New York’s requirement that health care workers be vaccinated against the coronavirus even when they cite religious objections.
As is often the court’s practice in rulings on emergency applications, its unsigned order included no reasoning. But Justice Neil Gorsuch filed a 14-page dissent saying that the majority had betrayed the court’s commitment to religious liberty.
Justice Samuel Alito joined Gorsuch’s dissent. Justice Clarence Thomas also said he would have blocked the vaccine requirement, but he gave no reasons.
The Supreme Court in October refused to provide relief to health care workers in Maine who had made an essentially identical request in a challenge to a similar state requirement, over the dissents of the same three justices.
The court has also rejected challenges to vaccination requirements at Indiana University, for personnel in New York City’s school system and for workers at a Massachusetts hospital. The court also rejected a challenge to a federal mandate requiring masks for air travel.
All those rulings were issued by just one justice, which can be a sign that the legal questions involved were not considered substantial. But those one-justice rulings did not involve religion.
Cases challenging President Joe Biden’s vaccine mandates affecting the private sector may soon reach the court, too. Challenges to the mandates — for federal contractors, health care workers and companies with more than 100 employees — are pending in lower courts.
In his dissent Monday in the case from New York, Gorsuch wrote that the practical consequences of the court’s decision would be grave.
“Thousands of New York health care workers face the loss of their jobs and eligibility for unemployment benefits,” he wrote.
“These applicants are not ‘anti-vaxxers’ who object to all vaccines,” Gorsuch added. “Instead, the applicants explain, they cannot receive a COVID-19 vaccine because their religion teaches them to oppose abortion in any form, and because each of the currently available vaccines has depended upon abortion-derived fetal cell lines in its production or testing.
“The Free Exercise Clause protects not only the right to hold unpopular religious beliefs inwardly and secretly,” he wrote. “It protects the right to live out those beliefs publicly.”
The ruling came in a pair of challenges brought by doctors, nurses and other health care workers who said the requirement violated their right to the free exercise of religion. They argued that the availability of a medical exemption meant that the state was discriminating against religious practice, citing decisions of the Supreme Court striking down limits on religious gatherings that the justices in the majority said were more restrictive than ones imposed on secular gatherings.
A federal judge in Brooklyn, New York, ruled against the challengers in the case before him, but another federal judge, in Utica, New York, ruled for the challengers in a second case.
In a consolidated appeal in the two cases, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in New York, refused to block the requirement.
“Faced with an especially contagious variant of the virus in the midst of a pandemic that has now claimed the lives of over 750,000 in the United States and some 55,000 in New York, the state decided as an emergency measure to require vaccination for all employees at health care facilities who might become infected and expose others to the virus, to the extent they can be safely vaccinated,” a unanimous three-judge panel of the appeals court wrote in an unsigned opinion. “This was a reasonable exercise of the State’s power to enact rules to protect the public health.”
In an emergency application asking the Supreme Court to intercede, the health care workers’ lawyers wrote that the requirement “imposes an unconscionable choice on New York health care workers: abandon their faith or lose their careers and their best means to provide for their families.”
Barbara D. Underwood, New York’s solicitor general, responded that the state does not allow a religious exemption for its long-standing requirements for measles and rubella. The medical exemption for vaccination requirement, she added, “is tightly constrained in both scope and duration,” making very few people eligible for it.
As a general matter, she wrote, “achieving high vaccination rates in particularly vulnerable settings is of the utmost importance.”
In his dissent, Gorsuch wrote protecting religious freedom warranted a different approach.
“Today, we do not just fail the applicants,” he wrote. “We fail ourselves.
“We allow the state to insist on the dismissal of thousands of medical workers — the very same individuals New York has depended on and praised for their service on the pandemic’s front lines over the last 21 months,” Gorsuch wrote. “To add insult to injury, we allow the state to deny these individuals unemployment benefits too. One can only hope today’s ruling will not be the final chapter in this grim story.”
Gorsuch invoked similar reasoning in the Maine case.
“Where many other states have adopted religious exemptions, Maine has charted a different course,” Gorsuch wrote at the time. “There, health care workers who have served on the front line of a pandemic for the last 18 months are now being fired and their practices shuttered. All for adhering to their constitutionally protected religious beliefs. Their plight is worthy of our attention.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Texto completo: The National Guard has been asked to help staff hospitals in at least four states as another virus surge is overstretching healthcare systems and straining overtaxed workers.
On Thursday, the largest hospital network in Indiana announced that it had asked the Guard for assistance for most of its hospitals. Hospitalizations in the state have increased 49 percent over the past two weeks, according to data from The New York Times.
Six-person teams with both medical support and non-clinical members will deploy to Indiana University Health across the state in two-week increments. All Guard members are fully vaccinated, the statement said.
“The demand and strain on IU Health’s team members, nurses and providers has never been greater,” the hospital system said in a statement.
New Hampshire and Maine took similar measures on Wednesday.
In New Hampshire, 70 National Guard members will be deployed the next few weeks to help hospitals with nonmedical functions like food service and clerical work. On top of that, Gov. Chris Sununu said at a news conference, the Federal Emergency Management Agency was dispatching a team of 24 people to assist the hardest-hit facilities.
More than 55,000 coronavirus patients are hospitalized nationwide, far fewer than in September, but an increase of more than 20 percent over the past two weeks, according to a New York Times database.
The United States is averaging over 121,300 cases a day, an increase of about 27 percent from two weeks ago. Reported deaths are up 12 percent, to an average of about 1,275 per day.
Last week, New York State also turned to National Guard troops to reinforce overburdened nursing homes. Gov. Kathy Hochul issued “a pre-emptive strike,” ordering that roughly 30 hospitals nearing their capacity stop performing elective surgeries.
Hospitalizations in the state remained much lower than the highs of last winter or spring. The new restrictions will mostly impact hospitals upstate.
“We continue to see an uptick in hospitalizations,” Ms. Hochul said at a news conference on Thursday. “This is what keeps me up at night.”
Gov. Charlie Baker of Massachusetts signaled that he could take similar measures on Thursday.
Kentucky has yet to enlist the National Guard, but long-term staff shortages plague health care facilities there.
On Thursday, Gov. Andy Beshear declared that the state’s chronic nursing shortage was an emergency, with shortages of up to 20 percent. Mr. Beshear said he would sign an executive order aimed at boosting enrollment in training programs for nurses.
Even states that rank among the highest in vaccination rates are struggling, like Maine, where about 73 percent of the population is fully vaccinated, behind only Vermont and Rhode Island, according to a New York Times database. Cases in Maine recently reached their pandemic peak.
Gov. Janet Mills of Maine activated as many as 75 state Guard members to help hospitals there. She said they would support nursing facilities and administer monoclonal antibodies, which help prevent serious illness.
Maine Medical Center, the state’s largest hospital, said in a statement on Wednesday that there had been times this week “when there were no critical care beds available,” forcing hospital leaders to postpone surgeries.
“We are caring for an unprecedented number of patients,” the hospital said.
Officials are bracing for the Omicron variant, but the Delta variant remains the more imminent threat. Health care workers staff shortages brought on by burnout, illnesses and resistance to vaccine mandates have made the situation even more dire.
In Missouri, where 52 percent of the population is fully vaccinated, hospitalizations are up 43 percent in the past two weeks, data shows. More than 1,680 people were hospitalized with Covid as of Wednesday, compared with about 980 on Nov. 8.

WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Wednesday seemed ready to take another step in requiring states to pay for religious education, with a majority of the justices indicating that they would not allow Maine to exclude religious schools from a state tuition program.
The court has said that states may choose to provide aid to religious schools along with other private schools. The question in the new case was the opposite: Can states refuse to provide such aid if it is made available to other private schools?
Maine requires rural communities without public secondary schools to arrange for their young residents’ educations in one of two ways. They can sign contracts with nearby public schools, or they can pay tuition at a private school chosen by parents so long as it is, in the words of state law, “a nonsectarian school in accordance with the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.”
Two families in Maine that send or want to send their children to religious schools challenged the law, saying it violated their right to freely exercise their faith.
Religious people and groups have been on a winning streak at the Supreme Court, which seemed likely to continue in the new case. In recent decisions, the justices have ruled against restrictions on attendance at religious gatherings to address the coronavirus pandemic and Philadelphia’s attempt to bar a Catholic agency that refused to work with same-sex couples from screening potential foster parents.
The court also ruled that the Trump administration could allow employers with religious objections to deny contraception coverage to female workers and that employment discrimination laws do not apply to many teachers at religious schools.
The point of Maine’s law, said Christopher C. Taub, a lawyer for the state, was to provide something resembling a public school education to young people in remote areas. “That is the benefit at issue here: a free public education,” he said. “That private schools are sometimes enlisted to deliver the benefit is of no constitutional significance.”
Justice Elena Kagan said Maine’s program sought to solve a distinct problem.
“This is really a default program for a very small number of students living in isolated areas where the state has decided it does not have the resources to provide public schools,” she said.
Justice Samuel Alito asked whether the program allowed parents to use state money for tuition at elite private boarding schools in other states but not at local religious ones.
Taub said yes. “An Andover or a Phillips Exeter may be different from Bangor Public High School in many different ways,” he said. “But what they share in common is the most important feature, which is that they are not inculcating religion.”
The case, Carson v. Makin, No. 20-1088, was broadly similar to one from Montana decided by the court last year. In that case, the court ruled that states must allow religious schools to participate in programs that provide scholarships to students attending private schools.
Chief Justice John Roberts, writing for the majority in that case, Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue, said a provision of the state's Constitution banning aid to schools run by churches ran afoul of the federal Constitution’s protection of the free exercise of religion by discriminating against religious people and schools.
“A state need not subsidize private education,” he wrote. “But once a state decides to do so, it cannot disqualify some private schools solely because they are religious.”
But the Montana decision turned on the schools’ religious status rather than their curricula. There might be a difference, Roberts wrote last year, between an institution’s religious identity and its conduct.
“We acknowledge the point,” he wrote, “but need not examine it here.” The Maine case will turn on the point.
Roberts and other conservative justices made clear Wednesday that they thought the distinction drawn in the Montana case, between religious status and religious activity, made no constitutional difference.
The chief justice asked, for instance, whether the state would pay for tuition at a religious school whose doctrine calls for public service and that “does look just like a public school, but it’s owned by religion.” Taub said yes.
What about a religious school that “is infused in every subject with their view of the faith?” the chief justice asked. Taub said such a school would not qualify.
Roberts said that was an important concession. “So you’re discriminating among religions based on their belief, right?” he asked, adding that the government may not “draw distinctions between religions based on their doctrine.”
Michael Bindas, a lawyer with the Institute for Justice, a libertarian group that represents the families, said that “religious discrimination is religious discrimination.”
“Religious schools, after all, teach religion, just as a soccer team plays soccer or a book club reads books,” he said. “Yes, it is part of what they do. It is also part of who they are.”
One of the schools at issue in the case, Temple Academy in Waterville, Maine, says it expects its teachers “to integrate biblical principles with their teaching in every subject” and teaches students “to spread the word of Christianity.” The other, Bangor Christian School, says it seeks to develop “within each student a Christian worldview and Christian philosophy of life.”
The two schools “candidly admit that they discriminate against homosexuals, individuals who are transgender and non-Christians,” Maine’s Supreme Court brief said.
Kagan said that point was not in dispute. “These schools are overtly discriminatory,” she said. “They’re proudly discriminatory. Other people won’t understand why in the world their taxpayer dollars are going to discriminatory schools.”
Justice Neil Gorsuch said that Maine’s anti-discrimination laws were not at issue in the case.
Much of the argument was devoted to hypothetical questions. Taub volunteered that schools that taught Marxism, Leninism or white supremacy “would be doing something completely inconsistent with a public education,” though he conceded that the state law at issue in the case does not currently forbid that.
“Would you say the same thing about a school that teaches critical race theory?” Alito asked.
Taub said that he did not “know exactly what it means to teach critical race theory” and that “the Maine Legislature would have to look at what that actually means.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Texto completo: Hundreds of protestors demonstrated at Boise State University in Idaho over the weekend following comments made at a conference by a professor who said men should be prioritized for fields of study such as engineering, medicine and law.
BSU political science professor Scott Yenor made disparaging remarks about women and spoke critically of feminism at the National Conservatism Conference in Orlando, Florida, on October 31 in a speech titled "The Family Form that Nations Need."
"Every effort made must be made not to recruit women into engineering, but rather to recruit and demand more of men who become engineers," Yenor said. "Ditto for med school, and the law, and every trade."
CNN has reached out to Yenor for comment but has not heard back.
In response to the attention the video received recently on social media, Yenor said on Twitter that "making special efforts to recruit women into fields where they don't seem to want to be" should be stopped, and he denied wanting to prevent women from obtaining those professions.
He also posted a video in which he said the country should "elevate the importance of family life for both men and women in America."
Boise State issued a statement saying it doesn't endorse Yenor's comments yet "cannot infringe" on his ability to make them.
"Boise State University understands that the open exchange of ideas, which is fundamental to education, can introduce uncomfortable and even offensive ideas," the statement said. "However, the university cannot infringe upon the First Amendment rights of anyone in our community, regardless of whether we, as individual leaders, agree or disagree with the message. No single faculty member defines what Boise State -- or any public university -- endorses or stands for."
Idaho state representative Brooke Green told CNN that Yenor's beliefs are "not only outdated, but completely sexist and reflect a society that no longer exists."
Green helped organize the event Saturday at the university to counter Yenor's remarks, and said there were about 500 men and women in attendance.
"Many young women at the university are worried their futures are in the hands of a tenured professor who believes they do not deserve to be there and occupy a seat that belongs to a man," Green said.
"Women shouldn't have to spend time today defending our value in society or rights as human beings however, women wanted to gather to send a message saying we will continue to occupy professional spaces, whether it's a boardroom, courtroom, or leadership role within our community," she said.
Boise State is the largest university in Idaho with nearly 20,000 students.

Texto completo: The Supreme Court expressed deep skepticism Wednesday of a Maine school tuition assistance program that allows parents to use vouchers to send their children to attend public and private schools but excludes religious schools from the program.
Conservative justices such as Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh suggested that if a state makes the choice to provide a public benefit, it can't exclude schools based on the fact that they teach the curriculum through the lens of faith.
"All they are asking for is equal treatment," Kavanaugh said at one point, referring to the parents who want to use the funds for sectarian schools. "They're saying don't treat me worse because I want to send my children to a religious school rather than a secular school. Treat me the same as the secular parent next door."
Chief Justice John Roberts expressed concerns about the process Maine would go through in order to decide whether schools with a religious identity are going too far in "infusing their subjects with religion." It was a sentiment shared by Justice Amy Coney Barrett. Gorsuch said that the court has made clear that "you don't have to choose between receiving a public benefit and your faith."
The case marks the court's latest step to expand religious freedom, a trend bolstered by the addition of three of former President Donald Trump's nominees and favored by Justice Samuel Alito, who claimed in a 2020 speech that "in certain quarters" religious liberty is "fast becoming a disfavored right."
In Maine, parents living in some rural areas without a a local public school receive vouchers so that they can send their kids to public or private schools in other areas. The aim of the program, the state says, is to give students an education that is roughly equivalent to what they would have had if there had been a public school in their area.
To participate in the program, a private school must meet the requirements of Maine's compulsory education law. The school district must pay tuition, up to a statutory limit, "at the public school or the approved private school of the parent's choice" and the school must be "nonsectarian."
A school's affiliation with a religious institution does not, on its own, render a school ineligible. Instead, the state looks at the sectarian nature of the instruction and whether it "promotes the faith or belief system with which it is associated."
On Wednesday, a lawyer for two sets of parents argued that the program infringes upon their rights because it bars them from using the funds to send their children to the religious school of their choosing.
To make their case, the parents point to past precedent such as a dispute from 2017 where the court determined that a state could not restrict funds for resurfacing playgrounds from a church-owned preschool based solely on its religious identity. In June 2020, the court held that a state could not exclude families and schools from participating in a student aid program because of a school's religious status. Last term, the justices also ruled in favor of houses of worship in a series of emergency applications challenging Covid-19 restrictions.
Maine argues that the nonsectarian provision is necessary to ensure that public money is not funding religious education. While some religiously affiliated schools are allowed, the state draws the line if the educational material is presented through the lens of faith.
Religious organizations "that are willing to provide education comparable to a public education" are eligible to receive the public funds, Christopher Taub, Maine's chief deputy attorney general, wrote in court papers, but the state declines to fund schools that offer "an education designed to proselytize and inculcate children with a particular faith."
The Biden administration supports Maine in the dispute.
Lawyers for the parents say they are being unlawfully excluded because their children attend or wish to attend a sectarian school.
David and Amy Carson send their children to Bangor Christian, a school they say they selected because of its academic rigor and the fact it aligns with their religious beliefs. They seek to use the state funds to help pay the tuition. According to the court record, the school has a mission to instill a "Biblical world view" and it will not hire teachers who are LGBTQ.
Troy and Angela Nelson seek to send their child to Temple Academy, a religiously affiliated school but would need the tuition assistance to do so. The school, located in Waterville, Maine, expects its teachers, according to court papers, "to integrate Biblical principles with their teaching in every subject."
"Maine's sectarian exclusion discriminates against families who are eligible for the tuition assistance program and believe that a religious education is the best option for their child," Michael E. Bindas, a lawyer for the Institute of Justice who is representing the parents, said in legal briefs. In court, he said the program amounts to discrimination "based on religion."
The three liberal justices, led by Justice Stephen Breyer, expressed sympathy with Maine's goal to bar the parents from using the funds for religious schools in order to keep government money from getting entangled with religious beliefs.
"Beware," Breyer exclaimed at one point, if the government gets "too involved" in religion.
Breyer noted pointedly that some religious schools won't hire LGBTQ teachers and he said that if public money flows into some schools they are going to find themselves in "all kinds" of disputes.
"I see a big push, with our 60 or 70 religions, towards keeping the state out of it," he said.
Justice Elena Kagan said that the state "generally doesn't have to subsidize the exercise of a right" and she said that the courts have always recognized a "play in the joints" between the Constitution's Establishment Clause that bars government support of religion and its mandate allowing the free exercise of religion.
"Not everybody has to follow the same model," she said, "and there is some amount of funding which is neither prohibited by the First Amendment nor commanded by the First Amendment."
In the past, courts have drawn a distinction at times between a religious organization's "status" or identity and how the schools will actually "use" the funds. A federal appeals court used that reasoning to uphold Maine's program.
The 1st US Circuit Court of Appeals said that Maine's program does not "bar schools from receiving funding simply based on their religious identity," but, instead, bars the funds based on the "religious use" that the school would make of the funds.
Eric Rassbach, vice president at the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty who filed a brief in support of the parents, said the so called "status/use" distinction is meaningless in the context of religious schools.
"The court should reject the idea that to participate in a public benefits program, religious schools have to stop exercising their religion," Rassbach told CNN.
While the court has in recent years trended to side with plaintiffs making religious liberty arguments, Alito has said the justices aren't moving quickly enough.
In June, Alito wrote a furious opinion joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch when he said that the court had not gone far enough in ruling in favor of a Catholic foster care agency that refused to work with same-sex couples as potential parents because the agency believes that marriage should be between a man and a woman.
Alito complained that his colleagues -- while ruling unanimously in favor of the agency -- had "emitted a wisp of a decision that leaves religious liberty in a confused and vulnerable state."
Wednesday will be another chance to see what the justices are thinking.

In the Mountain West, the ‘Dirty’ Soda Rush Is On

Samantha Durfey was a high school sophomore in St. George, Utah, when the first Swig soda shop opened there. Today, at 28, Durfey visits the shop at least three times a week. She usually orders a Save Me Jade — Diet Dr Pepper with sugar-free vanilla and coconut flavor syrups — but every now and then she’ll change her order if she wants a break from caffeine.
“They have really good carbonated-water drinks, and because carbonated water itself is disgusting they mix it with fresh fruits and sugar-free syrups and stuff,” she said, “and it makes it taste really yummy.”
Since the first Swig opened in 2010, dozens of soda shop chains and independent soda shacks have opened from Idaho to Utah to Arizona, an area of the Mountain West sometimes called the Mormon Corridor. A significant portion of the region’s population belongs to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and the church’s prohibition on tea and coffee has spurred a niche beverage market that has intensified in the last decade, hitting a fever pitch during the pandemic.
New soda shops are also increasingly opening in other parts of the country, including South Carolina, Florida, Texas and Oklahoma.
“Some people say, ‘Oh, well, it’s just a Utah trend,’ and we kind of proved that wrong when we went to Oklahoma, and proved people like their soda everywhere,” said Nicole Tanner, who founded Swig with her husband, Todd. “It may sound so weird to some people who have never been, but it’s happiness in a cup. I’ve always known from the start that this is something that can and should go everywhere.”
The idea for Swig came out of Nicole Tanner’s family outings to Sonic, where “they had the good pebble ice, and the good foam cup,” she said.
Several of the major soda shop chains in Utah — Swig, Sodalicious, Fiiz and others — are projecting aggressive growth in the next few years. Kevin Auernig, an owner of Sodalicious, said the 25-shop company will double its locations in the next three years. Fiiz started franchising five months after opening in 2014 and now has nearly 40 stores in Utah, Texas, Colorado, Idaho and Nevada, “with a bunch more in the hopper,” said the chain’s owner, Jason Anderson. There are 26 Twisted Sugar shops around the country, but by this time next year there could be nearly 100 franchises, said Tonia Jardine, an owner of the chain.
Swig, which employs about 700 people, plans to open 10 to 15 shops a year, and in two or three years, Tanner said she hopes there will be 200 or more shops across the United States.
The soda shop chains pay special attention to the history of Starbucks — which decades ago expanded at a breakneck pace, from fewer than 20 stores in 1987 to more than 100 in 1992. Worldwide, there are more than 30,000 Starbucks stores today. Many soda shop owners believe their industry could be at least that successful.
“There is a great soda-drinking culture in the Mountain West region,” Auernig said, adding, “What Starbucks originally did for coffee was kind of our idea with soda.”
U.S. soda consumption has been steadily declining over the last two decades, but Americans still drink an annual average of 37 gallons of soda per person, according to 2019 data from the Beverage Marketing Corp.
Soda shop offerings vary from store to store, but they always include brand-name soda or energy drink bases with add-ins like flavored syrups, fruit purées and dairy products like creamer and half-and-half. At Fiiz — which opened in 2014 north of Salt Lake City in Bountiful, Utah — a menu of nearly 600 drinks, using 67 syrups, gives customers vast drink options.
After Mitt Romney was photographed drinking a Diet Coke while running for president in 2012, the church posted a statement on its website clarifying its stance on caffeine, saying it “does not prohibit the use of caffeine.” The Word of Wisdom, the church’s health code, specifically bans hot caffeinated drinks, like coffee and tea.
Brant Ellsworth, an associate professor at Central Penn College in Summerdale, Pennsylvania, specializes in the history of the church. He said its clarification about caffeine did not likely spur the popularity of soda shops in Utah. Ellsworth, who grew up in the church and went to Brigham Young University, said his mother “religiously drank Coke” and his father “religiously drank Diet Coke.”
“I know that Mormons need to get their caffeine fix, and with coffee and tea being off the table, Dr Pepper can be the go-to staple,” he said.
Ellsworth, who wrote a chapter in the 2020 book “This is the Plate: Utah Food Traditions,” said soda shops “really are tongue-in-cheek with the way they engage with LDS culture, its history and some of its practices” — pointing to drink names like the Second Wife at Sodalicious and the Missionary at Swig.
Durfey said the church’s clarification on caffeine has given many mothers, in particular, the freedom to indulge. Women make up a large majority of soda shop customers, especially mothers who grab a drink between dropping off and picking up children from school.
“Moms can’t function without caffeinated beverages,” said Durfey, a mother of two.
“We’re exhausted,” she said. “I don’t know a single mom who cannot go through the day without some form of caffeine. I think that has definitely aided in the popularity of soda shops, because LDS women can’t have coffee, they can’t drink alcohol. So their vice of getting that relaxation, that energy, and that whole kind of ritual, I guess you could say — I feel like soda is their only option.”
The shops have also become popular with high school and college students for dates and hangouts, acting as a bar or coffee shop substitute for people who do not drink coffee or alcohol.
Judy Levin, who wrote the recent book “Soda and Fizzy Drinks: A Global History,” said the shops hark back to the temperance-era soda kiosks and fountains in Europe and North America, which “were absolutely set up as an alternative to the bar.”
“To the extent that I was willing to do predictions in the middle of COVID, I sort of felt the soda fountain might come back for various reasons because of the social function that it once had,” Levin said.
While the pandemic halted or shuttered many restaurants and bars, soda shops were able to stay open and thrive during the first few months of the pandemic, largely because of their drive-through lanes.
“It became a nice little escape from being stuck at home all the time,” Durfey said.
As a nod to her hometown, Atlanta, Olivia Diaz, who is 27 and lives in Orem, Utah, likes to order Life’s a Peach: Dr Pepper with peach and vanilla syrup flavorings, and half-and-half to make it “extra dirty.” (The term “dirty” refers to the flavor add-ins, and its use in marketing was the basis of a 2015 trademark lawsuit when Swig sued Sodalicious.)
Diaz started going to the soda shop once or twice a week after her sister began working at one. Now, she goes only a couple of times a month.
“I just realized that probably drinking that much soda probably wasn’t the best for me,” she said.
Many of the dirty sodas, which come in sizes up to 44 ounces, can contain up to 1,000 calories.
Rebecca Fronberg, a program manager at the Utah Department of Health, said, “It’s not really great to drink our calories” and that sugar in the diet “is always a concern for diabetes, heart disease and all kinds of things.”
Despite that, many seek out soda as a pick-me-up, a small indulgence.
In Clinton, Utah, Nichole Richins, 42, lives within 10 minutes of 10 soda shops. Her usual order is a Polar Punch from Swig, a blended energy drink with blackberry, raspberry, strawberry, ginger ale and vanilla cream. She visits the shop about once a week, “but if it’s a hard week, it will be more.”
“That’s my extra treat,” she said.

Texto completo: Deqa Dhalac saw it in their faces when she started campaigning.
Some people, she says, seemed scared to open their doors when she knocked. Others saw her hijab and assumed she didn't speak English.
But Dhalac kept knocking and telling her story.
And she says a lot has changed since those days back in 2018, when she first ran for City Council in South Portland, Maine -- and won. On Monday she became the first Black mayor of the small city on the state's Southern Coast. And she's believed to be the first Somali American mayor in the United States.
South Portland's other city councilors, who are all White, elected her in a unanimous vote, heaping praise on Dhalac for her dedication to the community and thoughtful consideration of issues.
Dhalac, 53, says her election shows what can be accomplished when people find ways to connect with each other instead of putting up walls.
"People will always have some kind of reservation...but will get to know you, listen to you and see who you are through that," she says.
Given that Maine is the whitest state in the country, and that South Portland is 90% White, Dhalac knows her election sounds surprising to some.
But she says that it shouldn't be. And that's one reason she ran for office in the first place.
She hopes her election as mayor will inspire others to follow in her footsteps.
"I'm...really proud of the fact that I'm going to be opening a lot of paths for other folks who look like me, especially our young community members, to say, 'If this woman can do this, actually I can do that,'" Dhalac told the City Council last month after her nomination.
"And also not only for immigrant, first-generation or Black people, but also young, White individuals who may have been afraid or don't want to be a part of the civic duties that we all have. ... I say, 'Yes, if I can do this, yes, you can do it. We really, really need you, each and every one of you in this beautiful city of ours, to step up.'"
Her election marks multiple milestones
Dhalac's inauguration is a milestone for Somali immigrant communities that have grown in size and become more established in states like Maine, Minnesota, Ohio and Washington. As that's happened, more Somali Americans are taking on roles on local school boards and city councils -- and also serving as lawmakers, like Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minnesota.
Dhalac is the first Somali American mayor in the United States, according to New American Leaders, an organization that trains and encourages immigrants to run for office. But the organization says they hope she won't be the last.
"Her leadership will certainly make a big difference not only in South Portland, but around the country," said Ghida Dagher, the organization's president. "She's going to serve an example for Somali Americans across the country to step up and step into their own leadership journey. ... It's about owning their own power and potential in our democracy."
Dhalac's election is also a historic first for South Portland, which has never had a Black mayor before, says Seth Goldstein, vice president of the South Portland Historical Society.
Goldstein, who teaches history and leads historical tours in the area, says he's happy to watch this new chapter in his city's history unfold.
"It's very exciting, I think that it is reflective of the way that the community here is gradually changing," Goldstein says.
About 6,000 Somalis live in Maine, Goldstein said, thanks to a wave of migration that began in the early 2000s.
Their arrival hasn't always been met with open arms. In 2002, the mayor of Lewiston, Maine, drew national media attention when he wrote an open letter telling Somali immigrants not to come to his city.
But Dhalac says the people she's met in Maine have been welcoming, and in recent years she's seen more Somalis and other immigrants taking on leadership positions in the state. In the past, she says, immigrants were more hesitant to run because they were focused on making ends meet and supporting their families.
"I think we were always kind of afraid to get involved. ... We were waiting on somebody (else) to do something," she said.
In 2018, Dhalac got tired of waiting.
Trump's presidency helped convinced her to run
Dhalac fled Somalia in 1990, just before the country descended into civil war. After she immigrated to the United States in 1992, she says it wasn't long before she started organizing fellow immigrants to become citizens and vote. But she'd never thought of running for office herself, until she came to a troubling realization.
"No matter how important my work was, we were missing out at the decision-making tables," Dhalac said Monday in her inaugural address.
After former US President Donald Trump took office, Dhalac told CNN she felt even more determined to make her voice heard. She joined protesters at a 2016 rally after Trump made comments denigrating Somali immigrants.
The next year, she participated in a protest against White supremacy and drew cheers from the crowd when she declared, "I am a Muslim, Black immigrant woman, and I'm not going anywhere."
When an opening came up on the South Portland City Council, Dhalac says many people were pushing her to run. Once she got her family's blessing, she started knocking on doors, doing what she could to connect with voters and win them over.
In 2018, she ran against a local business owner and won, making history as the first African American and first Muslim elected to the council. In 2020, she ran unopposed for a second term. The city council selects from among its members who will be mayor, and in November, her colleagues unanimously supported her nomination.
And on Monday, they voted to make it official. She'll serve a one-year term.
South Portland is home to about 25,000 people, making it Maine's fourth largest city. It neighbors the larger city of Portland and is also home to the state's largest mall and half of the Portland International Jetport.
Dhalac's major priorities for the city include improving its climate change response, increasing the availability of affordable housing and promoting diversity, equity and inclusion.
Being on South Portland's City Council isn't a full-time job. Dhalac has a background in social work, and by day she's the family engagement and cultural responsiveness specialist for Maine's Department of Education. She also serves on numerous boards and is the mother of three adult children.
But no matter how much else she has on her plate, Dhalac says she always wants members of the community to feel comfortable coming to her with questions.
And they do, Dhalac says.
"Why is the construction taking too long? ... Why does this person have a rooster next door? You name it."
There's a Somali saying behind her leadership philosophy
On Monday, so many people wanted to attend Dhalac's inauguration that organizers had to move it to a larger auditorium.
Dhalac says she's grateful to community members who could have seen her as a stranger, but welcomed her instead. And that connection should go both ways, she says.
She encourages fellow immigrants to leave their bubbles, too.
"We're living in the same space, so we should build relationships together," she says.
Dhalac points to a Somali saying: "What I am missing is within my brother or within my sister."
That, she says, means that in order to make the best decisions, leaders must consult with the community.
In her inaugural address Monday, Dhalac pledged to keep an open mind as mayor "and listen with empathy, compassion, grace and understanding, so we can serve South Portland together."
The crowd gave her a standing ovation.

Texto completo: As millions of Jewish people across the country celebrate Hanukkah, police say vandals painted anti-Semitic messages and symbols in tunnels near Idaho's Anne Frank Human Rights Memorial on Friday.
Law enforcement officials are looking for whoever is responsible for the vandalism along the Greenbelt in Boise, the Boise Police Department (BPD) said on Twitter.
"We recognize the significance of this being the last Saturday of Hanukkah and we are reaching out to Jewish leaders in our community to let them know we will not stand for such hateful and abhorrent behavior in our city," BPD Chief Ryan Lee said on the department's Twitter page.
The graffiti included anti-Semitic messaging targeting Jews, messages of hate against minority groups and symbols including swastikas, Lee told CNN affiliate KIVI. A swastika is the centerpiece of the Nazi flag and is synonymous with anti-Semitism.
The graffiti was quickly covered up by Boise Parks and Recreation workers, police said.
"The antisemitic messages contained in the graffiti found along the Greenbelt put a literal and figurative stain on our community. This will not be tolerated," Boise Mayor Lauren McLean said on Facebook.
"Hate speech is reprehensible. It is not who (we) are as a city and is not part of our shared values. I invite all good people of Boise to stand with me, as I stand with our Jewish neighbors, to rebuke this hate."
Idaho's Anne Frank Human Rights Memorial is the only Anne Frank memorial in the US, according to the memorial's website. The educational park features a bronze statue of Anne Frank as well as an amphitheater, quotes wall, garden and classroom.
Ahead of the Hanukkah holiday this year, the Anti-Defamation League launched #ShineALight to raise awareness around anti-Semitism and how communities can respond.
Hate crimes in the US reached a 12-year-high in 2020, with more than 7,700 criminal hate crime incidents reported to the FBI, according to the FBI's annual hate crime statistics report. There were 683 anti-Jewish attacks last year, according to the FBI data, down from 963 in 2019.
Police are asking anyone with information regarding the vandalism to call 208-377-6790 or CrimeStoppers: at 208-343-COPS (2677), or leave a tip through the "P3 Tips" mobile app.

After 110 Years, an Overdue Book Is Returned to a Library in Idaho

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
In 1911, someone checked out a copy of the book “New Chronicles of Rebecca” from a library in Boise, Idaho.
For the next 110 years, the city’s libraries would survive pandemics, recessions and world wars — all without that copy of the 278-page series of stories by Kate Douglas Wiggin about an imaginative girl named Rebecca.
Then, the volume turned up in November at Boise’s main library. The circumstances of its recovery, however, remain a mystery, said Lindsey Driebergen, the interim communications manager for the Boise Public Library system.
“We don’t have any info about where it was from,” she said.
All that’s known, she said, is that the book was returned either in late October or early November to a library in nearby Garden City. The librarians there sent the book to the main library in Boise because it still had inserts from an old library in the city that has since closed.
It was not clear who had checked out the copy, who had returned it or where it was all this time. One theory is that the book, a sequel to a tale about a village girl in Maine, could have spent the last century in an attic, “because it was really well taken care of,” Driebergen said.
Whoever had the book kept it in “immaculate” condition, she said.
“The cover was in great shape, all of the pages were crisp, nothing was missing, all the images were there,” she said.
There have been other cases of books being returned decades overdue, but 110 years is an unusually long time. This year, a Wisconsin woman mailed a book that was 63 years overdue to the Queens Public Library in New York. In 2016, a 72-year-old Manhattan woman returned a book that was 57 years overdue.
Driebergen said copies of “New Chronicles of Rebecca” sold for about $1.50 when it was published in 1907.
The person who checked out “New Chronicles of Rebecca” in 1911 can rest peacefully, as the Boise Public Library scrapped late fees for overdue books in 2019. Otherwise, the person would have owed around $800, because the library charged a fine of 2 cents per day, the library said on Facebook.
However, even in the early 20th century, the library never charged fines more than the cost of the book, said Anne Marie Martin, a library assistant at the main library.
“Books may be kept two weeks without renewal, unless otherwise labeled,” one of the book inserts said. The book’s checkout record showed it was due in November 1911, not 2021. It was listed as missing in 1912, Martin said.
Several library systems across the country have done away with overdue fines in recent years to encourage people to keep coming back.
“New Chronicles of Rebecca” was a sequel to the more popular 1903 novel “Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm” by Wiggin, an author, teacher and composer. The stories follow the life of Rebecca Rowena Randall, a cheerful Maine girl who was sent to live with her two aunts. “Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm” was made into a 1938 movie of the same name starring Shirley Temple.
It doesn’t appear that the copy of “New Chronicles of Rebecca” that was returned to the Boise library is rare. Eric E. Wiggin, a distant cousin of the author’s husband who wrote a third installment of the series, said that there were many early edition copies of the book in circulation. In fact, he has many himself.
“I’m trying to get rid of them,” said Wiggin, 82.
However, the library’s copy may be the only one with a book binding that says the author’s last name is “Wiggins.”
“Probably that was a mistake from the Pioneer Library Bindery,” Martin said.
Library books are typically rebound with a stiffer binding, and this one was likely rebound sometime before it was first checked out, she said.
Now that the Boise Public Library’s copy of “New Chronicles of Rebecca” has finally been returned, it will be displayed in a special room at the main library, Driebergen said.
The librarians do not know the name of the person who checked out the book in 1911 because they no longer save the paper files that were used a century ago, she said.
But the library is hoping that someone with knowledge of the book’s former whereabouts might let the staff know. “We’re hoping someone comes forward and says, ‘Hey, it was my grandma’s book,’ ” Driebergen said.
“If we had a little bit of understanding as to the history of it, we’d love to hear it,” she added, promising, “There’s obviously no fines or anything that would be implemented.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Texto completo: CNN Hero of the Year
Phippsburg native Lynda Doughty, founding executive director of Marine Mammals of Maine, has been nominated for CNN's 2021 Hero of the Year, which honors individuals around the world who strive to improve the lives of others.
Doughty is among 10 finalists for the award. Viewers are voting to see who will win the award and $100,000 donated to their nonprofit. Votes can be cast on CNN's website.
In a news release Tuesday, Doughty wrote she is "humbled by this recognition." A Marine Mammals of Maine volunteer nominated her for the award.
"The community I was raised in has been a huge support system along my journey to carry out this critical work in Maine," Doughty wrote. "At the end of the day, I just want to ensure these animals have a voice, that we help those impacted by humans, and that we are doing everything we can to protect their habitat. Now we have this incredible opportunity to do even more of that if awarded Hero of the Year."
Founded in 2011, Marine Mammals of Maine is a nonprofit dedicated to marine mammal and sea turtle response, rescue, care, research and education. The organization responds to reports of stranded marine mammals and sea turtles along about 2,500 miles of Maine's coastline from Kittery to Rockland. The organization also operates a rehabilitation center for seals.

Lynda Doughty among top 10 picks for CNN’s 2021 Hero of the Year

Phippsburg native and founding executive director of Marine Mammals of Maine Lynda Doughty was nominated for CNN’s 2021 Hero of the Year, which honors individuals around the world who strive to improve the lives of others.
Doughty is among the top 10 nominees for the award. Voting is taking place to see who will win the award and $100,000 toward their nonprofit. Votes can be cast on CNN’s website.
In a news release Tuesday, Doughty wrote she is “humbled by this recognition.” A Marine Mammals of Maine volunteer nominated her for the award.
“The community I was raised in has been a huge support system along my journey to carry out this critical work in Maine,” Doughty wrote. “At the end of the day, I just want to ensure these animals have a voice, that we help those impacted by humans, and that we are doing everything we can to protect their habitat. Now we have this incredible opportunity to do even more of that if awarded Hero of the Year.”
Founded in 2011, Marine Mammals of Maine is a nonprofit organization dedicated to marine mammal and sea turtle response, rescue, care, research and education. The organization responds to stranded marine mammals and sea turtles along about 2,500 miles of Maine’s coastline from Kittery to Rockland. The organization also operates a rehabilitation center for seals.

Texto completo: About 110 years ago, a book was checked out from a Boise, Idaho library, and it has finally been returned.
The "New Chronicles of Rebecca" was originally checked out in 1910 from Boise's Carnegie Public Library, according to Boise Public Library's Facebook post.
Just this month, the novel was checked back into a library in nearby Garden City, Boise Public Library's Interim Communications Manager Lindsey Driebergen told CNN.
After library staff in the Boise suburb noticed a sticker on the book from the Boise Public Library, they sent it there, she said.
"It was originally supposed to be returned to the Boise Carnegie Library in 1911." Driebergen said.
The book was in great condition and images on the library's Facebook post show the original paper stamps in the front cover.
"All the pages are really well maintained, and the images are clear," Driebergen added. "It must've been kept tucked in a safe spot to help it from getting tarnished."
According to an Amazon listing, the children's book was published in 1907 and is a sequel to "Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm."
A note on the inside cover of the book reads, "Books may be kept two weeks without renewal, unless otherwise labeled. A fine of two cents per day is imposed on overdue books."
Lucky for the person who checked it out originally, the library stopped charging for overdue books in 2019. If they did still charge, however, the late fee would have been $803, the staff calculated, Driebergen said.
Paper records of the book are no longer available so the book worm who originally checked out the book, and who kept it that long, are unknown.
As the novel is out of circulation, it sits in library's Idaho room alongside other historical books.
The library added it hasn't heard from anyone about being, or knowing, the person who originally checked out the book.
"You're not going to be in trouble, obviously, but if you know anything about this book let us know!" Driebergen said.

Texto completo: Bettina Lerman was on a ventilator for weeks after getting Covid-19 and hadn't responded to doctors' efforts to wake her from a coma when her family made the difficult decision to take her off of life support.
They made funeral arrangements and picked out her casket and headstone as they prepared to say goodbye, her son Andrew Lerman told CNN.
On the day they planned to remove her from life support, Lerman said, he got a call from one of her doctors at Maine Medical Center in Portland.
"He's like, 'Well, I need you to come here right away.' I was like, 'OK, what's wrong?'" Lerman said. "He goes, 'Well, there's nothing wrong. Your mother woke up.'"
Lerman said he dropped the phone when he got the news.
More than 768,000 people have died from Covid-19 in the United States since the start of the pandemic, according to Johns Hopkins University. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says 58.9% of the US population is fully vaccinated.
Lerman said his mother, who turns 70 in February, had a number of health conditions, including diabetes, and had a heart attack and quadruple bypass surgery a couple of years ago.
She started showing Covid-19 symptoms in early September, was diagnosed when she went into the hospital September 12 and went on the ventilator on the 21st, he said.
She was not vaccinated but had been planning to get her shots when she got sick, he said.
Her condition deteriorated and doctors told the family she wasn't expected to recover.
"We had a family meeting with the hospital because my mother wasn't waking up. No matter what they (did), they couldn't get her to wake up," Lerman said. "They said that her lungs are completely destroyed. There's irreversible damage -- that it's just not going to happen."
It's been about three weeks since she woke up on October 29, and a hospital spokeswoman told CNN she's in serious condition. The hospital could not release any additional information because of privacy laws.
Lerman said his mother didn't suffer any organ failure and no one really understands how she's doing so well.
"My mother is very religious and so are a lot of her friends, and church, and everything else and they've all been praying for her," he said. "So they can't explain it on the medical side. Maybe it's on the religious side. I'm not that religious, but I'm starting to believe that there's something that helped her. I don't know."
Lerman said he talked to his mother for hours Wednesday, and she's able to move her hands and arms and can breathe on her own for a few hours at a time with some oxygen support, instead of the ventilator.
"She knows where she is, who she is -- she's as sharp as a tack," Lerman said. "Usually, when somebody comes out of a coma like that, they say that the patients have delirium where they're very confused. From day one, she hasn't experienced any of that."
He said she's not out of the woods yet, and could still have setbacks, but the medical staff is looking at getting her on a list for rehab to help her regain her range of motion.
She's already getting physical therapy to help rebuild the muscle strength she lost during the ordeal.
Lerman and his mother live in Florida, but they'd both been coming up to Maine a lot to care for his father, who has stage 4 cancer. Lerman's father got Covid at about the same time as Lerman's mother but has recovered.
Lerman and his wife also got Covid, and he said they're going to get vaccinated in a few weeks when they're eligible.
When they didn't think she would recover, Lerman said, the family gave up his mother's Florida apartment, collected important family items and donated the rest of her things to other residents in her building.
His sister set up a GoFundMe campaign to raise money to help her mother as she recovers.
Lerman said his mother told him she was praying while she was in the coma and remembers people visiting and talking to her.
"So the words of encouragement that I have is not to give up hope, and when you do visit your family members in this situation, talk to them because they can hear you," he said.
He also said every Covid case is different and he knows not everyone will be able to recover like his mother.
"She's a miracle," he said.

Lights Out: 5 New ‘Dark-Sky Places’ for Top-Shelf Stargazing

Vast expanses of glittering stars. Pristine views of the night sky. And no glare to muddy the Milky Way.
Those are the defining features of what are known as dark-sky places. As of this month, 187 such sites across 21 countries — among them, national parks, remote sanctuaries and nature reserves — have been determined to meet the International Dark-Sky Association’s standard for the designation: “a land possessing an exceptional or distinguished quality of starry nights.”
The group, which is based in Tucson, Arizona, grants the certifications as part of its mission to restore night skies to their natural state. It has certified 30 new dark-sky places so far in 2021, with a few more scheduled before the end of the year, according to Ashley Wilson, the association’s director for conservation.
To help reduce light pollution — obtrusive artificial light that obscures views of the stars and planets — the group suggests simple changes, such as angling exterior lights downward to limit disturbance to nocturnal wildlife.
“Each dark-sky place acts as an important vehicle to bring messages about the importance of dark skies and quality outdoor lighting to a wider audience, most notably people who live in cities,” Wilson said in an email.
All protected public lands as well as private ones that provide nighttime access are eligible for the certification.
Wilson said sites “must demonstrate that the Milky Way is readily visible to the unaided eye” and that “no nearby artificial light sources yield significant glare.”
Here are five sites that have recently received dark-sky designations.
Kentucky: Mammoth Cave National Park
At nearly 53,000 acres, this national park in southern Kentucky is known for its labyrinth of caves and lush forests. Last month, it became an official dark-sky park.
“We hope that this designation will encourage the public to appreciate the vastness of not only the miles of deep underground passageways of Mammoth Cave, but also the beauty of the night sky above the park,” Barclay C. Trimble, the park superintendent, said in a statement.
The certification involved an evaluation of more than 700 outdoor light fixtures and retrofitting the fixtures to make them dark-sky-friendly. The park, the first National Park Service-operated site in Kentucky to receive the designation, also had to show a commitment to promote the benefits of dark skies to the public.
West Virginia: Watoga State Park
In October, Watoga State Park in West Virginia received its dark-sky status along with nearby Calvin Price State Forest and Droop Mountain Battlefield State Park.
The three areas, which collectively encompass 19,800 acres of public land in southern West Virginia, were the first places in the state to receive dark-sky designations.
In 2018, the Watoga State Park Foundation began seeking the certification. Two board members obtained a grant to replace light fixtures at the park and worked with volunteer astronomers to measure the quality of the park’s night skies over a year.
John Goodwin, the foundation’s president, said in a statement that “our many sensitive animal species will live and thrive in their accustomed darkness just as their ancestors did, free from artificial light pollution.”
Texas: Black Gap Wildlife Management Area
In August, Black Gap Wildlife Management Area in Texas was named a dark-sky sanctuary.
In the association’s nomenclature, a dark-sky sanctuary is “typically situated in a very remote location with few (if any) nearby threats to the quality of its dark night skies.” They are even more remote — and usually darker — than dark-sky parks or reserves.
Black Gap, which covers about 103,000 acres with little development, is in the rugged Trans-Pecos region of West Texas.
Black Gap is the second state park-run property to receive the sanctuary status. (Devils River State Natural Area was certified in 2019.) Texas has four dark-sky parks.
Maine: Appalachian Mountain Club’s Maine Woods
In May, the Appalachian Mountain Club’s Maine Woods property became the first dark-sky park in New England.
The area, which offers clear views of pitch-black skies, is one of the darkest places on the East Coast, which has significant light pollution, experts say.
The dark-sky park sits at the edge of the North Maine Woods, an area of 5,400 square miles of largely uninhabited forest stretching from Monson, Maine, to Canada.
“We hope this designation will draw further attention to the value of this natural resource as well as its regional scarcity,” Ruskin Hartley, the International Dark-Sky Association’s executive director, said at the time of its designation.
Arizona: Chiricahua National Monument
The nearly century-old national monument in southeastern Arizona was named a dark-sky park in April.
The association said that the monument “protects some of the darkest night skies remaining in the American Southwest.”
Known for its looming rock pinnacles or “standing up rocks,” the park has been described as a sky island because of the isolated mountain range above the surrounding grassland sea.
The park’s “geographic isolation” from major metropolitan areas provides “great natural protection from light pollution and sky glow,” the dark-sky association said in April, describing the park’s night sky quality as “nearly pristine in the zenith.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

At 83, ‘Nimblewill Nomad’ Enters the Appalachian Trail Record Book

M.J. Eberhart, an 83-year-old retired eye doctor, had a strenuous weekend.
On Sunday, he pushed through the final few miles of a hike on the Appalachian Trail, becoming the oldest known person to complete the roughly 2,190-mile trail from Georgia to Maine.
It was an odyssey that started in January from his home in Flagg Mountain, Alabama, with a series of day hikes that gradually took him to Georgia. From there, he started the journey along the Appalachian Trail. He carried a six-pound pack, with a tent, sleeping bag and other gear (not including food and water).
Known by his trail name “Nimblewill Nomad,” Eberhart hiked the distance in segments. Sometimes friends and supporters hiked with him or picked him up for overnight breaks of a warm bed and meal, driving him back the next morning to where he had dropped off the trail.
Mostly, he slept in the wild. He was stunned by the natural beauty around him. He saw bears. Mosquitoes divebombed and pecked at him. He dreaded the prospect of boulders and 50-mph winds in the Presidential Range in New Hampshire.
And he came “face to face” with himself, he said in an interview. Every day, he said, he overcame the temptation to quit.
“I knew what was coming,” he said. “And day to day, the challenge.”
But he pushed on.
“Every foot of that trail,” he said.
At the end, Eberhart hiked the last leg of his trek on Sunday into Dalton, Massachusetts, and into the record books.
On Depot Street, Eberhart was greeted by Tom Levardi, known by insiders as a trail “angel” who for decades has supported hikers.
There, a celebratory handover took place, where Dale Sanders, 86, known by his trail name “Grey Beard,” handed Eberhart an engraved hiking stick in a symbolic transfer of the record and then toasted him with Champagne. Sanders had held the title since 2017, when he hiked the entire trail at age 82, and had driven from Tennessee to walk the final miles with Eberhart.
“An incredibly emotional time, as I again break down in tears,” Eberhart wrote about the hike in his online journal.
“He stole my record from me,” Sanders, reached by telephone, said, laughing. “I am not at all disappointed that he took it. I actually promote older people to get out and break my record.”
On Monday, Eberhart was on the move again. He set off in good spirits, this time in a car with a driver, for home in Alabama.
The Appalachian Trail, nicknamed the AT, stretches from Springer Mountain in Georgia to Mount Katahdin in Maine, crossing 14 states over mountains, woods and roads. About 3 million people hike the trail, either for a few miles or in multiday segments, or persist along its entire length.
People who hike the Appalachian Trail have become a close-knit community online and on foot, referring to each other by their trail names and exchanging tips, warnings and other information.
Eberhart thanked some of them in his blog, including those he hiked with on his final day: Slim Jim, Kitchen Sink, Pooter Scooter, Mayor, Slider and Neighbor Dave.
Jordan Bowman, a spokesperson for the Appalachian Trail Conservancy, the organization that leads management of the trail, said Monday that he was informed of Eberhart’s achievement by a reporter Sunday.
The conservancy does not verify log books, hostel visits or other written documentation that someone has completed a thru-hike, he said. Instead, he said, there is a strict honor code.
“We are not monitoring to make sure you touched every white blaze,” he said, referring to the paint markers on trees that let hikers know they are on the right path.
It was the third time that “Nimblewill Nomad” had hiked the trail in a thru-hike, which is when someone goes the full distance within a 12-month period. The other two times were in 1998 and 2001-02, when the trail was part of longer hikes of thousands of miles, he said.
After adding hundreds of miles to his hike by starting in Alabama, Eberhart said, he put his pack on and set off on the Appalachian Trail itself on March 1. He averaged about 10 miles a day, he said.
By July, he was on the New York-Connecticut state line when a friend took him off the trail and drove him to Maine to avoid bad weather. From there, he hiked south.
“Once you get into it, it helps steel you,” he said. “The more you get into it, the more committed you have to be.”
The trek requires mental and physical resolve. “Eighty percent of it is mental grit,” Eberhart said. “And that is why so many people fail.”
In 2016, Eberhart was living mostly out of a pickup truck, using a relative’s home in Missouri as a mailing address.
“Put me in the great outdoors, preferably the mountains, and you’ve got a happy camper,” he told The New York Times in an article profiling adventurous retirees.
The trail was closed during the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, but the numbers of hikers have come back to pre-pandemic levels this year, Bowman said. Bowman added that the registrations for attempts to hike the entire trail in one 12-month period were 3,107 in 2019 but that the system for registration, which is voluntary, was halted for much of 2020 when COVID-19 was surging. There were 3,763 registrations this year. “There were a lot of people who had postponed their hikes,” he said.
He said he had known about Eberhart’s hikes for months, but he had not spoken with him after he made the record.
“I hope he is doing well and soaking his feet,” he said.
Eberhart said he overcame pain every day, including foot pain that brought him to tears. But he often thought of Lance Armstrong, the cyclist, who once said that pain was temporary but that quitting lasted forever.
He lost 15 pounds but said he would not cut his hair or shave. “The old man on the mountain has got to have a beard,” he said.
After a hike of thousands of miles, Eberhart did not hesitate when asked what he planned to do next.
“I don’t know,” he said. “I am 83 years old. I just hope I am here tomorrow.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Texto completo: Nov. 8 - A new study of white-tailed deer in Iowa suggests many of those animals have active COVID-19 disease, likely contracted it from humans and are spreading it to each other, according to The New York Times.
Scientists are concerned about the possibility of the virus mutating within the deer population and creating a new strain that might be transmitted back to humans.
"Our results suggest that deer have the potential to emerge as a major reservoir host" for the coronavirus, according to the study, which has not yet been peer reviewed.
Scientists at Penn State University, working with the Iowa Department of Natural Resources and Iowa State University, found that among Iowa deer studied between April 2020 and January 2021, nearly 80 percent had detectable levels of COVID-19.
As hunters on Monday began the second full week of the state's firearms season, the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife said it is not actively studying COVID-19 in deer but is monitoring the studies being done in other states.
"Currently there does not seem to be any evidence that suggests transmission from deer to humans, and the risk to humans appears very low," said Mark Latti, communications director for DIF&W.
"As always, we continue to suggest that hunters take precautions when processing wild game, such as wearing gloves, and discourage people from feeding wildlife, which can concentrate deer in smaller areas, and ease the transmission of any disease," Latti said.
Despite the findings, hunters and people who enjoy eating venison are not believed to be at risk.
There is no evidence deer have transmitted the disease back to humans, nor have scientists been able to figure out how the animals got the coronavirus from humans in the first place.
People usually are infected with the coronavirus through the spread of respiratory droplets and COVID-19 has not been found in the deer muscle tissue meat that might be consumed by hunters.
Key members of the group that conducted the Iowa research are worried about the potential implications of such widespread COVID-19 in deer.
"It was effectively showing up in all parts of the state," Penn State veterinary microbiologist Dr. Kuchipudi told The New York Times. "We were dumbfounded."
In September, results of a study by the U.S. Department of Agriculture found a high incidence of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) antibodies in deer populations in four states. That indicated exposure to the disease, rather than infection.
That research, conducted on deer in New York, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Illinois, did not test for active COVID-19, nor did it determine how the animals were exposed to the disease, how they were affected by it or whether they could transmit it to humans.
The study suggests that deer populations in other states likely are having a similar issue with COVID-19.
"There is no reason to believe that the same thing isn't happening in other states where deer are present," said Penn State microbiologist Dr. Vivek Kapur.
Despite the recent study findings, Iowa wildlife officials, like those in Maine, are urging hunters to take the usual precautions when harvesting a deer.
"To date, there have been no cases of contracting COVID-19 from eating food, including hunted wild meat," Iowa Department of Natural Resources spokesperson Tammie Krausman told the Des Moines Register.
The USDA study found that approximately 33 percent of deer were carrying coronavirus antibodies.
"There is no evidence that animals, including deer, are playing a significant role in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 to people," the USDA said. "Based on the available information, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is low."
The Iowa study was done on samples of lymph nodes from 283 deer that were harvested at game farms, killed by hunters or hit by vehicles.

Winter Heating Bills Loom as the Next Inflation Threat

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
With consumers already dealing with the fastest price increases in decades, another unwelcome uptick is on the horizon: a widely expected increase in winter heating bills.
After plunging during the pandemic as the global economy slowed, energy prices have roared upward. Natural gas, used to heat almost half of U.S. households, has almost doubled in price since this time last year. The price of crude oil — which deeply affects the 10% of households that rely on heating oil and propane during the winter — has soared by similarly eye-popping levels.
And those costs are being quickly passed through to consumers, who have become accustomed to cheaper energy prices in recent years and now find themselves with growing concerns about inflation this year.
In the United States, the winter months account for about 50%-80% of residential fuel consumption. And there is “a significant chance” consumers could face a “marked increase” in prices for heating, said Nina Fahy, an analyst for Energy Aspects, a research consultancy.
Last winter was warmer than average, which led to residential energy bills that were comparatively low. This season, heating costs could rise to levels not seen for a decade, even if there isn’t a severe winter. Several factors — lower global fuel inventories, incentives for producers to let prices rise and a mismatch between supply and demand as economies emerge from the pandemic — may combine to push bills higher regardless.
Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors’ Association, a group of state officials administering aid to low-income households, says those living paycheck to paycheck, or just trying to save, aren’t going to be soothed by complex explanations about inventory levels, supply chains or global demand. When the bills start coming in December or January, he said, “the public’s going to get angry.”
Expert forecasts suggest that the southern half of the country, which has milder winters and relies on relatively cheap electricity for home heating, may enter spring largely unscathed. But the Northeast and the Northern Plains, as well as rural areas nationwide, are far more dependent on heating oil and propane, which are highly exposed to price spikes in commodity markets.
Reflecting the particular concern in their region, a bipartisan group of senators from New England — led by Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Jack Reed, D-R.I. — sent a letter to the White House last week urging “targeted actions” to provide relief “given the current state of energy markets.”
Last week, the Biden administration released 90% of the $3.75 billion in funds dedicated to the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which provided an average of $439 to more than 5 million families the year before the pandemic. It received $4.5 billion in additional emergency grants this year. Usually, funding for the program isn’t released until all budget items for the fiscal year are approved, but Congress recently made an exception as cold months approached and sparring over spending bills continued.
Wolfe’s group has urged Congress to include $5 billion more for the program in the social safety net package being negotiated in Washington.
The increase in home heating costs is sure to hover over economic debates in Washington about inflation. White House allies, fighting to push through the president’s sweeping agenda, assert that the current surge in consumer prices mostly reflects pandemic disruptions that will dissipate next year. Federal Reserve officials, who have been trying to put in place a policy framework less keenly sensitive to inflation, will be pushed to gauge whether that contention is well founded.
The latest outlook from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration suggests a decent chance of a milder-than-average winter. But according to projections by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, if winter is somewhat colder than usual, energy bills could rise 15% for households heated by electricity, 50% for those depending on natural gas and 59% for those that mostly use heating oil. Propane users would be in for the biggest blow — a 94% increase, or potentially hundreds of dollars over the six-month heating season.
As with other price shocks stemming from the pandemic, the pain will be particularly acute for those of limited means. Twenty-nine percent of those surveyed by the Census Bureau have reported reducing or forgoing household expenses to pay an energy bill in the past year.
Before the pandemic, Jamillia Grayson, 43, of Buffalo, New York, had a successful event-planning business. Her work dried up, and even with unemployment insurance, she couldn’t meet household expenses while supporting her 8-year-old daughter, who has sickle cell anemia, as well as an older aunt, who depends on a home oxygen tank and lives with them.
Electricity and gas bills piled up throughout this year, and by the end of the summer, she owed $3,000, she said.
Grayson applied for funds from the Emergency Rental Assistance Program, part of the American Rescue Plan passed by Congress in March, which eligible renters can use to cover their utility costs.
“But the paperwork was so long, it was so hard,” she said. “So as my last resort, I’m like, ‘OK, let me just try Catholic Charities.’ ”
Within three weeks of reaching out, she received a letter from Catholic Charities of Buffalo notifying her that their staff had helped her get approval for about $3,600 to address her unpaid gas and electric bills through New York’s Home Energy Assistance Program.
Grayson estimates that about half of her neighbors are struggling to some degree to cover bills along with rent, especially since the federal supplement to unemployment benefits has expired. And she said she hoped more of them find some measure of help as she did: “You might have to do some research, but there are people who are helping.”
But Jeffrey M. Conrad, a senior director at Catholic Charities of Buffalo, is worried that both nonprofit and government assistance programs could be overwhelmed once New York’s moratorium on utility payments expires in December.
“Once January hits, that’s where the rubber is going to meet the road, and we need to be prepared for an influx of people coming to us,” he said.
Power companies, Conrad said, are bracing for a “March wave” of missed payments and requests for grace periods — especially since moratoriums on utility payments have expired in many states. Although in many instances it may be against state law for a utility company to cut off customers’ heat during winter, “some people are going to be on the hook for, in some cases, thousands and thousands of dollars,” he said.
There are some somber ways for consumers to bring down their bills. The Energy Department says that turning the thermostat down 7 to 10 degrees from its normal setting can cut winter energy costs 10%.
Larry Dawson, CEO of the Illinois Association of Community Action Agencies, which provides energy assistance to people with lower incomes, emphasized that some of the steps that best reduce bills — retrofitting homes for energy efficiency, or installing heating insulation — tend to have the highest upfront costs.
“Most of the folks we serve are below 200% of the federal poverty level,” he said. “They don’t have the money to be able to make the upgrades to these homes.”
And lower-income families are more likely to live in poorly weatherized dwellings that lend themselves to high energy bills in summer and winter.
Decisions by energy companies have also shaped this winter’s prospects. Producers could have more quickly ramped up production to create more supply once it became clear that the economy was reopening. But several industry experts say that would have been out of line with the retooled profit strategies of oil and gas companies and their investors, who are hungry for financial returns after several years of underwhelming performance.
Now, says Brett Ryan, a senior U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank, they want more of what commodity market insiders call “capital discipline” — letting prices run higher before producing more supply to obtain greater returns while demand is robust.
So far, despite a relative uptick in production compared with pandemic lows, companies are mostly practicing that discipline: a savvy business move that may nevertheless intensify the increase in consumer bills.
If energy bills do create widespread hardship in the coming months, planning and organizing assistance may largely fall to locally based nonprofit groups like Catholic Charities of Buffalo — a challenge Conrad says he accepts as a duty.
“It’s what our faith is based on,” he said. “It’s really what all of our religions are based on. It’s helping your neighbor.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Vast expanses of glittering stars. Pristine views of the night sky. And no glare to muddy the Milky Way.
Those are the defining features of what are known as dark-sky places. As of Nov. 1, 187 such sites across 21 countries — among them, national parks, remote sanctuaries and nature reserves — have been determined to meet the International Dark-Sky Association’s standard for the designation: “a land possessing an exceptional or distinguished quality of starry nights.”
The group, which is based in Tucson, Arizona, grants the certifications as part of its mission to restore night skies to their natural state. It has certified 30 new dark-sky places so far in 2021, with a few more scheduled before the end of the year, according to Ashley Wilson, the association’s director for conservation.
To help reduce light pollution — obtrusive artificial light that obscures views of the stars and planets — the group suggests simple changes, such as angling exterior lights downward to limit disturbance to nocturnal wildlife.
“Each dark-sky place acts as an important vehicle to bring messages about the importance of dark skies and quality outdoor lighting to a wider audience, most notably people who live in cities,” Wilson said in an email.
All protected public lands as well as private ones that provide nighttime access are eligible for the certification.
Wilson said sites “must demonstrate that the Milky Way is readily visible to the unaided eye” and that “no nearby artificial light sources yield significant glare.”
Here are five sites that have recently received dark-sky designations.
Kentucky: Mammoth Cave National Park
At nearly 53,000 acres, this national park in southern Kentucky is known for its labyrinth of caves and lush forests. Last month, it became an official dark-sky park.
“We hope that this designation will encourage the public to appreciate the vastness of not only the miles of deep underground passageways of Mammoth Cave, but also the beauty of the night sky above the park,” Barclay C. Trimble, the park superintendent, said in a statement.
The certification involved an evaluation of more than 700 outdoor light fixtures and retrofitting the fixtures to make them dark-sky-friendly. The park, the first National Park Service-operated site to receive the designation, also had to show a commitment to promote the benefits of dark skies to the public.
West Virginia: Watoga State Park
In October, Watoga State Park in West Virginia received its dark-sky status along with nearby Calvin Price State Forest and Droop Mountain Battlefield State Park.
The three areas, which collectively encompass 19,800 acres of public land in southern West Virginia, were the first places in the state to receive dark-sky designations.
In 2018, the Watoga State Park Foundation began seeking the certification. Two board members obtained a grant to replace light fixtures at the park and worked with volunteer astronomers to measure the quality of the park’s night skies over a year.
John Goodwin, the foundation’s president, said in a statement that “our many sensitive animal species will live and thrive in their accustomed darkness just as their ancestors did, free from artificial light pollution.”
Texas: Black Gap Wildlife Management Area
In August, Black Gap Wildlife Management Area in Texas was named a dark-sky sanctuary.
In the association’s nomenclature, a dark-sky sanctuary is “typically situated in a very remote location with few (if any) nearby threats to the quality of its dark night skies.” They are even more remote — and usually darker — than dark-sky parks or reserves.
Black Gap, which covers about 103,000 acres with little development, is in the rugged Trans-Pecos region of West Texas.
Black Gap is the second state park-run property to receive the sanctuary status. (Devils River State Natural Area was certified in 2019.) Texas has four dark-sky parks.
Maine: Appalachian Mountain Club’s Maine Woods
In May, the Appalachian Mountain Club’s Maine Woods property became the first dark-sky park in New England.
The area, which offers clear views of pitch-black skies, is one of the darkest places on the East Coast, which has significant light pollution, experts say.
The dark-sky park sits at the edge of the North Maine Woods, an area of 5,400 square miles of largely uninhabited forest stretching from Monson, Maine, to Canada.
“We hope this designation will draw further attention to the value of this natural resource as well as its regional scarcity,” Ruskin Hartley, the International Dark-Sky Association’s executive director, said at the time of its designation.
Arizona: Chiricahua National Monument
The nearly century-old national monument in southeastern Arizona was named a dark-sky park in April.
The association said that the monument “protects some of the darkest night skies remaining in the American Southwest.”
Known for its looming rock pinnacles or “standing up rocks,” the park has been described as a sky island because of the isolated mountain range above the surrounding grassland sea.
The park’s “geographic isolation” from major metropolitan areas provides “great natural protection from light pollution and sky glow,” the dark-sky association said in April, describing the park’s night sky quality as “nearly pristine in the zenith.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

HANOVER, N.H. — Ben True spent years training alone. A solitary figure on the roads and trails near his home in Hanover, he logged long miles in pursuit of distance-running glory. It was not that he wanted to be doing everything by himself, without the help of a team. But New Hampshire — far from the running meccas of Boulder, Colorado, or Flagstaff, Arizona — is home for him.
“Being here makes me happy,” he said on a recent weekend afternoon. “I’m in my comfort zone. But would I have loved to have other people come train with me? Definitely.”
In recent months, ahead of his appearance in the New York City Marathon on Sunday, True decided to mix things up. After spreading word among friends that he would be willing to go so far as to pay someone to relocate and train with him, True, 35, now has two full-time running buddies — Dan Curts and Fred Huxham, both 25 — who have used True to feed their own ambitions in the sport.
And he has organized a weekly long run: the Tour de Woodstock, just down the road in Vermont. True posts the time and location on Strava, an online exercise-tracking tool, and anyone is welcome to join. Consider it the running equivalent of Kevin Durant advertising his pickup basketball games on Twitter. True’s weekend warriors are free to break off and do shorter, slower circuits. Everyone meets for coffee and waffles afterward.
“It’s a social thing,” Huxham said. “But if you’re going a long way with Ben, you’ve got to be ready to pick up the pace.”
With a small community behind him, True is set for his marathon debut, nearly five months after he narrowly missed an Olympic berth in the 10,000 meters when he finished fourth at the United States trials. And while he has guarded against putting too much pressure on himself, he considers New York something of a test. A test, he said, to see whether he is “cut out for the marathon.” And a test to determine whether his future in the sport is financially viable.
“I’d love to keep racing,” he said. “The way that my body has felt for the marathon build has made me think I can do this for a lot longer.”
True, who grew up in Maine and graduated from Dartmouth, has history with New York. In 2015, he became the first American man to win a 5,000-meter Diamond League race, with a victory at the Adidas Grand Prix on Randalls Island. In 2018, he won the New York City Half Marathon in his debut at the distance.
He chose to make his marathon debut in New York because of his strong relationship with New York Road Runners, which organizes the marathon, and his love of pure competition. Unlike several other major marathons, New York does not employ pacesetters. And on a notoriously challenging course, elite runners chase one another rather than the clock.
On Sunday, he will face a loaded field including the likes of Kenenisa Bekele of Ethiopia, a four-time Olympic medalist and five-time world champion. True has never raced with a wristwatch, he said, but he plans to wear one for the marathon to protect himself from himself. He has some familiarity with the course, and knows how runners can surge at various points of the race, like Mile 16 off the Queensboro Bridge.
“I’m somebody who thrives on latching onto somebody and never letting go,” True said. “But if Bekele drops a 4:30 mile coming off the bridge, I probably shouldn’t try to match him.”
True would like to exercise patience, a component of success that has occasionally been in short supply for him. He thought back to 2019, when he crammed his schedule full of races and competed in the 5,000 meters at the world championships with an Achilles tendon injury. He should have taken time off, he said, but he was worried about losing his health insurance if his world ranking dipped.
“I was just in so much pain,” he said, “and it really made me think that I either had to step away or make some big changes. Luckily, Dan showed up.”
True had been circulating an unconventional offer in the high-end running community: He would pay someone $20,000 to run with him. He went a few years without any takers.
“I’m not sure if people thought I was serious,” he said.
Curts, who ran at Iowa State, was back home in Maine when he learned from mutual friends that True was in the market for a training companion. He moved to New Hampshire last fall, then recruited Huxham, who was a second-team all-American at the University of Washington, to join them a couple of months ago.
“I have no idea how he ran alone for so long,” Curts said. “There’s a reason nobody at his level on the planet does that.”
On weekends, the three are joined by a motley crew of men and women — medical students and engineers, former cyclists and soccer players — on the roads near Woodstock. True said the experience as a whole had been energizing.
“I don’t doubt that if I’d had a training partner through my career, I would’ve run faster,” True said.
At the same time, he has balanced training with fatherhood — he and his wife, Sarah True, an Olympic triathlete, have a 3-month-old son, Haakon — while coping with some of the harder realities of his profession. At the end of last year, Saucony chose not to renew his sponsorship deal after he had spent nearly 10 years with the company.
“I am not a social media influencer,” said True, who has an Instagram account that mostly collects dust. “I do not like using it.”
In New York, True said he would be wearing “old” Saucony sneakers and a blank singlet as an unsponsored athlete.
True tends to frame his observations about marathon training as questions, which makes sense given his relative inexperience. He does not know what to expect. “Hopefully I’m ready?” he asked.
Yet he has found marathon training to be more forgiving than the work he did to prepare for 5,000- and 10,000-meter races on the track: He does more mileage now, but less of the high-end speed work that often led to injuries. The result is that he feels surprisingly spry, which has made him wonder whether he is doing it right.
“Everyone always complains about how exhausted they are during marathon training,” he said, “and I haven’t really experienced that?”
True understands, for example, that the course has its share of inclines, and he has done the bulk of his training on a quiet road that features hilly terrain. “So I’m hoping that helps me out?” he asked.
Because True has not had much income this year, his $20,000 payment to Curts ended up being a one-time thing, but he has been coaching Curts and Huxham pro bono, in addition to running alongside them.
The experience has been a thrill for Curts, who taped an autographed photograph of True to the front of his mileage log when he was a high school freshman.
Huxham, who placed second at the national 10-kilometer road racing championships in July, has used True to gauge his own improvement. The bar, Huxham said, is high.
He cited a recent 12-kilometer time trial that True ran on his own. Afterward, True looked as if he had gone for a brisk walk. Huxham checked True’s splits. “He had come within 10 seconds of the national record,” Huxham said.
There have been long periods, True said, when running feels like a job to him, when the injuries seem unavoidable and the pain is real, and he asks himself: “Why am I doing this?”
Now is not one of those times, he said. He heads out the door with his friends feeling healthy and free, and runs toward something beautiful, a place he had help finding.
“There’s nothing better,” he said. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

House Democrats Revive Paid Leave Program, Ignoring Manchin’s Concerns

WASHINGTON — Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California announced Wednesday that she would include four weeks of federal paid family and medical leave in the $1.85 trillion domestic policy bill that the House plans to consider as early as Thursday, seeking to pressure Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., to drop his opposition.
The announcement, which came as Democrats scrambled to iron out differences over the package, is unlikely to result in enactment of the leave program. Manchin, a crucial Democratic holdout, reiterated Wednesday that he would not support it as part of the sprawling social policy, climate and tax legislation. But the inclusion of paid leave promised to give House Democrats a chance to register their support for a program that has bipartisan backing.
It also all but guaranteed that the legislation would have to be modified by the Senate and approved a second time by the House before it becomes law, breaking with Pelosi’s promise to moderate lawmakers that she would not force them to vote on a plan that could not clear the evenly divided Senate.
The speaker’s move amounted to the most direct challenge yet of Manchin, a centrist who has repeatedly voiced concern that the social safety net bill is overly generous and whose objections have effectively compelled Democratic leaders to either curtail or remove a number of provisions.
In a letter to Democrats on Wednesday, Pelosi acknowledged that she had been “informed by a senator of opposition to a few of the priorities contained in our bill” and stressed that a compromise would be needed for the final package to become law.
While several Democrats celebrated Pelosi’s decision, Manchin made clear that he would not back down from his opposition. Because Republicans are unanimously opposed to the entire package, Democrats must maintain the support of all but a few of their members in the House and all 50 senators who caucus with their party for it to pass.
“I’m for paid leave,” Manchin told reporters at the Capitol after Pelosi’s announcement. He added that he did not believe Congress should be “putting that in a bill that we should be able to work in a bipartisan way to get done.”
President Joe Biden and congressional Democrats had hoped to include 12 weeks of paid leave in their package, but they scaled it back to four amid opposition from Manchin before ultimately dropping it altogether. Biden did not include it in a compromise framework that he presented last week, and House Democrats left it out of a draft bill they produced the same day.
It was included in a list of final changes to the House bill, which the Rules Committee released Wednesday afternoon. The program would begin in 2024, includes all employed and self-employed workers and can be used for family caregiving or personal illness.
Pelosi’s decision came a day after five moderate and conservative Democrats reiterated to her in a letter that they did not want to vote for a package that lacked the guaranteed support of all 50 Senate Democrats or might run afoul of the strict budget rules that apply to the plan. The legislation is being considered under a process known as budget reconciliation, which shields it from a filibuster but tightly limits what can be included.
Still, for proponents of the paid leave program — predominantly women in both chambers — the decision to include it was welcomed, even if it was unlikely to become law.
“This victory is personal for so many American workers and their families, and it is personal for me,” said Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., a longtime champion of the proposal. She held an emotional meeting with staff members who had helped craft the provision and a tearful call with Christopher Dodd, who had fought for a similar federal program as a Democratic senator when she served as his chief of staff in the 1980s, according to an aide.
Rep. Richard Neal, D-Mass., chair of the Ways and Means Committee, vowed “to do whatever is necessary to get this provision signed into law by President Biden and give the American people the basic support they deserve.”
Top Democrats hoped it would buoy a lobbying campaign to change Manchin’s mind. Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Patty Murray of Washington have cornered him repeatedly in recent days to plead for his support for including paid leave in the bill.
The campaign also gained an unlikely ally: Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex. The former actress from the United States, who married Prince Harry in 2018, has emailed Murray and called multiple senators in both parties to push for the provision, according to people familiar with her outreach.
“Much to my surprise, she called me on my private line and introduced herself as the Duchess of Sussex,” said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine. “She just weighed in that she thought paid leave was really important, and I told her there were a lot of different approaches, and people were working on it.”
Collins, who said she had also spoken to Manchin about a possible bipartisan solution, added that “I was happy to talk with her, but I’m more interested in what people from Maine are telling me about paid leave.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Overturning Roe could mean women seeking abortions have to travel hundreds of miles

Texto completo: A Supreme Court decision that overturned Roe v. Wade could bring abortion bans to as many as half the states in the country already poised to prohibit the procedure. Such a move would also have knock-on effects on the primarily blue states that would maintain access to abortion.
A Roe v. Wade reversal -- and the flood of abortion restrictions such a ruling would usher in -- stands to affect the distance women would have to travel to their nearest clinic, according to a new report released this week by the Guttmacher Institute. The institute, which favors abortion rights used data from the US Census Bureau to estimate the number of women of reproductive age living in each Census block and calculated the driving distance to the closest abortion clinic.
Illinois, North Carolina and California are among the states that could see the biggest jump in out-of-state abortion patients, as their clinics would be closest for women whose own states are positioned to quickly ban the procedure, according to Guttmacher's analysis.
In states like Louisiana, Texas and Idaho, women would see the distance they'd have to travel to the nearest clinic increase by tenfold or more, if Roe v. Wade was reversed and abortion bans went into effect in the states most likely to implement them.
The new data is being released as the Supreme Court hears two major cases on abortion. One case, being argued Monday, concerns Texas' six-week abortion ban, which prohibits abortion after fetal cardiac activity. The law appears to run afoul of the constitutional protections for pre-viability abortions -- a point usually around 23 weeks into the pregnancy -- that the Supreme Court enshrined in its 1973 Roe decision.
The law has already given a preview of what abortion access would like if other states were allowed to implement extreme limits on the procedure or outright bans. Clinics in Oklahoma and Kansas have reported major surges in Texas patients, prompting delays for residents in their own states to get appointments, while Texas women have traveled as far as Colorado and California to obtain the procedure, according to court filings in the case.
In December, the Supreme Court will hear another case arising out of Mississippi challenging the state's 15-week abortion ban.
In both cases the states are asking the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade, although the justices indicated in the Texas dispute that they won't be focused on that question. It's also possible that the court decides the cases in a way that doesn't overturn Roe, but rather weakens its precedent, allowing more aggressive restrictions on abortion but still preserving abortion rights in some instances.
If the court was to reverse Roe outright, the Guttmacher Institute anticipates that 26 states are certain or likely to ban abortion almost immediately. A dozen of those states have so-called trigger laws, where the abortion ban would be triggered by a Supreme Court reversal of Roe. Sixteen states have extreme abortion restrictions -- such as the near total bans in Arkansas and Alabama, or the six-week bans in Idaho, Kentucky and Tennessee -- that are on the books but are not being enforced due to lower court orders citing Roe v. Wade.
Nine states banned abortion before Roe was decided and another five, Guttmacher predicts, will quickly take steps to pass new laws banning abortions, given those states' recent trend towards restrictive laws and their political composition.
"There is potential for the states with pre-Roe bans for those pre-Roe bans to go into effect if Roe is overturned," Elizabeth Nash, a senior state issues manager at Guttmacher, told CNN.
Pointing to the five states that her organization has deemed likely to pass new laws banning abortion after a Roe reversal, Nash said that "these are all states that have recent history in limiting access to abortion and ongoing debates in the legislature about abortion, routinely."
Hundreds of miles of travel to the nearest abortion clinic
If states were allowed to outlaw abortion, the driving distances their residents would face to access the next nearest clinic would increase exponentially.
If all 26 states that Guttmacher looks at ban abortion, Louisiana women seeking abortions would see the average distance to their nearest clinic increase by 1720%.
In that scenario, the next nearest clinic for nearly three-in-five women in Louisiana would be Illinois. For the rest of the women in the state, Kansas or North Carolina would likely offer the nearest clinics.
Women in Oklahoma, another trigger law state, would be reliant on Kansas for their nearest clinic, according to Guttmacher's analysis, which said that the average driving distance to the nearest clinic would be increased from 18 miles to 181 miles.
For women in Idaho, which has a six-week abortion ban that would become enforceable depending on court rulings, the driving distance to their nearest clinic would increase from 21 miles to 250 miles, in the Guttmacher scenario.
How abortion access in blue states would be affected, if red states were allowed to implement bans
States that have taken proactive steps to protect abortion rights wouldn't be spared the impact of a flood of abortion bans. In scenario where 26 states banned abortion, more than a dozen would see a likely significant increase of out-of-state patients just because their clinics would be the closest clinics for women in states where abortion outlawed, according to the Guttmacher data.
Illinois stands to be a particularly critical "destination" state for patients in surrounding states where abortion could be banned after a Roe reversal.
For nearly 9 million women -- including for women in neighboring states like Indiana and Missouri, as well as women as far as Louisiana and Alabama -- their next closest clinics would be Illinois, according to Guttmacher. The percentage of women who would need drive to the state to reach their nearest clinic would increase by 8,651% percent.
Illinois has taken steps to expand abortion, passing statutory protections for the procedure and making it eligible for Medicaid enrollees, Nash said.
North Carolina also stands to become a hub of out-of-state abortion patients if Roe is overturned. For 1 million in Tennessee, 370,000 women in Kentucky, 230,000 women in Louisiana and 200,000 in Mississippi -- all states with trigger laws -- North Carolina would be the next closest state in the hypothetical Guttmacher analyzed.

CNN honors 10 men and women for making the world a better place

Información de publicación: CNN Wire Service ; Atlanta [Atlanta]. 29 Oct 2021.

Texto completo: These 10 people are making the world a better place and now, they have been named the Top 10 CNN Heroes of 2021.
They were all nominated by you -- our audience -- and selected by CNN to each receive a $10,000 prize. And now you can vote on who you think should be named CNN Hero of the Year and receive an additional $100,000 for their cause.
To find out who is named Hero of the Year, you'll have to watch "The 15th Annual CNN Heroes All-Star Tribute," hosted by Anderson Cooper and Kelly Ripa on Sunday, December 12, starting at 8 p.m. ET.
CNN Heroes has been spotlighting the impactful work of people across the world since 2007. Here's a look at this year's Top 10 CNN Heroes:
Jenifer Colpas: Bringing clean water and power to rural villages in her country
Her cause: Jenifer Colpas co-founded Tierra Grata in 2015, a non-profit that provides access to clean water, solar-powered lights and electricity along with eco-toilets and showers for remote rural communities throughout Colombia. Colpas and her team currently serve 35 communities and their services have helped improve the quality of life for more than 10,000 people.
What inspired her: Growing up in Barranquilla, Colombia, Colpas was mostly shielded from the poverty outside her door. After college, she moved to India for a job in information technology. There, she became aware of vast social inequalities.
"Something inside me (was) saying, 'You need to do something about it,'" Colpas said.
She decided to change her career path and return home, where she co-founded Tierra Grata, which means "gratitude to the earth" in Spanish.
Read more about Jenifer Colpas and her work
Lynda Doughty: The seal rescuer
Her cause: For the past decade, Lynda Doughty's nonprofit, Marine Mammals of Maine, has provided response efforts, assistance and medical care for more than 3,000 marine animals.
The group monitors 2,500 miles of coastline and operates a 24-hour hotline, responding to calls about distressed or deceased marine mammals, and it has federal authorization to provide temporary care for critically ill and injured seals. Data gathered on these animals allows Doughty and her team to monitor trends in diseases and human impact on marine mammal health.
What inspired her: Growing up in coastal Maine, Doughty developed a passion for the marine wildlife living along the coast and knew from an early age that she wanted to dedicate her life to protecting them.
"I just remember being so amazed (by them) and wondering what's happening in their life," Doughty said.
She also became aware that their livelihood was jeopardized by pollution, habitat destruction and other human-related activity.
"I knew that I wanted to do something to help these animals," Doughty said.
She became a marine biologist and worked for several years with organizations that provided emergency response and rehabilitation for sick and injured marine mammals. But as nonprofits and state agencies lost funding or closed their doors, Doughty decided to step in and fill the gap.
Read more about Lynda Doughty and her work
David Flink: Creating a new way to learn
His cause: David Flink's Eye to Eye program pairs middle school children who have a learning difference with a college or high school mentor who also has a learning difference. Eye to Eye's 18-week program centers on a specific social-emotional learning objective. Each lesson builds on the previous, moving students from self-doubt to empowerment.

The organization is in 150 schools nationwide and has more than 1,350 mentees impacting middle school children each week. Eighty percent of Eye to Eye students graduate from college -- an impressive rate considering children with learning disabilities are three times more likely to drop out of high school.
What inspired him: Growing up, Flink had a hard time focusing in school, and he didn't understand why he couldn't learn the way other students did.
At 11, Flink was diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia. With the support of his parents and the right school, Flink graduated high school and went to Brown University.
When he got to college, he found a community of students who also had learning differences. Together with five of them, Flink started a mentoring program for nearby elementary school students who had a learning disability.
Read more about David Flink and his work
Dr. Patricia Gordon: Saving women from a preventable disease
Her cause: Dr. Patricia Gordon operates CureCervicalCancer, which delivers screening, training and supplies to clinics around the world. The organization has since worked in 10 countries, including China, Haiti, Guatemala, Kenya, Nigeria, Tanzania and Vietnam.
The non-profit has screened more than 150,000 women and treated more than 8,600 to date. It has also established 106 sustainable clinics to screen and treat women in remote and underserved areas.
"That there are 8,000 women who are alive and well and able to provide for their families is honestly the most rewarding thing that I could have ever imagined in my life," Gordon said. "I think I'm the luckiest doctor that ever lived."
What inspired her: Gordon, a radiation oncologist, traveled with a group of doctors in 2012 to bring a new radiation device to a hospital in Dakar, Senegal. While there, she saw how many women were needlessly being killed by a preventable, treatable disease: cervical cancer.
"There are 350,000 women dying a painful, undignified death globally. And it's almost 100% preventable," she said.
The team arranged to provide cervical cancer screenings for women in a remote and hard-hit area of Senegal. Using a method Gordon and others call "See & Treat," screening can be done without needing electricity and with a few transportable supplies.
It was a far cry from the way things operated in her Beverly Hills office, but the experience stayed with Gordon, whose own family history of breast cancer is a driving force in her work.
After 27 years, Gordon left her private practice in 2014 to devote all her time to CureCervicalCancer. She takes no salary.

Hector Guadalupe: Giving former prisoners a second chance
His cause: Hector Guadalupe's non-profit, A Second U Foundation, helps formerly incarcerated men and women get certified as personal trainers and build careers in the fitness industry so they can support their families. Guadalupe and his team of volunteers offer a free eight-week program for 10-15 students every quarter to prepare for the national certification exam.
In addition to study materials and exam fees, the program now also provides each student a free tablet with keyboard, transportation, new clothing, software classes and a $1,300 stipend. Coaches also mentor students, helping with far more than classwork.
Once students have passed the exam, Guadalupe helps them get jobs. More than 200 people have graduated from the program since 2016 and only two have reoffended -- a recidivism rate of less than 1%.
What inspired him: By the time he was a teenager, Guadalupe had lost both parents and ended up spending 10 years in prison for drug trafficking. There he became obsessed with fitness and got certified as a personal trainer. When he came home, he was determined to work at one of Manhattan's elite gyms.
"Six days out of the week, I'm literally at every corporate health club ... filling out applications," Guadalupe said. "Nobody was calling me back ... and I knew why: because of my past ... But I didn't give up."
After nine months, he landed an opportunity and worked without a day off for four years to establish himself in New York's fitness scene. Now, he devotes much of his week to helping others do the same.

Michele Neff Hernandez: Finding a way through grief together
Her cause: Michele Neff Hernandez created Soaring Spirits in 2008, three years after her husband's death. Her nonprofit connects widows and widowers, allowing them to heal in a community that understands the pain of losing a partner. It has grown to include 70 regional chapters all over the US, as well as pen pals and programs specifically for the LGBTQ community.
To date, the organization has reached more than 4 million people worldwide.
"It's about helping widowed people live life in community with each other, so that someone who has borne witness to their pain also bears witness to their life as they continue making their way forward," Neff Hernandez said.
What inspired her: Hernandez and her husband, Phillip, were enjoying the active life they built as a couple. But everything changed in August 2005 when Phillip went for a bike ride and was hit by a car and killed.
"I didn't even know what to do with myself," Neff Hernandez said. "Every single thing about my life changed."
While she had a great support system, none of their friends and family knew how to handle her grief.
Hernandez realized she wanted to connect with other widows to learn how they dealt with their new reality.
"I thought if I could bring these widows together, what a difference that would make," she said.
Read more about Michelle Neff Hernandez and her work
Zannah Mustapha: Building a strong and peaceful future generation
His cause: For more than a decade, Zannah Mustapha has devoted his life to providing hope and peace for children in northern Nigeria caught in the epicenter of the Boko Haram insurgency. He and his staff educate more than 2,000 students from both sides of the conflict at the Future Prowess Islamic Foundation School.
The school offers psychological and social support to help children with trauma. Students, who all live nearby with relatives or family members, are also provided uniforms, books, meals and health services.
Mustapha said 1,023 students have graduated, and many have gone on to college or careers.
"These are children (who are) ravaged by the disturbances that Boko Haram has brought in," he said. "Children ... are not even having this war."
What inspired him:
Mustapha said he believes the way to achieve true and lasting peace in the devastated region is through education, and he has defied all odds to keep the doors to his three schools open.
He started the program in 2007 with 36 orphans and expanded, even as others fled the region. As Mustapha continued to expand to meet the needs of children, he saw more and more women struggling when their husbands were killed in the conflict. So, he developed a program in which women could learn a trade to help support their families.
A peace leader, Mustapha envisions a Nigeria where there is no more violence, where education and acceptance are encouraged for all.
"(When I) see the faces of these children and how these children are dreaming, it gives me the hope that still there's a light at the end of the tunnel."
Read more about Zannah Mustapha and his work
Shirley Raines: Beauty 2 the Streetz
Her cause: For the past six years, Raines and her organization, Beauty 2 the Streetz, have been a mainstay on Los Angeles' Skid Row, providing food, clothing, hair and makeup services -- and most recently health and hygiene items -- to thousands of people.
Rain or shine, she sets up "shop" weekly at the corner of 5th and Townes to serve those she calls "Kings" and "Queens." Her goal: to make the homeless feel human, whether that means a haircut, a facial, a hearty meal, or a hug.
Before the pandemic, Raines was making 400 meals a week in her one-bedroom apartment kitchen in Long Beach and driving three times a week to downtown LA to feed and bring supplies to people.
What inspired her: Raines' 2-year-old son Demetrius was staying with her grandmother when he accidentally ingested medication and was hospitalized.
He died on Sept. 6, 1990, just shy of his third birthday.
"I blamed myself for not having stability. If only I'd had my own backyard. If only I'd had my stuff together," Raines said.
Soon after, Raines also faced the loss of her grandmother and then her son's biological father to cancer.
"I just fell apart. I lived a very unhappy life. I couldn't keep anything together," she said.
After struggling with anxiety and panic disorder for decades, Raines' twin sister stepped in, urging her to find a purpose for her pain. That purpose came in 2017 when Raines joined a church group on a feeding mission.
"I went to Skid Row, I'm like, 'Oh, this is where all the broken people are? Oh, I've been looking for y'all all my life,'" she said. "I never wanted to leave. It's a place where people have amazing hearts, but nobody can see it because they can't see the forest for the trees."

Dr. Ala Stanford: Bringing Covid-19 testing and vaccines to Philly's minority neighborhoods
Her cause: Since April 2020, Dr. Ala Stanford has been working to change Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy among people of color. Her group, the Black Doctors Covid-19 Consortium, has brought testing and vaccines to more than 75,000 residents of Philadelphia's minority neighborhoods.
Throughout 2020, they provided free testing in the parking lots of local churches, mosques, community centers and SEPTA stations, eventually offering antibody testing and flu shots as well as Covid testing.
In January, Stanford and her team began offering Covid vaccinations and for the first few months, vaccinated an average of 1,000 people a day. The group also ran a 24-hour "Vax-A-Thon" at which they inoculated more than 4,000 people.
The volunteer effort that Stanford initially funded from her own pocket is now a large operation with 70 employees and more than 200 volunteers.
What inspired her: Born to teen parents in north Philadelphia, Stanford's family often struggled to make ends meet. But that didn't keep her from dreaming big.
"I knew I wanted to be a doctor from the time I was about 8 years old ... and I never believed I couldn't do it," she said. "That grit that comes from being a poor kid raised in Philadelphia is what has given me the tenacity to press on, no matter what."
She became a pediatric surgeon and built a successful private practice. But in March 2020, her work slowed dramatically when the country shut down due to the coronavirus pandemic.
She was disturbed to hear about the high fatalities of Black residents in Philadelphia as a result of Covid-19. Then a Drexel University researcher reported that people in affluent White areas of the city were being tested six times more frequently than those in poor minority areas.
Stanford knew that people of color were more vulnerable to Covid-19 for many reasons, including that they were likely to be essential workers. Knowing they weren't getting tested deeply upset her.
So, she gathered up protective supplies from her office, got testing kits, rented a van and headed out to bring free testing to areas where positivity rates were the highest.
"The first day we did a dozen tests. The second time we went out, we did about 150 tests. And the third time ... there were 500 people lined up before we started," she said.

Made Janur Yasa: A plastic clean-up program that's feeding families
His cause: Made Janur Yasa's non-profit, Plastic Exchange, allows local villagers in Bali, Indonesia, to exchange plastic trash for rice, a main food staple. This barter system benefits the environment and empowers the local people.
In May 2020, he hosted the first exchange in the village where he was born and raised. It was a success, and the concept quickly spread to other villages across Bali.
Villages hold community exchange events once a month in which residents can bring in plastic to trade in for rice. Yasa says the organization has so far helped feed thousands of families and collected nearly 300 tons of plastic for recycling.
What inspired him: Yasa owns a vegan restaurant on Indonesia's island of Bali, where tourism is the driving economic force. When the Covid-19 pandemic hit, many residents lost their jobs.
"I saw people in my village start worrying about how they were going to put food on the table," he said. "This concerned me."
Yasa said he wanted to find a way to help people in his community during the pandemic while also addressing the ongoing problem of plastic pollution on Bali's beaches.
"I got to thinking, inside the challenge there is an opportunity," he said.

Strongest storm to ever hit the West Coast makes landfall over the weekend as millions prepare for severe weather
This weekend, the strongest storm to ever hit the West Coast made landfall causing severe weather and rain in California, according to NBC News.
On Monday, more than 7 million people remained under flood watch alerts and 18 million on high, dangerous wind alerts. As record rainfall continues to fall on the state, much of California was be on landslide, mudslide and flash flooding alerts through Monday night.
California, which is in the middle of a drought, experienced 111-mph winds on Mammoth Mountain this weekend while more than four inches of rain fell on San Francisco, breaking the record for the wettest October day in the area ever.
The storm system, which made its way east, hit Massachusetts hardest Tuesday night and left nearly 500,000 businesses without power as of Wednesday morning, according to The Weather Channel.
However, the storm helped firefighters completely contain the Dixie Fire of 2021, the second-largest wildfire in California, which destroyed 963,309 acres by the end of September.

Last spring, as false claims about vaccine safety threatened to undermine the world‘s response to COVID-19, researchers at Facebook wrote that they could reduce vaccine misinformation by tweaking how vaccine posts show up on users‘ newsfeeds, or by turning off comments entirely. Yet despite internal documents showing these changes worked, Facebook was slow to take action. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File)
Facebook may be facing its most serious crisis yet due to the release of “The Facebook Files,” which caused Wall Street investors to pull their stocks, according to CNN.
On Friday, 17 different U.S. news publications began publishing company documents from Facebook that whistleblower Frances Haugen provided to Congress. The documents included information about groups on Facebook that use the platform to promote violence, information on how human trafficking groups use the platform to exploit users and concerns about the effect of the platform on teenage girls.
Haugen testified before a Senate committee claiming that, “Facebook’s products harm children, stoke division and weaken our democracy.”
As Facebook fights another scandal, Wall Street investors have started to pull their stocks as a way to show their disproval of the company. On Friday, the stocks fell 5% and are now at 15% of what they were earlier this year, according to CNN Business.
Bryan Koslow, the principal of Clarus Group which owns Facebook, said, “There is a bull‘s eye on Facebook‘s back. They have these products and services that are considered to be addictive.”

Two people died and five more are injured after a shooting at a shopping mall in Boise, Idaho, on Monday, according to USA Today.
Boise Police Chief Ryan Lee says officers responded around 1:50 p.m. to the Boise Towne Square shopping mall after reports of shots being fired. The shopping mall is the largest in Idaho. Upon arrival, police identified someone who matched the description of the suspect, which led to an officer being injured.
The suspect, who is in critical condition, is in custody and thought to be the only shooter, Lee said. There has not yet been an identified motive. Officers near the area are investigating a second crime scene that may be related to the shooting.
Idaho Governor Brad Little wrote on Twitter that the shooting was “unthinkable,” adding that his prayers are with those injured in the shooting and their families.
“As we think about those that were hurt today, my heart goes out to those who sheltered in place, those who saw this crime, those who weren’t sure if they’d see a loved one again,” Boise Mayor Lauren McLean stated at a news conference on Monday, adding, “I am deeply, deeply sorry for the pain and trauma you experienced.”
U.S. launches program allowing American sponsors to help resettle Afghan refugees
On Monday, the State Department announced a “historic” new program that allows American citizens to help resettle Afghan refugees in the U.S., according to ABC News.
After the U.S. sparked chaos by leaving Afghanistan this year, the Biden administration brought upwards of 65,000 Afghans to military bases across the nation and plans to bring around 30,000 more before 2022.
However, the process has not been easy or organized, with the refugee resettlement process still struggling due to the difference between the Biden administration‘s strategy and that of the Trump administration, which consisted of drying up funding and lowering admissions.
The new program is called Community Sponsorship Hub and is set up to train and vet groups of private Americans that apply and volunteer to host Afghan refugees in their communities. The volunteer hosts will be supported by organizations like Airbnb, Immigrant services and others.
According to Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, the program, “harnesses this outpouring of support and enables individuals to become directly involved in the welcome and integration of our new neighbors,” and “showcases the powerful role that individuals can play in coming together to welcome and integrate Afghans into American society, reflecting our spirit of goodwill and generosity.”

Since she tested positive for the coronavirus in April 2020, Josie Cabrera Taveras has found herself sleeping for up to 15 hours a day, stopping in grocery store aisles to catch her breath, lapsing in and out of consciousness and unable to return to her job as a nanny.
She believes that she is one of thousands, possibly millions, of Americans who may have a condition known as “long COVID.” The Biden administration has said people with the condition could qualify for federal disability protections and benefits, which can include health care, housing and unemployment benefits.
But like many others who may have long COVID, Taveras, 31, of New York, has had a hard time proving it.
Two brain MRIs, several heart ultrasounds, dozens of lung X-rays, two stomach endoscopies, one colonoscopy and multiple CT scans have all provided the same results: Everything looks normal. “It’s something doctors can’t explain yet, what’s happening to me,” Taveras said.
With no direct medical evidence of her condition, she has been turned down for disability coverage twice. Even a note from a prestigious post-COVID clinic in the Mount Sinai hospital system, attesting that Taveras “continues to experience daily symptoms and is currently unable to work,” was not enough.
In July, at a White House event celebrating the Americans with Disabilities Act, President Joe Biden promised “to make sure Americans with long COVID who have a disability have access to the rights and resources that are due under the disability law.”
But with no widely agreed-on method of diagnosing the ailment, those who believe they have long COVID are finding it difficult to qualify under a system that is unfamiliar and already tricky to navigate.
Studies have shown that a significant number of COVID-19 patients continue to seek treatment for a wide range of medical conditions many months after a diagnosis. The American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation estimates that 3 million to 10 million Americans may have long COVID.
Yet many of those seeking benefits cannot produce a positive coronavirus test, which were in short supply at the beginning of the pandemic. And lab results and scans often show nothing unusual for those continuing to experience symptoms.
“I expect the tests to come back normal,” said Dr. Luis Tatem, an infectious-disease specialist who has been treating Taveras and other long COVID patients at the University Hospital of Brooklyn. He added: “We’re used to having a laboratory to back us up. And for this, you don’t.”
Since December 2020, the Social Security Administration has determined that about 16,000 applicants were able to provide medical evidence supporting COVID-19 as one of their impairments, according to Nicole Tiggemann, a spokesperson for the agency, which was not flagging COVID cases before that.
But she would not say how many of those 16,000 applicants had been approved for benefits, or how many people claiming long COVID as a condition had been denied. Many cases are probably still pending; wait times for a determination can stretch for five months or more.
The pandemic forced the Social Security Administration to largely shut down in-person services, and some experts predict a flood of applicants with long COVID in the coming year, on top of the agency’s already-strained workload.
“Addressing the disability backlog is one of our top priorities,” Tiggemann said via email, acknowledging that the pandemic had increased wait times. Biden has called for an increased $1.3 billion for the agency’s budget for the 2022 fiscal year, but his proposal is part of the current negotiations in Congress, and it is unclear whether it will pass.
About 8.1 million disabled workers and 1.4 million of their family workers receive disability benefits, which average about $1,280 a month. To qualify, applicants must demonstrate a disability that substantially limits their ability to work and has lasted, or will last, for at least a year. Typically, the Social Security Administration uses medical assessments or health records to determine whether someone qualifies, and a vast majority of those approved for disability stay on it for life.
Getting approved can be difficult. Between 2009 and 2018, the Social Security Administration denied 66% of applications on average.
But some people with long COVID symptoms have had success — even without a positive coronavirus test — if they are able to demonstrate a substantial downturn in their health and ability to work.
Steven Trompeter, 49, was unable to perform his job as an industrial mechanic after getting sick with COVID symptoms, including cough, fever, muscle aches and loss of taste and smell, in February 2020. He applied for disability in December 2020 and was approved six months later.
Trompeter, a Navy veteran who lives in Idaho Falls, Idaho, said he believed that the extensive medical records documenting his past health and his repeated visits to a Veterans Affairs medical clinic in 2020 helped show how sick he had become, with ongoing “brain fog” and other difficulties.
“I’ve heard nightmares where you have to get denied three times and then get a lawyer to go before a judge, and I didn’t have to do any of that,” he said. “I just had to wait.”
Tiggemann said a determination of whether people qualify for benefits has more to do with how their symptoms affect their ability to function than the exact diagnosis. So a positive COVID test, while helpful, might not be necessary if the other evidence clearly shows an inability to work, she said.
“No two cases are the same, each case is individual,” she said. “We look at doctor’s tests, medical records, past treatments and whether they have other conditions.”
Long COVID has proved similar to other diseases that can be difficult to diagnose, including myalgic encephalomyelitis (also known as chronic fatigue syndrome), fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis and post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome — conditions that can also cause fatigue, memory issues and joint pain.
Patients with these diseases often find it difficult to qualify for disability benefits and get accurate, timely medical diagnoses. Studies from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and organizations that represent people with those conditions have shown that some patients can spend years or even more than a decade trying to determine what causes their illnesses.
Many medical schools do not offer enough training on these types of diseases, and research for them is underfunded, said Linda Tannenbaum, chief executive of the Open Medicine Foundation, a nonprofit that funds research into chronic complex diseases like fibromyalgia and long COVID. “Most patients cannot get disability benefits,” she said.
Dr. Stephen Martin, a physician and professor at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, said the complex nature of diagnosing long COVID required the coordination of various specialists who also have specific knowledge of the condition. Many are overbooked, he said, with wait lists of more than six months — especially for patients who do not have good health insurance.
“This really hits us in our Achilles’ heel of health care,” Martin said. “The American health care system really isn’t set up to do this at scale.”
Sandee Babb, 54, of Grand Rapids, Michigan, has seen nearly two dozen doctors over the past year trying to figure out what is causing a range of symptoms, including cardiac arrhythmia, a chronic cough, shortness of breath and joint pain, which have kept her from returning to her job as a teacher and librarian. She says she gets breathless just trying to put her socks on, and cannot walk up a flight of stairs without stopping to rest.
“The brain fog is crazy bad,” Babb said. “I’ve been in the shower and stared at my shampoo bottle and couldn’t figure out how to open it.”
She could not get a coronavirus test when she first got sick in March 2020, early in the pandemic. But a September progress note from her doctor said her symptoms “could be consistent with long-haul type syndrome.”
Since getting sick, Babb has lost her home and all of her retirement savings. She is working as a live-in caretaker for a quadriplegic friend in part to keep a roof over her head.
After months documenting her condition, she submitted her unemployment application in August and is not sure when she will get an answer. “If it doesn’t come through, then I’m really stuck,” she said. “Where do I go from here?” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Texto completo: Hundreds of thousands of New Englanders were dealing with power outages and debris cleanup Wednesday after a nor'easter strengthened into a "bomb cyclone" and tore through the region, downing trees and power lines with winds that sometimes reached hurricane strength.
The storm, which flooded parts of the Northeast on Tuesday, picked up strength as the day progressed and battered coastal areas with extreme winds into Wednesday morning.
At the outages' peak Wednesday morning, more than 600,000 homes and businesses were without power in New England, with the majority being in Massachusetts, according to PowerOutage.us.
As of about 5 p.m. ET that number had improved to about 514,000, with almost 459,000 outages in Massachusetts. Almost all the other power disruptions were in Rhode Island.
Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker said at a news conference that utility workers are doing their best to restore power.
"National Grid and Eversource and the other utilities are already working to restore power where they can, but in some cases, they do need to wait until the winds come down before it's really going to be safe to get up into a bucket truck," the governor said.
Baker emphasized that residents needed to treat any downed wire as a live wire and report it.
Storm leaving, winds should die down
With the storm heading out to sea, most of New England will begin to see winds die down, except for those areas along the coast where winds may remain gusty through the evening.
Numerous trees were downed across the Boston area. In Milton, just south of Boston, a tree fell onto Colleen McCarthy's home, coming to rest on the roof above a bedroom where a 3-year-old was sleeping, CNN affiliate WBZ reported. No one was hurt.
"I've never been in an earthquake, but that was my first reaction. Our whole house shook. We heard a crack. It really did. It felt like an earthquake," McCarthy told WBZ.
Wind also caused damage along parts of Massachusetts' South Shore. In the coastal town of Cohasset, several boats were blown aground, trees were uprooted and a press box was blown off the stands at a high school athletic field, leaving it smashed and splintered, police said.
Wind gusts of 74 mph or stronger were recorded Wednesday morning in some parts of Massachusetts and Rhode Island -- enough for the National Weather Service to urge coastal residents to stay away from windows. Gusts of 94 mph were clocked in Edgartown, Massachusetts.
The severe gusts moved the weather service to advise people to not drive in southeastern Massachusetts.
A "bomb cyclone" is a rapidly strengthening storm that increases at least 24 millibars (a unit of pressure) in 24 hours -- and typically the lower the pressure, the stronger the storm.
The storm, which delivered about 2 to 8 inches of rain in short order over parts of several states from Tuesday into Wednesday, led the governors of New Jersey and New York to declare states of emergency in advance, just weeks after Hurricane Ida left severe flooding there in early September.
River flooding still was underway Wednesday from New York to Virginia, the weather service's Middle Atlantic River Forecast Center said.
'One of the worst I've seen'
Joe Kidston was one of the Massachusetts residents without power Wednesday morning. The electricity went out at his home in Hingham as howling wind pushed down trees around 3 a.m., he said.
"It was one of the worst I've seen," Kidston said of the storm.
Kidston posted video of the storm and its aftermath on Twitter, showing strong and noisy winds during the night and downed tree limbs in the morning.
The debris blocked the road leading to his home.
"We live on a dead end street," he said on Twitter, sharing photos of the trees. "Looks like we're stuck here for a while."
Plymouth County, where Hingham is located, had wind gusts ranging from 40 mph to 85 mph.
CNN's Amy Simonson, Paul P. Murphy, Judson Jones and Monica Garrett contributed to this report.

COVID Cases Keep Falling

The number of new daily COVID-19 cases in the United States has plunged 57% since peaking on Sept. 1. Almost as encouraging as the magnitude of the decline is its breadth: Cases have been declining in every region.
Forecasting COVID’s future is extremely difficult, and it’s certainly possible that cases will rise again in the coming weeks. But the geographic breadth of the decline does offer reason for optimism.
Past COVID increases have generally started in one part of the country — like the South this summer or the New York region in early 2020 — and then gone national. Today, there is no regional surge that seems to have the makings of a nationwide surge.
Yes, there are some local hot spots, as has almost always been the case since the pandemic began. Several of the hot spots are in northern parts of the country, like Alaska, Idaho, Montana, North Dakota and a few counties near the Canadian border in New Hampshire and Vermont. This pattern has led to some speculation that the onset of cold weather is causing the increases by moving more activity indoors — and that the entire country will soon experience a rise in caseloads.
That does not seem to be the most likely scenario, however. In most colder regions, including both Canada and the densely populated parts of the northern U.S., cases are still falling. The biggest problem for Alaska and the Mountain West is probably not the weather; it’s the vaccine skepticism. Idaho is the nation’s least vaccinated state, and several other Western states are only slightly ahead of it.
The CDC tracks a range of COVID forecasting models. On average, the models predict that new daily cases in the U.S. will fall roughly another 20% over the next three weeks.
The bottom line: There is no reason to expect another COVID surge anytime soon, but surges don’t always announce themselves in advance.
When the delta variant began spreading this summer, many people worried that it was both much more contagious than earlier versions of the virus and much more severe. Only one of those two fears seems to be true.
Delta is clearly more contagious, which is the main reason that every metric of the pandemic — cases, hospitalizations and deaths — soared this summer. But a typical COVID case during the delta wave was about as severe as a typical case during the earlier stages of the pandemic. During the wave in late 2020 and early this year, about 1.2% of positive cases led to death; during the delta wave, the share was 1.1%.
Scientific studies trying to answer the severity question more precisely have come to conflicting conclusions. Some have found delta to be more severe than other versions of the virus, and others have found that it is not. Until the research becomes clearer, the best guess may be that delta is modestly more severe, which could explain why hospitalizations and death rates have held steady even as vaccination rates have risen.
“Delta may be a little more serious, but not materially so,” Dr. Robert Wachter, chair of the department of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, said.
This pattern can influence how you think about your day-to-day activities. If you are vaccinated (and boosted, if eligible) and you were comfortable socializing indoors and without a mask last spring, you can probably feel comfortable doing so again, now or soon. Wachter adds: “Some older people or those with medical conditions may want to be sure that everybody else indoors with them is vaccinated before removing their mask.”
Despite all the encouraging news, one shadow still hangs over the U.S.: The pandemic does not need to be nearly as bad it is.
About 1,500 Americans have died of COVID every day over the past week. For older age groups, the virus remains a leading cause of death. And the main reason is that millions of Americans have chosen to remain unvaccinated. Many of them are older and have underlying medical conditions, leaving them vulnerable to severe versions of COVID.
For older people, the effects of vaccination are profound. In late August, near the height of the delta wave, 24 out of every 10,000 unvaccinated Americans 65 and above were hospitalized with COVID symptoms, according to the CDC. Among fully vaccinated Americans 65 and above, the number was 1.5 per 10,000.
Even so, many Americans are saying no to a shot. Among affluent countries, the U.S. is one of the least vaccinated, trailing Canada, Australia, Japan, South Korea, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and others. Less vaccination means more death.
The low vaccination rate in the U.S. is another consequence of the country’s polarized politics and its high levels of socioeconomic inequality. Only 67% of American adults without a four-year college degree have received a shot, compared with 82% of college graduates, according to the most recent Kaiser Family Foundation poll. And only 58% of self-identified Republicans are vaccinated, compared with 90% of Democrats.
It is a triumph of misinformation: Offered a lifesaving vaccine to counteract a highly contagious virus, many Americans are instead choosing to take their chances. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Texto completo: The accused gunman in an Idaho mall shooting on Monday died Tuesday at a local hospital, according to a news release from the Boise Police Department.
The Ada County Coroner's Office identified the suspect as Jacob Bergquist, 27. He was injured during an exchange of gunfire with a police officer Monday, BPD said.
Bergquist had previous run-ins with mall security, Boise Police Chief Ryan Lee said during a news conference Tuesday.
"They were generally what we would categorize as disorderly conduct sort of calls in nature, trespass calls in nature, for disruptive behavior," Lee said, adding that police had contact with Bergquist in the past and he was a known subject of police reports, but they had no reason to arrest him.
Two other people -- a 49-year-old man and a 26-year-old man -- were killed when the gunman opened fire at Boise Towne Square Mall, the release said.
Three other people were injured in the shooting. Two were identified as a 52-year-old woman and a 23-year-old woman, the release said. Both were injured while inside a store and had non-life-threatening injuries.
The third person was a 68-year-old woman who was shot while inside her car, the release said. She also had non-life-threatening injuries.
A Boise police officer was also injured in the shooting. The officer was treated and released, officials said.
The release says officers responded to the mall for reports of shots fired at 1:30 p.m. Monday.
"Callers indicated a white male adult, dressed in black, in possession of guns, had fired multiple shots inside of the building," the release said.
A preliminary investigation showed the gunman shot a security officer on the first floor of the mall, who later died at the scene. The gunman then continued firing multiple rounds inside the mall, hitting a glass escalator and a second victim who died at a hospital, the release said.
Officers arrived at 1:53 p.m. and confronted the gunman. An exchange of gunfire took place between the gunman and at least one officer, the release said.
Video streamed by a reporter from CNN affiliate KBOI showed several police cars and one ambulance outside the main entrance to the Macy's department store. The video shows one person being brought out on a gurney and loaded into the ambulance. Another person sits on the bumper of a police SUV while several emergency workers tend to his head.
"A preliminary investigation shows the suspect was in possession of multiple firearms and ammunition on scene at the mall," the release said. "(Eighteen) spent shell casings were recovered from inside the building."
A search warrant was executed Tuesday at a home on Fry Street in Boise today, the release said.
"We have been coordinating with our local, state and federal partners to investigate rumors and reports from social media and there is no evidence of additional planned attacks or ongoing threats to the public," the release said. "All evidence indicates the suspect was acting alone."
Police said they are in the process of notifying family members of the people involved.
Officers were going from one merchant to the next, clearing each business, police added.
Lee said most of the mall -- which has 153 stores, according to its website -- has been cleared.
Idaho Gov. Brad Little said the shooting is "unthinkable" and he was praying for the people who were injured. He said the state was ready to help police investigate the shooting.
Lee said a county task force would investigate the officer-involved part of the shooting.

Texto completo: West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice said Friday that he would welcome three western Maryland counties whose Republican legislators have asked to join the state.
"Absolutely, without any question, the invitation is wide open," Justice, a Republican, said Friday, adding, "We want everyone to always know that we're absolutely standing here with open arms, we welcome these counties and would be tickled to death to have them."
A handful of Republican lawmakers from Maryland's Allegany, Garrett, and Washington counties sent two letters this month to West Virginia's top Republican legislators asking them to consider adding their counties to West Virginia.
Such a proposal, however, would be difficult because state legislatures have to approve any moves, followed by the US Congress taking action.
"We believe this arrangement may be mutually beneficial for both states and for our local constituencies. Please advise on next steps," the Maryland lawmakers, which includes House Minority Leader Jason Buckel, wrote. The other Maryland lawmakers are Sen. George Edwards, Dels. William Wivell, Wendell Beitzel and Mike McKay. CNN has reached out to the lawmakers for comment.
Justice on Friday announced his intent to put the issue to a vote in a special legislative session, while also acknowledging the difficulty in such a process and calling it an "unprecedented opportunity."
CNN has contacted the Maryland governor's office for comment but did not immediately hear back.
Last year, West Virginia Republicans encouraged conservative residents in Virginia counties to leave for West Virginia.
West Virginia GOP Del. Gary Howell, the Speaker Pro Tempore, said Friday that Beitzel, who represents Garrett and Allegany Counties, reached out to him several months ago to see if a similar offer stood for them.
The Maryland legislators came to Charleston to meet with Howell, West Virginia Senate President Craig Blair and House Speaker Roger Hanshaw about the process of joining their state, according to Howell.
Both Blair and Hanshaw on Friday welcomed the prospect of the counties joining their state, with Blair calling it "a fit that would work very well for the people in both West Virginia and Maryland."
Justice's invitation for three of Maryland's 23 counties to join West Virginia underscores a tension seen in many states: In places like Maryland, largely Democratic urban areas are home to most of the population, and therefore ensure the party's control of statehouses -- to the chagrin of voters in its rural, Republican-leaning western portion. In other states, such as Texas, heavily Democratic cities have little influence in statehouses where larger suburban and rural areas deliver control to Republicans.
The urban and rural divide has grown more prevalent in recent years -- a reality on display in West Virginia, where Justice, who was first elected governor as a Democrat, switched parties in 2017 and then ran for re-election as a Republican.
Border changes to US states are exceedingly rare
International borders with Mexico and Canada have seen minor changes over time as a result of rivers slowly shifting paths, such as in 2009, when six islands along the Rio Grande were ceded from Texas to Mexico. Maritime borders and claims to territory outside the continental United States have also changed.
However, after states have been formed, substantial changes to their borders are exceedingly rare.
Typically, states are fighting over tiny strips of land. In 2013, North and South Carolina clarified a boundary that resulted in 19 homes moving into a different state. In 1961, about 20 acres was transferred from Minnesota to South Dakota. In 1950, Kansas and Missouri swapped small areas due to the Missouri River's changing path.
Bigger changes, though, are infrequent. The best example remains West Virginia's break from Virginia during the Civil War. West Virginia split off and remained a part of the union, while the rest of the state seceded and joined the Confederacy.
Still, with one of the major dividing lines in American politics being urban voters who typically back Democrats and rural voters who largely support Republicans, calls to shift state boundaries pop up from time to time.
Earlier this year, five counties in rural eastern Oregon voted to attempt to break off from the state and join Idaho.
In March, in response to Minnesota Democratic Gov. Tim Walz's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, two Republican lawmakers introduced a bill that sought to establish a process for counties to leave the state.
Republican Kristi Noem, the governor of neighboring South Dakota, tweeted in response to the bill: "In South Dakota, we roll out the red carpet for people who love personal responsibility and Freedom."
That bill never got a hearing or a vote. A host of proposals from local and state officials elsewhere have similarly failed to get off the ground in recent decades.
State lawmakers in Illinois in recent years have proposed breaking Chicago or Cook County into its own state, separate from the rest of Illinois. Local officials in Florida have at various times discussed breaking the state into two: North Florida and South Florida. Residents of rural Nevada have petitioned to break away from a state where the politics are largely controlled by the more liberal Clark County, the home of Las Vegas and most of the state's population.
California has regularly seen proposals to break off bits into smaller states -- and a group advocating moving rural eastern Oregon into Idaho also called for part of California to be moved into the state.
This story has been updated with additional information.

Utah’s new Covid cases are dropping, but hospitals remain overwhelmed.

Texto completo: While the number of daily Covid cases in Utah has begun to fall, the state’s hospitals are still overwhelmed and public health leaders are asking residents not to let their guards down.
There were 570 people hospitalized with Covid-19 on Wednesday, nearing the state’s peak in January, when vaccines weren’t yet widely available, according to a New York Times database. Although new coronavirus cases are trending down, the number of Covid patients remains high and is overstretching hospitals in Utah.
That is why public health leaders in a news briefing on Wednesday warned people to remain vigilant and get vaccinated.
“Now is not the time to let your guard down. Covid is not over,” Dr. Russell Vinik, the chief medical officer at the University of Utah Health, said at the news briefing.
The difference between this latest surge and last winter’s is that Utah doesn’t have as many health care workers to treat Covid patients, Dr. Vinik said. Patients who can no longer delay routine care are streaming back into medical facilities. Health care workers across the country are quitting from burnout, while some in Utah have been lured to other states, such as Nebraska and New York, with the promise of extra pay.
Nationally, Covid hospitalizations are trending downward, according to a New York Times database, but cases and hospitalizations have plateaued at high levels in several states in the Mountain West and Upper Midwest.
Hospitalizations in Idaho set a pandemic record on Oct. 2, but are trending slightly downward again. In Wyoming and Montana, hospitalizations have nearly reached peak levels in recent weeks.
The rate of fully vaccinated people in Utah — 52 percent — is lower than the national figure of 57 percent, according to a New York Times database. But the state’s vaccination rate is still far ahead of most of its neighbors, including Idaho and Wyoming.

National Dessert Day 2021: Delicious American favorites you can't resist

Texto completo: October 14 is National Dessert Day.
In celebration, CNN Travel did a delicious dive into its archives to uncover six of the best desserts spread across the nation:
Apple pie
According to the American Pie Council, apple really is the US national favorite.
Not to burst the patriotic bubble, but it's not an American food of indigenous origin.
Food critic John Mariani dates the appearance of apple pies in the United States to 1780, long after they were popular in England. Apples aren't even native to the continent; the Pilgrims brought seeds.
So what's the deal with the star-spangled association? The pie council's John Lehndorff explains: "When you say that something is 'as American as apple pie,' what you're really saying is that the item came to this country from elsewhere and was transformed into a distinctly American experience."
And you're saying Americans know something good enough to be an icon when we eat it, with or without the cheddar cheese or vanilla ice cream on top. -- Dana Joseph
Blueberry cobbler
Also charmingly called slump, grunt and buckle, cobbler got its start with early oven-less colonists who came up with the no-crust-on-the-bottom fruit dish that could cook in a pan or pot over a fire.
They might have been lofting a mocking revolutionary middle finger at the mother country by making a sloppy American version of the refined British steamed fruit and dough pudding.
Cobblers become doubly American when made with blueberries, which are native to North America (Maine practically has a monopoly on them).
We love blueberries for how they sex up practically any crust, dough, or batter, maybe most of all in cobblers and that other all-American favorite, the blueberry muffin. -- Dana Joseph
Coconut Cake
Bouncy, buttery rounds of vanilla cake are piled high with shredded coconut and seven-minute frosting for a classic Southern dessert. This is the kind of all-American sweet that stars at potlucks, cake walks and church picnics, and it's often made with recipes passed down on hand-written recipe cards.
There are dozens of versions, but every single one is cloaked in a frothy layer of shredded coconut ... preferably fresh.
Layer cakes weren't invented in the United States, but the distinctive profile of the coconut cake is pure Americana, and there's no mistaking the high, round shape of an American layer cake for a slim European torte. Despite the minimalist, all-white color scheme, the coconut cake is an over-the-top, old-fashioned pleasure. -- Jen Rose Smith
Doughnuts
In the Pantheon of world desserts, fried dough is a mainstay.
Everything from French beignets to Greek loukoumades are doughnuts of a kind, and it's no wonder they're so beloved; a quick swim in boiling oil transforms simple bread dough into a fast and filling treat. But it's latter day American doughnuts that really shine with their creative approach to fillings and flavors.
From Portland, Maine's The Holy Donut to Voodoo Doughnut in Portland, Oregon, the old-school doughnut has been loaded down under piles of maple frosting, crispy bacon, fresh fruit glazes and boozy toppings that take the sweet into uncharted territory. -- Jen Rose Smith
Key lime pie
If life gives you limes, don't make limeade, make a Key lime pie.
The official state pie of Florida, this sassy tart has made herself a worldwide reputation, which started in -- where else? -- the Florida Keys, from whence come the tiny limes that gave the pie its name.
Aunt Sally, a cook for Florida's first self-made millionaire, ship salvager William Curry, gets the credit for making the first Key lime pie in the late 1800s. But you might also thank Florida sponge fisherman for likely originating the concoction of key lime juice, sweetened condensed milk, and egg yolks, which could be "cooked" (by a thickening chemical reaction of the ingredients) at sea. -- Dana Joseph
Twinkies
Hostess' iconic "Golden Sponge Cake with Creamy Filling" has been sugaring us up since James Dewar invented it at the Continental Baking Company in Schiller Park, Illinois, in 1930.
The Twinkie forsook its original banana cream filling for vanilla when bananas were scarce during World War II. As if they weren't ridiculously good enough already, the Texas State Fair started the fad of deep-frying them.
Dumped in hot oil or simply torn from their packaging, Twinkies endear with their name (inspired by a billboard advertising Twinkle Toe Shoes), their ladyfinger shape (pierced three times to inject the filling), and their evocations of lunchtime recess. -- Dana Joseph

Covid-19 infections are declining in the US. But hospitalizations are still high in some hot spots

Texto completo: While the rate of Covid-19 infections nationwide is slowing, health care systems in some parts of the country are struggling with hospital wings still packed with patients.
Montana, for instance, is facing new highs this week in coronavirus hospitalizations, with 533 Covid-19 patients in hospitals as of Wednesday, according to the US Department of Health and Human Services. This eclipses the high set in November, before vaccines were readily available, according to HHS and data from the Covid Tracking Project.
The percentages of ICU beds used for Covid-19 patients in Montana, along with neighboring Idaho and Wyoming, are among the highest in the country, HHS data showed.
This comes as vaccine advisers to the US Food and Drug Administration are meeting Thursday to discuss whether to authorize boosters of Moderna's coronavirus vaccine for some adults, with a recommendation vote scheduled for the afternoon.
But as Covid-19 hot spots like those in the Rockies emerge from the surge driven by the more infectious Delta variant, many doctors and officials are more focused on the millions of Americans who still aren't vaccinated at all -- and they say the pandemic will simmer as long as so many remain unvaccinated.
"Sadly, today I'm here to tell you that we've lost the war. That Covid is here to stay," Dr. Steven Nemerson, chief clinical officer with Saint Alphonsus Health System in Boise, Idaho, said Wednesday. "And the reason it is here to stay is because we cannot vaccinate enough of the public to fully eradicate the disease."
Idaho has been slammed by the pandemic over the last two months. Coroners and funeral homes reported running out of storage space for bodies last month due to the increase in deaths.
The day that the first vaccine was released last December was the pandemic's equivalent of D-Day, Nemerson said, and Covid-19 will be a recurring problem for years to come because the US failed to meet the challenge.
"There are episodes, at least on an annual basis, that we'll have to deal with," Nemerson said Tuesday during a briefing hosted by the state Department of Health and Welfare.
Hospitalizations at Saint Alphonsus have declined recently, Nemerson said, but that's doing little more than giving exhausted health professionals a chance to come up for air, particularly as workers face hostility from some Covid-19 patients and families.
"None of us are superhuman, and we all have a limit to how much work we're able to do, and how much stress and despondency we're able to handle," he said, "and that's compounded by the fact that too many people are coming into our hospitals questioning what we do."
In other parts of the country, some hospitals remain stretched thin. Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, New Mexico and Texas have 15% or less of their ICU capacity available to Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 patients, according to HHS data.
Idaho and Montana are two of 15 states that have still yet to fully vaccinate at least half of all residents, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A CNN analysis of federal health data last month found that during one week, the average rate of Covid-19 deaths was more than four times higher in the 10 least-vaccinated states compared to the 10 most-vaccinated states.
Abiding with vaccination regulations
After the Biden administration announced last month that new vaccination rules would be imposed on federal workers and large employers, many private companies and public bodies began establishing compliance rules.
At Boeing, with many of its 140,000 employees working stateside, the aerospace giant announced that its US-based employees will need to show proof of vaccination or "have an approved reasonable accommodation" by December 8.
Smaller employers in certain cities are also working to stay in compliance. In the 30 days since New York City started enforcing its own vaccine requirement for most indoor activities, authorities have generally found success, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Wednesday.
Around 31,000 inspections have been conducted, which includes installation of proper signage and checking for proof of vaccination, the mayor said.
Around 6,000 warnings were issued, according to NYC Small Businesses Services commissioner Jonnel Doris, yet de Blasio said only 15 businesses following the warnings were still found to be in violation and fined.
"To all the small business owners, to all the employees who made this work: Thank you," de Blasio said.
The city's overall vaccination rate has increased by 9% since the city's mandate began, he said.
As for public employees in other cities, approximately 812 Boston city employees are still not in compliance with the city's Covid-19 regulations, down from 1,400 reported last week, according to a statement from Mayor Kim Janey's office. These employees have been placed on unpaid leave.
The Los Angeles Unified School District, the nation's second-largest, has pushed back its deadline for teachers and employees to be fully vaccinated against Covid-19 until Friday, according to a district spokesperson.
Boosters are up more than first doses, data shows
While health officials work to get as many first doses into the arms of Americans as possible, federal health data shows that the rate of boosters being administered is outpacing initial inoculations.
An average of 813,690 doses are being administered each day, but first doses -- or new vaccinations -- account for only about a quarter of all doses being administered, according to CDC data.
Booster doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine have been authorized for those at higher risk for Covid-19, and advisers at the US Food and Drug Administration are set to meet Thursday and Friday to review data and consider booster applications from Moderna as well as Johnson & Johnson.
An ongoing conversation among health experts is whether a mix-and-match strategy of using a booster from a different vaccine maker may prove safe or even more beneficial.
A preprint of a National Institutes of Health study, which has yet to be peer-reviewed or published, suggests that mixing boosters in different combinations among the three vaccines produced a robust immune response.
"The most important takeaways are two things. One is that all of these different nine combinations are safe, as in there are no new or different side effects, so all of these appear to be safe," CNN medical analyst and emergency physician Dr. Leana Wen told CNN on Wednesday.
"The second big takeaway is that all of these combinations induced a pretty strong, robust antibody response. So that actually justifies the mix-and-match approach," she said.
The Moderna application will be considered Thursday, and Johnson & Johnson's is set for Friday. Discussion from members of the FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, or VRBPAC, will then turn to mix-and-match boosters.
CNN's Andy Rose, Laura Ly, Maggie Fox, Jen Christensen, Deidre McPhillips, Rob McLean, Alex Harring and Mallory Simon contributed to this report.

Kindergarten often brings a flood of notices about events, school supplies and class photos. But when Vaniqua Hudson-Figueroa’s daughter started at a public school in New York City four years ago, there was one that Hudson-Figueroa wasn’t expecting: The city had opened a college savings account in her child’s name — and it already had $100 in it.
For Hudson-Figueroa, the account opens up possibilities she didn’t know she had when she was her daughter’s age.
“When I was a kid, nobody spoke about college,” she said. “There was nothing to talk about.”
The account for her daughter, Mia Issabela, was part of a pilot program that New York City is now opening to every public school kindergartner. Roughly 70,000 students are receiving a college savings account with $100 already invested and the potential to receive up to $200 more.
The establishment of a program by the largest school system in the country is the latest governmental endorsement of accounts meant to use modest investments to help set every child on the path to education beyond high school.
By the time the kindergartners are ready to graduate from high school, the average account is projected to be worth roughly $3,000 — hardly enough to cover books for a four-year degree, even today. But proponents say their value exceeds mere dollars: Researchers have suggested that even small sums in a dedicated college account can significantly increase a child’s likelihood of pursuing higher education.
Hudson-Figueroa, a 29-year-old personal assistant and now president of the PTA at her daughter’s school, said the account had sparked conversations about higher education that never happened for her. Her father died when she was 14, and her mother was unable to work after having several strokes.
“My daughter thinks about it all the time,” said Hudson-Figueroa, who is pursuing a dual bachelor’s and master’s degree in education and psychology. “She knows she has money in there.”
Child savings account programs — also known as child development accounts — have been steadily gaining momentum over the past decade, with initiatives stretching from San Francisco to Maine, two of the earliest pioneers. The money is generally invested in state-run 529 college savings plans, where earnings grow tax-free over time. Withdrawals are free of income and capital gains taxes as long as the money is used for eligible expenses associated with higher education or career training.
State and local governments, as well as school districts and nonprofit groups, set up these programs intending for them to become not only part of the classroom conversation but also part of the community fabric. With the account infrastructure in place, it is easier for local groups, corporations and others to direct money to students, experts said, particularly those with fewer resources.
“I certainly began my research thinking about how really small amounts of money can matter,” said William Elliott III, a professor of social work at the University of Michigan who found that even modest accounts make a child three or four times as likely to pursue higher education. “But I don’t want to lose track of the fact that one of the really important things these kinds of programs do is they provide the infrastructure to transfer wealth to lower-income families.”
Elliott can relate. He grew up in poverty in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania, dropped out of high school and can recall taking walks with his mother through more affluent neighborhoods where they fantasized about living someday. That helped them get through the day, he said, but it didn’t give them any sense of tangible hope.
The accounts can, Elliott said, by offering students and parents a sense of control.
“They feel like they can change their destiny and their future,” he said.
New York’s program automatically enrolls all students regardless of their household financial or immigration status. Shortly after receiving news of their child’s $100 account, families are encouraged to take a series of steps to earn more: Activate the account; open their own 529 account, link it to the scholarship account; and deposit at least $5 into their own. At each of those steps, which will be possible beginning in January, they will earn up to $25.
After that, they will receive a dollar, up to $100, for every dollar saved from first through fifth grade. All money is invested in the NY 529 Direct Plan, in a basket of low-cost Vanguard mutual funds, which gradually become more conservative as high school graduation approaches. Students must use the scholarship money within 20 years of completing kindergarten; otherwise, it will be returned to the program to help future students.
“The big idea is that every kid graduating is going to have a real resource for their higher education for college or career training,” said Debra-Ellen Glickstein, executive director of NYC Kids RISE, the nonprofit organization that manages the program in partnership with the city and its Department of Education.
“That is a message that is being sent from the school, and it is a tool for communities, no matter which community that is, to reinforce the message about what is possible,” she added.
For every public dollar invested, the city expects a return of $15 to $20, generated through philanthropy, family savings, scholarships and investment returns. The city said it would invest $15 million in the program through 2025, while the Gray Foundation, through NYC Kids Rise, provided an additional $15 million.
In 2019, California, Colorado, Illinois and Nebraska passed legislation to create programs, and according to Prosperity Now, there were more than 922,000 children’s savings account programs in 36 states at the end of 2020. That was up 30% from the previous year, with most growth driven by state and city-run programs with automatic enrollment, including initiatives in Maine, Pennsylvania, Nevada and San Francisco.
Pennsylvania’s Keystone Scholars program, created in 2018, is one of the largest statewide programs, and automatically provides newborns with $100.
Devon Tiller’s 6-month-old son, Ayvion, was one of them. Just a few months after he was born, Tiller, a single mother who recently started a second job as a material handler in a warehouse, received a letter explaining that a college account had been opened for her son, with materials on how she could also set up one of her own.
“I had talked to my mom about it, and she and I thought it would have been an amazing thing to get started for my son,” said Tiller, 29, of Lancaster, who is also trying to open up an account for her 7-year-old daughter, Nevaeh.
Feeling unprepared after high school, Tiller struggled in community college and ultimately dropped out. “I know life is hard,” she said, “and I don’t want to see them struggle like I have to.”
Child savings accounts were conceived 30 years ago by Michael Sherraden, founder of the Center for Social Development at Washington University in St. Louis, who proposed creating accounts for all children at birth. Since 2007, he has been the lead investigator in an experiment tracking 2,700 newborns in Oklahoma randomly assigned to two groups: Half received $1,000 accounts at birth; the other received nothing. Many programs draw on the center’s research, which has found that the accounts raise both the parents’ and child’s expectations about the child’s future.
Thus far, the biggest beneficiaries of 529 accounts have been more-affluent families who open them on their own. There were 14.3 million 529 accounts totaling $437 billion in assets at the end of June, according to ISS Market Intelligence, a financial research and analytics firm.
But proponents believe that automatically starting accounts will help change that, and can ultimately contribute to narrowing the wealth gap; New York’s so-called baby bonds program is just one part of a broader economic justice initiative. In the pilot school district, certain students living in public housing in Astoria, Queens, already have more than $1,500 in their accounts, thanks in part to scholarships raised through the tenant association.
A similar effort helped Hudson-Figueroa’s daughter, now in fourth grade, raise her balance to more than $500. The Woodside Houses Resident Association helped raise $35,800 — roughly $218 each — for first through fourth graders at P.S. 151.
As the school’s PTA president, Hudson-Figueroa is now helping other parents, answering questions and guiding them through the steps they need to take to maximize the savings they are eligible for.
“The main question I get most of the time is, ‘What do I have to do?’” she said. “And the best part of it is, I can tell them, ‘Your child is already enrolled.’” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Texto completo: A pilot from World War II has finally been laid to rest 76 years after his death.
US Army Air Forces 2nd Lt. Ernest N. Vienneau was 25 in 1944 when his plane was shot down over present-day Slovenia, according to a news release from the Department of Defense.
His B-17 Flying Fortress bomber came under heavy fire during a mission and a piece of flank tore through the cockpit and struck Vienneau in the head, killing him, the release said. The crew treated him and tried to make it back to base but had to ditch the aircraft off the coast of Croatia with Vienneau's body inside.
His body couldn't be found until recently.
His remains were recovered last fall after crews excavated the crash site discovered in 2005, the release said. He was officially identified by the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA) in April using dental and anthropological analysis, as well as circumstantial and material evidence.
Vienneu's remains were then returned to his hometown of Millinocket, Maine, and buried on Saturday next to his parents.
"As veterans we take care of our own the best we can and their families. It's been very emotional for a lot of people up here and to find somebody from World War II. It doesn't happen too often," Paul L'Heureux, Department Adjutant for the American Legion Department of Maine, told CNN affiliate WABI.
Members of his family, veterans, and the community all came to pay their respects, WABI reported.
Vienneu's name has been recorded on the Walls of the Missing at the Florence American Cemetery, an American Battle Monuments Commission site in Impruneta, Italy, and now a rosette will show he has been accounted for.

Texto completo: - Idaho Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin put a vaccine passport order in place while the governor was away last week.
- Gov. Little said he would be "rescinding and reversing" McGeachin's order when he gets back from Texas.
- McGeachin has announced she will run for governor in 2022, where she will likely face off with Little, who is expected to seek reelection.

Idaho Lieutenant Governor Janice McGeachin sidestepped questions and walked off an interview with CNN when she was questioned about her recent executive actions that some have criticized as political grandstanding.
McGeachin, a far-right Republican, butted heads with Idaho Governor Brad Little when she issued a ban on so-called vaccine passports in schools and attempted to deploy the state's National Guard while Little was out of state this week. Little, also a Republican, said he would reverse McGeachin's actions, stating he had "not authorized the Lt. Governor to act on my behalf."
"Our constitution states that when the governor leaves the state, all duties that apply to the office of the governor then fall to the lieutenant governor," McGeachin said in an interview with CNN's Dan Simon.
"But you know what you're doing. You're running for governor, but when he leaves town, you're issuing these orders. You're undermining what he's doing when you're doing this," Simon said.
"I'm not going to talk anymore to an activist. If you're asking me fair questions as a reporter, then that's fine, but if you're going to be an activist..." McGeachin said.
Simon said he wasn't "being an activist" and asked how McGeachin responds to her critics.
"I am not anti-vax. I am not anti-testing of COVID. We know a lot of people that are suffering from this right now, but I am very much against it being a mandate in our state, and that's what this is all about," McGeachin said.
Simon said that Gov. Little "never mandated anything," at which point McGeachin said "interview's over," and walked away.
McGeachin has announced she will run for governor in 2022, where she will likely face off with Little, who is expected to seek reelection.
Jim Jones, the former Chief Justice of the Idaho Supreme Court, said in an interview with CNN that McGeachin "acted like an idiot."

Texto completo: Students began flocking back to the six campuses of the University of Maine this fall hoping for a more normal college experience, one without shutdowns or Zoom classes.
As those tens of thousands of students returned to residence halls and full classrooms, university leaders hoped the measures they put in place would keep Covid-19 cases down and avoid widespread cases that shut down many campuses nationwide last spring.
University of Maine President Joan Ferrini-Mundy, who chairs the system's Science Advisory Board, told CNN they prepared a science-based, multifaceted approach with the help of a team that included an epidemiologist, a statistician, microbiologists and virologists.
As the semester began at the end of August, university officials were about to find out if it would work.
In September, cases in the heavily vaccinated state began to rise. Hospitals began filling up with numbers not seen since a surge in January, according to the state's Center for Disease Control & Prevention. The number of people needing ventilators reached all-time highs and intensive care units reached record numbers, according to state health data. All counties began to be classified as having high levels of transmission.
And yet, throughout the University of Maine, cases remained extremely low and seemingly avoided the crush taking hold of the state. At the start of October, the campus system of more than 30,000 students and employees had a 1.5% positivity rate, compared to the state's rising 4.5% positivity rate.
The university told CNN that the system has had 52 known Covid-19 cases among students or employees as of Wednesday. Forty-five of those were on the flagship campus in Orono. Zero cases were recorded at the University of Maine at Augusta, University of Maine Farmington and University of Maine at Presque Isle campuses.
So how did they do it?
Ferrini-Mundy credits that multifront system -- known as the "Swiss cheese" model -- as a key defense against Covid-19. While each prevention measure, or layer of cheese has holes in it, when stacked together they create an effective defense.
Ferrini-Mundy knows a big part of it is not just the measures the campus put in place, but the willingness to adhere -- a situation that doesn't always exist in other settings.
"We've been able to control this through excellent behavior and compliance by our students," Ferrini-Mundy said.
Lucia Mullen, a senior analyst at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said the university's success shows two things. First, that this "Swiss cheese" model is the strongest plan to increase activities and social interactions while making sure transmission is low.
"It also shows the difference like compliance and willingness can make in in bringing down cases," Mullen said.
While there is always going to be exceptions and settings where the university model couldn't work, Mullen says it's a good example of success in a time of Covid-19 fatigue.
Vaccination efforts
One of the big reasons for the university system success is the rate of vaccination on campus compared with the rest of the state. Maine has a strong full dose vaccination rate of 74.4%, compared to the university's systemwide 88.3%.
But, state health officials have said in briefings, the Delta variant only needs a small window to create havoc. And that's mainly what happened among the unvaccinated population, according to Maine CDC Director Dr. Nirav D. Shah. Some pockets, especially rural areas, don't have vaccination rates on par with the state's average.
"Folks are getting it in their day-to-day lives," Shah said in video message responding to the uptick in cases. "Maybe because they had coffee with a friend or had dinner with some friends at their house in smaller settings where the virus can travel easily from person to person. Right now, most of the new cases of Covid-19 that we are seeing are happening among unvaccinated people."
On the University of Maine campuses, a vaccine mandate seems to have helped protect students against the community transmission seen in the rest of the state. More and more students got vaccinated early in the semester, giving the campus a measure of protection, the university said.
As of Tuesday, 97.2% of residential students were in compliance. Across the system, including faculty, staff, and students off-campus that rate is 88.3%, according to Ferrini-Mundy. The mandate will officially be enforced beginning October 15.
A 'robust testing regime'
Any students not fully vaccinated or with an exemption must undergo weekly testing as part of what Ferrini-Mundy calls a "robust testing regime." The university has a lab on campuses that processes those tests.
"We get quick turnaround results and then we've got a robust contact tracing program that that follows up," she says.
And the University of Maine, like hundreds of other campuses, is turning to wastewater testing in hopes of early detection of cases. Researchers have said they have high hopes for this testing, which they say can alert public health officials to trends in infections and doesn't depend on individuals getting tested. And because people excrete virus in feces before they show symptoms, it can serve as an early-warning system for outbreaks.
"We really want to be sure that if there are asymptomatic cases, perhaps in vaccinated people who aren't being tested on our campus, that we have a couple of backup systems in place," Ferrini-Mundy said of the wastewater testing.
Mullen said such testing is an important component with testing unvaccinated students to help cut off the virus as soon as possible.
"We can identify (the virus) much sooner," Mullen said. "So, we stopped the potential chain of transmission, because instead of not identifying it until they've had time to infect others we identify it at the source."
Indoor masking
On top of that, Ferrini-Mundy touts their indoor masking policy in all facilities, including classrooms.
Some state colleges with vaccine mandates are not requiring masking indoors, or only in residence halls. Some colleges have said their state's board of regents have not allowed them to enact mask or vaccine mandates.
"It sounds like this university has such a high compliance with mask use indoors, that's a major factor as well, because we're just presenting less opportunities for the virus to take hold and for people to be exposed," Mullen said.
Ferrini-Mundy credits the messaging throughout the system and faculty assistance in ensuring mask wearing is not only happening but happening the correct way.
"I just came away from a faculty meeting and some of the folks there were saying, 'I need to remind them every now and then the mask needs to go above the nose, and they're doing that, and the students comply,'" she said.
Ferrini-Mundy even noted that it isn't rare to see students masking outdoors, where it is not mandated.
Doubling down
The university system is not resting on the current success, Ferrini-Mundy says, with some additional measures coming.
With concerns about sports, conferences and other events moving indoors when winter comes to Maine, there will be a requirement to show proof of vaccination or a negative test at a gathering with more than 250 people. Some campuses have already been doing that, but it will become a requirement next week, Ferrini-Mundy says.
And as the vaccine mandate takes place, the university is reaching out to the minority of people who have not either submitted proof or requested an exemption. Ferrini-Mundy says as of Tuesday, that was 708 people across the whole university system.
The university is making phone calls, sending text messages, e-mails, app reminders, holding one-on-one support sessions on Zoom and a Covid-19 hotline to try and get them all into compliance.
Then, the hammer will drop.
"They won't be able to register for spring semester if they don't do this and come October 31, we actually will be withdrawing them from their courses," Ferrini-Mundy says.
Creating a bubble that ensures good health
Ferrini-Mundy cannot help but praise all partners, including students, for creating an atmosphere that seems to have insulated them from widespread cases for now.
Maine's Center for Disease Control & Prevention heralded the university as an "excellent partner throughout Maine's pandemic response."
"Its leaders have consistently put public health ahead of politics and taken proactive steps to limit virus transmission on campuses and within the wider university system community," the agency said in a statement.
Ferrini-Mundy believes the student buy-in due to the struggles of learning throughout the pandemic is a big reason for the university's success.
"We had a disruptive year last year -- our students weren't able to be here fully. They were engaged in a variety of hybrid kinds of remote courses which we are very grateful that we were able to do," she said.
"But the feeling I'm getting here as I talk to students out and around on the campus is they really want to be back. They want to make this work."

Texto completo: Connecticut’s COVID-19 cases continue to slow, state numbers show, even as nearby states such as Maine and New Hampshire see upticks.
Dr. Manisha Juthani, the state’s public health commissioner, said Wednesday that she’s encouraged by Connecticut’s progress but concerned with the increases in other parts of New England.
“We don’t live on an island, and it’s very easy to get from any of those states here,” Juthani, an infectious disease specialist, said. “We’re coming up on a colder season and times that people want to gather. I don’t know what that’s going to mean when it comes to our state.”
After a summer in which the states with the highest levels of COVID-19 were mostly located in the southern half of the country, many northern states have seen upticks in recent weeks. According to data from the New York Times, New Hampshire and Maine both rank among the five states with the sharpest recent increases in cases, along with North Dakota, Michigan and Minnesota.
Dr. Ulysses Wu, an infectious disease specialist at Hartford HealthCare, said that although Connecticut’s has seen fewer per capita COVID-19 cases than any other state over the past two weeks, he isn’t celebrating.
“We’ve been decreasing for a couple weeks but at a very slow rate, not at the rate that we should be,” Wu said. “We should be close to zero, and we’ve still got a few hundred [patients] in hospitals.”
Connecticut on Tuesday reported 377 new COVID-19 cases out of 19,825 tests, for a positivity rate of 1.9%. The state’s seven-day positivity rate now stands at 1.93%, essentially unchanged from Monday and near its lowest level since late July.
Connecticut has averaged 396 COVID-19 cases a day over the past week, fewest in a seven-day period since early August. No state has recorded fewer recent COVID-19 cases per capita, according to New York Times data.
As of Wednesday, Windham and New London counties were experiencing “high” levels of COVID-19 transmission as defined by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, while Connecticut’s five other counties were experiencing “substantial” transmission.
Connecticut now has 230 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, down seven from Tuesday and the fewest at a given time since Aug. 11. Hospitalizations are down more than 40% since the height of the delta variant surge in mid-August.
Hospital officials say the vast majority of those hospitalized with serious COVID-19 symptoms are unvaccinated.
Connecticut reports coronavirus-linked deaths once a week. Last Thursday, the state reported 53 COVID-19 deaths over the past week, bringing its total during the pandemic to 8,629.
The United States has now recorded 705,394 COVID-19 deaths, according to the New York Times.
As of Wednesday, 76.8% of all Connecticut residents and 88.1% of those 12 and older had received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose, while 69.1% of all residents and 79.3% of those 12 and older were fully vaccinated, according to the CDC.
COVID-19 booster shots are currently available for recipients of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine more than six months removed from their second dose who are 65 or older, have health conditions that leave them vulnerable to COVID-19 or work jobs that leave them at high risk.

Texto completo: An extraordinary public feud between Idaho's two top leaders escalated on Tuesday when the state's governor, Brad Little, accused fellow Republican Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin of overstepping her authority by ordering the state National Guard to the US-Mexico border while he was in Texas visiting the border.
McGeachin, who is running for governor next year, also drew Little's ire on Tuesday when she attempted to broaden his executive order banning so-called vaccine passports.
"Before I even left the state, the Lt. Governor unabashedly requested information from the Adjutant General to deploy our National Guard to the border, the same place I am visiting today to work with my fellow Republican governors on solutions to the crisis," Little said in a statement posted on Twitter. He traveled to Texas to meet with nine other governors to discuss border security and take a boat tour of the Rio Grande River.
Idaho's Constitution says that in the event the governor leaves the state, the lieutenant governor takes control of "the powers, duties and emoluments" of the governorship until the governor returns.
McGeachin defended herself Thursday in remarks to CNN.
"I absolutely have the authority to act," McGeachin told CNN's Dan Simon at Idaho's Capitol in Boise. "Our Constitution states that when the governor leaves the state, all duties that applied to the office of the governor then fall to the lieutenant governor. So when the governor is out of the state, the lieutenant governor serves as acting governor and has full authority that the governor does."
McGeachin added: "He was out of the state yesterday and the day before and so I issued the order on Tuesday."
The order in question was aimed at amending the language of a vaccine passport ban that would, according to McGeachin, close a loophole allowing schools and universities to ask for proof of vaccination.
On Tuesday, McGeachin tweeted that she "fixed" Little's executive order. "I will continue to fight for your individual Liberty!," the lieutenant governor said.
Eight minutes later, Little tweeted, "I will be rescinding and reversing any actions taken by the Lt. Governor when I return."
The dispute is the latest episode in an ongoing political skirmish between the state's two top leaders. Little, who was first elected in 2018, has not yet declared whether he will seek reelection, but ahead of next year's Republican primary, McGeachin has sought to establish herself as the champion of the Trump wing of the party while attempting to paint Little as an establishment figure.
In the wake of Little's stay-at-home order at the onset of the pandemic last year, McGeachin wrote in an op-ed, "I lose sleep at night because the heavy hand of our government is hurting so many Idahoans." That May, McGeachin issued an executive order banning mask mandates while Little was unaware and out of town, which Little subsequently repealed.
"The action that took place was an irresponsible, self-serving political stunt," Little said at the time. "Taking the earliest opportunity to act solitarily on a highly politicized, polarizing issue without conferring with local jurisdictions, legislators, and the sitting Governor is, simply put, an abuse of power."
CNN's Devan Cole and Dan Simon contributed to this report.

'Every one of those deaths is unnecessary,' expert says of rising Covid-19 US death toll as tens of millions remain unvaccinated

Texto completo: With a first-of-its-kind antiviral pill against Covid-19 potentially headed towards distribution, the health care community may soon have another tool to combat a virus that has claimed the lives of more than 700,000 Americans.
Merck and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics created an antiviral pill the companies say can reduce risk of Covid-19 hospitalization and death by 50%, and Merck said it will seek emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for its molnupiravir medication "as soon as possible."
"We'll be able to prescribe this to folks. They'll take a five-day course and hopefully be able to stay home, not come in for an intravenous infusion and keep folks out of the hospital. So, it's really very promising news," Dr. Jonathan Reiner, CNN medical analyst and professor of medicine and surgery at George Washington University, told CNN's Pamela Brown Saturday.
But the best strategy for fighting the pandemic -- full immunization -- is still hampered due to resistance, Reiner noted, and a substantial number of Americans have died since late February, when vaccine access expanded.
"We've lost 700,000 Americans now and fully 200,000 of those folks have died since vaccines have been available almost to everyone in this country, and every one of those deaths is unnecessary," he said. "So even though the news is great for this antiviral agent, really the message that people need to receive is 'get vaccinated.' No one needs to die from this virus."
As progress slowly moves forward nationwide with the rate of inoculations, tens of millions of unvaccinated Americans remain at higher risk for Covid-19.
Nearly 56% of the total US population, or 65.4% of those ages 12 and up who are eligible, are fully vaccinated, according to data published Sunday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
However, fifteen states have yet to fully vaccinate more than half of their residents, according to CDC data: Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, West Virginia and Wyoming.
While much of the focus from health experts and officials remains on new inoculations that will help lower hospitalization rates, booster shots for some people previously fully vaccinated with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine are gaining traction, with about 5.3 million people who have received an additional dose -- or booster -- since August 13, CDC data shows.
People ages 65 and older, people at high risk of severe disease and people whose jobs put them at risk of infection may get an additional dose.
Appearing on ABC's "This Week" Sunday morning, Dr. Anthony Fauci addressed people who remain hesitant about the vaccines, believing they are too new, saying, "This vaccine has been given to hundreds of millions of people ... throughout the world, so although it is 'new,' there is a lot of experience with this vaccine."
"It's within our capability to make sure that that turnaround we're seeing ... continues to go down," he said of the country finally turning a corner in the pandemic. "We can do that, really, by getting vaccinated."
Covid-19 mitigation efforts continue to help children
While the Delta variant has contributed to more Covid-19 infections in children compared to earlier in the pandemic, recent studies show certain mitigation measures are still effective tools in lowering infections -- underscoring the importance of these strategies while children under the age of 12 remain ineligible to receive a Covid-19 vaccine.
Covid-19 protocols at summer camps kept many from contracting Covid-19, and outbreaks increased when those safety measures weren't taken, according to two studies published in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report on Friday.
One study compared the number of infections at camps in Louisiana since 2020 and saw a 31-fold increase in cases from last year to this year.
Last year, there were only two outbreaks in the camps studied in Louisiana. There were no vaccines then, but there was a mask mandate in place and camps used other mitigation measures, as well. This year, the camps saw 28 outbreaks that involved 321 cases among 2,988 campers and staff.
While there was a vaccine this year, the difference may have been that Louisiana dropped its mask mandate and "apparent underutilization of preventative measures," one report said. The Delta variant was also in wide circulation in the state in 2021.
Measures including "vaccination of all eligible adults and adolescents, wearing masks indoors, regular screening testing, physical distancing and cohorting, and increasing ventilation can help prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in settings with youths who cannot be vaccinated," the study said.
A second study looked at the number of infections among more than 7,000 campers and staff members in several states from June to August this year. The camps used multiple prevention strategies including masks, regular testing, podding, physical distancing and hand hygiene, and had a 93% vaccination rate among those who were eligible.
The camps had only nine Covid-19 cases, the study found, and there were no secondary infections.
"These findings highlight important guiding principles for school and youth-based Covid-19 prevention protocols," the study said.
A Covid-19 vaccine for children between the ages of 5 and 11 could be on the way. The FDA's advisory committee is scheduled to meet October 26 to discuss whether it will recommend Pfizer's vaccine for that age group.
However, according to a new poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation, only about a third of parents say they will vaccinate their child as soon as a vaccine is available. KFF noted the bulk of interviews were done before Pfizer announced clinical trials showed the vaccine was safe and generated an immune response.
On Sunday, Fauci warned while a child might have less of a chance of having a severe outcome from a case of Covid-19, it is not a "benign situation."
"We are seeing now, very clearly, if you go to pediatric hospitals, that although this risk is less than an adult, there are children in hospital who are getting seriously ill," he said on CNN's "State of the Union." There is also the risk of long Covid, where some survivors suffer lingering symptoms for months after getting infected.
"You want to protect your child, but you also want to make the child a part of the solution, mainly so that there's not the spread of infection, either within your household or to other vulnerable people," he said, adding it is a "very positive, good thing to get their children vaccinated."
People with disabilities had more issues accessing vaccines, study finds
While vaccine hesitancy remains a significant barrier in curbing the pandemic, access for some has also been an issue, even if they want the vaccine.
People with a disability in the US were less likely than those without disabilities to be vaccinated against Covid-19, even though they report less hesitancy and are disproportionately vulnerable to hospitalization or death from Covid-19, according to a new analysis.
People with a disability aren't any more hesitant to get a Covid-19 vaccine than those without a disability and were more often likely to report they would "definitely" get vaccinated. However, they reported more issues in accessing the vaccine, the analysis published in the CDC's weekly report suggests.
Of those who reported difficulties, they had the hardest time getting an appointment online. They also reported having a hard time getting to a vaccination site. Other obstacles included hours at vaccination sites that didn't work with their schedules, and not knowing where to get the vaccine.
"Reducing barriers to scheduling and making vaccination sites more accessible might improve vaccination coverage among persons with disabilities," the report said.
Among more than 56,000 people who responded in CDC phone interviews from the end of May until the end of June, about 5,000 reported having some form of disability. Earlier studies suggest a higher number of people have at least one disability -- about 15% of American adults. A disability in this case included anyone who said they had difficulty in seeing, hearing, walking, remembering, making decisions or communicating.
People with disabilities are more vulnerable to Covid-19, in part because they are likely to have a chronic condition that can make Covid-19 severe and are more likely to have health care access issues.

Texto completo: A deaf Colorado man has filed a federal lawsuit claiming that two local police officers slammed him to the ground and tasered him without recognizing his disability when they arrested him after stopping him for running a stop sign.
Attorneys for Brady Mistic, who spent four months in jail, filed the lawsuit two weeks ago in the US District Court in Denver against Officers Nicholas Hanning and Ellie Summers, the city of Idaho Springs and the Board of County Commissioners of Clear Creek County.
The 2019 arrest was captured on body camera footage from at least one of the officers, which was shared with CNN by Mistic's attorneys. Mistic is deaf in both ears and primarily uses sign language to communicate.
The charges against Mistic, which include second-degree assault on a police officer and resisting arrest, were eventually dropped, according to the lawsuit. Mistic was also charged with criminal possession of a forged instrument after Summers found what appeared to be 24 $100 bills in his wallet, which she said felt like they were made of printer paper with Chinese symbols on the back of the bill, according to the police report.
According to the lawsuit, the bills were "fake movie-prop money with Chinese characters from Wish.com," which is an online marketplace. "Possessing play money without any intent or attempt to pass it off as real money is not a crime," the filing says.
Mistic was held in jail for four months with an extremely high bond due to the serious nature of the charges and could not pay his bail, according to his attorney Raymond Bryant. Mistic's bond was first lowered to $3,000, which he still could not afford, and then he was granted a personal recognizance bond, releasing him from jail without having to post any money, Raymond said.
The prosecution against Mistic continued for almost two years until District Attorney Heidi McCollum moved to dismiss his charges in July. In the lawsuit, Mistic claims he was denied an interpreter while in jail.
He's seeking compensation for "physical and emotional harm, pain and suffering, permanent scarring, and economic damages, as well as punitive sanctions against the individual officers to punish and deter the blatant abuse of authority and violation of rights evident here."
"While in jail, Mr. Mistic suffered even further indignity, humiliation, isolation, and discrimination due to being deaf due to being unable to communicate," the lawsuit says. He was also allegedly denied an interpreter during his meetings with his attorney while in jail. The Clear Creek County Sheriff's Office is responsible for the jail's operation under the supervision of Sheriff Rick Albers.
The sheriff's office declined to comment on the case when contacted by CNN, due to pending litigation.
"This is a civil rights action seeking justice for the shocking use of unnecessary police force and wrongful incarceration of a deaf man whom the Defendant officers rashly attacked after failing to recognize his disability and misinterpreting his non-threatening attempts to see and communicate as challenges to police authority," according to the lawsuit.
In response, the Idaho Springs Police Department released a statement that says, "The officers gave verbal commands for Mr. Mistic to get back in his vehicle. It was later determined Mr. Mistic was deaf, but this fact was not known to the officers during the initial encounter."
"The incident was reviewed by former Chief Christian Malanka and the officers' actions were deemed to be appropriate," the department said.
"Due to pending civil litigation there will be no further statements regarding this incident," the statement added.
Both Hanning and Summers were named as defendants in another lawsuit filed in federal court in July stemming from an incident in late May. Hanning was charged with third-degree assault by District Attorney McCollum after he used a Taser on 75-year-old Michael Clark in his home, according to a press release from Colorado Fifth Judicial District Attorney's Office.
As the officers responded to a disturbance call at Clark's apartment, he opened the door "holding a club-like object with what appeared to be teeth along the edges," according to a news release from the police department.
In footage of the incident distributed by Clark's lawyer, Hanning can be seen forcing his way into the man's apartment and pushing Clark against the wall -- before giving a verbal command or identifying himself as a police officer.
The officers give different commands while Clark complains about the noise from his neighbors and Hanning subsequently uses his Taser, which strikes Clark in the abdomen and pelvic area, the affidavit says. According to the lawsuit, Hanning is also accused of putting a knee onto and over Clark's head and neck, causing an injury to his carotid artery, which was followed by a stroke.
The Idaho Springs Police Department told CNN that Hanning is no longer with the department but did not disclose whether he was fired and for what reason.
CNN contacted lawyers for Hanning and Summers for comment but did not immediately receive a response. A lawyer for the Board of County Commissioners of Clear Creek County also did not immediately return a request for comment.
Both officers can be heard in body camera footage demanding that Mistic get back into his car and they claimed in police reports that Mistic failed to comply with their demands and felt like he was about to attack them.
According to the lawsuit, however, Mistic is unable to lip-read and can vocalize a few words, and it's "necessary for him to use writing to communicate with persons who do not know ASL," the lawsuit says.
While he was in handcuffs, Mistic was unable to write responses to communicate with the officers or use ASL and stood up in an attempt to indicate that he needed to write in order to communicate, the lawsuit says.
"When one of the officers hurt himself in the course of the attack, the Defendant officers falsely charged the deaf man with assault on a police officer in an illusory attempt to cover up their misconduct -- which caused the man to unjustifiably spend months in jail without appropriate accommodations to help him communicate that he was, in fact, the victim," the lawsuit states.
Mistic's lawyer Raymond Bryant said in a statement to CNN, "One of the biggest concerns I have about this case is that the officers used force so rashly and quickly. Within 7 seconds of exiting their vehicle, without looking or listening to assess the situation, and without utilizing any reasonable attempts at communication, the officers went hands-on and used force on Mr. Mistic. They did not have justification."
"Even if Mr. Mistic could hear the officers, they did not tell him he was being stopped, detained, arrested, or otherwise had a legal obligation to do anything other than what he did (which was just to stand still and attempt to see/communicate before being assaulted)," the statement continues.
The lawyers add that "the ADA creates an additional layer of affirmative obligations on police officers to ensure that they are able to effectively communicate with disabled members of the public, like Mr. Mistic."
Altercation stems from traffic stop
The lawsuit stems from a traffic stop on September 17, 2019, in Idaho Springs after Mistic allegedly ran a stop sign before driving into the parking lot of a laundromat, according to the police report shared with CNN by Mistic's attorneys.
Mistic, who drove a white SUV, "never slowed down for the intersection and continued to travel through it at about the same speed," the report says. Officer Summers was in the driver's seat and Hanning, her field training officer, was in the passenger seat, according to the police report.
While Summers notified dispatch of the traffic stop, Mistic exited his vehicle and walked "briskly to the back of his vehicle" toward the police car, the report says. Hanning wrote in the police report that Mistic's facial features turned into "rage with his face scowled and his eye brows furrowed," adding, "I knew an attack was imminent."
Summers said she feared for her safety, drew her service pistol and held it at a low position until she could see that Mistic was unarmed, her police report says.
In the lawsuit, lawyers say Mistic parked his car and began walking toward the laundromat entrance when he was "blinded by police lights, and unable to hear or know what was going on. He had no idea what was happening, what the police were doing, or if the officers' presence had anything to do with him."
Mistic tried to communicate with his hands in a "non-threatening manner" when the officers grabbed him, slammed him to the ground, and tasered him "despite him saying 'no ears' to communicate he was deaf," the lawsuit says.
According to the police report, Hanning grabbed Mistic by his right wrist, when he "violently pulled away by punching his hand away from my grasp." As he attempted to take Mistic to the ground, Hanning fell backward and struck his head, which caused his vision to go black for a "split second," he wrote in the report. Mistic then fell on top of Hanning and his body camera fell loose, the report says.
In the meantime, Summers gave Mistic commands of compliance to put him in handcuffs, the report says. At this point, Hanning had "tremendous" pain in his right lower leg and ankle and instructed Summers to taser Mistic, Hanning wrote in his police report.
Body camera footage from the incident, reviewed by CNN, shows roughly seven seconds pass between the officers pulling into the laundromat parking lot and the physical encounter taking place.
Summer is heard in the footage commanding Mistic to sit back in his car twice before she and Hanning exited the vehicle and approached him. Hanning is heard saying, "You're gonna come up on us like that? Excuse me? Who do you think you are?" as Mistic stands in front of the police car.
The footage shows Mistic on the ground as Summers yells at him to put his arms behind his back and threatens to tase him. Hanning instructs Summers to use the Taser, and she tases him and continues to demand that he put his arms behind his back.
Mistic can be heard yelling out in the video and asks, "Why this happen?"
"Defendants knew or should have known by Mr. Mistic's lack of speech, hand gestures, and/or thick-tongued articulation of the words "no ears" that he was deaf and could not hear or understand the officers," the lawsuit says.
Once the incident subsides, Summers is heard saying to Mistic as he sits on the ground, "Don't run at us like that, just stay sitting down." She then appears to realize he is deaf and asks Mistic if he is OK and if anything hurts.
Deputies on the scene placed Mistic in Summers' vehicle and she transported him to St. Anthony's Hospital for "medical clearance," according to the police report.
In the hospital, Summers then used an interpreter to communicate with him why he was in custody and that he was going to jail, according to her police report. Mistic was medically cleared and Hanning had broken his right tibia and fibula in his leg, the police report says.
'You didn't know I was deaf,' Mistic said
A second body camera video from Summers, reviewed by CNN, shows the officer and Mistic in a hospital room where she communicates with him through an interpreter. Summers tells the interpreter that the officers stopped Mistic for failing to stop at the stop sign when he got out of his car and approached her car "very quickly." She added, "that's not how that's supposed to work, so we got out and tried to contact you."
According to Mistic, he understood that he failed to stop but does not understand the subsequent interaction. "When I got pulled over, I tried to come because the light was in my face and it scared me," Mistic said through the interpreter. "I couldn't see, and I didn't like that and I was frustrated so I came over to see what was going over because of me," the footage shows.
Summers then tells Mistic that he is going to jail, to which he responded through the interpreter: "I didn't fire anything, you grabbed me and took me down on the ground. And later I got frustrated. I was trying to talk, I was trying to say something, but you didn't know I was deaf."
Mistic adds, "I'm surprised, what am I going to jail for?"
Summers tells Mistic he's going to jail for resisting arrest, assault in the second degree and a stop sign violation.
"Assault in the second degree?" Mistic says through the interpreter. "That sounds like I was trying to kill someone. I wasn't doing anything. When I came to try and talk with you, you pulled me down."
According to the lawsuit, Mistic neither threatened, physically harmed or fought with the officers nor did he flee or attempt to flee the scene.

‘This Was a Failure’: Biden’s ATF Pick Says White House Left Him Open to Attack

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
David Chipman’s confirmation odyssey began with a short congratulatory buzz from Attorney General Merrick Garland in April and ended, he said, with a long, rueful call from the presidential adviser Steve Ricchetti admitting the White House had fallen “short.”
Chipman, a brash gun control activist whose nomination to head the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives imploded this month, said he had no other contact with the White House, which often left him feeling alone, on “an island,” when pro-gun groups attacked him.
Instead, the West Wing strategy focused on selling Chipman to Sen. Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, the centrist Democrat and perpetual kingmaker in an evenly divided Senate, only to lose the support of Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, which left Democrats at least one vote short of the 50 needed for confirmation.
“Either this was impossible to win, or the strategy failed,” Chipman told The New York Times in his first public comments since President Joe Biden withdrew the nomination, conceding he could not get the votes. “This was a failure.”
Chipman’s defeat represented a major victory for the gun lobby and a huge loss for gun control groups, who saw appointment of a strong director for the bureau as the most important move Biden could make as Republicans block legislative action. It was a reminder of Biden’s struggles, eight months into his presidency, to fulfill big promises he has made to progressives on voting rights, immigration and guns.
In a far-ranging interview, Chipman, who served as an agent at the bureau for 25 years before becoming one of the country’s most prominent gun control activists, praised the White House for what he jokingly called the “gangster move” of nominating someone like him in the first place.
But he questioned the administration’s willingness to execute a coordinated strategy to get him through the Senate and expressed concern about its next moves. He said he found it “unusual” that he spoke to no one at the White House from the moment he was nominated.
“In the back of my mind, I always thought that there would be a Plan B, but so far there hasn’t been,” Chipman said.
White House officials pushed back on the suggestion that they are stalled, saying they are considering several possible nominees and pointing to new gun control, community engagement and anti-crime initiatives Biden outlined earlier this year.
“We know this work is going to be difficult — especially with Republicans on Capitol Hill moving in lock-step with the gun industry — but the president is absolutely committed to pushing both legislation and personnel to combat gun violence,” said Michael Gwin, a spokesperson for Biden.
Chipman, 55, said he was speaking out now in hopes of encouraging Biden’s team to focus on reforming and energizing the long-neglected agency, which has been handcuffed by decades of legislative attacks from the National Rifle Association and other pro-gun groups.
He prefers to do so from the outside, rejecting a recent offer to serve in the Justice Department. He has returned to his position as an adviser to the organization founded by former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, a survivor of gun violence he described as having more courage than anyone in Washington.
Chipman placed most of the blame for his defeat on the gun lobby, in particular the National Shooting Sports Foundation, an industry trade group that lobbied King and others.
And he singled out Lawrence G. Keane, a top executive at the group, for posting a picture on its website showing a federal agent — falsely identified in a tabloid article as a young Chipman — standing in the smoldering debris of the Branch Davidian compound in 1993, which he said prompted a spate of online threats.
“Larry Keane put up a photo of me that he knew was false, trying to get me killed,” said Chipman, who arrived in Waco, Texas, to assist in the investigation long after the ATF had begun an assault that eventually resulted in the deaths of 82 civilians and four federal agents.
Keane, in a phone interview, called the accusation “categorically false,” adding that “the moment we found out that it was in fact not him, we pulled it from our website. If I had known it wasn’t him, we would never have used the photograph.”
He acknowledged that Chipman was the subject of death threats, which he called “extremely unfortunate and uncalled-for.” But he said Biden never should have nominated someone as belligerent to gun owners, manufacturers and dealers as Chipman.
There was, however, one point both men agreed on: The White House, along with Chipman’s small support team at the Justice Department, did not do nearly enough to knock down that story or other accusations against him that circulated widely in conservative media.
Chipman lauded the dedication of the Justice Department team, but said his attempts to get them to send reporters documents debunking the Waco claim failed — and he finally had to give journalists the information himself after concluding “no one’s defending me.”
Administration officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, said that they quietly countered negative stories about Chipman, but believed the under-the-radar media strategy was the wisest course.
They said the problem was not Waco, but King, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, who blindsided them by expressing opposition to Chipman just as the nomination was headed to a floor vote in late June.
A person close to King said his position should not have come as a surprise to anyone. He had already told administration officials he objected to their sales pitch — that the ATF, an agency he viewed as a neutral regulator, would be the focal point of gun policy under an activist director like Chipman.
Chipman got that message in person in July when King summoned him to his office.
When he arrived, King told the nominee that Chipman’s father — a King supporter who lives in Maine — had sent him a letter urging him to vote for his son.
“At least he likes you,” King quipped.
Then the senator, who had been the subject of an intense lobbying effort by pro-gun groups in his home state, laid out his grievances. According to Chipman, the senator told him that “my friends who are gun dealers in Maine” objected to the nomination.
Chipman, who had vowed to intensify inspections of federally licensed gun dealers if confirmed, did not give ground — and polite calls from Biden, Giffords and Thomas Brandon, a former acting director of the agency, over the next few weeks did nothing to budge the senator.
By early September, the White House bowed to the inevitable. Ricchetti called Chipman, and spent about 20 minutes expressing regret at all he had been through, as the nominee stood near a field of sunflowers he was visiting with his wife.
Last week, King explained his position in a letter to constituents, saying Chipman could not be “a fair and objective regulator” because his association with gun safety groups meant he could not be “evenhanded” with gun dealers.
Chipman drew another conclusion from the meeting: that King had been “captured” by the gun lobby, and that his own defeat was a reflection of its enduring power.
“I left his office thinking, ‘Does he really believe that people who regulate industries can only get those jobs if they’re friends with the industry?’” Chipman said. “He said the quiet part out loud.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Texto completo: Adequate rates of vaccination can help prevent the rise of new mutations that could force people to get booster after booster dose of Covid-19 vaccine, the head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Sunday.
The CDC and the US Food and Drug Administration recommended booster shots for many Americans last week to help preserve their immunity.
But that doesn't necessarily mean people will need to keep getting boosters. CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky told CBS's "Face the Nation."
"Our goal right now is to stay ahead of the virus. We want to boost now so we don't end up in a vulnerable place," Walensky said.
"We will see if we can get the amount of transmission down in this country, and truly around the world, which we are also working to do, and then we are anticipating and hoping we will not have more mutations that will require more boosting in the future."
'Our hospitals are filled with unvaccinated people'
Covid-19 is killing so many people in Idaho that some funeral homes are running out of space to store the bodies.
"We are working nonstop. We're exhausted. We're frustrated," Ada County Coroner Dotti Owens said. "Funeral homes are out of storage. Our hospitals are out of storage."
The county bought a mass fatality trailer late last year to accommodate a larger number of bodies, but even that is filling up, Owens said.
"Now we're packing them in there," she said. "Our internal cooler is full."
What's happening in Idaho is tragic, but perhaps not surprising.
Idaho has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the US, with 41.3% of residents fully vaccinated as of Saturday, according CDC data.
Only two states had lower vaccinations rates: West Virginia (40.3%) and Wyoming (41%).
And the average rate of Covid-19 deaths was more than four times higher in the 10 least-vaccinated states compared to the 10 most-vaccinated states, a recent CNN analysis showed.
In Idaho, Covid-19 has killed an average of 20 people a day over the past week, according to CDC data published Saturday.
At Cloverdale Funeral Home in Ada County, "our refrigeration facility here at Cloverdale is substantial, and it's full," managing partner Steve Salove told CNN affiliate KIVI.
He said part of the problem is many victims' family members are also sick with Covid-19 -- meaning bodies have to be stored until they recover and can attend a funeral service.
About 90% of Idaho's ICU beds were occupied, with 58.6% taken up by Covid-19 patients, according to data from the US Department of Health and Human Services.
Alaska is calling for additional medical staff to help with Covid-19 cases.
The state is seeking 297 registered nurses, 114 nursing assistants and a variety of other technicians and therapists to help hospitals that are struggling with staffing and near capacity. The endeavor will likely cost the state about $1 million per day, which will be reimbursed by the federal government, officials said.
The new resources come as the state has authorized hospitals to enact crisis standards of care, allowing the facilities to ration resources when overwhelmed by patients.
The CDC director said she's worried about hospitals in some states running out of beds.
"And when you see that, you worry that people may not be able to come in and get the proper care if they have a motor vehicle accident or if they're having a heart attack," Walensky told CBS on Sunday.
"People who are not vaccinated are 10 times more likely to be in the hospital. Our hospitals are filled with unvaccinated people."
Some schools have to pause in-person learning
The Filer School District in Idaho closed Friday due to "excessive staff absences and the shortage of substitute teachers," district officials said in a Facebook post.
Students will not learn remotely during the break, which ends October 4.
The district's Covid-19 dashboard showed 11 school staff and 56 students have tested positive for Covid-19 since school began September 7.
A combination of absences among teachers, kitchen staff, custodians and other workers as well as a lack of substitute teachers is making it difficult for the district to operate, Schroeder explained.
"It's hard to say if the absences and shortages have been caused by Covid-19," FSD Superintendent Kelli Schroeder told CNN in an email. "There are several other staff members who are out for illness and other reasons."
Children typically don't get infected in schools where proper precautions are taken, the CDC director said.
"Our science has demonstrated that the disease generally comes in from the community, and when schools are practicing the proper mitigation and prevention strategies, it is not where the transmission is actually happening," Walensky told CBS.
The CDC has recommended mask wearing for students, teachers and visitors in schools from kindergarten through grade 12, along with improved ventilation, physical distancing and testing on a screening basis.
"We know how to keep them safe," Walensky said. "When we don't use the proper mitigation, they're more likely to have outbreaks."
The good news for kids: the CDC chief said she think it might be OK to go trick-or-treating this year.
"Oh, gosh, I certainly hope so. If you're able to be outdoors, absolutely. Limit crowds. I wouldn't necessarily go to a crowded Halloween party," Walensky told CBS.
"I think we should be able to let our kids go trick-or-treating in small groups, and I hope that we can do that this year."
GOP governor: 'Vaccinations remain our ticket out of this pandemic'
Ohio, Gov. Mike DeWine recently announced the "Vax to School" program, which residents ages 12 and 25 may enter with proof of vaccination.
The program will give five scholarships worth $100,000 and 50 scholarships worth $10,000. All scholarship money can be used toward any type of education or job training the winner chooses.
DeWine noted an "alarming trend" of Covid-19 cases in young Ohioans, including 42,000 cases in children between the ages 5 and 17 since school started August 15.
"Vaccinations remain our ticket out of this pandemic," DeWine said. "Vaccinations are the way that we stop our hospitals from being overcrowded."
Correction : An earlier version of this story understated the value of Ohio's "Vax to School" program. Prizes will include 50 scholarships worth $10,000 each and five $100,000 scholarships.

Texto completo: Five articles from around The Times, narrated just for you.
This weekend, listen to a collection of narrated articles from around The New York Times, read aloud by the reporters who wrote them.
Bully Pulpit No More: Jen Psaki’s Turn at the Lectern
Written and narrated by Michael M. Grynbaum
Jen Psaki, President Biden’s press secretary, may be the most prominent spokeswoman in American politics, but political fame hits different in the post-Trump era.
The daily White House briefing, once a highly rated staple of daytime TV, rarely appears anymore on cable news. Sean Spicer and Sarah Huckabee Sanders, two former Trump press secretaries, became B-list celebrities; after nine months on the job, Ms. Psaki has not even rated an impersonation on “Saturday Night Live.”
But a cult of Psaki has proliferated online, where clips of her restrained, if occasionally withering exchanges with reporters have established this once obscure political strategist as an unlikely cultural force.

Taking the ‘Shame Part’ Out of Female Anatomy
Written and narrated by Rachel E. Gross
Allison Draper, a first-year medical student at the University of Miami, loved anatomy class. She found the language clear, precise, functional. She could look up the Latin term for almost any body part and get an idea of where it was and what it did.
Then one day she looked up the pudendal nerve, which provides sensation to the vagina and vulva, or outer female genitalia. The term derived from the Latin verb pudere: to be ashamed.
It grew worse. When her teacher handed her a copy of the “Terminologia Anatomica,” the international dictionary of anatomical terms, she learned that the Latin term for the vulva — including the inner and outer labia, the clitoris and the pubic mound — was pudendum. Translation: the part to be ashamed of. There was no equivalent word for male genitals.
While anatomists have bid farewell to “pudendum,” other questionable terms remain.

Specialty Pharmacies Cater to the Blind and Those With Impaired Vision
Written and narrated by Joshua Brockman
The pandemic has cast a spotlight on inequalities at pharmacies, where precautions and new programs have further limited access to health care for people with intellectual, developmental and physical disabilities.
Critical services like drive-through coronavirus testing, vaccination and pharmacy pickup windows have failed in many instances because they were rolled out in ways that were inaccessible. How can a blind person drive through a pharmacy? Why isn’t walk-through an option?
In addition, labeling and packaging have been a longstanding problem for older adults and for anyone who cannot read or understand the tiny type that appears on most prescription bottles and the accompanying pamphlets listing side effects and drug interactions.
Unlike most other pharmacies, Accessible Pharmacy — which is nestled in a nondescript mini-mall, next to a Pizza Hut and a partially vacant building in Fairless Hills, Penn. — does not cater to walk-in customers or, for that matter, people who can see. The company offers service to blind people and those with low vision, including assistance from those who can see and free home delivery for prescriptions, medical devices and over-the-counter medications.

Richard Powers Speaks For the Trees
Written and narrated by Alexandra Alter
Richard Powers, the Pulitzer-winning author of “The Overstory,” was hiking in the woods one day when he had the idea for his new novel, “Bewilderment.” Set in the near future, the novel is narrated by Theo Byrne, an astrobiologist whose search for life on other planets feels increasingly futile in the face of the coming collapse of life on Earth. As he struggles with the disasters unfolding around him, Theo fears for his 9-year-old son, Robin, who is consumed by grief over the death of his mother and the fate of the planet.
“Bewilderment” is Powers’s latest and perhaps furthest foray into science fiction, but it has ominous echoes of contemporary America — catastrophic weather, political unrest, a Trump-like president who tweets erratically and spouts conspiracy theories about election fraud, a deadly virus that jumps from cows to humans and spreads rapidly before it gets detected.

‘Their Crisis’ Is ‘Our Problem’: Washington Grapples With Idaho Covid Cases
Written and narrated by Mike Baker
Surgeries to remove brain tumors have been postponed. Patients are backed up in the emergency room. Nurses are working brutal shifts. But at Providence Sacred Heart Medical Center in Spokane, Wash., the calls keep coming: Can Idaho send another patient across the border?
Washington State is reeling under its own surge of coronavirus cases. But in neighboring Idaho, 20 miles down Interstate 90 from Spokane, unchecked virus transmission has already pushed hospitals beyond their breaking point.
At a time when Washington State hospitals are delaying procedures and struggling with their own high caseloads, some leaders in the state see Idaho’s outsourcing of Covid patients as a troubling example of how the failure to aggressively confront the virus in one state can deepen a crisis in another.

A vaccine mandate for domestic flights isn’t ‘off the table’

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — The White House’s recommendation to require all visitors flying into the United States to provide proof of vaccination has sparked speculation over whether the federal government will ultimately require passengers on domestic flights to be vaccinated as well.
The speculation increased even before the new requirements when Dr. Anthony Fauci told podcast The Skimm earlier this month that he would support requiring vaccination for air travel. “If you want to get on a plane and travel with other people … you should be vaccinated,” Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a top medical adviser to the Biden administration, said.
White House COVID-19 response coordinator Jeff Zients, announcing the international requirement Monday, fed that speculation by refusing to rule out an eventual domestic travel requirement. “We’re not taking any measures off the table,” he said.
But such a requirement has led aviation-related stakeholders to complain that the logistical hurdles would be challenging at best and a nightmare at worst.
For example: Who would check for proof of vaccination? What safeguards would be in place to ensure that the documents weren’t fraudulent? Would the paper cards currently given to the vaccinated suffice? What sort of central records exist to help airlines track if people are vaccinated? How would airlines handle children not yet eligible for such a vaccine? And would such a requirement extend to other sorts of travel, such as buses and trains?
<img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-26293086" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2021/09/US_Sept_11_Air_Travel_20835.jpg" alt="US Sept 11 Air Travel" width="1000" height="667" />
“It should have been obvious a long time ago that it was going to be necessary to have a more reliable mechanism for authenticating immunization status than a flimsy, handwritten cardboard card — if only because other countries were likely to require it for travel, whatever we did in the United States,” said Julian Sanchez, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute.
He said such a process could’ve been done without requiring any kind of master federal database of who has been vaccinated. The CDC could have — and possibly still can — simply say that vaccine records have to be offered in both physical and digital forms by providers, and use any one of the various protocols already in existence for cryptographically authenticating the information on the record.
That model would’ve kept lists of the vaccinated with states and health care providers on a centralized database to authenticate the card was issued by a real provider and verify the printed information.
“It’s much trickier now, of course, because we’ve got tens of millions of people already vaccinated who’d have to be provided with updated records,” he said.
Lawmakers’ response to an air travel vaccine mandate ranged from ambivalence to outright opposition.
“I think that’s up to the airlines to decide for themselves,” said Sen. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev.
“I don’t think the American people would stand for it,” said Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., ranking Republican on the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee.
“I do not believe there should be any COVID mandates,” said Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. “That means no vaccine mandates, that means no mask mandates, that means no vaccine passports.”
Cruz, who has introduced a bill banning vaccine mandates, said he is worried the Biden administration will institute such a requirement. “Joe Biden has demonstrated a willingness to trample on individual freedom and medical privacy in order to distract from the catastrophe of the Afghanistan withdrawal,” he said.
Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., was similarly concerned. He introduced an amendment to the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee’s budget resolution to bar funds from the draft measure from being used to impose or support vaccine requirements as a condition for traveling on public or private transportation. The committee did not approve the amendment.
Massie said Fauci’s comments spurred him to introduce the amendment. “I think it’s absolutely wrong, bad idea, going to hurt the economy,” he said.
By contrast, Rep. Donald S. Beyer Jr., D-Va., has introduced a bill that would require full COVID vaccination or a negative test for domestic air and Amtrak travel.
“Every regulatory piece is a balancing of rights,” Beyer said. “You have a right to smoke, but you can kill yourself. But you don’t have a right to blow second-hand smoke in someone’s air space. It’s the same thing with the vaccine. It’s sad if you choose to put yourself at risk of early death or long COVID, but it’s unacceptable to put other people at risk. You can get to choose for yourself, but you don’t get to choose for everyone else.”
Beyer said he’s received more calls on this bill than most others. Only about 3 percent oppose it, he said. “The other 97 percent says, ‘Why aren’t we doing this already?’”
Among the organizations that have spoken out against vaccine mandates for domestic travel is the U.S. Travel Association, a national nonprofit organization representing the travel industry. It warned in a statement last month that the policy would “have an unfair, negative impact on families with young children who are not yet eligible to get the vaccine.”
“U.S. Travel has long maintained that there should be no mandatory vaccination requirement for domestic travel,” said Tori Emerson Barnes, executive vice president of public affairs and policy. She pointed to the federal mask mandate as providing ample protection for domestic travelers.
Delta Airlines CEO Ed Bastian told CNN in August that such a requirement “would be quite a logistical snafu.”
“There’s no evidence that there’s been spread of COVID in the domestic air transport system,” Bastian said.
United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby told CNN any decision on vaccine mandates for U.S. travel would be “up to the government.”
While stakeholders are concerned, polls indicate a majority of people support proof of vaccination for air travel. A poll by Monmouth University found 59 percent of Americans said people should need to show proof of vaccination to get on an airplane.

An Idaho nurse who told her family not to get vaccinated even as her mother was in a coma caused by COVID-19 has died of the disease, her brother told CNN.
Natalie Rise had worked as a registered nurse and a home healthcare worker before staying home with her two special-needs twins, her brother, Daryl Rise, told CNN.
Daryl Rise told the news outlet that his sister didn't think there had been studies conducted on the vaccines. She told her family not to get vaccinated, he said, even as her mother was lying in a coma.
"I think it was from misinformation, I think it was falling into negative social media and bloggers, YouTubers," Rise told CNN.
The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was fully approved by the Food and Drug Administration on August 23, after millions of people had already received both doses of the two-dose shot. About 181 million Americans have been fully vaccinated against the coronavirus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
About 40% of people in Idaho have been fully vaccinated, CNN reported. Earlier this month, Idaho hospitals activated crisis protocol and began rationing care due to an increase in COVID cases caused by the Delta variant.
"Crisis standards of care is a last resort. It means we have exhausted our resources to the point that our healthcare systems are unable to provide the treatment and care we expect,"Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Director Dave Jeppesen said in a September 7 statement. "This is a decision I was fervently hoping to avoid. The best tools we have to turn this around is for more people to get vaccinated and to wear masks indoors and in outdoor crowded public places."
Daryl Rise said he got vaccinated the day after his sister died. He said his mother, who is recovering, is still undecided about the vaccine.
"It was the hardest decision of my life, you know, am I doing right by God? Am I doing right by Natalie?" he told CNN. "And I got it out of fear."

Texto completo: Natalie Rise was a registered nurse in Idaho who loved her job as a home health care worker before she decided to stay at home with her special-needs twins, according to her brother, Daryl Rise.
But her science-based training to become an RN was apparently no match for the disinformation about Covid-19 vaccines being shared across social media, according to her brother.
Rise refused to be vaccinated, even as the virus surged in her city, Coeur d'Alene. And even as her mother lay in a coma in a hospital bed, fighting for life against Covid, Natalie advised her family against being vaccinated.
"She was telling me not to get vaccinated," Daryl Rise told CNN. "I think it was from misinformation, I think it was falling into negative social media and bloggers, YouTubers."
His sister didn't think there had been studies on the vaccines, Daryl Rise said.
There have been numerous scientific studies of the vaccines, testing on thousands of people and millions have received them after authorities granted approval based on those studies.
According to the CDC, 54.7% of the US population is fully vaccinated. However, in Idaho, it's only 40.8%.
Natalie Rise, 46, died August 22, one of the many unvaccinated patients who have triggered a capacity crisis in Idaho hospitals that's flowing into Spokane, Washington, which is about 33 miles away.
Idaho last week said that healthcare providers are allowed to ration care, meaning that providers decide who is sickest and needing immediate care, and who must wait for care.
"This is serious; your ability to receive care in a hospital will likely be affected," the Idaho Department of Health explained the measure on its website. "It may look very different than how you have received care in the past. Surgeries are being postponed, emergency departments are full, and there may not be any beds for patients to be admitted to the hospital."
Misinformation and disinformation on social media
But there's not much alternative, Idaho providers say. Hospitals are converting classrooms and conference rooms into hospital care rooms, and there are patients in the hallways.
"We're in the worst state that we ever have been in the pandemic, this surge has been back-breaking for our health care facilities," said Katherine Hoyer, a spokeswoman for Panhandle Health District that covers five northern counties in Idaho. "Our case investigators, they cannot keep up."
She explained that the hospitals are full of people who are unvaccinated. "It's been like a tsunami wave that continues to hit us each day," Hoyer said.
As for the cause of vaccine hesitancy in Idaho, Hoyer blamed misinformation and disinformation. "Social media makes it so easy to spread information quickly that may seem like fact, and it's not. I wish people would listen to credible sources," she said.
The tsunami has washed into Spokane. "We're declining roughly half of our patients at this point due to capacity, and we've done a lot of things to try to increase capacity," said Daniel Getz, chief medical officer at Providence Sacred Heart Medical Center and Holy Family Hospital in Spokane.
"Historically we're roughly able to accept 90% of transfer requests from our communities to bring patients in," Getz said. "We've struggled over the past two weeks to accept half of those patients."
The hospital is opening a second ICU in the postoperative recovery area, he said, but it's not unthinkable that it too, will have to ration care.
"If we get to the point where we saturate our ability to deliver care, then we're put in that incredibly difficult position," Getz said. "And that's a tragic decision to have to make. You're now trying to triage patients. You have multiple sick patients. You're trying to determine which of those patients does not get life-saving care."
Getz is quick to point out that there are pockets of unvaccinated people in east Washington who are contributing to the crisis. And the overwhelming majority of those crowding medical facilities in both Washington and Idaho are not vaccinated, health officials said.
"The vast majority of patients that are in the hospital for Covid right now are unvaccinated, especially those patients that are in our ICU on ventilators," Getz said.
Patients who are not immediately able to receive the care they need are taking it "horribly, and rightly so," Getz said. "At the end of the day, we're delaying their care."
As for the Rise family, Natalie's death has upended the family. Daryl has given up his job as a truck driver to help care for the 10-year-old twins his sister left behind, he said.
His and Natalie's mother, who is still recovering from Covid-19, remains on the fence about being vaccinated, he said.
But Daryl got his first shot the day after his sister died.
"It was the hardest decision of my life, you know, am I doing right by God? Am I doing right by Natalie?" he said. "And I got it out of fear."

For His Next Act, Anthony Doerr Wrote a Book About Everything

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
KETCHUM, Idaho — Anthony Doerr kept apologizing for the air.
And it’s true that a yellowish haze, which blotted out the sun and filled our noses with a campfire smell, hung over the Sawtooth Mountains last month as we hiked to Titus Lake, 9,050 feet above sea level. The fires on the West Coast were responsible.
My problem was not so much the air quality, but how little of the stuff there seemed to be. I’d flown to this ski-resort town to meet Doerr — best known as the author of the Pulitzer-winning 2014 novel, “All the Light We Cannot See” — to talk about his new book, “Cloud Cuckoo Land,” which will be released by Scribner on Sept. 28. He normally lives in Boise with his wife and twin teenage sons, but he has a second home in Ketchum, just a short walk away from the squat midcentury house where in 1961 Ernest Hemingway turned a shotgun on himself.
Doerr, 47, was making quick headway as I panted behind him. He felt bad about the air since our view of the mountains, covered with spiky pine trees, was less than pristine. But what bugged him wasn’t just the visibility: A fire 1,000 miles away was putting smoke in our throats here, the kind of connection he wished people would spend more time thinking about.
“Take the salmon,” he said, stopping amid the blackened carcasses of fallen trees. These mountains were the headwaters for rivers that were once the endpoint of a 900-mile migration of wild salmon, but a few decades ago dams were built on the lower Snake River, making it near impossible for them to pass. Bears and eagles used to eat the fish, and the entrails they dropped enriched the soil, helping trees and shrubs grow. Without the salmon, the soil is diminished, and the trees are more susceptible to fires and invasive species.
“So four dams built in the 1970s are making it harder for the trees today,” he said, exasperated.
Doerr has a mission — alongside his craftsman’s commitment to assembling sentences and then stories from those sentences and then whole worlds from those stories. It is to put readers high above it all. There is certainly a desire to please, to offer the “drug” of plot, as he put it when we finally sat, breathless, by the shimmering lake. But there is something else, and it makes him an outlier among novelists, driven as so many are by the challenges of rendering interior life. Doerr hopes to give his readers perspective so they see their place on Earth, that “little mud-heap in a great vastness,” as a character in “Cloud Cuckoo Land” calls it.
Similar to “All the Light,” his new novel has short chapters and is propelled by disparate characters who must somehow intersect, but like a juggler adding three and then four more balls, he’s raised the level of difficulty. This book contains three story arcs — one set in the late 15th century at the fall of Constantinople, another in present-day Idaho and a third on a Noah’s ark-like spaceship heading toward a possibly inhabitable planet. Holding these pieces together is an ancient Greek text (one Doerr invented), the “Cloud Cuckoo Land” of the title, which passes through and affects the lives of the book’s five main characters. It was named to the National Book Awards fiction longlist Friday.
Nan Graham, his longtime editor, said that where other writers might live by the diktat “write what you know,” for Doerr, it’s “write what you want to know.” His interest was first sparked by the walls of Constantinople, which stood for nearly 1,000 years before the Ottoman invasion. This then led him to the culture that existed within the city’s walls, its vast libraries, and all the books now lost to time. And that in turn to how books, especially when produced by scribes, were preserved over centuries, and this idea of stewardship, a chain of human effort to keep stories alive.
“I think art is another way to try to exercise your imagination at connecting incongruous things,” Doerr said. “It’s a way to say, hey, reader, let’s work together and practice and train our imagination to connect things that you don’t readily think of as connected. And then that maybe becomes a little bit political, because I think the solution going forward is we need to have a much more planetary perspective.”
The stories he tells are fablelike in the way fables lead a character through a treacherous situation toward light — a wolf slaughtered, an escape from an oven — with a moral emerging through the telling. Doerr didn’t fight this characterization. “I love fables!” he said. “I don’t take that as a critique.”
And as in many fables, his protagonists are usually children. “All the Light,” which was set during World War II, featured a blind French girl helping the resistance and a German boy conscripted into the Wehrmacht. In his new book they include two young people on either side of Constantinople’s walls and a girl on that mission through space. Writing from the perspective of a child allows him to defamiliarize the world, he said, “to see more nakedly some of the things that we’ve elided or erased in our minds because of age.”
Doerr’s bald head, smooth face and crystal eyes make him look almost otherworldly, even driving in his Toyota pickup through the very real landscape of rural Idaho, pointing out deer and trying to spot a moose. He has a soft-spoken Midwestern niceness — he grew up in Cleveland, the son of a science teacher. At least four times throughout the day he offered me chocolate chip cookies. There’s little evidence of a writer’s tortured soul besides what he admits is an “impostor complex” that has him work himself hard, never quite able to process his own success.
What he hopes to preserve for himself is a certain openness to the world. It’s a sensitivity that has him saying a prayer (“to God, maybe?”) whenever he passes roadkill (“that’s a dead raccoon or a fox and we’re just like, going to soccer practice, which seems totally wrong”). It’s hard not to crack a cynical smile listening to this, but it doesn’t seem contrived.
“I believe in awe, and I’m trying to put awe occasionally into my paragraphs, but particularly just in my life,” Doerr said. “And if I get kind of down, it’s because I haven’t gone outside yet. You don’t have to see an elk come stumbling through the grass. Sometimes it’s just a really cool pebble you found. Or just watching an ant do its job for a little while. Like man, there’s so much happening around us all the time. On micro and macro levels.”
Doerr’s one close writer friend is Jess Walter, the author, most recently, of “The Cold Millions.” The two met during a residency at Tin House. “His humility is genuine,” Walter said about Doerr.
What did it mean for his friend, despite this groundedness, to contend with the phenomenon his last book became? According to Scribner, “All the Light” spent more than 200 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list. It sold more than 5.7 million copies in North America across print, e-book and audio formats and another 9.5 million copies worldwide.
“I can’t imagine any writer not getting a slight case of the bends when that success comes,” Walter said, “but whatever anxiety he had, all the expectation in the world can’t change the fact that you still have to write something else, and that’s what he did.”
After our trek down from Titus Lake, we stopped for dinner at Smiley Creek Lodge, a restaurant surrounded by acres of land and fronted by a wooden sculpture of a grizzly bear clutching a fish.
I wanted to understand more about the flip side of popularity, whether it ever made him regard his own work differently. After all, Doerr himself told me that literature has to be, at some level, “unsettling.” Can a book be unsettling and also massively popular? He did admit that the one critique of “All the Light” that landed a blow was that he had aestheticized the war, not really showing the suffering of the Holocaust.
Then there was the question of his signature short chapters. Doerr laughed off the possibility that these were an accommodation to the attention span of readers. “I know where you’re going with this,” he said with a smile, looking completely in his element with the sun heading down behind the mountains, the empty, purple vista all around us and a burger and fries on his plate.
He had hit upon this approach for the most practical of reasons. As a parent, he couldn’t hope to get more than an hour or two of solid work done before having to attend to shuttling the boys to swim practice or some other activity. “I might have stumbled accidentally into that,” he said.
It may have been by chance, and it may have had the side effect of being easy to read, but this way of putting a novel together offered a bridge between the miniaturist in Doerr and the seeker of world-spanning connections. He could focus on the details of every piece in the narrative, but there was pleasure, too, in placing them against each other. Sometimes he would lay out all these micro chapters on the floor so he could see them and discover the resonances between characters across space and time.
“That’s the real joy,” Doerr said, “the visceral pleasure that comes from taking these stories, these lives, and intersecting them, braiding them.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

The roughly 15% of the population living in rural America includes some of the oldest and sickest patients in the country — a disparity that has grown more stark during the coronavirus pandemic. The Biden administration is investing more in telemedicine, whose use has grown sharply during the pandemic, as a way to improve their access to care.
Last month, the Department of Health and Human Services announced that it was distributing nearly $20 million to strengthen telehealth services — usually medical appointments that take place by video or phone — in rural and underserved communities across the country. While the amount is relatively modest, it is part of a broader push to address the long-neglected health care infrastructure in those areas.
The spending includes about $4 million to help bring primary, acute and behavioral health care directly to patients via telehealth in 11 states, including Arkansas, Arizona and Maine. The money will update technology in rural health care clinics, train doctors and nurses how to conduct telehealth appointments and teach patients how to take advantage of virtual appointments when they cannot see a doctor in person.
An additional $4.3 million will help specialists at academic medical centers provide training and support to primary care providers in rural and other underserved areas via “tele-mentoring,” so that they can treat patients in their communities with complex conditions, such as long COVID or substance use disorders.
“Telehealth expands access to care and is a vital tool for improving health equity,” said Diana Espinosa, the acting administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration, an agency within the department that is distributing the money. “This funding will help drive the innovation necessary to build clinical networks, educational opportunities and trusted resources to further advance telehealth.”
Rural Americans are at greater risk of dying from heart disease, cancer, accidental injury, chronic respiratory illnesses and strokes than their urban counterparts, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The pandemic, too, has hit them disproportionately: ICU beds have been sparse in rural Idaho during virus surges. Navajo Nation in rural Arizona once had a higher virus death rate than New York City.
In August, the Biden administration provided billions of dollars to rural communities through the American Rescue Plan — separate from the $20 million — to address virus concerns, including by expanding telehealth, and to help rebuild crumbling health care infrastructure.
Other investments in rural health during the pandemic have included improving training for clinicians working at rural Veterans Affairs hospitals; more than $8 billion to help hospitals and doctors’ offices make up for lost revenues and increased expenses during that time; and $350 million to rural communities for food, medical supplies and vaccines.
Even though telehealth has become more mainstream during the pandemic, challenges persist. It remains inaccessible in areas without internet or proper speeds. And there is still a lot of uncertainty about how using telemedicine more would affect insurers’ and hospitals’ bottom lines over time, not to mention patient outcomes. A large body of research supports the use of telehealth for communication and counseling, and for monitoring patients with chronic conditions, but more evidence is needed on its broader use.
The University of Mississippi Medical Center will receive more than $3.5 million of the $20 million from the Health Resources and Services Administration, through two grant programs to improve health care in rural, medically underserved areas of the state that have widespread chronic disease and high poverty rates.
The coronavirus pandemic increased not only the need for telehealth but also the amount that doctors and nurses get paid to use it. Early in the pandemic, Congress and the Trump administration expanded Medicare’s coverage of telehealth services for the duration of the public health emergency, although it is unclear whether the coverage will continue indefinitely.
“There is now momentum; telehealth is now considered part of the mainstream of health care delivery,” said Dr. Saurabh Chandra, the chief telehealth officer at the Center for Telehealth at the University of Mississippi Medical Center. “There were lots of loosening of regulations that allowed us to expand telehealth and do telehealth in a very short period of time.”
Telehealth is not just for rural areas, Chandra said. It can be used in schools and correctional facilities, as well as in patients’ homes, nursing homes, doctors’ offices and hospitals. Among other things, telehealth technology has been crucial to stabilizing rural COVID-19 patients as they await transfer, through a program commonly called “tele-ICU.”
The University of Mississippi Medical Center plans to start such a program — essentially a two-way video system that connects critically ill patients in rural hospital ICU beds with teams of doctors and nurses who specialize in caring for patients from a distance.
Angela Turner-Ford, a Democratic state senator in Mississippi who is the chairwoman of the state’s legislative Black caucus, said that increasing access to telehealth would also help medical providers combat misinformation that had been circulating among the state’s Black residents and creating high vaccine hesitancy.
If it were easier to connect with doctors regularly, many of the hesitant might change their minds, she said.
“They are left to themselves and what someone may have told them that may not be reliable information,” Turner-Ford said. “If you don’t have that existing relationship with a practitioner, someone in that instance may have known who to call just to have a simple conversation.”
Jennifer Yturriondobeitia, CEO of Cornerstone Whole Healthcare Organization, a nonprofit in Boise, Idaho, focused on improving rural health care, said the $350,000 it received will go toward telehealth for mental and substance abuse disorders. Idaho lacks treatment for these conditions, especially in rural areas, she said.
Yturriondobeitia said her group had used telehealth in Idaho since 2015. Back then, patients drove to doctors’ offices to connect with distant specialized providers. Now the focus is on connecting patients with those providers from their own homes.
In Oregon, the funding will help residents primarily in the Columbia River Gorge region. Five of the six counties that will benefit are in the vast rural area where mountain ranges form the boundary between Oregon and Washington. Poverty levels are high, and for some, a visit to the doctor can be an hour’s drive away. Nearly one-third of the population is Hispanic.
“They don’t have enough primary care doctors, they don’t have enough mental health professionals, they don’t have enough anybody there,” said Dr. Nancy Elder, director of the Oregon Rural Practice-Based Research Network, which received $475,000.
Chronic diabetes is also pervasive in the region. Elder said one way she believed the quality of care could be improved was by increasing the skills of the doctors and nurses already based there.
The region’s award will be used for Project ECHO, a program that allows rural primary care clinicians to learn from specialists by video. The meetings begin with an educational presentation, followed by a discussion of real-life clinical obstacles the providers are facing.
“They get access to expertise that they wouldn’t have,” said Maggie McLain McDonnell, director of the Oregon ECHO Network and Health Education Initiatives, “but they also get support so that they feel less alone in the challenges that they’re facing treating these patients.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Texto completo: Idaho officials announced Thursday they're preparing to ration hospital care due to the Covid-19 surge, and it was the last thing next-door Washington state's top hospital advocate wanted to hear.
"It's terrible. I don't know if people understand the gravity of the situation," Cassie Sauer, chief executive of the Washington State Hospital Association, told CNN Thursday evening. "This is not something that should be happening in America at this point."
Sauer says hospitals in Washington are getting more requests to take patients from overwhelmed facilities in Idaho. In some cases, sick Idahoans are simply driving themselves across the border seeking treatment.
"The fact that it's not causing severe alarm in Idaho is shocking to me," Sauer said. "In a normal time, our hospitals would accept almost every transfer request. They're accepting some, but they're declining more now."
Although hospitals as far west as Seattle have been getting transfer requests, according to Sauer, most are coming to Spokane. That city is just across the border from Coeur d'Alene, the largest city in Idaho's narrow northern region.
"While we have been able to accept some of those patients, we have also had to decline more than half," said Marce Edwards Olson with MultiCare, which operates Deaconess Hospital in Spokane. "All of our hospitals are very busy taking care of Covid patients and we have been near capacity for some time."
Under the Crisis Standards of Care declaration announced Thursday, the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare said, "The massive surge of Covid-19 patients has exhausted the supply of staff, available beds and necessary resources to adequately address the increased demand for healthcare services."
The declaration is a decision of "last resort," Idaho's health department director, Dave Jeppesen, said earlier this month. It moved Idaho Gov. Brad Little to plead for eligible Idahoans to get vaccinated.
"We have reached an unprecedented and unwanted point in the history of our state," the governor, a Republican, said earlier this month.
We're in a situation of limited resources'
Throughout the pandemic, Covid-19 has strained the US health care system. Hospitals continue to face difficult decisions on which patient takes priority when staffing is low and beds are full.
"We're already making those choices, and they're very difficult choices," Dr. Steven Brown, a critical care pulmonologist at Mercy Virtual Care Center in St. Louis, told CNN's Ana Cabrera earlier this week. "I work in the intensive care unit. Many people have serious illnesses but not illnesses where they're going to die immediately, but serious illnesses where they need an operation and some of these operations are so serious that after surgery, they need to be in the intensive care unit for a day or two -- replacement of a heart valve, surgery for serious cancers like pancreatic cancer.
"If the intensive care unit beds are all filled up with patients who are on ventilators because of their pneumonia, surgeries have to be postponed," Brown said. "We have situations where people may come into the hospital with a heart attack, and they have to stay in the emergency room for extended periods of time while waiting for a bed to open up."
In some cases, that means a patient has died.
"It's a sad situation that we really haven't seen in American history in a very, very long time." Brown said. "We're in a situation of limited resources now, and when you have limited resources, we are in triage situations -- and some people may die as a consequence of this."
Generally, hospitals and health systems say they have plans to address an overflow of patients.
"All hospitals and health systems have plans in place to deal with a surge in patients. These plans can include actions like adding beds, including in non-traditional areas of care in a hospital like a cafeteria or parking lot, shifting patients between hospitals, and working with their local and state health departments to find other sites of care," Akin Demehin, director of policy at the American Hospital Association (AHA), wrote in an email to CNN earlier this month.
"Sometimes this includes sending patients to hospitals in nearby states that may have the capacity to treat them," Demehin wrote. "One other option that some hospitals have taken is to scale back, or put a pause on, so-called elective procedures that are non-emergent and can be safely delayed."
Yet for the most part, hospital capacity is not only about how many beds are filled. A hospital can usually add beds. But many facilities are more concerned about enough staffing to care for patients, according to Demehin.
"Hospitals and health systems entered the COVID-19 pandemic already facing a shortage of skilled caregivers, and the last 18 months have exacerbated that," Demehin wrote, adding that AHA has called on the Biden administration to work as a partner in developing strategies to address the shortage of health care staff.
Hospitals making tough choices
Under federal law, an ER must accept any patient who seeks care, Art Caplan, professor of bioethics at NYU Langone Health in New York, told CNN earlier this month.
"You have to accept anybody, even if they have no money, and stabilize them. It's called EMTALA, and it's been around for a while," Caplan said.
The Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) requires hospitals with emergency departments to provide a medical screening exam to any person who comes to the emergency department and requests care. The law also prohibits hospitals with emergency departments from refusing to examine or treat people with emergency medical conditions.
Now, during the pandemic, many of the Covid-19 patients filling hospital beds are unvaccinated. EMTALA obligations remain in place.
Back in Washington, Sauer is frustrated that the state's neighbor to the east is not taking the kind of extensive steps Washington has to stem the tide.
"Idaho's not doing what it should. They don't have a [statewide] mask mandate. They need to do their part," said Sauer. "They cannot rely on Washington as their stopgap."

Texto completo: (TNSEve) -- The University of Maine's Presque Isle Campus issued the following news release:
The University of Maine at Presque Isle will present New York Times best-selling author Kate Braestrup as the first speaker in its 2021-2022 Libra Distinguished Lecture Series on Friday, Sept. 24 at 7 p.m. in the Campus Center. During her talk, Practice and Play in the Maine Woods, Braestrup will pass on lessons learned from game wardens about preparing for, and enjoying, time in the wild and beautiful lands of Maine. The event is free and the public is encouraged to attend.
In an effort to best ensure the health and safety of campus and community members, campus visitors must be vaccinated or have a negative COVID test result within the past 72 hours to enter campus buildings, and face coverings are required while indoors on campus. Exceptions can be made to this requirement with appropriate approval from campus administration.
Kate Braestrup serves as the Chaplain for the Maine Warden Service and is the author of several books, including her New York Times best-selling memoir Here If You Need Me, about her journey in the wake of her husband's death, pursuing his dream to become a minister, and finding her calling as a chaplain to search-and-rescue workers. She has written three other books--Marriage, and Other Acts of Charity, Beginner's Grace, and Anchor & Flares.
The daughter of a foreign correspondent, Braestrup spent her childhood in Algiers, New York City, Paris, Bangkok, Washington, D.C., and Sabillasville, Maryland, and was educated at the Parsons School of Design/The New School and Georgetown University. Her first husband, Trooper James Andrew "Drew" Griffith, was killed in a car accident while on duty in 1996. Braestrup was left a widowed mother of four children between the ages of 3 and 9.
Following through on her husband's plans to become a Unitarian Universalist minister, Braestrup found her own vocation. She entered the Bangor Theological Seminary in 1997, and was ordained in 2004. Since 2001, she has served as chaplain to the Maine Warden Service, joining the wardens as they search the wild lands and fresh waters of Maine for those who have lost their way, and offering comfort to those who wait for the ones they love to be rescued, or for their bodies to be recovered. Braestrup has since remarried to artist Simon van der Ven and the two have a total of six children.
The University's Libra Distinguished Lecture Series was established in 1999. Each year, the LDLS Committee sponsors four to six speakers who come from Maine and beyond, representing a range of disciplines and viewpoints. While the emphasis tends to be on featuring visiting academics, it is not exclusively so. The speakers typically spend two days at the University meeting with classes and presenting a community lecture.
UMPI welcomes the campus and community to hear Braestrup speak on Sept. 24. For more information about Kate Braestrup, visit her website at www.katebraestrup.com.

The U.S. outlook
Even if you’ve been following news of the virus closely, it can be hard to know which way the pandemic is headed. To help sort it out, I gathered a few charts that give us a clearer picture.
Virus cases, which had been accelerating rapidly since early July, seemed to have leveled out before Labor Day. There was chatter that perhaps the worst of the Delta wave was behind us. The holiday weekend caused case numbers to fluctuate wildly, but now that the dust has settled, the U.S. finds itself in more or less the same place.
“The truth is, we’re right around 150,000 cases per day, which is lower than the peak this summer,” said Mitch Smith, who tracks the virus for The Times. “But that’s still like 50 times higher than we’d like.”
The positive news is that the national case rate is not growing, even at a time when most of the country is open and schools and colleges are back in session. Some of the states that were hit the hardest this summer — including Florida, Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia — also seem to be turning a corner.
Cases are rising in the Mountain West, the Northeast and the Upper Midwest. But Mitch said he expects case levels to remain well below those seen in the South this summer. We may even see cases decline over the next few weeks.
However, the national outlook appears much more dire when tracking hospitalizations and deaths.
While hospitalization numbers are beginning to come down nationally, they are hitting crisis levels in some regions. In the South, health care centers are running dangerously low on space in intensive care units. In Alaska, emergency room patients are waiting hours in their vehicles, forcing medical teams to ration care.
One in four U.S. hospitals now reports more than 95 percent of I.C.U. beds occupied — up from one in five last month. When all or nearly all I.C.U. beds are occupied, experts say it can become difficult to maintain standards of care for the sickest patients.
Most worrying, Mitch said, are the death numbers, and what they will look like in the weeks ahead.
“We’re fast approaching 2,000 deaths a day on average, and we never wanted to be anywhere near that number again,” Mitch said. “Unfortunately, the hospitalization case numbers suggest that the death rate is not going to start going down for a while. And, tragically, we are now closing in on 700,000 total deaths.” (The U.S. recently passed another grim milestone: 1 in 500 residents has now died of Covid-19.)
Unvaccinated Americans are 10 times more likely to be hospitalized with Covid than the vaccinated, according to the C.D.C. Several of the states with the highest rates of I.C.U. occupancy, including Alabama and Mississippi, are also among those with the lowest vaccination rates.
Put simply, the vaccines save lives. Unlike most countries, the U.S. has more than enough for everyone. That means many of the recent deaths were preventable.
The New York Times Opinion section set out to quantify how many lives could have been saved during the last wave if all states had managed to vaccinate their residents as quickly as the state with the highest vaccination rate (usually Vermont).
The findings were stark: During July and August, at least 16,000 lives could have been saved.
The return that wasn’t
New York Times photographers around the U.S. spent the past six months documenting the coronavirus economy as the early summer veered from a seeming return to normalcy into a much darker and more uncertain situation.
Today, the finish line still feels elusively out of reach. Take a look at what our photographers saw, month by month, here.
What else we’re following

- The U.S. made coronavirus vaccinations mandatory for new immigrants.

- President Biden met with executives to push vaccine mandates.

- Federal regulators published the first analysis of Pfizer’s booster shot application.

- The Biden administration is taking over the distribution of monoclonal antibody treatments and ordering 1.4 million doses to prevent a supply shortage, The Washington Post reports.

- The pandemic was the top issue for many voters in California’s recall election.

- If you’re vaccinated, when should you wear a mask?

- More than 2,600 Los Angeles Police Department employees, out of about 12,300, plan to request a religious or medical exemption to the city’s vaccine mandate, CBS reports.

- Jessica Grose, who writes the Parenting newsletter, explored why Covid parenting decisions were making her feel dead inside.



What you’re doing
I have finally learned that the deep pain and anger I have been dealing with — by being surrounded by many who don’t mask and many who aren’t vaccinated — really comes from the feeling of belonging to a community that doesn’t care about me, my family or others. A community should be a group of people who work together to make a safe and nice place to live. My community is currently the biggest threat to my family, and that is sad. How and when I will get over this, I’m unsure.

Texto completo: Surging COVID-19 cases - and the increasing proportion reported in children - are causing many health experts to worry about the outlook as the school year gets underway across the entire country.
But Dr. Anthony Fauci said there shouldn't be a big uptick "if we do it right."
"We've gotta get the school system masked in addition to surrounding the children with vaccinated people," said the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. "That's the solution."
In Miami-Dade County Public Schools, 13 school employees have died from COVID-19 since Aug. 16, the school district and local teacher union told CNN. All 13 - four teachers, one security monitor, one cafeteria worker and seven school bus drivers - were unvaccinated, they said.
"I think this underscores the big tragedy that we see occurring across America," Miami-Dade County Public Schools Superintendent Alberto Carvalho said.
"Even though in my community, 98% of individuals have gotten at least one dose of the vaccine, there is still a lag specific to individuals that represent ethnic minorities in Miami-Dade."
The 13 school employees who died were African Americans and were unvaccinated, according to their families, Carvalho said.
Since vaccine mandates are illegal in Florida, the best thing Carvalho can do is offer incentives to teachers to get fully vaccinated, including a $275 stipend to any employee who shows proof of vaccination, he said.
Schools, particularly in the South, started their new year in August and many districts, notably those without mask measures in place, saw an explosion of cases.
Doctors and experts warn it could happen again when students in much of the rest of the country return to school after the Labor Day weekend unless there is strong action to keep the virus in check. Fauci and other officials across the U.S. have stressed masks in schools and vaccination for those eligible are crucial.
"These little ones don't have the choice to take the vaccine. It's up to us," Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said during a back-to-school event in Rochester. "For goodness sakes, we're adults and we know what protects them, so it shouldn't be that hard to say, the science says, put them in a mask. You wouldn't let them run across the street without looking, you certainly wouldn't put them in a crowded classroom without a mask."
While officials believe the federal government is limited on broadly mandating vaccines, President Joe Biden is expected to deliver a major address this week on the next phase of the pandemic, which will include components related to schools, private companies and requirements for federal employees, two sources familiar with the speech told CNN.
Ahead of the speech, poll data from Gallup showed more Americans now disagree than agree that Biden and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have communicated a clear plan of action in response to COVID-19.
The speech comes as the impact of the pandemic on schools becomes clearer.
Children now represent 26.8% of the weekly COVID-19 cases, according to new data. Over two weeks, from Aug. 19 to Sept. 2, there was a 10% increase in the cumulated number of COVID-19 cases in children since the beginning of the pandemic, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.
Pace of vaccinations may be slowing again
Meanwhile, data published by the CDC shows an average of about 356,662 people are initiating their COVID-19 vaccination each day - an 18% drop from last week and a 26% drop from a month earlier.
But those slowing numbers may have been affected by the Labor Day holiday, and could pick up again.
U.S. officials continue to stress the way out of the pandemic is through vaccinations.
"What we've got to do to get to a successful place with Delta is vaccinate enough people, develop enough in the way of therapeutics and treatments, such that we're not losing nearly as many people every day, every week, every year to the Delta virus," U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy told CNN's Jim Acosta.
A large, real-life study confirmed that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are about 90% effective at keeping people 50 and older out of the hospital. Johnson & Johnson's vaccine also had high effectiveness, the team found, but "additional data are needed."
The study, led by the CDC, found that two shots of Pfizer's or Moderna's mRNA vaccines were 91% effective against infection leading to an emergency department or urgent care clinic visit, 89% against infection leading to hospitalization and 90% against infection leading to an ICU admission.
Even among people 85 and older, effectiveness was 85% or higher, the team wrote. Johnson & Johnson's vaccine was 73% effective against emergency department or urgent care clinic visit and 68% against infection leading to hospitalization, the team found.
The study showed the mRNA-based vaccines were highly effective among people 85 or older and those with chronic medical conditions.
Reinforcements going to hospitals
The lagging vaccination rates and climbing case numbers are keeping the pressure on the health care systems in many states.
In Kentucky, hospitals are facing critical staffing shortages and getting pushed to the brink for ICU beds, Gov. Andy Beshear said, forcing the closure of some surgery rooms to create ICU centers and more beds to address the influx of COVID-19 patients.
The state has stepped in to help by providing COVID-19 testing via third-party vendors that set up outside of hospitals, freeing up hospital emergency room staff and clinicians to prioritize other healthcare needs for the community, Beshear said.
The governor said he also requested FEMA strike teams and has had a nurse strike team deployed up at St. Claire Regional Medical Center, which has been overwhelmed in treating the influx of COVID-19 patients.
Less than half of Kentucky's population is fully vaccinated against the virus, according to CDC data.
Reinforcements are also on the way for health care workers treating COVID-19 patients in Idaho, Arkansas and Alabama.
Each state will get a 20-person US Army North (ARNORTH) team that includes nurses, respiratory therapists, and medical doctors. Six teams are already deployed, with three teams in Louisiana, two in Mississippi, and one in Alabama.
"This is the first time Department of Defense medical assets have deployed to support both Idaho and Arkansas during the pandemic," ARNORTH commander Lt. Gen. Laura J. Richardson said. "We are proud to be called upon to support our local, state, and federal partners there, and in Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi, in this whole-of-government response."
The best protection against hospitalizations, health experts have emphasized, is vaccination.
Data from local health departments in Utah, Virginia and Seattle's King County suggests that unvaccinated people are at least four times - and up to nine times - more likely than vaccinated people to test positive for coronavirus, and that gap has grown in recent weeks.
About 53.2% of all Americans are fully vaccinated, according to CDC data. Those numbers are not yet where experts say they need to be to protect the majority of Americans.
In August, the FDA authorized an additional COVID19 vaccine dose for certain immunocompromised people. And while the effort to vaccinate the entire population continues, officials are now preparing for the rollout of booster doses for a larger population.
The boosters do not indicate that something is wrong with the first two doses, Fauci said. Rather, the third dose may just be part of a full vaccine regimen.
The White House is expected to kick off its booster plan the week of Sept. 20. At that time, up to 5.2 million people may be eligible to receive their third dose.
The plan is to allow third doses starting eight months after a person receives the second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna mRNA vaccines, although the timing could fluctuate.
It's not clear what the timing will be for a second dose of the single-dose J&J vaccine, which more than 14 million people received, according to the CDC.
"That might be two doses for a J&J, but for the mRNA, we know from studies that are already ongoing in Israel now, that when the degree of protection against infection and even severe disease goes down to a certain precarious level, when you give the person that third boost, you dramatically increase the level of protection," Fauci said.
"Even more so than before the boost, it goes up to and beyond the level of protection."

ARVADA, Colo. — President Joe Biden warned on Tuesday that the United States had only a decade left to confront a global climate crisis, using his second day touring a wildfire-ravaged West to try to rally the public, and congressional Democrats, to support measures that his administration hopes will reduce the burning of fossil fuels.
Biden’s stops this week in Colorado; Boise, Idaho; and Long Beach and the Sacramento area in California amounted to more than an opportunity to call attention to the severe destruction of wildfires and other natural disasters that have been exacerbated by climate change. The visits were a last-ditch opportunity to sell the importance of measures aimed at mitigating climate change, some of which appear increasingly at risk in his spending packages.
“A drought or a fire doesn’t see a property line,” Biden said during remarks at a federal renewable energy laboratory. “It doesn’t give a damn for which party you belong to. Disasters aren’t going to stop. That’s the nature of the climate threat. But we know what we have to do. We just need to summon the courage and the creativity to do it.”
Underscoring the urgency, Biden added: “We don’t have much more than 10 years.”
Democratic leaders drafting a $3.5 trillion spending bill are struggling to match the urgency of Biden’s pleas with pushback from energy lobbyists and some key Democrats, who want a far less expansive effort than what Biden has in mind.
On Monday, during a visit to California’s Office of Emergency Services in the Sacramento area, Biden appeared to recognize that. Before he received a briefing on the wildfire damage, he reminded dozens of emergency workers in the conference room that he was not able to include all of his proposed investments to combat climate change in a bipartisan agreement that he reached this summer on infrastructure. He said he was focused on including them in the more sweeping $3.5 trillion package but acknowledged that it could fall short of his ambitions.
“Whether that passes or not, exactly how much, I don’t know. But we’re going to get it passed,” Biden said.
Tax writers in the House have already made a concession of sorts on climate. A bill released earlier this week omits any tax on carbon emissions, even though such revenue could help pay for the giant package, which Democrats plan to pass along party lines and without Republican support. Many Senate Democrats have pushed to include either a direct tax on emissions or an indirect one, like a tariff on goods imported from high-emission countries such as China. But the party is not aligned, and given the slim majorities in the House and Senate, such a plan would probably have trouble gaining the 50 votes needed in the Senate.
Centrist concerns over the size and scope of some proposed tax increases could force party leaders to pare back incentives for low-carbon energy deployment in the plan. So could influential Democrats who have resisted the party’s previous climate legislation, like Sen. Joe Manchin III of West Virginia.
A coal-state moderate, Manchin is the committee chair charged with drafting the Senate version of the single largest effort to reduce emissions in the bill: a carrot-and-stick approach to push electric utilities to draw more power from low-carbon sources over the coming decade.
“The transition is happening,” Manchin said, speaking on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday. “Now they’re wanting to pay companies to do what they’re already doing. Makes no sense to me at all for us to take billions of dollars and pay utilities for what they’re going to do as the market transitions.”
He declined to comment further on Tuesday, telling reporters he preferred to negotiate in private. Senate Democrats used a weekly caucus lunch to provide an update on efforts to cobble together pieces of the legislation during the annual summer break, though it was unclear how swiftly they would reconcile differences within and between both chambers.
Biden used his western swing to highlight what his aides hope will be a call to climate action for those who have not committed to a more aggressive plan. Throughout the trip, Biden heard from emergency officials and governors — including those at odds with the administration on the pandemic and other issues — about the urgent need to address natural disasters. Biden told the emergency workers in California that he had recently spoken with Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, a Republican, about emergency response.
“Some of my more conservative —” Biden said before stopping himself and resuming, “some of my less believing friends in this notion of global warming are all of a sudden having an altar call.”
“They’re seeing the Lord,” Biden said.
When Biden received his fire briefing later from officials at the Office of Emergency Services, a woman presenting a map of wildfires to him could be heard saying, “That’s why this is so important.”
On Tuesday, Biden watched a wind turbine demonstration at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory Flatirons Campus in Arvada, Colorado, then recounted the damage from hurricanes and wildfires he had seen in trips across the United States this month. He called for tax credits to speed deployment of solar power and electric vehicles and for the creation of a Civilian Climate Corps to conserve public lands and help make them more resilient to climate change.
Biden’s economic team has not clarified whether the president would embrace an emissions tax as part of the package. He refused to agree to a Republican proposal to raise the federal gasoline tax to help pay for infrastructure, citing his pledge not to raise income taxes on anyone earning less than $400,000. But his administration has not objected to a tax increase on cigarettes, which the House included in its tax plan and which would disproportionately hit lower earners.
Administration officials have also not said how far a final agreement must go on emission reduction in order for Biden to accept it. Asked by a reporter in Arvada if he would sign the $3.5 trillion spending package if it included slimmed-down measures to address climate change, Biden pumped his fist. “I’m up for more climate measures,” he said.
Karine Jean-Pierre, the principal deputy press secretary, told reporters on Air Force One that Biden was strongly committed to the climate components of the bill. But, she said, “the Biden climate agenda doesn’t hinge on just reconciliation or infrastructure package alone.”
“We are looking at every sector of the economy for opportunities to grow clean-energy jobs and reduce greenhouse gas emissions,” she said, “especially in the decisive — in this decisive decade.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

A Plan to Hasten the Sale of Surplus Federal Property Gets Bogged Down

The plan sounded simple enough.
The federal government has long owned more real estate than it knows what to do with — buildings that sit empty and sites that are underdeveloped — but it must jump through hoops before it can sell its holdings. So surplus properties languish while taxpayers foot the bill for maintenance.
The solution, springing from legislation passed in 2016, was an independent agency that would quickly identify underused properties and expedite their disposal.
But nothing has been simple about the Public Buildings Reform Board, as the little-known agency is called.
It took three years for the five existing board members to be sworn in, and two empty seats remain, including that of the chairman. The Government Accountability Office reported that the board did not adequately document how it went about selecting properties for sale. The board was sued when it sought to sell a Seattle building that is a repository of important tribal records. The General Services Administration, the agency that disposes of most federal properties, has flouted the board’s advice.
And so far, only a single property that the board has recommended for sale has actually been sold.
“It’s taken a lot more effort to get rid of this stuff than the reformers had hoped,” said Demian Brady, vice president for research at the National Taxpayers Union Foundation, a lobbying group.
The board’s tribulations are a reminder of how difficult it can be to untangle government red tape. Some of the issues can be chalked up to growing pains and the difficulties of operating during the pandemic, and board members contend that the agency has turned a corner.
But the rise of remote work means that federal agencies are likely to need less office space, resulting in a greater need for the government to reduce its footprint.
“This tool is going to be more, not less, important going forward,” said Daniel Mathews, head of federal sales at WeWork and former staff director of the House subcommittee that drafted the legislation creating the board.
But whether the board will have its intended effect remains to be seen.
“It’s turned into an arm-wrestling contest,” said Norman Dong, a managing director at FD Stonewater, a real estate company. He supported the legislation as commissioner of the public buildings service in the GSA.
The problem of surplus federal property dates back decades, well before the Public Buildings Reform Board was created. By 2003, the GAO had placed the management of federal real property on a “high risk” list, in part because of long-standing difficulties unloading unneeded property.
The GSA functions as the federal landlord, managing the buildings the government owns. But it cannot sell a building unless the agency occupying it declares it “excess.” And agencies have had little incentive to do that.
It might cost an agency less to maintain a building on an annual basis than to relocate employees to a smaller space and prepare the old building for sale, even if it makes sense in the long run to get the property off its books. And agencies may not benefit financially from a sale because the proceeds often go directly to the Treasury Department.
If an agency does deem a building “excess,” there are additional hurdles: The property must first be offered to other agencies and, if there are no takers, made available for homeless services and other uses. The process can take years, leading to a backlog.
In the federal government’s 2015 fiscal year, agencies reported more than 7,000 excess or underused properties, according to the GAO.
Attempts have been made, through Republican and Democratic administrations, to remedy the problem. A bipartisan breakthrough came in 2016 with the passage of the Federal Assets Sale and Transfer Act, known as FASTA, modeled on a successful process of whittling down Defense Department installations after the Cold War. FASTA, it was hoped, would do for civilian properties what the Base Realignment and Closure process had done for military sites.
Signed into law by President Barack Obama just before he left office, FASTA authorized the board to come up with three rounds of sales, beginning with a group of “high value asset” properties that would fetch $500 million to $750 million. The high-value round was also seen as a high-speed strategy because those properties could skirt the usual procedural hoops and go straight to sale, with the earnings funding the preparation of other properties for sale. Total projected earnings over the board’s six-year term: $7 billion.
But members were not sworn in until May 2019, leaving them scrambling to hire staff and identify high-value properties by a fall deadline.
A former Nike missile site in Gaithersburg, Maryland, a suburb of Washington, made the cut. So did 17 acres in Menlo Park, California, dotted with buildings the U.S. Geological Survey was vacating. Real estate is at a premium in both areas.
But the board stumbled with its selection of a Seattle building where the National Archives and Records Administration stores historical documents. Board members felt that the run-down building was ripe for redevelopment, but protests by scholars and tribes concerned about losing access to the records led to a lawsuit by Washington’s attorney general and, ultimately, the withdrawal of the property.
The board also recommended the sale of the Chet Holifield Federal Building — a ziggurat-like office building on 92 acres in Laguna Niguel, a city in Orange County, California — but historic preservation issues have held up the process.
The final list of FASTA properties was narrowed to 11.
To expedite sales and maximize returns, the board recommended that the GSA hire a brokerage firm to sell the remaining properties together. The board believed a portfolio sale would attract “the largest and best potential buyers,” said D. Talmage Hocker, a board member who is founder and CEO of a real estate company in Louisville, Kentucky.
“We’re supposed to be making money,” said Angela Styles, a board member and former Office of Management and Budget official.
But after hiring a brokerage firm, the administration reversed course, deciding to sell the properties itself, one by one, on its auction website — the same place where it unloads used forklifts, office furniture, railroad spikes and combat boots.
Last year, the GSA sold 59 properties on the auction website for a total of $52.6 million, but this is a fraction of what was envisioned for the FASTA properties.
“GSA determined that offering properties based on an individual asset sale, rather than in a bundled portfolio sale, was the best course of action,” said Christina Wilkes, an agency spokeswoman.
But so far, only eight of the FASTA properties have been put up for auction; of these, a parking lot in Idaho Falls, Idaho, has been sold for $268,000.
“The proof is in the pudding,” said David L. Winstead, a board member and a former GSA official. “It’s taken longer to get these sales done, and we’re anxious to get them done and funds into the public assets fund.”
While proceeds dribble in, the board is assembling its next list of properties, due in December, with some changes in the way it does business. In response to the criticisms by the GAO, the board has beefed up documentation. After the debacle with the Seattle property, members are doing more outreach to public officials in whose districts potential sites are sitting.
“We learned a lesson,” Styles said. “Communication is just absolutely critical.”
Despite their early struggles, board members remain upbeat about their mission, which includes making recommendations about consolidating agency operations — potentially freeing up more buildings for sale — and about making their voice heard.
The board has until 2025 to make its mark. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

President Joe Biden visited California on Monday to tout his efforts to better protect the state against the raging wildfires that have burned more than 2 million acres, displaced thousands and pushed responders to the brink of exhaustion.
“These fires are blinking code red for our nation,” said Biden, who used the occasion to promote two bills pending in Congress that would fund forest management and more resilient infrastructure as well as combat global warming. The country couldn’t “ignore the reality that these wildfires are being supercharged by climate change,” he said.
But experts say there are limits to what the federal government can do to reduce the scale and destructive power of the fires, at least in the short term. That’s because much of the authority needed relies on state and local governments, those experts said.
Federal action largely depends on Congress approving new funding — but even if approved, that money might not make much of a difference anytime soon.
“Climate change impacts can’t be absolved in a single year,” said Roy Wright, who was in charge of risk mitigation at the Federal Emergency Management Agency until 2018. The goal, he said, should be “investments that will pay back over the coming three to five years.”
On wildfires, like so much else, Biden presented himself as the opposite of former President Donald Trump: clear about the role of climate change, willing to listen to experts and promising to better defend places such as California against a growing threat.
“If we have four more years of Trump’s climate denial, how many suburbs will be burned in wildfires?” Biden said in a speech last year as California staggered through record-breaking fires. “If you give a climate arsonist four more years in the White House, why would anyone be surprised if we have more of America ablaze?”
Biden, of course, won the election — only to see the damage from wildfires in California and across the country continue to get worse.
On Monday, Biden flew over the Caldor fire, which has consumed more than 200,000 acres south of Lake Tahoe and forced thousands of people from their homes.
“We have to act more rapidly and more firmly and more broadly than today,” Biden told a small crowd gathered in the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services. “We can’t afford to let anything slip further. It really is a matter of what the world will look like.”
Over the past decade, the number of fires in California each year has remained consistent, hovering around 7,000 to 10,000.
What has changed is their scale.
Until 2018, the largest wildfires in the state seldom burned more than 300,000 acres, according to state data. In 2018, the Ranch fire consumed more than 400,000 acres, and last year, the August Complex fire topped 1 million acres, making it the largest blaze in the state’s history.
Just north of the Caldor fire is the Dixie fire, which has already burned more than 960,000 acres and is not yet contained. That fire could break the record.
“The fire situation in California is unrecognizably worse than it was a decade ago,” said Michael Wara, director of the climate and energy policy program at Stanford University. He said that with the exception of 2019, each of past five years has brought fires that were more destructive than the year before it.
The wildfire crisis in California has often become a political fight. Last summer, Trump blamed California for its fire problem, and initially denied federal disaster aid.
“You got to clean your floors, you got to clean your forests,” Trump said at the time, in comments that emphasized just one aspect of a complex problem. “There are many, many years of leaves and broken trees and they’re like, like, so flammable.”
Trump also dismissed the link between forest fires and global warming. When state officials urged him not to ignore the science of climate change, which shows that higher temperatures and drought are making fires more destructive, Trump inaccurately responded, “I don’t think science actually knows.”
Although Trump was wrong to dismiss the role played by climate change in exacerbating the fires, he was right that more aggressive forest management is vital for addressing those fires, experts say. But much of that work must come from the federal government, which owns about half the land in California, Wara said.
Biden’s first budget request, earlier this year, didn’t ask Congress for enough money to reduce the amount of flammable vegetation in the nation’s forests, Wara said. The $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill now pending on Capitol Hill would significantly increase that funding.
“There’s no fixing the wildfire problem without dealing with how forests have been managed,” Wara said.
The Biden administration has taken other steps to reduce the damage from fires, including increasing the number of air tankers and helicopters at its disposal and boosting pay for federal firefighters to $15 an hour.
“We owe them a whole hell of a lot more,” Biden told California emergency workers Monday, before leading a rendition of “Happy Birthday” for an employee.
FEMA has made more money available to help communities prepare for fires in advance, for example by building fire breaks or retrofitting homes. And after a fire strikes, the agency has made it easier for fire victims who have lost proof of homeownership — documents that are often destroyed in a fire — to apply for assistance to rebuild that home.
And Biden has asked Congress to approve measures that would reduce the country’s greenhouse gas emissions. But even if those changes were to become law, the amount of carbon dioxide and other warming gases that has already been released into the atmosphere means the planet will continue to heat up for years.
Much of the action that would go the furthest toward reducing wildfire risk is outside the scope of federal authority, according to Kimiko Barrett, a wildfire policy expert at Headwaters Economics, a consulting group in Montana.
Protecting Americans from fires means reducing home construction in fire-prone areas — decisions historically made at the state and local level, she said.
“We’re developing and building homes in places that are very exposed to wildfires,” Barrett said. She said communities need to incorporate the risk of fires into how they grow, just as they do with flooding and, increasingly, with sea-level rise.
Still, Biden could use the megaphone of the presidency to encourage state and local officials to be more thoughtful about where and how they build, said Michele Steinberg, wildfire division director for the National Fire Protection Association.
“Folks, there is something called building codes and land-use ordinances, and they’re really good, and they really work when applied,” Steinberg offered as the message Biden could convey. “That would be a huge step in the right direction.”
But even if Biden wanted to send that message, he would be competing against the deeply held American view that land is something to profit from, rather than to conserve or protect, she said.
“It’s more like, let’s get the value out of this land that we can right now,” Steinberg said, “and let the next generation worry about it.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Texto completo: President Joe Biden surveyed wildfire damage in the Western US on Monday, using nearly every stop on his trip to illustrate how recent extreme weather events underscore the urgency of his economic agenda and its investments in the nation's infrastructure.
The President started his tour in Idaho and later traveled to California -- two states hit hard by recent wildfires.
At Sacramento Mather Airport, the President delivered a speech on his administration's response to the fires, describing how climate change is responsible for the rise in extreme weather events in recent years and is costing America billions of dollars each year.
"We can't ignore the reality that these wildfires are being supercharged by climate change. It isn't about red or blue states, it's about fires, just fires," Biden said.
"Scientists have been warning us for years that extreme weather is gonna get more extreme. We're living it in real time now," he continued, noting extreme weather will cost America more than $99 billion this year -- a record. "These fires are blinking code red for our nation. They're gaining frequency and ferocity, and we know what we have to do."
The President also made the case for his twin economic proposals, explaining how they would strengthen the nation's resilience to the climate crisis and extreme weather events. By getting those bills signed into law, Biden argued, the initial costs will wind up saving the US money that it would otherwise have had to use responding to severe weather events.
During earlier remarks in Boise, Idaho, at the National Interagency Fire Center, Biden said, "We can't continue to ignore reality."
"The reality is we have a global warming problem, a serious global warming problem." he said. "Things aren't going to go back to the way they were before."
Monday's travel marked Biden's first official trip to the West Coast as president.
As part of his trip, Biden received a briefing from local, state, and federal emergency response personnel on the impacts of recent wildfires and surveyed damage from the Caldor Fire by taking an aerial tour of El Dorado County.
Idaho has 22 fires currently burning and California has 13 burning, according to the National Interagency Fire Center.
Cal Fire Chief Thom Porter warned last week that California's fire season is "far from over" and forecasters predicted dry and windy weather conditions will continue to create the ideal environment for wildfires to ignite and expand.
On Monday night, Biden traveled to Long Beach, California, to deliver remarks at a campaign rally with Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom ahead of Tuesday's recall election. Newsom is attempting to stave off a Republican-backed effort to oust him, which is motivated in part by anger toward his pandemic restrictions. He appeared alongside the President through most of Monday's appearances in the Golden State.
The President's trip follows his previous visit to New York and New Jersey last week where he surveyed damage caused by Hurricane Ida. Biden said last week he planned to press Congress to take further action on his infrastructure proposals after remnants of Ida caused dangerous flash floods and tornadoes across the Northeast and as wildfires were burning their way across the western US.
On Tuesday, the President will travel to Denver, Colorado, where he will continue his push for his economic agenda and argue how the investments would help the nation tackle the climate crisis and modernize the nation's infrastructure, the official said.
CNN's Nikki Carvajal and Jason Hoffman contributed to this report.

Texto completo: Watch CNN's "Shine A Light," a commercial-free 9/11 20th anniversary tribute, hosted by Jake Tapper and featuring musical performances by Maroon 5, H.E.R., Brad Paisley, and Common on Saturday, September 11 at 8 p.m. ET.
The terror attacks of September 11, 2001 were centered around the East Coast, but its effect was felt in nearly all corners of the country. Ahead of Saturday's anniversary, newspaper editors around the US are publishing powerful front pages with unique stories that capture how local communities are still grappling with the tragedy 20 years later.
Tim Cotter, executive editor of The Day in New London, Connecticut, said that his staff reached out to people in the area ahead of the anniversary so they could feature their personal stories. The Day's front page on Friday included a story compiling many of those memories from the day of the attacks as well as a profile of a New London resident who had served as a volunteer construction worker at ground zero to clean up the aftermath.
"We wanted to hear from people," Cotter told CNN Business. "It's a moment that people will always remember where they were, what they were doing."
The Day plans to publish a story on Sunday about how the Muslim community in the area has been affected, Cotter said. The Daily Herald, a newspaper covering suburban Chicago, featured a story about that same topic on its Friday front page.
John Lampinen, senior vice president of Paddock Publications and editor of the Daily Herald, told CNN Business that his paper has been running a week-long series about the anniversary.
"[W]e wanted to teach or remind our audience what that day was like, how real and human it felt, how all of us as people responded — to teach or remind our audience that there was a time when the country came together; a time when the divisions disappeared," Lampinen wrote in an email. "And we wanted to teach or remind our audience that as universal as all this felt, there were some who felt left out — those in the Muslim community, in particular, even though they shared in the incredible heartache."
Here are the front papers of The Day, The Daily Herald and other newspapers in the US from September 10, 2021:

Texto completo: President Joe Biden on Thursday turned up the heat on his administration's COVID-19 vaccination campaign with two measures aimed at getting workers inoculated, part of a six-point plan to combat the pandemic.
Biden announced a new rule by the Labor Department that will require all businesses with 100 or more employees to be vaccinated or submit to testing at least once a week.
In addition, the president signed an executive order requiring most federal workers and contractors to be vaccinated against the coronavirus, a tightening of the previous policy announced in July that called for vaccinations but allowed other options.
Combined, Biden said the new vaccine requirements would cover about 100 million workers, two-thirds of the country's workforce.
Channeling the frustration of vaccinated Americans upset about not being able to return to normal life during what he repeatedly calls a “pandemic of the unvaccinated,’’ Biden had a direct message for the nearly 80 million holdouts.
“What more is there to wait for? What more do you need to see?’’ he said. “We’ve made vaccinations free, safe and convenient. The vaccine is FDA approved. Over 200 million Americans have gotten at least one shot. We’ve been patient, but our patience is wearing thin, and your refusal has cost all of us. Please do the right thing.’’
The new Labor Department standard would apply to more than 80 million Americans working in the private sector. The executive order affects employees working for the executive branch, about 90% of the federal workforce.
Some federal health workers, including those who work for the Veterans Department, are already required to get vaccinated. Members of the U.S. military also need to get the COVID-19 vaccine.
But civilian federal employees and contractors only had to reveal their vaccination status and, if not inoculated, get tested regularly, socially distance, wear masks and be subject to restrictions on most work travel. Those won't be options anymore.

New Biden strategy against COVID focuses on worker vaccinations, testing and school safety
President Joe Biden unveiled a six-point strategy Thursday aimed at strengthening vaccination requirements for federal and private sector workers, increasing school safety protocols and making COVID-19 testing more accessible.
Biden said the Department of Labor is developing an emergency temporary standard to require all businesses with 100 or more employees to ensure every worker is either fully vaccinated or face testing at least once a week, a standard he said will affect about 80 million workers. The Labor Department is also developing a rule to ensure those businesses provide paid time off for workers to get vaccinated or to recover from the shot.
Hospitals and other health care settings that receive Medicare and Medicaid funding will also be required to vaccinate their workers.
Ahead of his remarks, Biden signed a pair of executive orders to require vaccination for federal workers in the executive branch and contractors, building on a policy announced in July that encouraged vaccinations but provided other options.
Federal workers will have about 75 days to be fully vaccinated, according to a senior administration official. The order includes limited exceptions for medical or religious reasons, but any federal worker who refuses to comply could face disciplinary action, the official told reporters on condition of anonymity.
Biden had an edge in his voice as he blamed the nearly 80 million eligible Americans who are unvaccinated -- a little over 25% of those who can get the free shots -- for hampering the country's efforts to fight the virus.
"The unvaccinated overcrowd our hospitals, are overrunning emergency rooms and intensive care units, leaving no room for someone with a heart attack or pancreatitis or cancer,’’ Biden said.
“The path ahead, even with the delta variant, is not nearly as bad as last winter. But what makes it incredibly more frustrating is we have the tools to combat COVID-19, and a distinct minority of Americans, supported by a distinct minority of elected officials, are keeping us from turning the corner.’’
Other parts of Biden's plan include requiring teachers and staff at federally funded education programs like Head Start, Department of Defense schools and Bureau of Indian Education-operated schools to be vaccinated. He called on all states to adopt vaccine requirements for school employees.
Biden also said the Department of Education will provide additional funding to help local school districts backfill salaries and other funding that had been withheld by state leaders for implementing COVID-19 safety measures.
The president's strategy also centers on boosting availability of testing by expanding the existing free pharmacy testing program to 10,000 local pharmacies and sending nearly 300 million rapid tests to community health centers, schools and food banks.

L.A. school district is first among large systems to mandate vaccinations for students 12 and older
The Los Angeles Unified School District became the first in the nation among large school systems to mandate COVID-19 vaccinations for eligible students when the board of education voted 7-0 with one recusal Thursday in favor of the requirement.
All students 12 and older in the LAUSD, second largest in the U.S., will need to be vaccinated by January to take in-person classes, the Los Angeles Times reported. The district also requires that all teachers and school staff be fully vaccinated by Oct. 15.
L.A. schools Interim Superintendent Megan K. Reilly told the newspaper that the new policy will impact about 225,000 student in grades 6-12. According to the Times, district officials have estimated about 80,000 students are not vaccinated against the virus.
"We are seeing without a doubt that the vaccines are one of the clearest pathways to protecting individuals from getting severe sickness as well as for mitigating transmission of the COVID virus,'' Reilly said. "It is one of the best preventive measures that we have at our disposal to create a safe environment at schools.”
As schools shutter amid outbreaks, remote-teaching bans halt learning
Schools across the country are closing as the pandemic continues to hamper in-person learning, and thousands of students are either at home in quarantine or sick with the coronavirus. But in Tennessee and seven other states, new rules are limiting districts from pivoting to virtual learning. That means thousands of students nationwide are poised to receive even less instruction this year than last year when their classrooms or schools close – compounding the problem of unfinished learning.
In Tennessee, the Hamilton County schools medical team advised district leaders to close after the Labor Day weekend. But even though the county has been recognized nationally for its efforts to ensure tens of thousands of students have access to the Internet, hot spots and quality devices, students won't receive instruction while schools are closed.
"If there is ever a county that could pivot to virtual, it would be Hamilton County," McClendon said.

Study: Counts of nursing home deaths missed 16,000 fatalities
Government counts of the devastation from the coronavirus among the most vulnerable elderly likely missed more than 16,000 COVID-19 deaths in U.S. nursing homes during the early months of the pandemic, an academic study published Thursday has found. The missing deaths add up to 14% of what researchers estimate to be the true death toll in nursing homes for all of last year, according to the analysis in JAMA Network Open, a peer-reviewed publication of the American Medical Association. The researchers estimate the total of nursing home deaths at 118,335 by the end of 2020.

Airlines recovery struggles as delta variant diminishes bookings
The rise in COVID-19 cases from the delta variant is hurting airline bookings and hampering the travel industry's recovery, multiple airlines reported Thursday. American Airlines said a slowdown that started in August has continued into September, and the airline lowered its outlook for third-quarter revenue. United Airlines said its flying and revenue are both weaker than previously expected, and it is cutting its schedule for later this year to match the lower demand. United forecast a pretax loss in the third quarter that could extend into the fourth quarter if the virus outbreak continues.
Delta Air Lines said it still expects to post an adjusted pretax profit for the third quarter, but revenue will be toward the lower end of its previous forecast.
Fauci says infection rate is 10 times what is needed to end epidemic
The U.S. coronavirus infection rate being driven by the delta variant is more than 10 times the rate needed to end the pandemic, Dr. Anthony Fauci says. In an interview with Axios, the presidential adviser said the nation is struggling with about 160,000 new cases a day – "not even modestly good control" – and won't get appreciably better until more Americans are vaccinated.
"The endgame is to suppress the virus," Fauci said. "In a country of our size, you can't be hanging around and having 100,000 infections a day. You've got to get well below 10,000 before you start feeling comfortable."
More vaccinations won't completely end infections, but " you're not going to have it as a public health threat," he said, adding that current variants, while troublesome, remain controllable with available vaccines. And the longer it takes to end the pandemic, the more likely a "monster variant" will emerge that eludes vaccines, he said.
Pfizer science chief defends vaccine
Pfizer's vaccine contains only a fraction of a key active ingredient found in Moderna's jab and also produces a lower antibody response, according to a study.
The study of 1,600 Belgian health workers published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine produced twice as many antibodies as Pfizer's at six to 10 weeks after vaccination.
Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine has 30 micrograms of mRNA, while Moderna's has 100. Philip Dormitzer, Pfizer's chief scientific officer, told the Financial Times this week that Pfizer and its codeveloper BioNTech used the minimum dose level to get an immune response. A higher dose risked more side effects, he said.
"If you look at what's going on with all the COVID-19 vaccines out there, the derailer has often been adverse events that have cropped up," Dormitzer said. The vaccines, however, produce similar side effects, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Vaccinations do not increase chances of miscarriage, study says
A new study by Minnesota researchers indicates that COVID vaccinations do not increase the chances of a miscarriage. The study, published this week in the Journal of the American Medical Association, reviewed data from more than 100,000 pregnancies. The data was drawn from eight major health systems – Kaiser Permanente: Washington, Northwest, Northern California, Southern California and Colorado; Denver Health; HealthPartners; and Marshfield Clinic, Wisconsin – from December 2020 through June 2021.
The results were similar for all the vaccines approved or authorized by the Food and Drug Administration.
States running out of ICU beds consider rationing care
Some states are nearing a point of having to ration care in hospitals as COVID hospitalizations surge. At Kootenai Health hospital in Coeur d’Alene, Idaho, a conference center has been transformed into a field hospital with patients being treated with ventilators in classrooms. At the nearby hospital, COVID patients in emergency rooms are overflowing into hallways. On Tuesday, there were only nine intensive care beds available in the entire state, officials said. Idaho has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the country, with only 40% fully vaccinated.
Kentucky, too, is rapidly approaching a crisis standard of care, Gov. Andy Beshear said Wednesday, pointing out there are only 90 adult intensive care beds available in the state. More than two-thirds of hospitals are experiencing a critical staffing shortage, he said. Beshear told CNN the state is "right at” or “quickly approaching that point" at which hospitals will have to begin rationing care.
“So we are at a very precarious situation,” he said.

Texto completo: Surging Covid-19 cases -- and the increasing proportion reported in children -- are causing many health experts to worry about the outlook as the school year gets underway across the entire country.
But Dr. Anthony Fauci said there shouldn't be a big uptick "if we do it right."
"We've gotta get the school system masked in addition to surrounding the children with vaccinated people," said the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. "That's the solution."
In Miami-Dade County Public Schools, 13 school employees have died from Covid-19 since August 16, the school district and local teacher union told CNN. All 13 -- four teachers, one security monitor, one cafeteria worker and seven school bus drivers -- were unvaccinated, they said.
"I think this underscores the big tragedy that we see occurring across America," Miami-Dade County Public Schools Superintendent Alberto Carvalho said Tuesday.
"Even though in my community, 98% of individuals have gotten at least one dose of the vaccine, there is still a lag specific to individuals that represent ethnic minorities in Miami-Dade."
The 13 school employees who died were African Americans and were unvaccinated, according to their families, Carvalho said.
Since vaccine mandates are illegal in Florida, the best thing Carvalho can do is offer incentives to teachers to get fully vaccinated, including a $275 stipend to any employee who shows proof of vaccination, he said.
Schools, particularly in the South, started their new year in August and many districts, notably those without mask measures in place, saw an explosion of cases.
Doctors and experts warn it could happen again when students in much of the rest of the country return to school after the Labor Day weekend unless there is strong action to keep the virus in check. Fauci and other officials across the US have stressed masks in schools and vaccination for those eligible are crucial.
"These little ones don't have the choice to take the vaccine. It's up to us," Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said during a back-to-school event in Rochester on Wednesday. "For goodness sakes, we're adults and we know what protects them, so it shouldn't be that hard to say, the science says, put them in a mask. You wouldn't let them run across the street without looking, you certainly wouldn't put them in a crowded classroom without a mask."
While officials believe the federal government is limited on broadly mandating vaccines, President Joe Biden is expected to deliver a major address this week on the next phase of the pandemic, which will include components related to schools, private companies and requirements for federal employees, two sources familiar with the speech told CNN.
Ahead of the speech, poll data from Gallup on Tuesday showed more Americans now disagree than agree that Biden and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have communicated a clear plan of action in response to Covid-19.
The speech comes as the impact of the pandemic on schools becomes clearer.
Children now represent 26.8% of the weekly Covid-19 cases, according to new data. Over two weeks, from August 19 to September 2, there was a 10% increase in the cumulated number of Covid-19 cases in children since the beginning of the pandemic, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.
Pace of vaccinations may be slowing again
Meanwhile, data published Wednesday by the CDC shows an average of about 356,662 people are initiating their Covid-19 vaccination each day -- an 18% drop from last week and a 26% drop from a month earlier.
But those slowing numbers may have been affected by the Labor Day holiday, and could pick up again in the coming days.
US officials continue to stress the way out of the pandemic is through vaccinations.
"What we've got to do to get to a successful place with Delta is vaccinate enough people, develop enough in the way of therapeutics and treatments, such that we're not losing nearly as many people every day, every week, every year to the Delta virus," US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy told CNN's Jim Acosta on Wednesday.
A large, real-life study confirmed that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are about 90% effective at keeping people 50 and older out of the hospital. Johnson & Johnson's vaccine also had high effectiveness, the team found, but "additional data are needed."
The study, led by the CDC, found that two shots of Pfizer's or Moderna's mRNA vaccines were 91% effective against infection leading to an emergency department or urgent care clinic visit, 89% against infection leading to hospitalization and 90% against infection leading to an ICU admission.
Even among people 85 and older, effectiveness was 85% or higher, the team wrote. Johnson & Johnson's vaccine was 73% effective against emergency department or urgent care clinic visit and 68% against infection leading to hospitalization, the team found.
The study showed the mRNA-based vaccines were highly effective among people 85 or older and those with chronic medical conditions.
Reinforcements going to hospitals
The lagging vaccination rates and climbing case numbers are keeping the pressure on the health care systems in many states.
In Kentucky, hospitals are facing critical staffing shortages and getting pushed to the brink for ICU beds, Gov. Andy Beshear said Tuesday, forcing the closure of some surgery rooms to create ICU centers and more beds to address the influx of Covid-19 patients.
The state has stepped in to help by providing Covid-19 testing via third-party vendors that set up outside of hospitals, freeing up hospital emergency room staff and clinicians to prioritize other healthcare needs for the community, Beshear said.
The governor said he also requested FEMA strike teams and has had a nurse strike team deployed up at St. Claire Regional Medical Center, which has been overwhelmed in treating the influx of Covid-19 patients.
Less than half of Kentucky's population is fully vaccinated against the virus, according to CDC data.
Reinforcements are also on the way for health care workers treating Covid-19 patients in Idaho, Arkansas and Alabama.
Each state will get a 20-person US Army North (ARNORTH) team that includes nurses, respiratory therapists, and medical doctors. Six teams are already deployed, with three teams in Louisiana, two in Mississippi, and one in Alabama.
"This is the first time Department of Defense medical assets have deployed to support both Idaho and Arkansas during the pandemic," ARNORTH commander Lt. Gen. Laura J. Richardson said. "We are proud to be called upon to support our local, state, and federal partners there, and in Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi, in this whole-of-government response."
New data suggests unvaccinated people are at least several times more likely to test positive
The best protection against hospitalizations, health experts have emphasized, is vaccination.
Data from local health departments in Utah, Virginia and Seattle's King County suggests that unvaccinated people are at least four times -- and up to nine times -- more likely than vaccinated people to test positive for coronavirus, and that gap has grown in recent weeks.
About 53.2% of all Americans are fully vaccinated, according to CDC data. Those numbers are not yet where experts say they need to be to protect the majority of Americans.
In August, the FDA authorized an additional Covid-19 vaccine dose for certain immunocompromised people. And while the effort to vaccinate the entire population continues, officials are now preparing for the rollout of booster doses for a larger population.
The boosters do not indicate that something is wrong with the first two doses, Fauci said Tuesday. Rather, the third dose may just be part of a full vaccine regimen.
The White House is expected to kick off its booster plan the week of September 20. At that time, up to 5.2 million people may be eligible to receive their third dose.
The plan is to allow third doses starting eight months after a person receives the second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna mRNA vaccines, although the timing could fluctuate.
It's not clear what the timing will be for a second dose of the single-dose J&J vaccine, which more than 14 million people received, according to the CDC.
"That might be two doses for a J&J, but for the mRNA, we know from studies that are already ongoing in Israel now, that when the degree of protection against infection and even severe disease goes down to a certain precarious level, when you give the person that third boost, you dramatically increase the level of protection," Fauci said.
"Even more so than before the boost, it goes up to and beyond the level of protection."

More than 40 million cases of the coronavirus have been recorded in the United States, according to a New York Times database.
The total number of known infections, more than the population of California, the nation’s most populous state, is a testament to the spread of the coronavirus, especially lately the highly contagious delta variant, and the United States’ patchwork efforts to rein it in.
Vaccines are effective in preventing severe disease and death, but 47% of Americans are not fully vaccinated, allowing the delta variant more than enough opportunity to inflict suffering and disrupt daily life. Health officials say that most of the patients who are being hospitalized and dying are not vaccinated, and that it is those unvaccinated people who are driving the current surge and burdening the health care system.
Over the past week, new virus cases have averaged more than 161,000 a day, as of Sunday. New deaths are up to 1,560 a day, and hospitalizations are averaging more than 102,000 a day. Those numbers, while very high, remain lower than last winter’s peaks.
Before July 4, President Joe Biden said he hoped for “a summer of freedom.” Instead, the delta variant became the dominant form of the virus, ravaging unvaccinated populations and filling intensive care units in some states.
In an appearance Sept. 1, Gov. Brad Little of Idaho, a Republican, pleaded with people to get vaccinated.
“I wish everyone could have seen what I saw in the ICU last night,” he said.
On Tuesday, Idaho’s Department of Health and Welfare said it has activated crisis standards of care, emergency measures put in place when there are insufficient health care resources available, in the northern part of the state. Hospitals will implement the standards as needed, according to a news release from the department.
“When crisis standards of care are in effect, people who need medical care may experience care that is different from what they expect,” the department said. “For example, patients admitted to the hospital may find that hospital beds are not available or are in repurposed rooms (such as a conference room).”
Dave Jeppesen, director of the department, said, “This is a decision I was fervently hoping to avoid.”
Gov. Jim Justice of West Virginia said at a news conference Monday that the virus had flooded many of his state’s hospitals and closed schools there.
“We’ve got a really big time, big time situation in West Virginia, as it is all across this nation,” said Justice, a Republican.
After reading a list of people who died in his state from causes related to the disease since Friday, Justice pleaded with the unvaccinated people of West Virginia to get inoculated.
“We’ve got to get vaccinated for all, not just for you but for everybody — we’ve got to do this,” he said. “We can stop a lot of this terrible, terrible, terrible carnage.”
No U.S. state has more than 70% of its population fully vaccinated, according to federal data, and while the average pace of vaccinations ticked upward this summer, it remains far lower than when it peaked in the spring.
Cases in the United States make up nearly one-fifth of the known global total, more than 221 million cases as of Tuesday, according to data from the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. That is likely to be an undercount because of factors like insufficient testing and reporting.
The news came at the end of the Labor Day holiday weekend, not long after Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, warned that unvaccinated Americans should avoid travel.
But data from the Transportation Security Administration suggested people did not stay home in droves. TSA checkpoints recorded 2.13 million travelers through U.S. airports Friday, close to the number on the Friday before Labor Day two years ago.

It was a pitch tuned for a politically polarized audience. Erik Finman, a 22-year-old who called himself the world’s youngest Bitcoin millionaire, posted a video on Twitter for a new kind of smartphone that he said would liberate Americans from their “Big Tech overlords.”
His splashy video, posted in July, had stirring music, American flags and references to former Presidents Abraham Lincoln and Donald Trump. Conservative pundits hawked Finman’s Freedom Phone, and his video amassed 1.8 million views. Finman soon had thousands of orders for the $500 device.
Then came the hard part: Building and delivering the phones. First, he received bad early reviews for a plan to simply put his software on a cheap Chinese phone. And then there was the unglamorous work of shipping phones, hiring customer-service agents, collecting sales taxes and dealing with regulators.
“I feel like practically I was prepared for anything,” he said. “But I guess it’s kind of like how you hope for world peace, in the sense you don’t think it’s going to happen.”
For even the most lavishly funded startups, it is hard to compete with tech industry giants that have a death grip on their markets and are valued in the trillions of dollars. Finman was part of a growing right-wing tech industry taking on the challenge nonetheless, relying more on their conservative customers’ distaste for Silicon Valley than expertise or experience.
There are cloud providers hosting right-wing websites, a so-called free-speech video site competing with YouTube and at least seven conservative social networks trying to compete with Facebook.
Parler, the right-wing social network funded by conservative megadonor Rebekah Mercer, found itself fighting for its life earlier this year after Apple, Google and Amazon pulled their services. Another social media company popular with the far right, Gab, has fought to gain traction without a place on the Apple or Google app stores. And Gettr, a social network created by veterans of the Trump administration, was immediately hacked.
Finman, who has bleach-blond hair and a brown, chin-strap beard, calls himself an agent of change for both tech and Republican politics. In a freewheeling interview over lamb kebabs at a Turkish restaurant in New York City, Finman weighed in on British politics; quoted both Marcus Aurelius, the Roman emperor, and Karl Lagerfeld, the German fashion designer; and explained why he thought the modern Republican Party was “pathetic.” The party’s leaders complain about Big Tech censorship, he said, but do little about it.
In 2014, New York magazine profiled Finman as a 16-year-old from outside Coeur d’Alene, Idaho, who had struck it rich when, a few years earlier, he spent a $1,000 gift from his grandmother on Bitcoin.
By 2017, his riches had topped $1 million and he was posting photos online of him posing with YouTube celebrities, getting on and off private jets, and lighting $100 bills on fire. But he tired of the cryptocurrency scene.
“I actually hate talking about Bitcoin,” he said. “It’s like ‘Rolling Stones, play the hits.’”
He dove into politics. He said that by the age of 12, he considered himself a libertarian. (It was at a rally for Ron Paul, the former presidential candidate, when someone first told him about Bitcoin.) But his politics shifted when Trump arrived on the national political stage.
“I drank the Kool-Aid in 2016,” he said.
Over the next several years, Finman said, he became worried about what he viewed as Silicon Valley censoring conservative voices. He also spotted a business opportunity in other Republicans who shared his concerns. So he aimed at the dominance of Apple and Google and tried to create a new right-wing smartphone.
“Politics is the new national pastime, baby,” Finman said. “Even nonpolitical things like a freaking pillow end up becoming political,” he added, referring to Mike Lindell, the MyPillow founder, who has peddled lies about the 2020 election.
To make a smartphone, however, he had to rely on Google. The company’s Android software already works with millions of apps, and Google makes a free, open version of the software for developers to modify. So Finman hired engineers to strip it of any sign of Google and load it with apps from conservative social networks and news outlets. Then he uploaded the software on phones he bought from China.
Google and Apple declined to comment.
To unveil the phone, he recorded an infomercial in which he cast the tech companies as enemies of the American way.
“Imagine if Mark Zuckerberg banned MLK or Abraham Lincoln,” he said in the video. “The course of history would have been altered forever.”
At the same time, a series of right-wing personalities pitched the phone to their followers. They stood to earn $50 for every customer who used their discount codes.
Thousands of people bought the $500 phone. Others, including some conservatives, quickly panned the animated pitch.
“It’s not a bad instinct,” said Zachary Graves, a tech-policy specialist at the Lincoln Network, a libertarian think tank. “But when I first saw the video, I was waiting for them to say ‘Live from New York, it’s Saturday night!’”
Quickly, news outlets reported that the Freedom Phone was based on a low-cost handset from Umidigi, a Chinese manufacturer that had used chips shown to be vulnerable to hacks. Finman, who marketed the device as “the best phone in the world,” was on the defensive.
In an interview in July, Finman admitted that Umidigi made the phone but still said he was “100%” sure it was more secure than the latest iPhone. Apple has tens of thousands of engineers. Finman said he employed 15 people in Utah and Idaho.
Finman said he was not surprised by the criticism, but he was taken aback by the sales. That left him juggling responsibilities he had not planned for, including certification with the Federal Communications Commission and special rules for shipping devices with lithium batteries. He hired people from his hometown in Idaho to staff a makeshift customer-service center and he struggled to sort out sales-tax issues.
Within a month of the phone’s release, Finman had a solution: sell someone else’s phone and act as the branding frontman. Just as Finman’s political inspiration, Trump, has sold Trump steaks and Trump vodka without running a cattle ranch or a distillery, Finman unburdened himself of the difficult task of actually managing a company that makes phones.
“When the going gets tough, bring in the 50-something-year-olds,” Finman said. “They can be the ones with the sleepless nights.”
He teamed up with a 13-year-old firm in Orem, Utah, called ClearCellular, which had already created a phone that was disconnected from Apple and Google. The company also had experience with logistics, shipping and customer service.
The companies added the American Flag wallpapers and conservative apps to ClearCellular’s device and called it the Freedom Phone. Finman said the phone also has his “PatriApp Store,” though ClearCellular provides the technological support for the app store.
Finman will collect a cut, though they will not say how much.
Reviews of the new phone have not been positive. CNET, the product-review site, said the $500 device appeared to be “nearly on par with a $200 budget Android phone.”
Michael Proper, 46, the founder of ClearCellular, said Finman was “really building a brand.” Creating a phone company is ambitious, but “not only software, security, hardware, but supply chain, inventory and capitalization,” he added. Finman’s strength is “connecting with folks inside of the freedom community.”
Finman said he had orders for about 12,000 Freedom Phones, putting revenue at around $6 million in just over seven weeks. Finman and Proper said they had about 8,000 phones left to ship. Finman declined to connect The New York Times with any customers.
Finman said Proper “is like my Phil Knight, and the Freedom Phone is like the Jordans,” referring to the Nike co-founder who helped turn Michael Jordan’s shoes into a cultural and commercial hit.
The arrangement has freed Finman to focus less on running a phone company and more on building a political operation. In a telephone interview last week from Washington, where he was meeting with potential investors, he said the Freedom Phone could take on liberals in addition to freeing his customers from Big Tech.
He said that during elections, he planned to make the Freedom Phone direct users to nearby polling stations. And he aimed to create a news feed on the phone where he could promote conservative articles.
“I see it absolutely as one of the ultimate political tools,” he said. “Everyone has one in their pocket.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Texto completo: Works by late New York artist Michael Mulhern, who witnessed the attacks and later moved the Maine, have emerged from storage.

As Richard Keen hurried to leave his painting studio at Fort Andross Mill in Brunswick on a late afternoon just before Christmas, he noticed two men brusquely loading large, painted canvases into a trailer. An artist with a deep respect for the painting process and finished work, Keen was struck by both the high quality and quantity of the paintings and how roughly the men were handling them.
“I had never seen this work before, and I know a lot of artists in the mill,” he said. “So I asked these guys, ‘Whose work are you moving out of the mill?’ And one of them said, ‘I don’t know. Some old dead guy from New York. You want to buy some?’ “
Within days, Keen and gallery owner Elizabeth Moss bought the whole trailer full and many more, rescuing hundreds of paintings and works on paper by the late New York abstract expressionist artist Michael Mulhern, who lived and worked in a ninth-floor studio-loft one block south of the World Trade Center, on Cedar Street, in lower Manhattan. Mulhern, who died in Maine in 2012, watched through large windows as the first plane hit the north tower, then donned his safety goggles and respirator when the force of the first-falling south tower blew out those windows and filled his space with dust and debris, he told the New York Times and other journalists.
His paints and palettes thickly coated, Mulhern later incorporated the ash into his abstract paintings, which grew increasingly dark and gray. Some of those paintings ended up in Maine and will go on view beginning Friday when Elizabeth Moss Galleries in Falmouth opens the exhibition, “Michael Mulhern: A Phoenix Rising from the Ashes.”
His work has been exhibited widely, and the 9/11 Memorial and Museum in New York owns two of his paintings. The Scottish-born artist spent most of his life and career in New York. He moved to Maine late in his life to be closer to two of his grown sons, and died Oct. 15, 2012, in Falmouth at age 72. After he died, his art went into storage in the mill in Brunswick. When the storage bill went unpaid and liens unsettled, the contents were purchased in a blind storage-unit auction by the two burly guys Keen encountered last December, by fate or circumstance.
In that moment of recognition, Keen’s innate sense as an artist told him this art was notable and probably valuable, and he knew he had to act quickly before it was damaged. His first phone call was to Steve Howe of Cumberland Self Storage, who helped track down information about Mulhern, as well as the men who bought the art at auction; they lived in Sidney, near Augusta. When his research revealed that Mulhern was an accomplished artist with a long exhibition history, a 40-year teaching career at Boston College and a tight connection to the tragedy of 9/11, Keen called Moss, his art dealer.
The next day, they drove to Sidney to look more closely at the artwork, and encountered stacks and rows of Mulhern’s paintings under a falling-down event tent in a muddy cow pasture. Though covered, the paintings were exposed to the winter elements and at immediate risk of damage and eventual deterioration. Distressed, Keen and Moss bought as many paintings as they could fit into their vehicle and went to their separate homes to look more closely at what they had purchased.
That night, both were restless. They knew they had to do more.
“I didn’t know this guy from Adam, but if this was what happened to my artwork when I passed away, it would be my worst nightmare,” Keen said. “I couldn’t let this guy’s work deteriorate in a cow pasture under a tent that would fall down in the next storm. This guy’s work should be in more museum collections, and it should be taken care of and not end up in a party tent in Sidney, Maine.”
Said Moss, “The work was too sophisticated to pass up. In good faith, I could not have walked away from it. There is no way. This is not just a business for me. This is where my heart resides – in art and especially in paintings like these. I love large, abstract expressionist paintings.”
The next day, they arranged to buy the rest of the artwork, and two days later, on New Year’s Day, they went back to Sidney with a rental truck and a small team of volunteers to pack up paintings, drawings, blank canvases, rolled works, stretchers and other materials and items. All are now stored in an undisclosed location while Keen and Moss research and document the work. Keen said he and Moss salvaged “truckloads” of paintings, all completed between 1998 and 2008, with many dating from 2002 to 2004, with names like “Red Air” and “Black Air.”
Moss plans to show 15 or so paintings in the exhibition that opens in Falmouth on Friday. Some of those paintings Mulhern made in the aftermath of 9/11.
Howe, from Cumberland Self Storage, said the 10-by-12-foot unit in Brunswick “was stuffed right full. You couldn’t put any more in there even if you tried. … The sons rented the unit after their father’s passing to try to save his legacy, but unfortunately they couldn’t get it worked out.”
The sons, who live in Maine, declined through Mulhern’s estate representative in New Hampshire to be interviewed for this story. Cynthia Reeves, who represents Mulhern in the art market, said the family “lost the works through hardship. At some point it became difficult to keep up with the payments for the storage. We stepped in to help and took some of the work, and then Elizabeth was able to bid on the remaining works there in Maine.”
She said the family would be pleased to know Mulhern’s art is being shown in Maine. Reeves knew Mulhern for 25 years, and arranged exhibitions for him mostly in New York, Massachusetts and New Hampshire. The exhibition in Falmouth is believed to be his first in Maine.
“He was a monumentally good painter,” Reeves said. “He was a really fantastic painter in this very specific, very New York tradition of abstract minimalism. He was from the New York school of painting through and through, even though he was born in Scotland. But he adopted Manhattan because of the coterie of artists that he resonated with so deeply.”
The art that Moss and Keen acquired spans various phases of Mulhern’s career. In addition to the dark work associated with 9/11, Mulhern painted colorful “spaghetti confetti” style paintings. A year or more before 9/11, he began a series that he called Ash Road, made in black, white and gray and occasionally aluminum paint, with a swirling quality that alluded to dust or fog. According to Reeves, he called them his “color paintings” even through they were monochromatic.
After 9/11, the dust he was trying to achieve in his art became literal and his paintings became environmental and atmospheric. As he experimented with paints mixed with the ash from the World Trade Center collapse, the series took on profound weight and meaning.
“The previous work was very quiet,” Mulhern told the New York Times early in 2002. “This is almost severe. I can’t believe it is not a response.”

If there’s one thing the candidates vying to replace Gov. Gavin Newsom can agree on, it’s that too many Californians are fleeing the state.
While kicking off her campaign, Caitlyn Jenner shared that a fellow private plane owner was “packing up his hangar” for Arizona because he couldn’t stand to see any more homeless people. Kevin Paffrath, a YouTube star running as a Democrat, began his candidacy announcement by listing reasons for trading in “broken” California for Florida’s greener pastures.
In a recent debate, Republican candidate Kevin Faulconer said that if you named a state, any state, Californians were headed there.
Sure, there’s some truth to what’s been called the “California exodus”: More Californians are relocating to other states than are moving here from elsewhere in the country. But that’s by no means a new trend — it’s been that way for more than 30 years.
And while California’s population declined slightly last year and the state lost a congressional seat, it wasn’t because of a sudden mass migration to states like Texas and Idaho.
Our halted population growth was mostly because of falling numbers of births and international immigration, as well as a high number of deaths from COVID-19, as my colleague Shawn Hubler has reported.
Still, the discussion left me wondering where Californians end up settling when they do leave. So I crunched the numbers.
More than 653,000 Californians moved to another state in 2019, while about 480,000 people moved here from elsewhere in the country, according to data from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey. (The 2020 numbers aren’t available, but analyses of other 2020 data sets have yielded similar results.)
These were the top destinations for Californians leaving:
— Texas (82,235 people in Texas had moved from California in the last year).
— Arizona (59,713).
— Nevada (47,322).
— Washington (46,791).
— Oregon (37,927).
States you’d be most likely to run into a Californian:
— Nevada (three out of every 200 Nevada residents had moved from California in the past year).
— Idaho.
— Oregon.
— Arizona.
— Hawaii.
These are the states new Californians most often moved here from:
— New York (37,567 Californians had lived in New York in the past year).
— Texas (37,063).
— Washington (31,882).
— Arizona (28,226).
— Nevada (26,433).
For many Californians, the high cost of living makes staying here nearly impossible, experts say. In Texas, the median home price is $329,000, less than half of what it is in the Golden State, according to Redfin, a real estate brokerage.
Eric McGhee, a senior fellow with the Public Policy Institute of California, told me that people moving to California were more likely to be educated, employed and earn higher incomes than those moving away.
That suggests that high expenses are to blame for the departures, though not high taxes, as some claim, he said. California taxes wealthier people at much higher levels than those with lower incomes, he said.
“If those taxes were the motivation, you’d expect wealthy people to be moving out,” McGhee said, noting exceptions such as Elon Musk, a newly minted Texan. “By and large that’s not the people leaving the state.”
For all the hand-wringing about California’s no-longer-booming population, there’s some evidence that we may actually prefer it that way.
A University of California, San Diego poll released in July found that a fraction of Californians believed the state would benefit from continued population growth over the next decade.
A far higher share — more than 1 in 3 Californians — had a different take: California would be better off if it shrunk. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Coast to Coast in a Classic Car

Austin-Healey’s Mark I Sprite, a little racer known as a Bugeye, is perhaps not the first car you’d consider for a cross-country drive. For one thing, there’s no trunk lid (access is from behind the seats), external door handles or actual glass windows — there are removable “side curtains” instead.
Under its hood is a four-cylinder engine with all of 45 horsepower. Getting to 60 mph takes about 20 seconds, and these British roadsters, built between early 1958 and late 1960 (48,987 were made), are not exactly known for reliability.
But their fun factor can’t be measured, and Karen and Thomas Jeffrey Larrick of Mount Vernon, Washington, were recently at the Bugeye Guy restoration shop in Branford, Connecticut, taking delivery of their pale yellow 1958 Sprite, nicknamed Ducky. The couple were near the start of an epic journey — they planned to drive 4,000 miles home, on a route with many stopovers along the way.
David Silberkleit, the aforementioned Bugeye Guy, had made roughly 150 nonoriginal modifications meant to keep Ducky rolling toward Washington, including a Ford-sourced five-speed gearbox for more relaxed cruising, disc brakes all around, electronic ignition, an alternator and — crucially — a beefy aluminum radiator with six-bladed fan. Silberkleit said he planned “to sleep with my cellphone under my pillow” until the couple made it safely home.
Sure, it’s an adventure but possibly a uniquely enjoyable one for classic car owners. For Tom Cotter, host of the online show “Barn Find Hunter,” slow-paced cross-country trips like this are all about “going through towns bypassed by the interstate highways, where you can smell the just-mowed grass, eat in little diners and stay in hotels built 100 years ago.”
In 2017, Cotter experienced this firsthand, driving 3,700 miles in a 1926 Model T Ford — with some appropriate modifications, including electronic ignition, disc brakes and a period engine upgrade. The route followed the old Lincoln Highway, one of the first to link the East and West coasts, when possible.
Many of Cotter’s barn finds, all over the United States, were the reward for long-distance trips in his 1939 Ford Deluxe woody, a vehicle he found “resting against a barn” when he was 15. He paid $300. Today, the Ford looks original but travels with many modern mechanical upgrades. A trip from Key West, Florida, to Fairbanks, Alaska, is on the horizon, and Cotter said he would like to do it in “some significant car.”
Jonathan Klinger, vice president for car culture at Hagerty, the classic car specialist, agrees that seeking out the blue highways is part of the challenge — especially in cars that strain to reach 70 mph.
“It’s more the journey than the final destination,” he said. “You figure out what attractions are along the way and connect the dots with secondary roads. In the end, it’s a fantastic road trip, instead of ‘Gosh, I’m so glad I’m here.’”
Larrick, a semiretired vocational rehabilitation director, budgeted at least 30 days for the couple’s trip, with detours to visit attractions, friends and relatives. At home, he regularly drives his classics, which include a 1978 Citroën GS, a 1968 Saab 96 and a 2008 Smart car.
“When I insured the Sprite, I told them I planned to drive it 15,000 to 25,000 miles annually,” he said. “The Saab has been my daily driver.”
The Bugeye Sprite (they’re called “Frogeyes” in their native Britain) had been on Larrick’s bucket list for 50 years, even though he has owned plenty of other British cars, including MGs, Jaguars and Triumphs.
Ray Kopczynski, a city council member in Albany, Oregon, also owns and regularly drives a Saab 96, a 1965 model with a two-stroke engine that requires oil to be mixed with the gasoline. In fact, he drove that car, towing a small trailer, all the way to Albany, New York, in July for the Saab Owners’ Convention. (A sign he carried read, “Albany, OR to Albany, NY or BUST.”) He left July 6 and, despite a few setbacks, completed his round trip July 26.
In the process, Kopczynski lost more than 10 pounds (which he attributes to the extreme heat, the humidity and his skipping some meals) and suffered only one big breakdown — the exhaust came loose in Three Forks, Montana, during his return trip. He drove a lot of miles with the car making a tremendous racket before finding a willing welder in Lewiston, Idaho, relatively close to home.
“Finally, I could hear myself think,” he said.
Kopczynski’s wife chose to stay home, but Karen Larrick, a teacher and school librarian, elected to ride shotgun in the Bugeye.
“It’s awful cute and it smiles, so I’m good,” she said.
The Larricks toured Mystic Aquarium, the Pez Visitor Center and the Thimble Islands, all in Connecticut, then went to Tamaqua, Pennsylvania, covering the first 398 miles on the odometer. The car performed well but leaked a little bit of oil, which is typical for the breed.
“You’re so close to the ground that 50 mph on the highway feels like speeding,” Larrick said. “The speed limits in Pennsylvania are mostly 55, so I’m going at the same pace as the Corvettes.”
Giles and Nick English, founders of Bremont Watch Co. in England, made rather more rapid progress across the United States in 2017, driving a 1973 Porsche 911T and a 1970 Jaguar E-Type. Giles English, who bought the 911 when he was 20 and has long known his late dad’s E-Type, said they had flown the cars over from England.
“America is the most wonderful country, and the wonder of it is out of the cities,” he said. “It was amazing driving a car I’d previously driven only in England.”
The Porsche needed only a new starter motor on the trip, but the E-Type, while not using oil, had more difficulties, English said.
“We joke that it was made in America, because it has so many American-sourced parts on it now,” he said. “The clutch master cylinder failed in Memphis, where we visited Graceland. We put out a call on social media, and a lovely man took the necessary part off his own E-Type and delivered it to us the next morning.”
The pair took in much of the country on two separate visits, with the first one ending in Texas.
The Larricks reached home in Washington on Aug. 19, having traveled 4,001 miles, and experienced only minor mishaps. Larrick lost the turn-signal flashers, which meant he had to blink the lights by hand, and replaced a leaking rubber gasket with a piece cut from a tire. They got seriously wet on only one day.
On the trip, taken mostly on blue highways, the Bugeye was an intense object of curiosity — but only two people correctly identified it.
“When told that we were driving this tiny car across the country, people often said, ‘I wish I could do that,’” Larrick said. “But you could tell they were actually questioning our sanity.” Nevertheless, he said, he “had a lot of fun going slow” and would do it again.
Silberkleit, whose job title is Chief Frogeye Officer, has sold 323 of these early Sprites, and he said every one was different. Some customers want perfect concours restorations; others want upgraded hot rods. Most use their cars locally, within a 100-mile radius.
The Larricks bucked the trend.
“Their goal was reliability,” Silberkleit said. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

The Lighter Side of Octopus
Justin Smillie, the executive chef for the Il Buco restaurants in Manhattan and in Amagansett, New York, wanted to devise a lighter take on octopus. “I was looking for something other than the big steaky chunks you always see,” he said. So instead of cutting meaty cross-sections of the tentacles, he shaved them into ribbons the long way, quickly seared the strips on a plancha and tossed them with tiny tomatoes, herbs, a bit of Fresno chile and olive oil for his delectable, crispy octopus dish ($26, among the small plates at Il Buco Al Mare). He starts with cooked octopus and uses a meat slicer; for home cooks, a sharp knife works. He recommends marinating the strips before cooking, and also suggests threading them on skewers or tossing them with pasta or into rice dishes.

The Blush of Pineapple, From a New Online Source
Yes, they sell fragrant, juicy lychees, rambutans, mangosteens, dragon fruit, soursop and more. But the jewel in the crown from Full Moon Fruits, a fledgling fruit company, is the pink pineapple. With flesh the color of rosé, this rare pineapple from Costa Rica is irresistibly sweeter and less acidic than the yellow variety, delivering an almost cotton candy flavor. Uncut, they’re not so Instagrammable, sold without a crown of leaves because the tops are used to propagate subsequent crops. Matt Dembo, a marketing executive and a founder of the company, said he got into the fruit game as a sideline four years ago after sampling some of the fruits he found in stores in the Los Angeles area where he is based. He started sending various fruits, including some rare varieties, to friends, and before long was in business. He said he buys from small growers in California and in countries in Central America and elsewhere, preferably those who avoid chemicals. Prices start at about $5 for individual fruits by the pound; assortments are $39.99 and up.

Oysters, in the Form of a CSA
Faced with the pandemic putting an end to his New York bartending job, Aaron Waldman returned to Maine, his home state, and a year or so ago started the World’s Your Oyster Company, distributing cultivated oysters from Maine and Eastern Canada to restaurants. Earlier this year he expanded his market, offering oysters to consumers through a Community Supported Agriculture program, with monthly or bimonthly deliveries to locations in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens and the Hudson Valley. Other shellfish like clams can be included. Memberships in the September-October CSA are now open and feature oyster farms owned or managed by women.

—— A Sip of Paradise
St. Agrestis, the Brooklyn distiller known for its Italian approach to amaro and cocktails like the Negroni, has introduced a new aperitivo. Called Paradiso and sold in a distinctive tapered bottle like St. Agrestis’ other products, it’s the mellow yang to the decidedly bitter yin of the company’s Inferno Bitter and is formulated to be the foundation of a spritz. The honey-colored 40-proof spirit is made with a wine base, gets its bracing profile from blood orange and citrus peels, and has a spicy aroma with a hint of baked apple on the palate. Come fall, blend it in a spritz with sparkling hard cider (try Brooklyn Cider House Bone Dry) or simply enjoy it on the rocks.

A Chef’s Apron From Tom Colicchio
Chef and restaurateur Tom Colicchio has collaborated on the design of an efficient new apron from Tilit, a company that makes chef’s garb. In blue or green, it’s made from organic duck cotton with waxed cotton; a white one is all duck. All have a leather strap and a front zip pocket. They are $115, with $10 of the price being donated to Edible Schoolyard NYC.

A Streusel Cake to Write Home About
The new streusel cakes from the Vienna Cookie Co. in Baldwin, New York, are defined by their fillings of fruit, chocolate or nuts, sandwiched in between a tender cookielike base and a rich crumb topping. The cakes are the owner Heidi Riegler’s refinement of the typical New York coffee shop crumb cake and can go from breakfast to dessert. They will easily accept a pouf of yogurt, whipped cream or ice cream. Riegler uses local farmers’ market peaches and blueberries in her fillings, combines chocolate chips and ganache for the chocolate flavor, and soaks pecans in Grand Marnier for another variety.

Texto completo: A veteran journalist with the Los Angeles Times has been named city editor of the Portland Press Herald/Maine Sunday Telegram.
Nita Lelyveld, who will start next month, has been a staff writer, news and features editor, state editor and assistant city editor at the Los Angeles paper.
She has ties to Maine, where her family has owned land and a cabin Down East for nearly 50 years. The state "has always been a huge part of my life and I have been dreaming for years of moving to Maine," Lelyveld said.
As city editor, Lelyveld will replace John Richardson, who will become deputy managing editor. Richardson will be replacing Dieter Bradbury, who is retiring.
The daughter of a New York Times foreign correspondent, Lelyveld grew up traveling the world. Her father, Joseph Lelyveld, worked for the New York Times for nearly 40 years, eventually becoming executive editor from 1994 to 2001.
Lelyveld began her career at the Tuscaloosa (Alabama) News and then joined the Associated Press, working in Hartford and Washington. After that, she worked for the Philadelphia Inquirer, which sent her to California as a national writer.
When her assignment to California ended, she decided to stay and joined the L.A. Times, where she has held writing and editing positions and recently created City Beat, a feature that examines life in the California metropolis.
The feature has attracted a large social media following and Lelyveld said it reinforces her belief that newspapers are at their best when "building a community of readers who feel connected to the paper."
"We're fortunate to have found someone with such broad experience and talent to oversee critical coverage areas," said Cliff Schechtman, executive editor of the Press Herald/Maine Sunday Telegram. "Nita is an insightful editor whose depth and sophistication will help improve our journalism. And her lifelong connection to Maine is a tremendous asset as well."
"Nita is a superior journalist with an impressive resume," said Steve Greenlee, managing editor of the Press Herald/Maine Sunday Telegram. "She has an infectious enthusiasm for her work and a wealth of ideas."

Texto completo: The Northeast will see impacts from Tropical Storm Henri, perhaps even landfall, according to the latest guidance from the National Hurricane Center.
A hurricane watch has been issued for parts of Long Island, from Fire Island Inlet on the south shore and Jefferson Harbor on the north shore eastward to Montauk, and from New Haven, Connecticut, eastward to Sagamore Beach, Massachusetts, including Nantucket, Martha's Vineyard and Block Island, according to the NHC Friday morning.
Tropical storm watches have been issued for west of Fire Island Inlet to East Rockaway Inlet, west of Port Jefferson Harbor New York, and west of New Haven.
A storm surge watch is also issued for parts of Long Island, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts.
These watches mean there will be hurricane or tropical storm conditions and life-threatening storm surges possible in the next 48 hours.
Even if Henri stays offshore, swells could cause life-threatening high surf and rip currents.
"It should be noted that as Henri gains latitude and moves near New England, the wind field is expected to expand," the NHC said. "Therefore, users are reminded to not focus on the exact forecast points as impacts will extend far from the center."
It doesn't help that weather forecast models seem to be all over the place when it comes to Henri's predicted track.
Massachusetts, which has the potential to take a direct hit, can expect multiple potential hazards such as damaging winds, storm surge and heavy rain.
"Keep in mind tides will be astronomically high this weekend along both coasts," says the National Weather Service (NWS) in Boston.
High-tide timing is important because the moon phase tides will already be higher than normal, so any storm surge on top of that could trigger enhanced coastal flooding.
"Track will ultimately tell us which coastline is most at risk (east coast vs south coast) or if both will be in play," the Boston NWS said.
The onset of tropical-storm-force winds for coastal Massachusetts is expected Sunday morning, so the NWS urges that all preparations must be done by that point.
Even though the models may vary on what the exact impacts will be from Henri, it is always better to be prepared in case the storms hits.
Henri will likely deliver these impacts
"Generally, with tropical storms the biggest impact is from flooding rains," said Margaret Curtis, a meteorologist with the NWS in Portland, Maine.
Thanks to the remnants of Tropical Storm Fred, much of New England will be receiving heavy rainfall today. There are also additional rain chances in much of the Northeast this weekend, so flooding will be a concern even before Henri potentially hits the area. But Curtis explains there are other concerns as well.
"For the coast, high surf and pounding can create coastal flooding and erosion," said Curtis.
And high surf, as well as rip currents, won't just be limited to the Northeast. Coastal communities from North Carolina up through Atlantic Canada could experience "life-threatening surf and rip currents," according to the NHC.
Extra weather balloon launches are expected to take place along much of the East Coast. These additional launches supply extra insight into what the atmosphere may be doing to influence Henri's forecast track.
"The hurricane hunter planes sampling the atmosphere around the storm will likely play a bigger role than the extra launches in gaining accuracy and confidence in the upcoming model output," says Chad Myers, CNN meteorologist.
"It is too early to determine what the storm will do at this hour, but a direct landfall as a hurricane and then the center stopping over land making tremendous flooding seems to be the worst-case scenario in some of the current model output."

The Cheesiest Art Talk
Art and artifacts that feature food in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art span millenniums, from ancient Egypt to pop art. Narrow the search to a single foodstuff, cheese, and there is still plenty to savor, as Laura Corey, a senior researcher in the director’s office, will show in a virtual class this month. Also on the panel will be Zoe Brickley, creative director of Jasper Hill Farm in Vermont. And so the class is not merely digital, participants have the option to receive a selection of seven Jasper Hill cheeses from Jasper Hill to sample during the class. The deadline for ordering cheeses is Aug. 23; the class will be recorded for those who register but can’t watch it live.
“An Evening with the Met and Jasper Hill Farm,” 6 p.m. Aug. 26, $125 with cheese samples, $20 without, jasperhillfarm.com/products/themet.
The Perfect Clam for Your Pasta Sauce
When Atlantic surf clams, the mollusks with the big white shells you see empty on the beaches from Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, to Canada, are very small, no more than 2 inches across, they’re called butter clams or petite surf clams. They’re being farmed in Maine and on Cape Cod. Smaller and more tender than littlenecks, they are the ideal clam for spaghetti or linguine alle vongole, pasta with clam sauce. Now the Lobster Place in Chelsea Market has started to get shipments of these sweet little clams. The market expects to have them on a regular basis starting this week, but Lobster Place president Brendan Hayes said they rely on an oyster supplier in Maine, and should have a delivery every week through Labor Day. They’re worth seeking out.
Maine Butter Clams, $19.95 a pound (about 40 clams), The Lobster Place, Chelsea Market, 75 Ninth Ave., New York City. 212-255-5672, lobsterplace.com.
Sidle Up to This Bar for an Herbal Infusion
Herbal mixtures, which some consider to be remedies, date back to the very mists of civilization. Lou Sagar, who was a lifestyle and wellness consultant, founded the Alchemist’s Kitchen in New York City in 2017 as a place to sell herbal products and give advice about them. As natural remedies have grown in popularity, Sagar has now added the Elixir Bar next door, where herbal mixtures said to affect the mood are served and sold. The elixirs can be added to sparkling water, teas, coffees, kombucha, milks and very pretty infusions; consumed as plain shots and mocktails; and bottled to take home. Gluten-free vegan snacks like banana bread, muffins, cookies and quiches are served. The bright white store, with vintage touches, has a small bar and a communal table. Sagar said he vetted his sources for botanicals very carefully; on the company’s website there’s an excellent disclaimer about the efficacy of herbal remedies.

Master the Art of the Japanese Cocktail
The cover of “The Japanese Art of the Cocktail” gives you some idea of what making cocktails the Japanese way involves. It shows one of the authors, Masahiro Urushido, using a pick to sculpt a large ball of ice. The big, clear ice cube, usually made from molds these days, is a signature that the Japanese cocktail culture has brought to cocktails in the United States and elsewhere. Urushido, an owner of Katana Kitten, a Manhattan bar, details the precise approach the Japanese take not just to carving the ice but to assembling drinks. He describes his career, from low-rung beginnings as a food runner to a sought-after mixologist in Japan and New York. The book explains high-end cocktail bars in Japan and more informal izakayas; his bar blends both. Many of the book’s recipes, with long drinks and Japanese riffs on classics, are demanding; some simpler examples are the Japanese highball using frozen whiskey; the Far East Side with sake, tequila and shiso leaves; and Friday in the Park, combining pear cider and vermouth (though he recommends making your own vermouth). The book, released in June, has a guide to ingredients and sources.
“The Japanese Art of the Cocktail: Recipes, Tips, and Techniques from Katana Kitten in NYC and Beyond” by Masahiro Urushido and Michael Anstendig (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, $30).
A Nonalcoholic Rosé Worth Meeting
Making satisfying nonalcoholic wine appears to be a greater challenge than producing good wine with alcohol. A winner in this rapidly growing category is the new sparkling nonalcoholic rosé, Spring in a Bottle, that Wölffer Estate in Sagaponack, New York, introduced last month. It’s made in Germany from organic pinot noir, merlot and St. Laurent grapes in partnership with the Strauch Distillery in Rheinhessen. The pink wine, with nice carbonation and a delicately floral bouquet, has the flavor of white peaches: rich, tart, nicely fruity but not sweet. Wine drinkers will not miss the alcohol.

Spiedie Sauce Is Just the Beginning
Taste NY, created by the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets and the governor’s office in 2013 to promote locally made food products, has made the foods and other local items available online. The digital marketplace is run by the Cornell Cooperative Extension of Sullivan County. The products, like pickles, jams, condiments, sauces and syrups, are sorted by region. They’re the same products that are sold at many official state stores throughout New York.

Breanna Stewart’s Golden Journey to Motherhood

Breanna Stewart is ready to tell her secret.
She kept it for months: During the first half of the current WNBA season, as captain of the Seattle Storm; in Tokyo this month, as she led the United States to Olympic gold in women’s basketball.
Only a few close friends, which included a pair of teammates, knew of her and her wife’s private joy.
“We just wanted to share this with a very close circle,” she told me last week, referring to herself and her wife, Marta Xargay. “Just to have this special time in life to ourselves for a while.”
Many consider Stewart the greatest female basketball player of this era. Now they can also call her a mom.
Stewart and Xargay’s gestational surrogate carried an embryo that had been created with one of Stewart’s eggs. Two days after winning a gold medal and most valuable player honors at the Tokyo Games women’s basketball tournament, Stewart experienced a moment that she said could compare with nothing else: the birth of her first child. “It took my breath away,” she said. “The most important moment of my life.”
The no-fanfare birth of Ruby Mae Stewart Xargay is a story of love and family in the modern age — without limits. It shows how female sports stars are pushing past tradition and finding a level of power that extends to every aspect of their lives.
“This is about controlling my own destiny,” Stewart told me. “It’s about making decisions that fit me, fit my family and where we want to go, where we want to be, and not waiting.”
Though still rare, having children and returning to competition is not new for the best female athletes. In recent years, a small number of mothers, about 10 or so, have played in the WNBA each season.
But Stewart, 26, and in her prime, is helping chart a new course. Having missed the entire WNBA season in 2019 because of an Achilles’ rupture, using a surrogate afforded her the chance to keep her career going without another interruption.
She is now the most prominent player to become a mother since the Women’s National Basketball Players Association championed a trailblazing labor agreement that set a new template for how sports leagues should treat women. Formalized in 2020, that labor deal did not just increase leaguewide salaries. It also ensured full pay for maternity leave, boosted access to child care and provided significant financial support for child adoption, surrogacy and egg freezing so that players can have children when the time is right.
“I’ve always known I wanted to have a family, always wanted to be a younger mom,” Stewart said. “It will not be easy, but why can’t I be the best player, a mom and have a child in the way we have done?”
Stewart pulled this off in what for her is typical fashion — carefully and tactically.
In 2017, her second year as a pro, she revealed in an essay that she is a survivor of sexual abuse endured in her childhood, using the public disclosure to advocate on behalf of other survivors. As an emerging star in a predominantly Black sport, Stewart had not spoken out much on matters of race. But starting last summer, after listening to her peers and getting involved in protests in the Seattle area, she began speaking loudly for Black justice.
For a long time she was quiet, too, about her relationship with Xargay, a now-retired Spanish basketball player with whom she had fallen in love while the two played on a Russian EuroLeague team in 2019. But in May, Stewart posted to social media a picture of their engagement. The couple married July 6 in a small ceremony atop their downtown Seattle condominium, details Stewart had not made public until now.
Stewart and Xargay decided they wanted a child in the summer and fall of 2020, as they huddled together through a WNBA season played in a bubble in Bradenton, Florida.
When the season finished, they interviewed surrogates and searched for the right sperm donor. Using an egg frozen during Stewart’s 2019 rehab, the pregnancy took hold. Then there were months of Zoom check-ins with the surrogate and her Idaho doctors.
All the while, Stewart had to keep her focus on basketball, which proved particularly challenging in Tokyo. So long as the baby didn’t come early, birth would be induced just after the Games.
Stewart said she had to compartmentalize as never before. “When it was game time at the Olympics, I focused fully on the game,” she said. “When I was off the court, I could think of Marta and the baby.”
In keeping with her private nature, Stewart was quiet about Ruby to her fellow members of the U.S. national team. She told me that only her Storm teammates and close friends, Jewell Loyd and Sue Bird, knew what was going on behind the scenes. Bird is a founder of TOGETHXR, the media company for which Stewart filmed a documentary about her surrogacy journey.
“I went from one emotion to the next,” Stewart said. “From winning a gold medal to realizing, OK, I’m going home, and my daughter is going to be born in less than 24 hours.”
What a week she would experience. The gold medal mission accomplished, Stewart flew home with the team, arriving in Los Angeles on Aug. 8, a Sunday. From there she boarded a private plane to Boise, where Xargay and the surrogate waited. Last Monday afternoon, at the Birkeland Maternity Center, in Nampa, Idaho, Stewart and Xargay watched Ruby slip easily into the world.
The brown-haired girl’s wailing shrieks filled the room. She weighed 9 pounds 4 ounces. “I was in shock, seeing a baby being born in front of me,” said Stewart, who stands an angular, broad-shouldered 6 feet 4 inches. “I felt like crying. I also just felt the love that was in the air.”
Stewart cut the umbilical cord . Soon, she and Xargay held Ruby for the first time. They laid their baby on a bed. They placed the freshly won gold medal at Ruby’s side.
On Thursday, Stewart was back to basketball. She flew alone to Phoenix, where the Storm played the championship game of the WNBA's inaugural Commissioner’s Cup, a midseason tournament featuring the teams with the best records from the league’s two conferences. Stewart scored 17 points, missing just two field-goal attempts, and the Storm defeated the Connecticut Sun, 79-57.
When the game was done, she pulled her team around her in the locker room.
“I just wanted you guys to know that Marta and I had a baby,” she remembered saying to a sea of stunned faces. “It was like, ‘Wait, neither one of you are pregnant, so how can that happen?’ ”
As she explained, her teammates showered her with hugs.
Stewart told me she would miss only two Storm games to bond with Ruby and to rest. When the Storm play the New York Liberty for the second time this week Friday night, she will be there.
There is no slowing down in professional women’s basketball. The top players go from battling through WNBA seasons in America to months spent overseas, seeking to maximize their earnings while still in their prime.
It is a grinding treadmill Stewart has been on since she left the University of Connecticut in 2016. She will not stop. Only now she will have baby Ruby along for the ride, and no more secrets. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Texto completo: Every time there’s a bout of bad news out of Florida regarding the coronavirus pandemic, the media work itself into a tizzy to try and pin everything on Gov. Ron DeSantis and make him out to be some sort of villain.
Here are just a few examples: MSNBC’s Dean Obeidallah claimed Florida’s children are “less safe” because DeSantis “wants to be president some day.” CNN declared DeSantis’s decision not to reimpose lockdown restrictions on his state is a “reckless experiment” that could “yield some alarming results.” The Los Angeles Times’s Harry Litman alleged DeSantis’s opposition to school mask mandates is “borderline criminal behavior.” CNN’s Jim Acosta even suggested changing the name of the delta variant to the “DeSantis variant.”
"Instead of the delta variant, why not call it the DeSantis variant?" Acosta asked. "We could sell beer koozies that say ‘Don’t Florida My Fauci,’ and use the money to help pay for all of the funerals in the days to come."
One would be forgiven for thinking Acosta is actually enjoying the state’s recent uptick in positive cases and hospitalizations.
The facts, however, tell a much different story than the one the media are pushing. Although hospitalization rates have increased throughout the state over the past few weeks, Florida is still fourth in the seven-day rolling death per capita average. There are still only about 0.41 daily deaths per 100,000 residents in the state, which is less than Democratic-run Nevada’s, and much less than Arkansas and Louisiana’s, according to Becker’s Hospital Review.
And overall, there are 25 states that have worse total death per capita rates than Florida has had over the past 15 months. Considering the state has the second-largest elderly population in the country and experienced a lot of foot traffic throughout the pandemic, this is quite the accomplishment.
The claim that DeSantis is somehow threatening the lives of Florida’s children is also ridiculous. A recent article in the Wall Street Journal notes that as of July 31, the rate at which children were being hospitalized with coronavirus nationally was 0.5 per 100,000, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which amounts to roughly 250 patients. Moreover, the CDC acknowledged that not all of these children were even in the hospital for COVID-19, the article states. Even the doctors who have reported an increase in COVID-19 cases among children have admitted that it’s extremely unlikely that they fall seriously ill from the virus. So forgive me if I don’t buy into the hysteria.
It is also absurd to suggest that DeSantis’s opposition to sweeping mask mandates and other restrictions caused this spike. There are a number of other states that have similarly refrained from reimposing masking requirements, such as Idaho, without experiencing a significant increase in case rates. Idaho also has a much smaller vaccination percentage than Florida, but that has not been reflected in the state’s caseload either.
There are a couple of other factors at play that explain Florida’s spike, and none of them have to do with DeSantis: First, although Florida has led the country in vaccinating its elderly population, there are still many at-risk persons who have chosen not to get the shot, which means they are more likely to end up in the hospital. Second, Florida’s residents spend more time indoors during the summer months, where they’re more likely to spread the virus.
The fact is that DeSantis has been and is still exactly right about the coronavirus: Further restrictions are not the solution, but the vaccines are. This is why he has vigorously promoted vaccination in every part of the state, working with local community centers such as churches to make sure everyone who wants the jab has access to one, and inundating Floridians with vaccination advertisements.
The state still has some work to do to boost its vaccination rate, but to claim that this recent spike proves DeSantis has been a failure is just not true. He's been much better than most state leaders, and he has the numbers to prove it.

Texto completo: Salt Lake City • Tyler Holt summed up the problem his Utah landscaping business faces every year. “People who want to be in the job force want stability — if they want to work, they work full time,” he said. “Locally there’s just no workers who want to do anything seasonal.”
The complaint has been echoed not only by landscapers in Utah, but also by amusement parks in Wyoming, restaurants in Rhode Island, crab trappers in Maryland, camps in Colorado and thousands of other businesses around the country that depend on seasonal workers from abroad to work lower-wage nonfarm jobs.
The scramble for these temporary guest workers has been intense in recent years, as the jobless rate inched down and tensions over immigration policy ratcheted up. But this year, after the coronavirus pandemic first halted and then seriously constrained the stream of foreign workers into the United States, the competition has been particularly fierce.
The Biden administration responded to frantic pleas from small businesses in the spring. It did not renew a pandemic-related suspension of the J-1 program, which provides short-term visas designed for foreign students who come to the United States to work and travel. Soon after, it raised the quota on temporary visas under the H-2B program for temporary nonagricultural workers, which are issued through a lottery.
But travel restrictions, backlogs and delays at foreign consulates in approving applicants have still left businesses from Maine to California in the lurch.
Holt, the chief executive of Golden Landscaping and Lawn in Orem, asked for 60 H-2B workers, hoping the team could be in place by April 1, when the season began. He struck out in the initial lottery, but he was luckier the second time around, when the administration increased the quota by one-third.
On July 9, Holt was overjoyed to hear that his application had been approved. But now, roughly halfway through his eight-month season, still no workers have arrived.
“Nothing,” he said with disgust when asked two weeks later about an update.
Holt said he had raised his normal $14-an-hour wage — by $2, then $3, then $4 and then $5 — to attract local workers. “I will give anybody a job that wants to work,” he said. The crews he has in place are working 60 to 70 hours a week to keep up with the demand.
Landscapers like Holt employ more H-2B workers than any other industry — roughly half of the total approved. And their inability to get a workforce in place by the start of the season has been costly.
Ken Doyle, the president of All States Landscaping in Draper, Utah, said the late arrival of 27 temporary foreign workers had cost him 15% to 20% of his business, about $1 million.
“We’re so far behind,” he said. “We’ve lost some very large accounts.”
Doyle acknowledges that the work can leave blisters and an aching back. “It’s a hard job,” he said on a day when the temperature trudged past 100 degrees. “It’s hot outside. They’re digging holes for sprinklers or trees, laying sod and lifting heavy items.”
Under the H-2B visa program that Doyle and Holt rely on, the number of seasonal foreign workers is ordinarily capped at 66,000 a year, split between the winter and summer season. Veteran workers, who returned year after year, used to be exempted from the total, but Congress halted that practice in 2017 as the immigration debate got heated. The next year, the government instituted a lottery system that injected a new layer of uncertainty on top of a frustrating process.
“It’s quite the gamble if you’re going to be a viable business,” Doyle said.
Programs for temporary guest workers have long come under attack from several corners. Labor groups and immigration critics argue that it robs American workers of jobs and depresses wages. And every year, there are disturbing examples in which foreign workers are exploited by employers, cheated out of pay or living in squalid conditions.
(Tristan Spinski|The New York Times) Kyan Chase, 15, at work at Palace Playland in Old Orchard Beach, Maine, on July 29, 2021. Of the seasonal labor shortage, he says: "It's pretty good for me. I can get a job anywhere I want."(Tristan Spinski|The New York Times) Kyan Chase, 15, at work at Palace Playland in Old Orchard Beach, Maine, on July 29, 2021. Of the seasonal labor shortage, he says: "It's pretty good for me. I can get a job anywhere I want." (Tristan Spinski/)
Many employers counter that people don’t understand the peculiarities of the seasonal labor market and changed attitudes, particularly about manual work.
“Fifteen, 20 years ago we were able to get local summer kids in high school or college,” Holt said. “Those workers are just not there anymore. It’s easier to do other things than hard labor for eight to nine hours a day.”
Doyle spent nearly $30,000 advertising for workers as far away as Nevada and got no response, he said. For the last year, he has had a 20-foot trailer parked outside his office, emblazoned with a sign proclaiming: “NOW HIRING. WALK-INS WELCOME.”
“I had two people drop in all year,” he said.
Higher wages could encourage more American-born workers to apply to these jobs, said Muzaffar Chishti, director of the Migration Policy Institute at the New York University Law School. But he argues that in every labor market, there are difficult, unpleasant, low-paid jobs with no opportunity for advancement — like agricultural work or meatpacking — that are considered less desirable both for economic and for cultural reasons.
Some of the attitudes toward jobs, particularly in the service sectors, are changing, he said, but “we haven’t quite understood yet the impact of pandemic.”
Temporary guest workers have also gotten entangled in broader and more bitter arguments over immigration. There is a widespread misconception, Chishti said, that all foreign workers are eager to settle in the United States.
“A lot of workers don’t necessarily want to come and live here forever,” he said. “They want to work legally and travel back and forth. Their life in Mexico, for example, may be better than life in a U.S. city.”
In the meantime, employers are struggling. Small resort towns often depend on international seasonal workers because their population isn’t sufficient to fill all of the suddenly available slots at hotels, restaurants, ice cream shops or ski slopes that serve the hordes of tourists who appear and then vanish.
“We just don’t have enough local workers to be able to support the economy as it needs to be in the summertime,” said Jen Hayes, who is the J-1 visa program liaison for Old Orchard Beach, a coastal town south of Portland, Maine.
Historically, the town has had anywhere from 650 to 740 international student workers in the summer — from countries including Turkey, Romania and Russia — but Hayes estimated that there were only 125 to 150 as of late July. A meet-and-greet at the start of the summer that typically bustles with activity drew only a handful of people.
The labor shortage has forced some businesses to limit their hours or close for an extra day a week.
Exorbitant housing costs in vacation-friendly enclaves — whether in the Hamptons, in Ketchum, Idaho, or in Provincetown, Massachusetts — further shrink the pool of available workers, foreign or domestic.
In Maine, where the economy relies heavily on tourism and out-of-state visitors, workers on J-1 or H-2B visas generally make up about 10% to 14% of the seasonal workforce, said Greg Dugal, the director of government affairs at HospitalityMaine, a trade group.
But this year, the state will be lucky to receive half the usual number, Dugal said, adding that many who were approved for the summer arrived later than usual because of processing delays.
“The fact remains that we had a worker shortage prior to the pandemic,” he said, and “we have a worse worker shortage after the pandemic for the same reason and a lot of other reasons.”

Texto completo: - Martha Stewart, who turns 80 on August 3, is a beloved TV personality, businesswoman, and author.
- In college, she modeled to pay her tuition, and her clients ranged from Unilever to Chanel.
- She was convicted for three felony charges in 2004 and has spoken about her time in prison.
- Visit Insider's homepage for more stories.
She was born Martha Kostyra - Stewart is her married name.
She married Andrew Stewart, a Yale Law School student, in 1961, before graduating from college. They divorced in 1990.
"I had to sacrifice a marriage because of the lure of the great job, the fabulous workplace," Stewart told CNN in 2017. "But, I don't regret it at all, because what I've done is something bigger and better than just one marriage."
She's the second of six children.
All four of her grandparents were immigrants from Poland.
She started working as a model at age 13 and continued throughout college to pay for tuition.
She worked with clients from Unilever to Chanel, and she said she could sometimes make up to $50 an hour through modeling — a pretty penny back in the '50s and '60s.
She babysat for a few legendary baseball players.
When Stewart was in high school, she babysat the children of Mickey Mantle and Yogi Berra.
She earned a bachelor's degree from Barnard College in art, European history, and architectural history.
Originally, Stewart studied chemistry in college but later switched.
Stewart has spoken about how her education gave her a leg up in becoming a household name.
"Having a formal education was extremely important when I was starting out," she said. "Even if one had no specific career path, a college degree and even a graduate degree in law, architecture, or business were acknowledged advantages."
She worked as a stockbroker for a boutique firm.
She worked on Wall Street until 1972.
"It was not until I left Wall Street that I discovered my true entrepreneurial bent. I loved ideas. I loved building. I loved creating," Stewart wrote in a post on her website. "I loved making things that would enhance everyday living. And I loved making money as a result."
Julia Child got her into cooking.
In 2013, Martha Stewart told Maclean's, "The original teacher for me was Julia Child. I got to meet her several times and work with her. She got me interested in haute cuisine. I cooked every single recipe in her two big volumes of 'Mastering the Art of French Cooking.'"
She dated Sir Anthony Hopkins for a while, but she broke up with him because she couldn't stop thinking of him as Hannibal Lecter.
She confirmed this to NPR in 2012, adding, "I went out to dinner with him and then I went back and I saw his piano. He plays a piano and he has a lovely house. And I wanted to invite him to my house in Maine. I have this big old house in Maine. And I kept thinking, I don't know if I can do that."
She has worked in almost every kind of media.
She's had a hand in television, magazines, books, radio, digital content, mass-market homeware production, food wares, real estate, and more.
She was America's first self-made female billionaire.
On the day her company, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, launched its initial public offering in 2000, the stock tripled in value before closing, and Martha Stewart not only became an instant billionaire but America's first self-made female billionaire.
At one point, she owned eight houses.
At the time, she had two Manhattan apartments, her Turkey Hill home in Westport, Connecticut, two houses in the Hamptons, a 153-acre farm in Bedford, New York, and the famous Maine estate, Skylands.
She was convicted of three felony charges in 2004 and spent five months in prison.
In 2004, Stewart was found guilty of one count of conspiracy, two counts of making false statements, and one count of obstruction of agency proceedings, and she spent five months in a minimum-security prison, followed by five months of home confinement.
The charges stemmed from an incident in December 2001: After receiving information that was not publicly available, she sold off her ImClone Systems shares a day before their value plunged, avoiding a loss of more than $45,000, according to the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Prosecutors said she later lied about receiving the tip-off, according to an Associated Press report.
Stewart has spoken openly about her time in prison, which she said involved a lot of cleaning, and the lasting impression she took away from prison life.
"I would rather be doing all of this in my own home, and not here -- away from family and friends," she wrote in a note on her website in 2004, according to CNN. "There is no real help, no real program to rehabilitate, no programs to educate, no way to be prepared for life 'out there' where each person will ultimately find herself, many with no skills and no preparation for living."
She once said she only sleeps four hours a night.
Stewart likes to stay up at night watching late-night TV programs, then still likes to get up early.
In addition, her work ethic keeps her going through all hours of the day. She told WebMD in 2008, "It's an exhausting lifestyle, and I always say sleep can go. It's not important to me right now."
She has several interesting eating habits, such as drinking buttermilk straight from the carton.
A few of Stewart's guilty pleasures include eating a slice of American cheese, pickled herring, and liverwurst.
Her favorite thing to cook is breakfast.
"I am a creative breakfast cook," she told the Food Network in 2018. "I have my own chickens and my own eggs. As a result, I try to use them in different creative ways – mostly on Sunday mornings when I invite my horseback-riding friends over for breakfast."
Stewart says her fridge is usually pretty "bare," but she does have a few necessities she likes to keep on hand.
Martha Stewart told Harper's Bazaar in 2021 that she always keeps "good Parmesan cheeses," organic milk, lots of butter, creme fraîche, and fresh eggs from her own chickens in her fridge.
She was named one of "America's Top 25 Most Influential People" and one of the "50 Most Beautiful People in the World" in the same year.
In 1996, Time magazine listed Martha Stewart as one of "America's Top 25 Most Influential People," and People magazine listed her as one of the "50 Most Beautiful People in the World."
By this time, she had released her first book and had her own TV show, "Martha Stewart Living."
Martha Stewart and Snoop Dogg have been friends for over a decade.
Stewart and Snoop Dogg met when he appeared on "The Martha Stewart Show" in 2008. Though the show ended its seven-year run in 2012, the pair remained connected over the years and even started their own cooking show, "Martha & Snoop's Potluck Dinner Party."
"I like his laid-back energy," Stewart said on the Today show in 2019. "I like his outspokenness. I like his sense of timing."
You can .
She loves Instagram.
"I'm a visual person and I like posting pictures," she told the Food Network.
Last year, Stewart gained attention online for a sultry selfie she posted to her Instagram page that some labeled as a "thirst trap."
"I took a pool selfie photo by mistake," she told People magazine in 2020. "I was trying to take a picture of the beautiful turquoise planter at the end of the pool, but the camera was on me, so I just snapped it. It looked so good, so I posted it."

Religious groups eye legal challenges to Delta variant restrictions and vaccine mandates

Texto completo: The spread of the Delta variant has rekindled a debate that raged in the Supreme Court last term as houses of worship charged that state Covid-related restrictions were violating their religious liberty rights.
By and large, the justices ruled against the states and set fresh precedent in a series of emergency orders issued without the benefit of regular briefs or oral arguments. Now, groups that won in the first round of lawsuits hope the stern warnings from the conservative majority last term will influence states as they consider new restrictions, including possible vaccine mandates.
"If any governments try to go down the path of closing worship again, this time around we have the benefit of the Supreme Court's numerous rulings making clear that worship is not just important, but essential," Eric Rassbach, vice president of the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, told CNN.
Jim Oleske, a professor at Lewis & Clark Law School, expects the courts to be busy.
"The Delta wave is likely to prompt a whole new round of litigation, with legal challenges being made to any new limitations on gatherings and any new requirements for masking or vaccination," Oleske said.
The Supreme Court set new boundaries last term, voting, for example, 5-4 in one case in April to block California's restrictions on at-home gatherings. The restriction had been challenged by a pastor and his wife seeking to host at-home Bible study. The court adopted what legal experts refer to as "most favored nation" status. Simplified, that means that if the government makes an exemption for anyone, it has to make an exemption for the religious plaintiff.
The issue of vaccine mandates, however, is not as simple. Groups fought for houses of worship to get exemptions from Covid restrictions they believed were available to secular entities, but they may see vaccine mandates in a different light, given that vaccine requirements likely include accommodations for religious believers, and that the government could have a more compelling reason for its actions.
"One important question is whether the court will be as solicitous of religious objections in the vaccination context as it was when dealing with Covid rules that had the effect of limiting the size of gatherings for religious worship," Okeske said.
One petition concerning the potential of Delta variant restrictions has made it to the high court. Calvary Chapel in Bangor, Maine, represented by Mathew Staver, chairman of the Liberty Counsel, sought to block the state from enforcing or reinstating any restrictions that it says would violate its religious liberty rights under the Constitution. Staver acknowledges that Maine lifted restrictions in May but fears it may reinstate them with the rise of the Delta variant.
"The Delta variant increases the urgency for the Supreme Court to permanently quarantine governors from imposing discriminatory restrictions on churches and places," Staver said in an interview. "The Constitution cannot be suspended by Covid-19 or any of its variants."
Justice Stephen Breyer rejected the petition on Monday.
Vaccine mandate questions
Vaccine requirements raise different legal questions and are less worrisome to some groups concerned with religious freedom because there is often the opportunity to get an exemption based on religious beliefs.
Back in 1905, the Supreme Court upheld a state vaccine mandate in Jacobson v. Massachusetts in a case concerning an outbreak of smallpox.
Now as the Biden administration unveils new requirements falling short of a mandate, legal experts say that private or public employers can make vaccine demands, although they must abide by anti-discrimination laws.
"Nothing in federal law prohibits an employer from requiring vaccines so long as they provide accommodations to people with disabilities and those with sincerely held religious beliefs," said
Sharon Perley Masling, the director of workplace culture consulting at Morgan Lewis.
"Legally it appears that it will be difficult for a vaccine mandate challenge to succeed in federal court," she said.
In guidance titled "What you should know about Covid-19," the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, an independent agency that enforces workplace anti-discrimination laws, said that federal laws "do not prevent an employer from requiring all employees physically entering the workplace to be vaccinated subject to reasonable accommodation provisions of Title VII and the Americans with Disability Act."
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination based on race, color, national origin, religion and sex. According to the EEOC guidance, Title VII requires an employer to "provide reasonable accommodations because of a disability or a sincerely held religious belief, practice or observance."
The guidance explains that a "reasonable accommodation" that "does not pose an undue hardship on the operation of the employer's business" might include allowing an unvaccinated employee to enter the workplace to wear a mask, work at a social distance from co-workers ,work a modified shift, get periodic tests for Covid, be given the opportunity to telework, or accept reassignment.
There have already there have been some challenges to the fact that the vaccines have yet to be fully approved by the Food and Drug Administration but were instead authorized under the FDA's emergency authority. The Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel issued legal guidance last month holding that federal food and drug law "does not prohibit public or private entities from imposing vaccinations requirements, even when the only vaccines available are those authorized under EUA [emergency use authorization]."
It stressed, however, that it's opinion only addressed food and drug laws, and left open the possibility that other "federal, state, or local laws or regulations" might "restrict the ability of public or private entities to adopt particular vaccine policies." That is likely the reason that President Joe Biden has steered carefully around the issue of national mandates.
In a case out of Texas, a federal judge dismissed a challenge brought by employees that objected to vaccine requirements put forward by Houston Methodist Hospital. Critically, the hospital permits religious exemptions pursuant to Title VII.
US District Judge Lynn Hughes rejected the challengers' allegations that the vaccine is "experimental and dangerous" and cited the EEOC guidance in his opinion.
Jared Woodfill, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said he is already preparing an appeal.
Staver is looking carefully at vaccine mandates, particularly because the Department of Veterans Affairs is the first agency to require its workers including doctors, dentists, registered nurses and physician assistants to get vaccines.
Staver, has misgivings about such requirements. "No one should be forced to inject a drug into their body, especially one that is not fully approved by the FDA," Staver said. He said his group has been working successfully to obtain religious accommodations for some who object to the Covid shot. "At the same time, we are preparing litigation to stop mandatory shots."
"As with the church litigation, we will work to expedite any of our legal challenges to the Supreme Court," Staver said.
Vatican letter
But other groups haven't followed suit -- with some expressing approval for vaccine requirements.
Back in December, the Vatican gave the green light to vaccines after some groups that oppose abortion raised concerns about whether the vaccines were made using cells from aborted fetuses. The cells are actually engineered and grown in labs from tissue acquired many decades ago, and are not made directly from aborted fetuses.
The Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith said in a note approved by Pope Francis that receiving the shot was morally permitted.
"It is morally acceptable to receive Covid-19 vaccines that have used cell lines from aborted fetuses in their research and production process," the note said.

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
WASHINGTON — Congress is running a serious trust deficit.
While a bipartisan group of centrist senators was able to strike a rare accord on infrastructure, the continuing struggle to hash out and advance the legislation exposed a broader problem that has hindered lawmakers in recent years: a nagging suspicion that their colleagues were not acting in good faith.
Each side harbors deep doubts about the true motives of the other, making it increasingly difficult for lawmakers to take the leap and get behind big bills as they warily eye one another across the aisle.
On Friday, the infrastructure measure was briefly hung up again as Republicans suspected that Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., the majority leader, was trying to trick them into accepting a Democratic measure instead of the bipartisan deal. Schumer’s office said that he was making no such move, and that it would make no sense for him to backtrack on his promise to bring the compromise bill to the floor. The misunderstanding passed, but it was another indicator of the degree of mistrust on Capitol Hill.
Democrats are leery of Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader who has bedeviled and thwarted them for years. Liberal Democrats are suspicious that their more moderate colleagues will give too much ground in their zeal to notch a bipartisan achievement. And conservative Republicans worry that their own centrists will do the same, a concern stoked by Donald Trump’s attacks on the infrastructure bill as a Democratic Trojan horse devised to dupe Republicans into a politically fatal move.
Then there is the House, which does not trust the Senate, and vice versa. Everyone in Congress these days seems to believe everyone else is up to something. It is the legacy of the polarization and power plays that have robbed Congress of an essential ingredient to reaching big policy agreements.
“Trust is key, and there is almost none now,” said Tom Daschle, the former Democratic Senate leader from South Dakota who was able to work with his Republican counterpart, Trent Lott, despite their fundamental ideological differences. “Trust comes from personal relationships built over time.”
While members of the group of senators who developed the legislation with the White House say they have forged strong bonds that allow them to confidently deal with one another, suspicions about their agreement remain among their colleagues.
Many Democrats fear that Republicans, led by McConnell, are playing them, dragging out the infrastructure proceedings in hopes of watering down the package and complicating or killing Democratic efforts to pass a much larger $3.5 trillion budget measure stuffed with the party’s priorities. Their view is based on experiences from 2009 and 2010, when Republicans engaged in extended talks on health care, exacting concessions and taking up precious time, only to abandon the idea and leave Democrats on their own at a critical moment.
Republicans, on the other hand, worry that Schumer and most Democrats do not really want a bipartisan deal and would prefer to go it alone on their bigger, more progressive package. They believe Schumer is going through the motions to satisfy the bipartisan desires of President Joe Biden and a handful of Democratic senators to keep them on board for the bigger bill, but would not be unhappy if the infrastructure compromise collapsed so he could move on and still be able to say that he tried and failed to work with Republicans.
They hold this view even though Schumer has declared repeatedly that he is truly committed to delivering the bipartisan bill to Biden’s desk in tandem with the much larger Democratic package. The Republican unease was reflected in the position of several who refused to vote to open debate on the legislation until they could see the details in writing.
“When you are not relying on trust, you are relying on the printed word,” said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, one of those awaiting the fine print.
Members of both parties acknowledge senators are dealing with significant trust issues.
“There are Democrats who are saying Republicans are slow-walking the infrastructure deal, and there are Republicans who say Democrats are slow-walking this infrastructure deal,” said Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., who noted that he had been privately reassuring Republicans that both Biden and Schumer wanted the legislation. “The lack of trust from one caucus to another has made it harder to get this deal resolved.”
Multiple senators said the issue — like many in Congress — had grown out of the lack of personal connection between members of the two parties as Republicans and Democrats seldom interact as they did in the past.
Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, also points to the breakdown of the committee system, in which the leader of a panel would typically work closely with the senior member of the other party to develop legislation. Today, significant measures often emerge not from committee rooms but from leadership suites or “gangs” of negotiating lawmakers, as is the case with the infrastructure bill.
“When we had a strong committee system, you had strong relationships based on trust between the chairman and ranking member,” said Collins, one of the bipartisan infrastructure negotiators. “Now, because the committee structure and the power of the committees has lessened and more and more legislation is written either by groups like ours or in the leader’s office, it is harder to build those bonds of trust that allow you to get things done.”
The trust gap has only widened after the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol. Many Democrats believe Republicans were complicit, and some Republican lawmakers have subsequently sought to downplay the events of that day or blame the other party for them.
The recent deaths of three highly regarded former senators — Carl Levin, D-Mich., John Warner, R-Va., and Mike Enzi, R-Wyo. — have touched off memories about a time when lawmakers of different political parties were not always at one another’s throats.
“Carl was a senator’s senator,” Kent Conrad, a former Democratic senator from North Dakota, said of Levin, a longtime friend and colleague of his who died Thursday at 87. “He showed everyone, whether you agreed or disagreed with him, how you work across the aisle. You would just hope that kind of spirit would be reignited.”
Biden and the bipartisan group are promoting the infrastructure deal as proof that the Senate is still capable of such things. But it is also evidence of how hard reaching agreement can be, suggesting that making other deals will be very difficult.
The infrastructure bill is a sweeping public works and jobs bill with something for everyone, the type of pork barrel measure that used to be the bread and butter of Congress. Yet to get what should be very popular legislation to a debate on the Senate floor has taken the concerted backing of the White House, the cooperation of the Senate leadership and weeks and weeks of intense talks. The measure could still collapse at any moment — and that is before the House gets its hands on it.
Coons agreed that the trust level looked bad from the outside, but he said it was better than it seemed within the institution.
“There are relationships here that cross party lines, that are real and are positive and are meaningful and that are helping contribute to holding this place together,” he said. “There are more than you think, but not as many as there should be.”
Others are not sure whether to trust that assessment.
“Time was, serious discussions were carried out in good faith by legislators who believed trust was the coin of the realm,” said Bob Stevenson, a former longtime Republican Senate leadership aide. “But given the political toxicity of the modern era, that coin’s not worth much anymore.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Texto completo: If you’re willing to splurge, a lobster roll is a luxurious taste of summer at its simplest.
What to Cook This Week
Good morning. I was in Maine earlier this week, talking food journalism with Ruth Reichl at the Summer Institute of the College of the Atlantic on Mount Desert Island, and if talking with Ruth was a dream — in person! Not on a screen! — it was also exhilarating to be out of my bedroom office, taking in the landscape of beautiful places far from home. Plus, the food was sublime: corn salad and lamb chops one night from the Peggy Rockefeller Farms in Bar Harbor; a stuffed lobster roll from Beal’s in Southwest Harbor the following day; an ace banh mi from Saigon Sandwich House in Lowell, Mass., while on the road.
That lobster roll in particular was something I think we could all bring into our lives, at least if you can lay your hands on the sea bugs and don’t mind steaming them: a lot of shelled meat tossed lightly in butter and folded into a toasted, buttered hot dog bun. (Try that with crab if you can’t get the lobster, or with fresh shrimp just barely cooked through.) It’s a luxurious taste of summer at its simplest. Our Jason Epstein has a slightly more involved recipe (above), if you want a little celery and mayonnaise in there. (Some corn on the cob to go with it? That’s fine.)
Oh, I get it. Lobster’s expensive. So’s a ribeye steak. So is wild salmon and saffron and chickens that range free on organic feed. But for the moment there’s a lot of lobster available, at least in the Eastern United States, and if you plan your week right with frugality on other days to offset the splurge, a dinner of lobster can be a lovely way to celebrate the now. (Here are 15 other recipes for them.)
So lobster rolls tonight? That’s decided? Hope so. If I haven’t convinced you, here’s an inexpensive and awesome dinner of savory oatmeal with greens and yogurt.
On Monday, you might shift into this asparagus, goat cheese and tarragon tart, or these chile-oil noodles with cilantro.
And for Tuesday night, a tofu scramble, versatile and easily made.
Chicken under a brick for Wednesday evening? It’s one of the great weeknight feeds. (I actually put a plate over the chicken and my brick on top of that. It leads to a kind of stovetop steam-roasting situation that results in fantastic skin.) It’s very good with rice, with egg noodles, with bread and a simple green salad.
On Thursday, I like the idea of these sesame salmon bowls. (“My partner said it’s the best thing I’ve ever cooked,” one of our subscribers wrote in a note below the recipe.)
And on Friday, you can run out the week with pasta with garlicky anchovies and broccoli rabe.
There are many thousands more recipes to cook this week waiting for you on New York Times Cooking. You do need a subscription to access them. We’ve talked about that a lot. Subscriptions support our work and allow it to continue. So if you don’t have one yet, I hope that you will subscribe today. (Follow us on YouTube and Instagram for free. And you can find our stories on Twitter.)
We’re here like rangers at the national parks if you run into trouble with your cooking or our technology. Just ask us for help: cookingcare@nytimes.com. Someone will get back to you.
Now, it’s a moon shot’s distance from poached eggs and fra diavolo, but it’s always good to watch professionals at work. Here’s Jason Aldean and Carrie Underwood teaming up: “If I Didn’t Love You.”
You should absolutely read Zach St. George in The New York Times Magazine, on Jeff Lowenfels, the longtime gardening columnist for The Anchorage Daily News (since 1976!). When Lowenfels started, he didn’t know what he’d be doing is documenting climate change.
Here’s Carl Phillips’s poem “Blue-winged Warbler,” in The Oxford American.
Finally, two great pieces in The Times about James Lapine’s new book, “Putting It Together: How Stephen Sondheim and I Created ‘Sunday in the Park With George.’” The first is Alan Cumming’s marvelous review. The second, Jesse Green’s unpacking of the story. Theater is magic. Theater journalism takes us up the sleeves of the magicians. I’ll be back on Monday.

Texto completo: Rain is a good thing for the drought-parched Southwest, but too much at one time is fueling worries about significant flooding beginning Friday through the weekend.
Eight states in the West have flash flood watches in effect through the weekend, where monsoon rains are expected to expand outward from the desert Southwest.
"Monsoonal moisture continues to bring much needed rainfall to the drought-stricken regions of the western U.S," the Weather Prediction Center (WPC) said.
"The broad area of monsoonal showers and thunderstorms is expected to show increasing focus across central Colorado as well as spreading further north into the northern Great Basin during the weekend, where the threat of heavy rainfall will increase,"
Up to an inch and a half of rainfall is possible in some areas of the Southwest on Friday and the WPC has issued a slight risk for excessive rainfall in Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, Nevada, California, and Arizona to account for the potential for heavy rain.
Potential drought improvement
California is in desperate need of restorative rainfall this summer. The latest drought monitor indicated that 50% of the state is enveloped in exceptional (the highest level) drought conditions. At the start of 2021, only 1 percent of California was in exceptional drought.
Monsoon rains this weekend will make their way into California on the east side of the Sierras near the Nevada border, with up to an inch and a half of rain expected. The potential for heavy rain also carries a flash flooding threat.
"Another round of high monsoonal moisture is expected through the weekend that will lead to an increased risk for flash flooding across much of the region. Isolated to scattered thunderstorms capable of very high rainfall rates will be possible each afternoon Friday and Saturday and could linger into the overnight hours as well," according to the National Weather Service's office in Las Vegas.
Monsoon rains have been both a blessing and a curse for the desert Southwest the past few weeks. They have improved Arizona's drought conditions significantly but also causing harrowing scenes of flooding in areas with burn scars, which are areas of charred land left behind after wildfires have moved through. The burnt soil doesn't absorb rainfall well, exacerbating flash flooding.
"In Arizona, Tucson received more rain in 6 days (4.20 inches fell from July 20-25) than during all of 2020, when annual precipitation of 4.17 inches was the lowest on record," the US Drought Monitor said.
Prior to the rainfall, half of the state was in the worst level of drought conditions. After last week, the exceptional drought significantly improved, along with the extreme (second highest) drought levels.
"In addition to Arizona, improvement was noted in parts of New Mexico, southwestern Colorado and southern portions of Utah and Nevada," CNN Meteorologist Brandon Miller said.
This weekend's round of monsoon moisture could help to further improve some of the drought conditions in the region. The heaviest rainfall on Friday is expected in one of Wyoming's worst drought regions.
By Saturday, the moisture surges into the Great Basin bringing excessive rainfall to Oregon and Idaho. Along the Rockies, up to three inches of rain could fall.
Boise, Idaho has been a bulls eye for the Pacific Northwest heatwaves this summer and seen little moisture over the past month.
Since the beginning of July, the city has only recorded 0.08 inches of rainfall, 0.12 less than the average. This weekend Boise could see up to an inch and a half of rainfall by Sunday.
Arizona is also expected to see even more rainfall this weekend, and more flooding.
Flash flood dangers
While the regions getting rainfall are desperate for the reprieve, recent and previous large wildfires have left behind burn scars in much of the West. The Great Basin has been ravaged by wildfires this summer while overwhelmed by drought and heat.
Flash flooding becomes significant in burn scar areas due to the hydrophobic (water resistant) nature of the soil left behind, scorched by the flames. Runoff quickly develops and can become a dangerous situation.
"Burn scars will be particularly susceptible to heavy rainfall, leading to quick runoff and possible debris and mud flows," said NWS Denver.
Flash flooding in Tuscon this week saw washes overrun with wildfire burn scar debris and rushing water.
"People near slot canyons, swimming holes and recent wildfire scars should be prepared for rapidly changing conditions," warned NWS Flagstaff.
Burn scars across the West could be at risk this week due to the potential for heavy rainfall.
The monsoons moisture will bring heavy rainfall to the region throughout the beginning of the week, calming down after Tuesday.

Key Republican senators said Wednesday that they had resolved the biggest sticking points to a final agreement with the White House and Democrats on a far-reaching infrastructure bill and planned to vote to allow the package to advance, paving the way for action on a crucial piece of President Joe Biden’s agenda.
“We now have an agreement on the major issues, and we’re prepared to move forward,” said Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio and a lead negotiator for his party in bipartisan talks on the infrastructure measure.
Touring a truck manufacturing plant in Pennsylvania, Biden was upbeat about the emerging deal, telling reporters, “I feel confident about it.”
The proposal was expected to fill in the details of an outline the group triumphantly announced at the White House in late June but has spent weeks haggling over as they toiled to translate it into legislative text while keeping their fragile coalition together.
While details were not immediately available, the bill under discussion would pump the largest infusion of federal money in more than a decade into the nation’s aging public works system. The resulting bill is expected to provide about $550 billion in new federal money for roads, bridges, rail, transit, water and other physical infrastructure programs, according to a Republican aide who disclosed details on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to do so.
Republicans blocked the Senate from moving ahead with the plan last week, saying that too many issues remained unresolved. Portman’s comments and those of other Republicans in the group, who spoke after meeting Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the minority leader, suggested that they had cleared away the biggest obstacles to a deal.
It remained unclear whether enough Republicans would join the five core negotiators in advancing the measure, although some GOP senators outside the group signaled they would be open to moving forward.
“It’s not perfect, but it’s, I think, in a good place,” said Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., who said he would vote in favor of taking it up.
Senate Democrats, including at least one key committee chair, said they planned to wait to review the plan before weighing in on it. They met at 1 p.m. at the Capitol to discuss it over lunch.
“We’re very excited to have a deal,” Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., a key negotiator, told reporters beforehand. “Everyone has been incredible and doing this work for many months.”
She said that she had spoken to Biden on Wednesday morning and added that lawmakers would release the text of their proposal later in the day.
Earlier Wednesday, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., the majority leader, had expressed optimism as well and said a test vote on the measure could come as early as Wednesday night.
If the compromise holds, Democrats would have to maneuver it through the evenly divided Senate over a Republican filibuster, which would require the support of all 50 Democrats and independents and at least 10 Republicans. That could take at least a week, particularly if Republicans opposed to it opt to slow the process. Should the measure clear the Senate, it would also have to pass the House, where some liberal Democrats have balked at the emerging details.
But the five Republicans who announced the breakthrough on major issues — Portman and Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Mitt Romney of Utah — urged their colleagues to support a measure they said would provide badly needed funding for infrastructure projects across the country.
“I am amazed that there are some who oppose this just because they think that if you ever get anything done, somehow it’s a sign of weakness,” Cassidy declared, describing the needs of his voters. “We’re not going to delay relieving their problem.”
Romney drew a distinction between the emerging agreement and a second, more expansive $3.5 trillion budget package that Democrats are preparing to push through both chambers unilaterally, over the objections of Republicans. Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California has said she will not take up the bipartisan infrastructure bill in the House until that second package — expected to pour billions into programs to address climate change, health care, child care and education — passes the Senate.
“I love this bill; the other I can’t stand,” Romney said, citing concerns about inflation. “I’m confident that we will be able to get it across the finish line.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

White House hasn't given up on imperiled ATF nominee

Texto completo: The White House and Democratic Senate leaders are trying to salvage President Joe Biden's pick to lead the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, but it's not clear whether enough senators will get behind a nominee who has faced intense opposition from gun rights activists.
The White House hasn't given up on David Chipman's nomination to lead the bureau, according to two senior administration officials. One source said the administration was still hoping Senate leaders would schedule a vote in order to put the members on record.
But Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has long been leery about holding votes on matters that won't get the support of all 50 of his members -- and a single Democratic defection would derail Chipman's nomination.
At issue are a handful of moderate members, in particular independent Sen. Angus King of Maine and Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who have yet to commit to supporting the nomination. All Republicans are expected to vote against Chipman, despite the nominee's previous efforts to get some moderate Republicans -- including Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska -- on board.
King and Manchin signaled earlier this month that they hadn't been sold on Chipman's nomination.
"The issue is whether he's the right guy for the job," King, who caucuses with Democrats, told CNN. "My question is whether he can be an effective director. I haven't decided yet."
When asked he'd back Chipman, Manchin said, "We're still working on it," adding that they had a "very candid conversation."
Chipman would be the first Senate-confirmed director of the agency since 2015 and just the second in its history. Biden nominated him to the role in April.
Chipman is a former career ATF employee, having worked for the agency for 25 years. He was also a gun control activist, working as a senior adviser to Everytown for Gun Safety and Giffords -- the organization started by former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, who was shot at an event in her Arizona district in 2011.
The National Rifle Association opposes Chipman's nomination, but he's garnered the endorsement of several law enforcement groups. Complicating the vote for Democrats is that Chipman has faced a series of tough blows from hunting and sportsman groups, like Ducks Unlimited, that have argued that his views on an assault weapons ban are too extreme for the job.
"This is the first time I have seen such a broad array of sporting groups, conservation groups like Ducks Unlimited come out in opposition to a nominee. That shows how divisive he is," said GOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine earlier this month. Collins was one of those GOP senators who decided against Chipman, a sign of stiffening Republican opposition.
The resistance to Chipman's appointment comes amid a rise in mass shootings in the US and as Democrats have been trying for months to craft gun control-related legislation that could overcome GOP pushback. The House approved two bills to expand background checks on firearm sales, including one to do so on private and commercial transactions, but they lack the support of moderate Senate Democrats like Manchin and Sen. Jon Tester of Montana.
Earlier this month, Chipman was taking part in private one-on-one meetings with reluctant senators to assure them he respects the Second Amendment, including planned meetings with Murkowski and King. A meeting with pro-gun groups in West Virginia and GOP Gov. Jim Justice at Manchin's request was also on the books.
Senate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin of Illinois, the majority whip, told CNN on Monday that they were still "working" the nomination in an attempt to secure the votes.
The White House said in a statement that it continues to support Chipman's nomination.
"David Chipman's 25 years of distinguished service as an ATF agent uniquely equips him to reinvigorate the Bureau's critical mission, including combatting gun trafficking and keeping firearms out of the hands of criminals. Confronting the epidemic of gun violence head-on is a cornerstone of the President's gun crime strategy, and he looks forward to the Senate quickly voting on Chipman's nomination as ATF Director," said White House spokesman Michael Gwin.

Montana issues air quality warning due to wildfire smoke

Texto completo: Smoke from the Western wildfires has prompted officials in Montana to issue air quality warnings in a dozen counties.
"Air quality across the state ranges from MODERATE to UNHEALTHY, with the worst air quality concentrations occurring in the southern half of the state, south of the I-90 corridor. Air quality has worsened this morning, and will likely continue to worsen through Tuesday," Montana Department of Environmental Quality announced in a news release.
The department issued an air quality alert for Beaverhead, Carbon, Gallatin, Lewis and Clark, Madison, Missoula, Park, Pondera, Powder River, Powell, Ravalli and Sweet Grass counties. The state has 56 counties.
The heat is also an issue for residents. About 1.1 million people are under excessive heat warnings in parts of Montana -- and Idaho, Oregon, and Wyoming -- but most warnings will end by Tuesday.
Firefighter found uninjured
A firefighter who was reported missing near Montana's border with Idaho has been found safe, authorities said.
The firefighter was working the Granite Pass Complex when he went missing on Sunday, a news release from the official information site for the fire said.
"The individual has been found, uninjured and safe. Thank you to all those who assisted and to our dedicated Search and Rescue Volunteers. We are thankful for the positive outcome!!" the Missoula County Sheriff's Office said in a message on Facebook.
The Granite Pass Complex is among several fire burning in the US, mostly in the West. At least 85 active large wildfires have charred 1.5 million acres, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. This year, 36,467 fires have burned a total of 2,770,454 acres across the United States, the NIFC said.
An ongoing drought coupled with high temperatures continues to fuel flames in much of the West, threatening homes, prompting evacuations and destroying structures.
More than 22,000 deployed to battle fires
More than 22,400 firefighters and other personnel have been deployed to battle the flames throughout the US, the NIFC said.
The Missoula County Sheriff's Office issued an evacuation warning from Martin Creek on Highway 12 to the Idaho border as wildfires continue to burn in the area.
"Residents and visitors in the area should stay vigilant of the current situation and be ready to immediately leave the area if an evacuation ORDER is issued. If you are traveling along Highway 12 please do not stop," the sheriff's office said last week.
The dangerous fire conditions have already injured five federal firefighters who were working in Montana last week.
The firefighters were injured in the Devils Creek Fire when "a sudden wind shift blew the wildfire back over their position as they were constructing a defensive fire line on the perimeter," a news release issued by the Bureau of Land Management said Friday.
"Numerous wind shifts and rapid rates of spread resulted in erratic fire behavior as thunderstorms and associated cells were passing over the area when the incident occurred," the release said.
The bureau said the firefighters were evacuated and medically evaluated to "determine the extent of their injuries" following the incident on July 22 in Garfield County. An update on their conditions was not available.
Three more wildfires -- the Trail Creek Fire, the Alder Fire and the Christensen Fire -- are burning in Montana near the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest, according the Forest Service Facebook page.
Beaverhead-Deerlodge is the largest of the national forests in Montana, covering 3.35 million acres within eight southwest Montana counties.
A hotshot crew has been deployed to the Trail Creek Fire to help prevent the fire from growing toward the east. The fire has grown to 31,124 acres since starting on July 8, the Inciweb incident map shows.
The fire worked its way up to the Continental Divide, with approximately 15 acres burning on the Idaho side.
Fire activity picked up at the Alder Fire on Sunday because of high winds and low humidity, growing to 8,347 acres with 10% containment, according to Inciweb.
The Christensen Fire continued to push east and has burned 4,070 acres, according to Inciweb.
Baby bear burned
A 6-month-old black bear cub with burned paws is recovering after being found by homeowners returning to their property in Markleeville, California.
The homeowners, the only residents allowed to return to their area, spotted the injured animal and called Lake Tahoe Wildlife Care, which sent a team to catch the 21-pound male cub.
"Fortunately, the team was able to locate the bear cub in total darkness," officials with the wildlife care team said in a news release. "However, even with his injuries the cub still tried to flee."
The baby bear had severe burns to his four paws and was treated with pain medications and fluids. His paws were treated with Manuka honey, according to the release.
The bear was named "Tamarack" for the wildfire from which he was rescued.
Severe fire conditions fueling Bootleg Fire
As of Monday, more than 541,000 acres have burned in Oregon due to seven large wildfires, with the Bootleg Fire -- the state's current largest wildfire -- accounting for 409,611 acres charred since it sparked July 6.
The flames are 53% contained, according to Inciweb.
The more than 2,000 firefighters battling the Bootleg Fire have seen success in the batle against the blaze, according to public information officer Al Nash.
"We're making good progress and feeling good about what we've accomplished, recognizing there's still a significant amount of open fire line," Nash told CNN. "We have potential for thunderstorms and the biggest issue is the gusty outflow winds from thunderstorms, which can increase the fire activity."
Gov. Kate Brown told CNN's Jake Tapper on Sunday she is worried high temperatures will continue to contribute to the spread of the Bootleg Fire.
"It's incredibly important with climate change, that we get into these forests and start doing the fitting and harvest and prescriptive burning, so that we can create healthier landscapes that are more resilient, for wildfire," Brown said.
She signed legislation last week that would arm the state with tools and resources to make communities "more adaptive" to wildfires. The legislation includes resources for adequate firefighting tools and prescriptive and mitigation efforts.
Dixie Fire exhibiting extreme fire behavior
In Northern California, there are more than 5,400 firefighting personnel battling the Dixie Fire, which has burned 197,487 acres and is 22% contained, according to Cal Fire. It is now the 15th largest wildfire in state history.
The smaller Fly Fire has merged with the Dixie Fire in the larger blaze's east zone.
"Engines are deployed in Taylorsville prepping for structure protection in the event the fire reaches the area as it continues moving northeast," Cal Fire officials said.
Plumas County Sheriff Todd Johns said Sunday that the Indian Falls area has undergone significant loss. In the small community, 18 of 25 homes are thought to have been lost, he said.
CNN's Stella Chan, Joe Sutton, Robert Shackelford, Hollie Silverman, Deanna Hackney, Jenn Selva, and Claudia Dominguez contributed to this report.

Texto completo: A man and woman were arrested in Maine following the discovery of cocaine disguised as a cake in their vehicle, according to the Maine Drug Enforcement Agency.
Acting on information received from anonymous sources, agents stopped a vehicle on Tuesday along I-295 as it entered Gardiner. A drug-sniffing K9 alerted them to the presence of illegal drugs in the vehicle, the MDEA said in a news release. Inside the trunk, they found four pounds of cocaine and about $1,900 in cash, believed to be proceeds from illegal drug sales, the agency added.
Some of the cocaine found in the vehicle was pressed into a block and wrapped in cake packaging, MDEA Commander Peter Arno told CNN. Coffee grounds were spread on top of the cocaine in an attempt to throw off the scent.
Arno said the cocaine likely entered the country wrapped in cake packaging, and that agents will check with other departments to see if similar seizures have been made in order to determine its source.
Agents believe the drugs were being transported to Main for distribution in Kennebec and Somerset Counties. It's total street value is estimated at $200,000.
The suspects were taken to Kennebec County Jail and charged with aggravated trafficking in a schedule W Drug, a Class "A" offense, the MDEA said. If convicted, they could face up to 20 years in prison, Arno said.
The Winslow Police Department, Maine State Police and Homeland Security Investigations assisted in the investigation, which the MDEA said is ongoing.

Texto completo: The largest wildfire in the United States approached 400,000 acres burned with containment at just 38%, officials said Thursday.
The Bootleg Fire has charred 399,359 acres in southern Oregon, including some land that is set aside for carbon offsets.
"The fire will continue to be extremely active with gusty winds and extremely dry fuels," says an update posted to InciWeb, the national clearinghouse for wildfire information.
Officials in recent days have touted progress against the massive fire, which was started July 6 by lightning.
"Fire crews and support personnel have made significant progress in containing this fire in the last few days," Joe Prummer of the Northwest Interagency Incident Management Team said. "However, we still have a long road ahead of us to ensure the safety of the surrounding communities."
How to support western wildfire victims
The blaze grew about 4,000 acres Thursday and officials said there was growth and activity in two areas but the advance was controlled with bulldozers.
It is now the third-largest fire in Oregon since 1900, Marcus Kauffman, spokesperson for Oregon Department of Forestry, told CNN's Poppy Harlow on Thursday.
More than 2,100 people under some form of evacuation due to the fire, according to Kauffman.
Record-breaking, triple-digit temperatures and severe drought have devastated parts of Oregon. Those conditions have been fueling the fire and forcing evacuations.
Doug Grafe, chief of fire protection at the Oregon Department of Forestry, this week predicted a "long, difficult fire season."
He said Tuesday -- when the fire had burned 388,000 acres -- it's possible that another 50,000 to 100,000 acres could burn before the Bootleg Fire is contained.
"The future for us for the remainder of the season continues to look above normal dry and above normal temperatures," Grafe said. "So this is not going to return to normal anytime soon."
A ban on campfires will be banned in state parks and state-managed forests east of Interstate 5 started Thursday, the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department said. That covers all regions of the state except the Pacific coast and a portion of the Willamette Valley.
The ban includes not only charcoal and propane fires, but also tiki torches and even candles.
People in other areas of US getting short break from thick smoke
There was a break Thursday in poor air quality stretching as far as the East Coast. A cold front helped pushed out smoke created by the US and Canadian fires.
But by Thursday night, smoke from wildfires could return, before another front will push through the region on Saturday into Sunday to help clean it out again, according to CNN meteorologist Michael Guy.
This will be the pattern until the jet stream changes direction and/or the fires have diminished, he said.
The intensity of the fires was so strong that high-level winds had carried their smoke to the East Coast, where New York City recorded its worst air quality day in over a decade.
The city saw a 24-hour average Air Quality Index of 154 on Tuesday, the worst it's been since June 2006, when the AQI was 157.
With 79 large fires burning across 13 states, more than 21,700 wildland firefighters are battling blazes across the country. The fires have collectively scorched at least 1.49 million acres as of Thursday, according to the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC).
And in Canada, a state of emergency was declared for British Columbia, where 3,180 firefighters are working on 300 fires across the province, officials said.
More fires ravage US lands
The NIFC says eight active large fires in California have already burned more than 230,000 acres and additional evacuations were issued Wednesday around the Dixie Fire in Butte and Plumas counties.
"Firefighters fought the fire aggressively. Firefighters continued construction on control lines and engaged in structure defense overnight. Fire is going to continue to move Northeast. Air and ground firefighting resources will work together to strengthen and improve control lines," according to a statement from InciWeb.
Montana currently has 17 large wildfires -- the most in the country -- that have charred almost 100,000 acres, and Idaho is seeing 16 active wildfires that burned 178,000 acres, according to NIFC.
Following Oregon, the states with the most acres burned are California, Idaho and then Alaska.
The Dixie Fire has scorched more than 103,000 acres since it began last week and was 17% contained as of Thursday, according to Cal Fire. Evacuations have been ordered in the area, and the fire already destroyed eight structures.
On Tuesday, Pacific Gas and Electric said the fire may have been sparked by equipment it manages.
In a preliminary filing with the California Public Utilities Commission, PG&E detailed an outage alert July 13, the same day the fire started. A responding utility worker found three blown fuses and a tree leaning into a pole, with a small fire on the ground near the base of the tree.
CNN's Joe Sutton, Chris Boyette and Andy Rose contributed to this report.

Among Latter-day Saint women, frank talk about sacred underclothes

Texto completo: Sasha Piton was on a hike near her home in Idaho Falls, Idaho, when she realized something was wrong. The trek was just a few miles, and not strenuous, but a rash was spreading along the crease above her thigh.
Piton quickly identified the cause. Like many members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, she wears a white two-piece set of sacred temple garments, which are functionally underwear, almost all of the time.
After another painful hike, Piton reluctantly stopped wearing the garments when exercising and occasionally removed them overnight. Both changes felt significant, since church members have historically been encouraged to wear the garments “night and day.” But they were simply too uncomfortable.
And she did not stop there. Last month, Piton posted several cheerfully direct pleas to Instagram, where she discusses church culture as @themormonhippie. “We really want buttery soft fabric,” she said, addressing her comments to the church’s 96-year-old president, Russell M. Nelson. “My vagina has to breathe.”
And Piton encouraged her 17,100 followers to email the church about their own experiences.
Piton, 33, had tapped into a familiar problem that few women in the church felt bold enough to discuss publicly. Her posts drew thousands of comments and private messages, in which women vented their frustrations with the holy apparel: itchy hems, bunchy seams, pinching waistbands and even chronic yeast infections caused by fabric that does not breathe.
“It’s sacred,” one commenter wrote. “But it’s still actual underwear.”
Temple garments date back to the church’s origins in the 19th century and symbolize the wearer’s commitment to the faith, akin to the religious garments of many other faith traditions. Adult Latter-day Saints wear them after their “temple endowment,” a private membership ritual that typically takes place before missionary service or marriage. The church controls the design and manufacturing process of the garments, and sells them globally at low prices.
Most active church members, including young people, take seriously the exhortation to wear them as often as possible. In a 2016 poll of 1,100 Latter-day Saints, just 14% of millennial church members said they believed it was acceptable to remove the garments if they were uncomfortable.
A spokesperson for the church declined an interview request and declined to answer a list of detailed questions, instead sending a link to a brief video about the garments produced by the church.
Most of the available temple garment fabrics are synthetic. “If you’re trying to optimize someone’s gynecologic health, it’s not recommended,” said Dr. Kellie Woodfield, an obstetrician-gynecologist in Utah who is a member of the church. The cotton option is more breathable, she said, but tight and significantly thicker.
Woodfield, who wore the garments for most of her adult life, said the conversation around garments was indicative of larger struggles over women’s issues in the male-led tradition. While women feel increasingly emboldened to speak up on social media, they often feel stymied by what they describe as a lack of transparency and empathy. “How the church responds to this movement is a really interesting litmus test for how much the church is starting to trust women,” Woodfield said.
In the church’s early years, men and women wore the same pattern, a design that was “revealed from heaven,” as an early 20th-century church leader wrote. But the church has since modified its designs several times, including shortening the sleeves and pant legs, and expanding the number of styles and fabric options. (In the 1950s, the church enlisted well-known swimsuit designer Rose Marie Reid for help.) One common option now consists of a T-shirt, with cap-sleeves for women, and knee-length shorts. Each piece is subtly marked with sacred symbols.
While they hope for further design improvements, church members share hacks to mitigate discomfort. Some people turn their garments inside out, to relieve pressure from biting seams. Some members have cut off itchy tags; others snip out the crotch fabric for breathability. And many women wear traditional panties under their garments during their periods, finding the bottoms incompatible with pads and panty liners.

In Idaho, Piton ticked off the items on her wish list in the recent Instagram video: “buttery soft, seamless, thick waistband that’s not cutting into my spleen, breathable fabric.”
Although she is having fun with her campaign, Piton is serious about why it matters to her. She converted to the faith a decade ago and was profoundly moved by the temple endowment ritual, which includes putting on the garments for the first time and receiving a blessing specifically for the body.
In that moment, “I just felt this divine connection to my body,” she said. “In a world where my entire life being a bigger woman, I’ve been told my body should look different,” receiving a blessing focused on her body’s strength and holiness was a moving experience.
Not everyone is attached to the idea of preserving the garments. Lindsay Perez, 24, who lives in Salt Lake City, used to experience persistent urinary tract infections that she believes were made worse by her garments. She now leaves them off at night and after she showers.
If she had her choice, she said, she would prefer to wear a cross necklace, or a ring — popular among young church members — with the letters CTR, a reference to the motto “Choose the Right,” a reminder to make ethical choices. “There are so many different ways to remind myself of what I’ve promised,” Perez said. “I don’t need that to be through my underwear.”
In private Facebook groups for women in the church, she said, garments are a constant topic of discussion, with some women hoping for improvements and others defending the garments as they are. But few women feel comfortable approaching male leaders to discuss bodily fluids, infections and sexual intimacy.
“People are scared to be brutally honest, to say: ‘This isn’t working for me. It isn’t bringing me closer to Christ, it’s giving me UTIs,’” Perez said.
Open discussion is also thorny because the garments are frequent targets of mockery from outsiders. When Mitt Romney, a church member, was running for president in 2012, he was derided by some mainstream commentators for wearing “magic underwear.”
That kind of ridicule is “acutely painful,” said Jana Riess, a senior columnist for Religion News Service who writes about the church and who conducted the 2016 poll with a colleague.
It is especially hurtful, because the garments symbolize a profound spiritual connection to God. “One of the most beautiful things about them is they are underwear,” Riess said. “It expresses my belief that there’s no part of my messy humanity that isn’t beloved of God.”
Riess celebrated when the church tweaked its undergarment designs in 2018, adding mesh side panels, and less constrictive underarms, for example. But she is not surprised that younger women are now asking for more. “Young people have been brought up with a lot of choice,” she said, “and it’s something they don’t check at the door when they come to church.”
The church’s official handbook includes only a few paragraphs about the garments. Many practices around them are passed down within families and circulated among friends. Some families throw garments in the washing machine with other laundry, for example, while others keep them separate.
Afton Southam Parker, a mother of five who was raised in the church, has lived in Uganda and Thailand, where the garments felt especially stifling in the heat. In furtive conversations with other women, she realized she was not alone. “Everybody I talked to was getting some kind of rash or infection,” she said.
The word she heard over and over from women was “suffocation.”
Parker made it her mission to get church leaders to produce garments that fit and felt better. She approached one church leader after a talk, and wrote to anyone she thought could help. When a church designer finally agreed to meet with her last year, she showed him 34 PowerPoint slides that explained the garments’ many problems for women.
The initial result was disheartening, although she was encouraged recently when the church’s design team asked her for more feedback. “You’re talking about pads and gore,” she recalled the man responding at first. The implication was that such earthy topics were inappropriate for discussions of sacred matters.
“It’s of a greater magnitude than the church has any idea about,” Parker said. “Either get into the underwear business or get out.”

WASHINGTON — Democrats are preparing to muscle through the nomination of Tracy Stone-Manning to head the Bureau of Land Management, despite united opposition from Republicans who have branded her an “eco-terrorist” because of her involvement in a tree-spiking episode as a graduate student in the 1980s.
The vote over her nomination, scheduled for Thursday in the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, sets up a battle between Republicans and Democrats over an agency at the center of climate policy.
The Bureau of Land Management is an agency within the Interior Department that oversees grazing, logging and drilling on 245 million acres of public land and manages 700 million acres of mineral rights. It is responsible for balancing oil, gas and coal extraction with recreation and the protection of natural resources. It also is key to President Joe Biden’s goal to phase out oil and gas drilling on federal lands — a plan that is being challenged by 15 states led by Republican attorneys general.
“The concerns that many folks have about Stone-Manning’s nomination is that she’s going to be more on the side of protecting public lands for public uses, and the folks who want public lands to be used for more development don’t like that,” said Mark Squillace, a professor of natural resources law at the University of Colorado Boulder.
“These other issues are being used as a way to block her confirmation,” he said. “I don’t think anybody really cares what she did 32 years ago.”
Stone-Manning, 55, has built a career in environmental policy, working as an aide to Sen. Jon Tester of Montana and as chief of staff to former Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana, both Democrats, as well as the head of Montana’s environment agency, where she gained a reputation as a bridge-builder among environmentalists, ranchers and fossil fuel interests. She is currently the senior adviser for conservation policy at the National Wildlife Federation, a nonprofit conservation group.
But Republicans argue that her actions in 1989, and her account of that episode in the intervening years, make her unfit for the post. They wrote to Biden asking him to withdraw her nomination and they plan to vote against her as a bloc in the committee.
Republicans also fought the choice of Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, the first Indigenous Cabinet secretary, because of her opposition to expanded oil and gas drilling on public lands. While Haaland narrowly won confirmation, that process morphed into a proxy fight over climate policy.
Conservatives were more successful in March in forcing the Biden administration to withdraw its pick for deputy interior secretary, Elizabeth Klein, after senators from coal and oil states objected to Klein’s belief that the nation needs to curb its use of fossil fuels.
“Oil and gas, coal, those industries are declining or facing serious declines,” said John Leshy, an emeritus law professor at the University of California Hastings.
He attributed that to market forces more than government policies, but said the Interior Department had become the place where the fiercest battles over the future of those industries are currently playing out.
“There’s a lot of frustration connected with that,” Leshy said. “And we’re at a moment when those frustrations have come to the fore.”
Stone-Manning has never been charged with a crime and did not participate in the effort three decades ago to drive 500 pounds of metal spikes into trees in the Clearwater National Forest in Idaho, federal crimes for which two men were later convicted.
Tree spiking is a tactic to try to prevent logging by inserting metal rods into trees that could damage the blade of a saw. It was used in the 1980s by activists who hoped to make it uneconomical to cut down trees but the practice was dangerous; spikes can injure or kill loggers.
Manning, then a 23-year old graduate student, retyped and mailed a profanity-laced letter to the U.S. Forest Service on behalf of one of the activists who spiked the trees. Stone-Manning has described her act as an effort to warn authorities and protect people from harm.
Republicans have accused Stone-Manning of lying to lawmakers about whether she had ever been a target of an investigation, an accusation the administration has denied.
The 10 Republicans and 10 Democrats on the Senate Environment and Natural Resources Committee are expected to split evenly along party lines. That would force Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the majority leader, to discharge the nomination, a seldom used move that would bring it before the full Senate for a vote. If the Senate also divides along party lines, Democrats would need Vice President Harris to break the tie.
The White House issued a statement this week in support of Stone-Manning.
“Tracy Stone-Manning is a dedicated public servant who has years of experience and a proven track record of finding solutions and common ground when it comes to our public lands and waters,” said Vedant Patel, a White House spokesman. “She is exceptionally qualified to be the next director of the Bureau of Land Management.”
Republicans say that new statements from figures involved in the spiking episode indicate that Stone-Manning was more involved than she claimed to have been.
“We now know that President Biden’s nominee to run the Bureau of Land Management lied to the Senate about her alleged participation in eco-terrorism,” Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, said in a statement. “The White House should immediately withdraw her nomination.”
Tester said the accusations against Stone-Manning “smack of political smear.”
“The Tracy Stone-Manning I know is someone who spent the last 20-years-plus bringing people together from both sides of the aisle from all components of industry,” he said.
According to court documents, in the spring of 1989 when Stone-Manning was an environmental studies graduate student at the University of Montana in Missoula, activists with Earth First!, including John Blount and Jeffrey Fairchild, drove hundreds of pounds of nails into old-growth trees in the Idaho forest in an attempt to stop a timber sale.
Afterward, Stone-Manning testified, Blount asked her to mail a letter he gave her warning the Forest Service, which she did after retyping it. She later told prosecutors that was the first time she learned about the tree spiking and she was “shocked” by it.
In 1993, Stone-Manning testified against Fairchild and Blount in exchange for immunity.
Last week, Michael Merkley, a retired U.S. Forest Service investigator who was the special agent in charge of the case, wrote to Senate lawmakers and said that when the government initially investigated the tree-spiking crime Stone-Manning was unhelpful and combative. He also said that she received a “target letter” indicating she would be indicted in connection with her participation.
“Ms. Stone-Manning came forward only after her attorney struck the immunity deal and not before she was caught,” Merkley said.
Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, the top Republican on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, cites that and an interview that Stone-Manning gave in 1990 as evidence that she lied in response to written questions from the committee asking if she had ever been the target of a criminal investigation.
“She’s an eco-terrorist,” Barrasso said in an interview, adding, “She’s lied to the committee, misled the committee in terms of her past behavior and investigations.”
Kathleen Sgamma, president of the Western Energy Alliance, which represents oil and gas companies, said opposition to Stone-Manning is based on her behavior in 1989, not her opposition to expanding fossil fuel drilling on public lands. “It’s not like we’re going to get someone from industry if we get rid of Tracy Stone-Manning,” Sgamma said. “This is about her judgment.”
Fairchild, who spent time in prison for his role in the tree-spiking incident, defended Stone-Manning when reached by telephone.
“Having been one of the main participants in that event and one of the main planners, to the best of my recollection she knew nothing about it beforehand,” Fairchild said, adding that Stone-Manning was known for opposing violence.
“Tracy was always a moderating voice,” he said. “We were talking about ending the logging of old growth forests, and she was the first one to say ‘Yeah but loggers have families, too.’”
Tester said he also was not worried about the allegations. “We have the votes to get her confirmed,” he said. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Texto completo: Monsoon season is in full swing in the West with no end in sight, bringing hopes of a dent in the unrelenting historic drought -- but with thunderstorms comes lightning and the potential for more wildfires.
After enduring heat waves and years of minimal monsoonal moisture, the desert Southwest is seemingly back on track with an already above-average monsoon season.
The region expects to see temperatures below average all week due to the rainfall, bringing a welcome relief after extreme heat early in the summer.
"The unsettled regime will keep highs up to 5 to 10 degrees or so below normal over the southwestern US," said the Weather Prediction Center (WPC).
Cooler temperatures and widespread rainfall could help satiate the parched soil, and the WPC expects improvements to the drought as a result.
Southwest monsoon rains continue
Monsoon thunderstorms this week are expected to continue to bring life-giving rains to the region. Monday and Tuesday rain showers and strong thunderstorms will range from Arizona through the Great Basin.
"Isolated to scattered thunderstorms will again develop over the higher terrain around noon before drifting into the valleys later in the afternoon through the evening," said the National Weather Service (NWS) in Las Vegas.
The main threats associated with the strongest storms will be heavy downpours causing flash flooding and strong wind gusts of up to 50 miles per hour that could produce blowing dust.
As the week progresses, the monsoonal moisture will be centralized over the Four Corners, spreading slightly northward into parts of Wyoming at the end of the week.
Thursday and Friday see rain totals ramping up, with up to an inch and a half of rainfall per day in some areas. Heavy rain becomes more widespread into Thursday and Friday, when Utah, western Colorado, and western New Mexico will experience slightly higher rain totals than at the beginning of the week.
"The Southwest Monsoon should remain quite active for the foreseeable future and bring much-needed rainfall to this section of the country. However, the potential for flash flooding will also continue for isolated locations throughout the Southwest and central Great Basin, especially over burn scars," the WPC said.
The brunt of the rainfall is forecast to impact Arizona, an area in dire need of substantial relief from decades of drought. Up to 5 inches of rain could fall in parts of the state over the week, with locally higher totals where stronger storms pass over.
"More scattered to possibly widespread storms are expected for the second half of the week as a more organized weather system may affect the region. Storms will be capable of producing both locally heavy rain, strong winds, and blowing dust," the NWS in Phoenix said.
Flash flood watches have been issued across four states in the Southwest, including California, Nevada, Utah and Arizona, in effect through Monday afternoon and evening due to the potential for flash flooding in areas that see localized heavy rainfall.
Last week, flash flooding became a major issue in Arizona and Utah, leading to scenes of cars sweeping down neighborhood roads on feet of rushing water and train derailments resulting in injury.
Burn scars from wildfires in the region are the greatest areas of concern for flash flooding -- after a fire incinerates a swath of land, the ground left behind is hydrophobic, acting more like concrete than a sponge. Rainwater then easily flows off the burnt soil, sometimes drastically, causing flash flooding events.
The rain brought by monsoon season is a sigh of relief, but lightning from the stronger thunderstorms could cause more harm than good, producing more fires and leaving behind more burn scars.
More lightning could mean more wildfires
Statistics from the National Interagency Fire Center show that on average from 2008-2012, 12% of wildfires were ignited by a lightning strike while most were human-caused, but fires started by lightning burned nine times more acres on average than human-caused fires.
Four large fires are currently burning in Arizona, and the dry vegetation from the drought could cause concern with any lightning produced from monsoon thunderstorms. Luckily, most of the storms will contain plenty of rainfall and moisture, the biggest threat being flash flooding.
"Scattered to widespread wet thunderstorms are expected to continue across the Southwest, southern Great Basin, and southern Colorado," the National interagency Fire Center said.
This monsoon season has been more active than the seasons in 2019 and 2020, but the NWS in Phoenix points out that there have been a below-average number of lightning strikes compared to the average since 1990 -- a good thing for the extremely active fire season.
A different story could play out this week in the Great Basin and Northwest, where dry thunderstorms are expected to cause wildfire concerns Monday and Tuesday.
"Though high-based, these storms are expected to produce predominantly wet strikes. Nonetheless, fuels are critically/record dry across much of the Northwest. Efficient lightning-induced ignitions are possible with drier strikes on the periphery of storm cores, warranting the maintenance of broad isolated dry thunderstorm highlight," said the Storm Prediction Center.
Northern California and southern Oregon will see elevated fire weather conditions on Monday due to the potential for dry thunderstorms in an area that is already devastated by the country's largest wildfire.
The Bootleg Fire, located near the border of California and Oregon, has seared more than 300,000 acres of forest. Fire officials have said that it might take a significant weather event to put it out.
"We are experiencing extremely dry conditions with record to near-record temperatures. Conditions on the ground due in part to the historic drought have accelerated the fire season. The combination of the weather and fuel conditions have led to the rapid growth of the fire," Fire spokesperson Katy O'Hara told CNN.
"The scope and scale of the Bootleg Fire will require a season-ending weather event such as a significant storm that is either widespread wetting rain or snow, which in southern Oregon typically occurs in the late fall," O'Hara said.
This week, conditions are not looking favorable to help with firefighting efforts, and lightning initiations from dry thunderstorms could make matters worse.
"Isolated dry thunderstorms may also form in northern Idaho and western Montana with very hot, dry, and unstable conditions across the inland Pacific Northwest, Northern Rockies and Plains into northern Minnesota, and northern Great Basin," said the NIFC.
The SPC has highlighted critical fire danger in eastern Montana as winds pick up during a record heat event. Montana currently has 14 large wildfires burning, the most in the country just above Idaho with 13.
"During the afternoon, 20 mph sustained southeasterly surface winds will likely overlap with 15-20% relative humidity for at least a few hours. While the winds are somewhat marginal for Critical highlights, a Critical area has been maintained for portions of eastern Montana into far northeast Wyoming given the presence of Critically/record dry fuels," the SPC said.
Over 3 million people are included in red flag warnings across the Northwest and Northern Great Plains on Monday as fire danger runs high. Nearly the entire states of Idaho and Montana are in red flag warnings, and excessive heat warnings encompass all of eastern Montana where temperatures are climbing into the triple digits once again to start the week.
Overall, the 2021 US wildfire season has crushed the record-breaking 2020 season, with over 2.5 million acres (about the area of Connecticut) burned compared to 1.8 million acres this time last year.

Texto completo: Bekah King, Abi Roberts, and Morgan Tabor have a lot in common. They describe themselves as free spirited adventurers and fearless risk takers, all obsessed with music and the movie "Megamind."
They say they also unknowingly had the same boyfriend at the same time.
Following their discovery, rather than succumbing to their sadness the three young women said they dumped him, saved up money, purchased a school bus and spent over two months renovating it.
On June 25, the trio took their 30-year-old bus -- which they renamed the BAM bus after their initials -- on a road trip across the Western United States and into the next chapter of their lives.
The discovery that changed everything
The three young women made the heartbreaking discovery on a cold, snowy afternoon in December 2020, when Tabor, 21, suddenly felt waves of suspicion about her boyfriend.
After deep diving into his social media, she discovered another woman's page on VSCO, a photography app, flooded with photos of her and Tabor's boyfriend.
"I have no words to describe the feeling I got seeing the photo of him with another girl," Tabor, who lives in Boise, Idaho, told CNN. "I thought I was going to marry this guy. We had talked about houses and what our marriage would be like. My world came crumbling down. I had to mourn the loss of this future we were building up together. It was soul crushing."
She reached out to the woman -- who is now best friends with Tabor, Roberts and King but couldn't join them on the road trip -- and they kept digging. Eventually, they found Roberts via his social media comments and likes.
They quickly reached out to her and realized he was her boyfriend, too.
"I was crushed," Roberts, 19, told CNN. "I cried in front of these two girls I never met before. It was really emotional. It felt like there was no light at the end of the tunnel."
The three of them ended up on a six-hour FaceTime call, in the middle of which Tabor heard a knock on her door. She looked outside and saw their cheating boyfriend standing at her door with flowers.
"He wanted to surprised her. Morgan grabs the flowers, puts them on the floor, and was like 'I made some new friends today' and showed him her phone with the two of us on FaceTime," Roberts, who lives in lives in Salt Lake City, Utah, said. "His face just dropped. It was so priceless to see."
After offering excuses and explanations -- including one where he said he believed it was OK to be with multiple women at the same time -- the girls dumped him. Together.
Following the confrontation, the young women continued their search through his social media account, where they discovered their now ex-boyfriend had been dating six women in total, including them.
One of those women was Bekah King, who also lives in Boise, and had been casually dating him for five months.
"Two hours after they confronted him and he promised to never talk to another woman again and said he was a changed man, he reached out to me and asked to hang out," King, 18, told CNN. "The next day, the girls found my Instagram and messaged me and we immediately hopped another five hour call."
Within days, heartbreak turned into healing as King, Roberts, and Tabor girls quickly became friends. It didn't take long for them to realize they all had the same dream: buying a bus and exploring the country.
"The ball started rolling from there. We wanted to live out this dream found our group of adventure people?" Tabor said. "Having that from the beginning, just something we could look forward to, helped so much. We were living out our dream. It was something so needed during a really hard time."
Moving on to 'the next chapter' of their lives
In March, the girls found the vehicle of their dreams -- a green school bus that once belonged to a fire crew.
That BAM bus, as they called it, took months of renovations -- they put down floor boards, repainted the outside, built bunk beds and a roof deck and put in insulation.
The trio saved up around $5,000 altogether to purchase and renovate the bus, which was finally ready to hit the road on June 25.
Before heading out, the girls made sure they felt mentally prepared and healed after the ordeal they had gone through together.
"We don't talk about him anymore. He isn't part of our lives. There's so much more to look forward to," Tabor said. "He's on the way back corner of our minds. We have moved on to the next chapter of our lives. It's all about our adventure, our growth, and where we go next."
Their road trip started in Idaho. They then made way their way east, spending time soaking in hot springs, taking dips in lakes and visiting Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming. They also stopped Yellowstone National Park on their way to Montana, where they are currently camping in Bozeman.
"If I had a word to describe this whole experience, it would be surreal," Roberts said. "From the moment we pulled out of the driveway in Boise, we have met so many incredible people at campgrounds, on hikes, through our Instagram. We learned so much from so many inspiring people and the amazing nature we have been able to spent time in. It's absolutely surreal."
The three work remotely to fund their trip on their own without help from their parents or anyone else, but often receive Venmo donations from kind strangers.
While they had intended to head back home in November, the three are considering extending the trip and finding ways to make it a sustainable, long-term situation.
"This guy doesn't deserve any credit, but thank you for bringing us together, honestly," Roberts said. "We've been saying 'F you, but thank you.' As awful and horrible as that moment was, we would all do it again just to meet each other."

Texto completo: There are currently 80 large wildfires raging in 13 states across the US, burning more than 1 million acres, mostly in western states, according to the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC).
Montana has reported the most large wildfires with 18, and Idaho is close behind with 17, the NIFC said. In addition to wildfires, parts of Idaho and Montana are also seeing a heatwave that has brought above-average temperatures, according to the National Weather Service (NWS).
NWS tweeted a map Sunday showing triple-digit temperatures in the region.
"These hot temperatures will significantly increase the potential for heat related illnesses, particularly for those working or participating in outdoor activities. Car interiors will reach lethal temperatures in a matter of minutes," NWS Great Falls tweeted.
High temperatures are expected to reach 103 degrees in Montana and 102 degrees in parts of Idaho. The NWS has issued an excessive heat warning for eastern Montana and a heat advisory for the state's central region.
A heat advisory has also been issued for southeastern Idaho. A red flag warning is in effect for southwestern Idaho and eastern Oregon, which means "critical fire weather conditions are either occurring now, or will shortly," according to the NWS.
Those conditions are contributing to the Bootleg Fire burning in the Fremont-Winema National Forest along the Oregon and California border. It has grown to 298,662 acres as of Sunday afternoon, according to data from InciWeb, the US clearinghouse for wildfire information. The fire has burned the most acres of all the active wildfires, according to CNN Meteorologist Gene Norman.
The Bootleg Fire, which began July 6, is now 22% contained and has destroyed at least 75 structures, including 21 homes, and threatens an additional 5,072 homes, according to Marcus Kaufman, Bootleg Fire spokesperson.
Near the California-Nevada border, the Tamarack Fire has grown to 18,299 acres as of Sunday and is 0% contained, according to information from InciWeb.
The fire was sparked by lightning near the Alpine County, California, community of Markleeville on July 4, and has triggered mandatory evacuations for a number of campgrounds and neighborhoods in the area.
The fire has also burned at least three structures and jumped Highway 89 at one point on Saturday, according to InciWeb.
The fire danger will persist across the western US Monday, Norman said, as a combination of dry thunderstorms and excessive heat.

Texto completo: Dry thunderstorms on Saturday will raise the risk of sparking new wildfires in the Western US, where numerous blazes have already scorched hundreds of thousands of acres.
Red-flag warnings were posted for Idaho, Oregon and a small portion of Northern California, CNN meteorologist Robert Shackelford said. And heat advisories and heat warnings were in effect for parts of Montana and Idaho, with some areas seeing temperatures as high as 106 degrees.
As of Saturday, 70 large fires in 11 states -- most of them in the West -- had burned more than a million acres across the United States, according to the National Interagency Fire Center.
With 379,130 acres burned, Oregon has seen the most land charred by far, thanks in large part to the Bootleg Fire in southern Oregon. It's the largest wildfire in the United States this year, having scorched 281,208 acres as of Saturday morning, per InciWeb, the US clearinghouse for wildfire information.
The blaze, which began July 6 in the Fremont-Winema National Forest and on private lands near the town of Sprague River, is spreading at an average rate of 1,000 acres per hour, per Shackelford -- equal to a football field every 5 seconds -- and is 22% contained. More than 2,100 personnel are battling the fire.
Evacuations have been ordered for communities in the area, while others have been told to be prepared to leave at a moment's notice.
Approximately 2,000 people have been evacuated so far, according to a spokesperson for the agencies fighting the blaze, which is threatening more than 5,000 homes. The spokesperson told CNN the Bootleg Fire has already destroyed at least 75 structures, including 21 homes.
"This fire is large and moving so fast, every day it progress four to five miles," Incident Commander Joe Hassel said in a statement shared on a Facebook page sharing information on the fire.
Dry conditions are expected to exacerbate the fire. A red flag warning is in place until at least 8 p.m. local time Saturday, meaning that critical fire conditions are anticipated.
"The very dry and unstable conditions will continue to support extreme fire behavior with locally generated erratic and gusty winds," the National Weather Service said in an update Friday.
The Bootleg Fire is one of nine wildfires burning in the state, per the National Interagency Fire Center. Gov. Kate Brown on Saturday mobilized state teams to fight a new one, the Elbow Creek Fire, in northeast Oregon, near the community of Troy. The state fire marshal's office also said it was reassigning three task forces currently battling the Grandview Fire to the Elbow Creek Fire.
The fire was first reported Thursday and has already burned about 10,000 acres in the Umatilla National Forest, InciWeb shows. The Wallowa County Sheriff's Office issued an evacuation notice around Troy.
California has lost the second-highest number of acres, but with 161,176 acres it's just over half of what Oregon has seen burn.
Fire personnel from Butte County in Northern California are fighting the Dixie Fire, which has grown to 9,847 acres and is just 12% contained, according to an incident update Saturday from Cal Fire. The wildfire, which started early Wednesday, has already injured one person. Evacuation orders are in place for some areas, including High Lakes and Rock Creek to Tobin in Plumas County.
Meantime, the River Fire in Mariposa County is threatening 600 structures, per Cal Fire. One has already been destroyed, along with four other "minor structures." The blaze has burned 9,656 acres and is 64% contained.

Texto completo: The system also announced plans for unvaccinated students and staff to participate in required COVID testing and quarantine upon arriving on campuses this fall.

The University of Maine System will require COVID-19 vaccinations for staff and students when the federal government gives final approval to the vaccines and they are no longer in emergency use authorization.
The system has said for months it would consider a vaccine requirement pending final approval and made the announcement Friday as it also unveiled other COVID-19 protocols for the fall semester, which starts Aug. 30.
“We want to make it clear as we prepare to start the academic year that in fact when a vaccine has regular approval we will in fact be requiring it,” Chancellor Dannel Malloy said. “It also ties to the fact students will be showing up relatively soon. The bulk of them will be with us in late August and we want to be very clear. If regular approval is granted at some point, then vaccination will be required. Don’t wait and have to scramble.”
The UMaine System already has announced plans for a more traditional fall semester with the bulk of classes and activities being held in person, as they were before the pandemic. But Friday’s announcement outlined that some coronavirus safety protocols and rules will remain in place for unvaccinated staff and students.
Unvaccinated staff and students who plan to attend classes and work in-person will be required to participate in COVID-19 testing upon arriving on campuses and will have to quarantine while they await test results.
The university system is following state guidance and will drop masking requirements for vaccinated people indoors July 26, though unvaccinated people still will be asked to wear face coverings in university buildings going forward.
Students and staff are being asked to verify their vaccination status through an online portal. So far over, 5,000 of the system’s 35,000 staff and students have verified they are vaccinated, the system said Friday. Those who register as vaccinated before Aug. 20 will be exempt from the testing and quarantine arrival protocols.
During the semester, unvaccinated staff and students who are in-person can expect to participate in asymptomatic COVID-19 testing as often as once per week. “It will in all likelihood be once or twice per week, depending on the circumstances and what happens with the delta variant,” Malloy said. “The CDC may very well recommend more frequent testing as that variant becomes more common in Maine and elsewhere.”
The system is already conducting weekly asymptomatic testing of in-person students and staff who are unvaccinated during the summer in a carry-over from the testing regime last spring. In the last 14 days there have been 476 tests conducted and no positive results.
Hundreds of colleges and universities around the country, including several in Maine, have announced plans to require students, staff or both to be vaccinated against COVID-19 in the fall. Malloy said the system envisions requiring the vaccine for both students and staff when full approval is granted from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, though the system has noted that whatever policy is approved will “recognize and respect” that some individuals are not able to be vaccinated.
All three vaccines available in the United States are currently in emergency use authorization. On Friday CNN reported that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine has been granted priority review for its application for a full license. An FDA official told CNN a decision on full approval could come within two months.
In the meantime, the University of Maine System is continuing to encourage all students and employees who are able to get vaccinated to do so. On-campus vaccination clinics are currently being planned for the start of the fall semester.
The system also is launching a $1,000 Shot Clock Scholarship and will be awarding $1,000 scholarships on a weekly basis between now and Aug. 20 to students who verify their status as fully vaccinated online.
