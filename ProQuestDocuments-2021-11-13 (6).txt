Texto completo: The claim: Sen. Kelly Loeffler wore a wire during a debate
In September, both before and after the first Trump-Biden debate, social media users falsely claimed that then-candidate Joe Biden wore an earpiece or a wire through which he received answers.
Now, after a debate between Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler and her Democratic challenger, the Rev. Raphael Warnock, social media users have levied the same allegation — this time against Loeffler.
On Facebook, some users shared photos of Loeffler with circles around a light-colored strand on her head, accompanied by the text, "Looky looky. Is this an earpiece? That's why she sounded like a parrot."

The users behind the posts and the International Business Times have not responded to requests from USA TODAY for comment.
No, Loeffler was not wearing an earpiece at the debate
In reality, Loeffler was not wearing a wire at the debate.
After the rumor began to circulate online, the Atlanta Press Club — which hosted the debate on Sunday, Dec. 6— took to Twitter to debunk it.
"The candidates in last night's @atlpressclub debates had no audio assistance from their campaigns," its account wrote on Monday.
Both the New York Times and Reuters concluded that the light-colored strand in question was likely just a stray piece hair that caught the light on stage during the debate.
Stephen Lawson, a spokesperson for Loeffler, has not responded to a request from USA TODAY for comment on the matter.

HONG KONG — The United States imposed travel bans and other sanctions on 14 high-level Chinese officials over the continuing crackdown on the opposition in Hong Kong, as police in the Chinese territory arrested more pro-democracy figures Tuesday.
The U.S. State Department took aim at members of the Standing Committee of China’s National People’s Congress, citing the officials’ role last month in authorizing the Hong Kong government to disqualify four opposition lawmakers from the city’s legislature. The ousting of the lawmakers prompted the rest of the city’s pro-democracy camp to resign from the legislature in protest.
“Beijing’s unrelenting assault against Hong Kong’s democratic processes has gutted its Legislative Council, rendering the body a rubber stamp devoid of meaningful opposition,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Monday in a statement announcing the sanctions.
“Today, the Department of State is holding accountable those responsible for these brazen acts,” the statement continued.
The sanctions targeted 14 vice chairs of the top legislative body, including Wang Chen, a prominent backer of the national security law Beijing imposed on Hong Kong this summer, and Cao Jianming, China’s former top prosecutor. But they did not target its chairman, Li Zhanshu, the country’s No. 3 leader. Going after Li would have sent too provocative a message to Beijing, said Sonny Lo, a Hong Kong-based political analyst.
“The Americans opted for a kind of watered-down version of sanctions without seriously undermining official interactions between China and America,” Lo said.
The Trump administration has already imposed sanctions on several officials in Hong Kong, including its top leader, Carrie Lam, the security and justice secretaries, and the current and former police chiefs. Chinese officials with direct roles in Hong Kong affairs have also been subject to sanctions, including Luo Huining, head of the Central Liaison Office, the Chinese Communist Party’s official arm in the city.
China has denounced the U.S. sanctions as interference in its internal affairs. On Tuesday, Vice Foreign Minister Zheng Zeguang summoned Robert Forden, the chargé d’affaires of the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, to protest, Chinese state television reported.
“The Chinese government and people express strong indignation and condemnation toward the American side’s rude and unreasonable, crazy and vile behavior,” Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said Tuesday.
Some Chinese officials have previously laughed off the sanctions. In August, Luo said that he had no assets outside China, adding: “Perhaps I should send $100 to Mr. Trump for him to freeze.”
Lam last month alluded to the difficulties she now faces trying to use banks, although she said it was an honor to be “unjustifiably sanctioned.”
“I’m using cash every day for all the things,” she said in an interview with the Hong Kong International Business Channel. “I have piles of cash at home. The government is paying me cash for my salary because I don’t have a bank account.”
The latest sanctions are unlikely to slow authorities’ crackdown on dissent, which has escalated in recent weeks with the imprisonment of Joshua Wong and two other activists, and the detention of Jimmy Lai, a prominent pro-democracy media tycoon.
On Tuesday, police arrested at least eight opposition figures over a July 1 protest that took place hours after Beijing imposed a sweeping national security law on Hong Kong. The League of Social Democrats, a leftist political group, said four of its members, Leung Kwok-hung, Tsang Kin-shing, Figo Chan and Tang Sai-lai, had been arrested.
Police also arrested Eddie Chu and Wu Chi-wai, both former pro-democracy lawmakers, on suspicion of organizing and participating in the same protest, according to the politicians’ official social media accounts.
On Monday, police arrested eight people over a brief, peaceful protest at the Chinese University of Hong Kong during a graduation ceremony last month. Three of those arrested were accused of inciting secession under the national security law. Protesters had chanted slogans such as “Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times,” which the government has said could be seditious under the new law.
Human rights groups say the arrests show how severely the new security law has curbed peaceful political expression in the formerly freewheeling society.
“The people involved in this small protest were merely expressing their views peacefully,” Lam Cho Ming, Hong Kong program director for Amnesty International, said in a statement, referring to the arrests over the university protest. “But this is now treated as a crime as the Hong Kong and central Chinese authorities seek to crush all forms of dissent.”
Police and HSBC, the British-based bank, also faced criticism from a former lawmaker and a pastor who said their accounts had been frozen without notice or explanation.
Hong Kong law gives authorities broad power to freeze funds suspected of being involved in a crime, but activists say they believe the power is being misused to punish dissent.
Roy Chan, a 39-year-old pastor who led a group of older volunteers to mediate in anti-government protests, said his church’s HSBC bank account was frozen Monday, along with his and his wife’s personal accounts. Police said that they had arrested two women on suspicion of fraud and money laundering in the case, and that Chan and his wife were wanted for arrest as well.
“We’re in a desperate situation,” said Chan, who is now in Britain with his family. “We feel that this is a political persecution.”
The Good Neighbor North District Church, where Chan preached, said Tuesday afternoon that it had been searched by police along with a separate meeting site and three homeless shelters the church runs.
Ted Hui, a pro-democracy lawmaker, who announced last week while on a trip in Europe that he planned to go into exile, said his accounts had also been frozen.
Police said Monday that they had ordered about $110,000 frozen because Hui was suspected of embezzling money from a crowdfunding campaign. They also said he was under a national security law investigation for allegedly colluding with foreign forces after fleeing Hong Kong.
HSBC said it could not comment on specific accounts.

U.K. Coronavirus Vaccine: Side Effects, Safety and Who Gets It First

Britain’s National Health Service began delivering shots of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine Tuesday, opening a public health campaign with little precedent in modern medicine and making Britons the first people in the world to receive an authorized, fully tested vaccine.
Here’s a guide to some of the basics.
Should I be concerned about the safety of the vaccine in Britain?
Britain’s drug regulator is seen as a bellwether agency, and its decisions often have influence abroad. In the case of the Pfizer vaccine, the agency has said that it did not cut any corners and undertook the same laborious process of vetting the quality, efficacy and manufacturing protocols of the vaccine — except faster than usual.
Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the top U.S. infectious disease expert, said last week that the British had not reviewed the vaccine “as carefully” as the United States was. But he walked back those comments the next day, saying: “I have a great deal of confidence in what the U.K. does, both scientifically and from a regulator standpoint.”
Who in Britain will get the vaccine first?
Doctors and nurses, certain people older than 80 and nursing home workers.
Some doctors and nurses have received invitations in recent days to sign up for appointments, with the first shots intended for those at the highest risk of severe illness. The government has indicated that people older than 80 who already have visits with doctors scheduled for this week, or who are being discharged from certain hospitals, will also be among the first to receive shots.
Nursing home residents, who had been designated the top priority by a government advisory body, will be vaccinated in the coming weeks once health officials start distributing doses beyond hospitals.
They said they were not able to do so right away because of the ultracold storage requirements of the Pfizer vaccine. The vaccine must be transported at South Pole-like temperatures, although Pfizer has said that it can be stored for five days in a normal refrigerator before being used.
How will the vaccine cards work?
British health officials released images Monday of a small, wallet-size vaccination card. It will hold a record of the date of someone’s first and second dose of the vaccine, which are supposed to be roughly a month apart.
While the images raised fears of a government-mandated vaccine passport program, with the cards functioning as proof of vaccination and a key to traveling and going to events, health officials have indicated that the card will not function that way.
They have compared it to cards already in use by the country’s National Health Service for other two-dose vaccinations and said it would be useful but not necessary for people to bring it to their second vaccination appointment. The card does not even have space for a vaccinated person’s name, making it impossible to use as proof of someone’s vaccination.
When can I return to normal life after being vaccinated?
Life will return to normal only when society as a whole gains enough protection against the coronavirus. Once countries authorize a vaccine, they’ll only be able to vaccinate a few percent of their citizens at most in the first couple months. The unvaccinated majority will still remain vulnerable to getting infected.
A growing number of coronavirus vaccines are showing robust protection against becoming sick. But it’s also possible for people to spread the virus without even knowing they’re infected because they experience only mild symptoms or none at all. Scientists don’t yet know if the vaccines also block the transmission of the coronavirus.
So for the time being, even vaccinated people will need to wear masks, avoid indoor crowds and so on.
Once enough people get vaccinated, it will become very difficult for the coronavirus to find vulnerable people to infect. Depending on how quickly we as a society achieve that goal, life might start approaching something like normal by the fall 2021.
If I’ve been vaccinated, do I still need to wear a mask?
Yes, but not forever. The two vaccines that will potentially get authorized this month clearly protect people from getting sick with COVID-19. But the clinical trials that delivered these results were not designed to determine whether vaccinated people could still spread the coronavirus without developing symptoms. That remains a possibility. We know that people who are naturally infected by the coronavirus can spread it while they’re not experiencing any cough or other symptoms.
Researchers will be intensely studying this question as the vaccines roll out. In the meantime, even vaccinated people will need to think of themselves as possible spreaders.
Will it hurt? What are the side effects?
The Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine is delivered as a shot in the arm, like other typical vaccines. The injection won’t be any different from ones you’ve gotten before. Tens of thousands of people have already received the vaccines, and none of them have reported any serious side effects. But some of them have felt short-lived discomfort, including aches and flu-like symptoms that last less than a day. It’s possible that people may need to plan to take a day off work or school after the second shot.
While these experiences aren’t pleasant, they are a good sign: They are the result of your own immune system encountering the vaccine and mounting a potent response that will provide long-lasting immunity.
Does the vaccine affect fertility?
There’s no evidence that it does, and there’s good reason to think that it does not.
Some claims have been floating around the web that coronavirus vaccines can harm a woman’s fertility. Their supposed evidence rests on the fact that most coronavirus vaccines work by creating antibodies that attack the virus’ “spike” protein, and this protein has a minor resemblance to a protein crucial for the formation of the placenta.
But that does not mean that the antibodies generated by coronavirus vaccines would attack a pregnant woman’s placenta. The region of the placental protein that’s similar to the spike is just too short to give the antibodies a grip.
What’s more, the pandemic has brought a lot of evidence against the idea that the vaccine could threaten the placenta. When people get COVID-19, they fight off the coronavirus, known as SARS-CoV-2, by generating their own supply of spike antibodies. In recent months, researchers have carried out a number of studies on pregnant women to see if COVID-19 leads to miscarriages.
“And the consistent message is no, SARS-CoV-2 does not seem to induce miscarriage,” said Dr. Emily Miller, assistant professor in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Northwestern University. “If the placenta isn’t knocked out by antibodies generated from overt infection with SARS-COV-2, it is highly unlikely that it would get knocked out after vaccination.”

U.S. Leaves Behind Afghan Bases — and a Legacy of Land Disputes

At harvest time, as neighbors and relatives reap their crops, 80-year-old Jamal Khan can only look in despair on the plot of land that was the source of his family’s livelihood — until the American forces arrived over a decade ago.
Just before sunset one day, armored vehicles drove into fields of knee-high corn stalks, claimed about 30 acres that were co-owned by about as many families and quickly cordoned off the area with barbed wire. This was now Combat Outpost Honaker-Miracle, one of the roughly 1,000 military installations the United States and its coalition partners would prop up across Afghanistan.
“In the whole vastness of the lord’s world, I had this plot of land and this house that I am living in and nothing else,” said Khan, who lives the Watapur District of Kunar province, in eastern Afghanistan. “We told them this is our private land, how do you suddenly put up here? They said nothing.”
Khan is one of countless Afghans whose land became a casualty of the U.S.-led war and the sprawling military infrastructure born from it. They have been forced to navigate a maze of Afghan and American bureaucracy and indifference, stoking a growing bitterness toward coalition forces and the Afghan government alike.
Despite the drawdown of American forces in Afghanistan from more than 100,000 in 2011 to fewer than 5,000, some of the property they occupied has not been returned. Instead, the bases and the land have been transferred to Afghan security forces.
The Americans have left Watapur but Khan does not have his land back, and similar conflicts linger across wide swaths of the country. In at least half a dozen of Afghanistan’s 34 provinces, The New York Times has found land disputes involving owners who said they had simply been shut out.
In a country where due process is nearly impossible in the face of corruption and state erosion, the U.S. presence has added to a long history of land disputes that have often served as an underlying cause of local conflicts.
The Taliban touts the swift resolution of disputes in its shadow courts as a strength, and the unresolved discord over land bolsters the insurgents’ message that not only are Afghans deprived of justice under the American-backed government, but that the U.S. military presence has added to the injustice.
Khan still carries a pile of documents: petitions to the government, and even confirmation letters from the U.S. Army that say he is the rightful owner. On several occasions, he says, delegations from Kabul came to investigate — and they asked the villagers for money to cover their expenses during the stay.
But the most painful reminder of the trespass is his collection of small receipts. Although the Afghan army now occupies his land, Khan is still required to pay tax on the plot.
Over the years of fighting, the size of the U.S.-constructed installations varied greatly. Some bases were sprawling, even housing their own fast-food chain restaurants. In other cases, coalition forces would briefly occupy empty Afghan homes, destroying or modifying walls for defensive purposes before leaving.
The Americans sometimes negotiated temporary leases with local farmers, but those agreements were vulnerable to manipulation by corrupt local warlords and strongmen who brokered deals. During shorter stays, homeowners were rarely compensated.
A Pentagon spokesman, Army Maj. Rob Lodewick, deferred specific questions about land disputes to the Afghan government.
“It would be the responsibility of the government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan to adjudicate and compensate, as appropriate, any and all entities that claim ownership to areas and facilities” provided by the Afghan government for use by U.S. forces, he said.
The Afghan defense ministry, despite repeated requests, did not comment.
Today, most installations are controlled by Afghan security forces; the few U.S. bases that remain are shuttering now as part of the U.S. deal with the Taliban.
In northern Balkh province, the U.S.-led coalition forces built a base next to the provincial capital’s airport. Amanullah Balkhi, a local business owner, says the installation occupied about 20 acres of his land.
The defense ministry said it was government land, Balkhi was told, but if he proved he owned it, the coalition would compensate him and pay rent. He says he fought a six-year legal battle that cost him about $2 million, which he covered by selling two of his apartment buildings, renting out more land and taking on $500,000 of debt.
“I have the deed, and the government and the courts have attested that this is my land,” he said. “But the Americans still have the land and they still deny me.”
Balkhi has become deeply depressed, he said, adding, “I have ruined my life to get my right, but I have gotten nothing.”
The story of a base in Panjwai, in southern Kandahar province, is almost identical — and speaks to the troubling legacy the United States has left behind.
About 10 years ago, dozens of coalition vehicles arrived at the small village and eyed about 10 acres of vineyard owned by half a dozen villagers. They even tasted the grapes before getting to work building a new base.
“They didn’t carve a road where there was a trek, where we came and went — they carved a road for themselves through people’s lands, people’s gardens,” said Fida Muhammad, a tribal elder from Panjwai and one of the vineyard’s owners.
In the initial days, there was word that the coalition forces were offering compensation, but the area was so restive that approaching the base for money meant taking potentially lethal risks. Villagers feared the Americans would mistake them for the Taliban. And they knew that if they did manage to get their money, the Taliban, who were everywhere, would know and come after them for profiting from the occupiers.
The area was so lush that “you had to squint your eyes to find a dry patch,” said Rashid Gul, a village resident. But these days it’s desolate except for one small patch of vineyard.
“It ruined the irrigation system too — for five years, the irrigation canals were ruined, the land dried,” Muhammad said of the coalition base. “Many families left the area. They went to the city for daily labor.”
As one of the village elders, Muhammad took the lead in trying to get compensation and reclaim the land, to no avail. When the Americans ran the base, he said, the villagers’ claim was simply lost in bureaucracy; come tomorrow, come the next day, he was told repeatedly.
“We have lost hope of finding someone who can get us our right,” said Muhammad, who said he had made about 30 trips with petitions. “It’s just tiring ourselves, losing more money, but we can’t find a door to knock on for justice.”
When a base was transferred to Afghan control, the forces stationed there were often too preoccupied with defending it against Taliban attacks to pay much attention to land claims. Many of the Afghan commanders who rotated through simply did not care about the local residents’ grievances, which they saw as an issue between the farmers and the Americans.
Gul worried that even if one day the plot of land in Panjwai were returned, figuring out which piece belonged to whom could spark new disagreements.
Land disputes have been one of the main issues of conflict in the village, he said. Just two weeks earlier, Muhammad had to quell a feud because one farmer’s tractor had crossed the boundary of another man’s land.
“All this land is mixed up now, no one knows which piece is whose,” Gul said. “You will be amazed at what kind of fights will break out between people over this.”
Resolving those conflicts would require digging through government archives, hoping to find old property demarcation records.
Asked about how long that would take, he smiled a tired smile.
“This is Afghanistan,” he said.

Is California’s Thanksgiving Surge Hitting?

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
California’s hospitals continued to fill with patients, Gov. Gavin Newsom said Monday, even as the latest round of lockdowns took effect across much of the state.
The availability of intensive care beds is teetering in Southern California and the San Joaquin Valley — the two regions where scarce capacity led to the stay-at-home orders — and more than 10,000 COVID-19 patients are now hospitalized in the state, a figure more than 70% above what it was two weeks ago.
“You can see how quickly this grows,” the governor said Monday morning.
Although the state is averaging 21,000 new known cases a day, twice as many as it was reporting at its worst point this summer and by far its highest levels of the pandemic, Newsom once again tried to allay panic.
He said that the state still had more than 73,000 open hospital beds and that regional health care leaders had been gauging where to pull back on elective surgeries. He also mentioned programs allowing patients in hard-hit areas to be treated with oxygen at home and underscored efforts to bring on extra health care workers.
Still, as my colleagues and I have reported, officials have for weeks been warning of a post-Thanksgiving surge in cases. And now, state officials say, that in spite of their efforts to head it off, it looks as if the surge has arrived.
“We know that cases that potentially occurred during Thanksgiving are going to show up right about now,” said Dr. Mark Ghaly, the California secretary of health and human services.
I had asked the governor and Ghaly whether — knowing that experts had been sounding the alarm about Thanksgiving in particular — they had discussed implementing a broader stay-at-home order sooner.
The answer, unsurprisingly, was yes.
The state, they said, worked with health care providers, local officials and others to craft stay-at-home orders that would be as limited as possible, while also curbing the spread of the virus.
“All of these are coming together — these signals in our data — to cause us to do the regional stay-at-home order the way we did,” Ghaly said.
As we’ve seen throughout the pandemic, even in California, where support for restrictions has been relatively high, balancing the many considerations at play in managing the virus is exceedingly complex.
California’s long, complicated process of shutting down, then lifting restrictions and then reimposing them (but only in some places) is a testament to the difficulty of that task.
But Dr. Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo, vice dean for population health and health equity at the School of Medicine at University of California, San Francisco, told me that the fact that Californians had been under varying levels of restriction for roughly 10 months only makes the state’s plight now more vexing.
As cases began to rise again, policymakers took incremental steps to try to curb the alarming spread, rather than implement a more restrictive statewide order, like the one in March.
“They’ve tried to keep things open because of the economic need, which, unfortunately, makes the messaging more challenging,” she said. “Because now we really are in a crisis.”
Bibbins-Domingo emphasized another challenge facing the state, what she described as the “false dichotomy” of reviving the flagging economy and protecting public health.
Communities with higher concentrations of low-wage essential workers, who have been showing up for their jobs with little help from the state or federal government, are being disproportionately hurt by the latest surge, just as they have been for months.
“The communities that are most devastated by the pandemic are also most devastated by the economic crisis,” she said.
Communities where the virus is spreading will have to stay under restrictions longer, which will inevitably prolong their economic recoveries.
In any case, Bibbins-Domingo said that the impulse to “play the blame game” and figure out distinct sources of transmission — outdoor dining? factories? Thanksgiving dinner tables? — is not productive.
“We don’t have the data to pinpoint with any type of accuracy whether it’s this versus that,” she said. “It also misses the point that once the transmission goes up as high as it is, we basically just have to lock down.”

Covid and The New Age Of Censorship

Texto completo: Information has never been more plentiful or easier to distribute. Yet we are sliding into a new age of censorship and suppression, encouraged by technology giants and traditional media companies. As someone who's been falsely characterized as a coronavirus "denier," I have seen this crisis firsthand.
Since June, Amazon has twice tried to suppress self-published booklets I have written about Covid-19 and the response to it. These booklets don't contain conspiracy theories. Like the scientists who wrote the Great Barrington Declaration, I simply believe many measures to control the coronavirus have been damaging, counterproductive and unsupported by science.
Amazon has said earlier that "as a bookseller, we believe that providing access to the written word is important, including books that some may find objectionable." The company sells "Mein Kampf" and "The Anarchist's Cookbook." But when it comes to Covid, Amazon has a different standard. At least half a dozen other authors have emailed me that their books have been pulled. Amazon won't disclose how many, or other details about how it picks books to censor.
Google-owned YouTube censors even more aggressively. The company disclosed in October that it had pulled more than 200,000 videos about the epidemic -- including one from Scott Atlas, a physician who was advising President Trump. Facebook has not only censored videos and attached warning labels or "fact checks" to news articles, but removed groups that oppose lockdowns and other restrictions.
That online entertainment and retail companies have benefited financially from lockdowns adds to the ugliness of their suppression efforts. Interestingly, Apple -- whose mobile business means it gains less than other big tech companies -- has been less aggressive.
Tech companies aren't alone in their efforts to stifle debate. Traditional news outlets, book publishers and even scientific journals are reluctant to publish information that challenges ideological orthodoxies. The Danish authors of a study on whether masks protect their wearers from coronavirus struggled for months to get it published, despite its obvious public-health importance. When they finally convinced a journal to print the paper, which showed that masks didn't appear to protect their wearers, the journal's editor felt compelled to write a piece defending her decision to run it.
News organizations then treated the study's findings with a skepticism absent from the coverage of most other peer-reviewed scientific research. A New York Times headline declared: "A New Study Questions Whether Masks Protect Wearers. You Need to Wear Them Anyway." Newspapers are now in the business of ordering their readers around.
Outlets like the Times are increasingly unwilling even to ask ideologically inconvenient questions. Few acknowledge that top biologists are calling for an independent investigation into the possibility that Sars-Cov-2 is the product of a Chinese laboratory accident.
Although I was a reporter at the Times for a decade and I am no conservative, almost no one there spoke up for me when Amazon refused to publish my Covid booklets. Fortunately, business leaders like Elon Musk and independent-thinking media figures like Glenn Greenwald came to my defense. Amazon eventually relented. But many other people and ideas are still being suppressed.
The book business is also constrained. Even though my Covid booklets have sold almost a quarter-million copies, two mainstream publishers declined to make offers for a full-length book I am writing on the epidemic after saying they would. "You see what I mean about conservative imprints being some of the few places left truly interested in free speech," an editor at one wrote. I'll turn to a conservative publisher if that's what it takes to be true to liberal principles.

Texto completo: The payment companies said they would investigate financial links after The New York Times reported that videos on Pornhub depict child abuse.
Visa and Mastercard said they would investigate their financial links to MindGeek, the parent company of the adult website Pornhub, after the New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof reported that the website included videos of child abuse and nonconsensual sexual violence.
Visa said in a statement that it was "actively engaging with the relevant financial institutions" and with MindGeek to investigate the allegations.
Visa, which works with 61 million merchants and moves nearly $ 12 trillion in money through the financial system in a year, said it was "vigilant" about removing companies doing illegal activity from its network. Banks act as intermediaries between payment companies, such as Visa and Mastercard, and businesses.
"If the site is identified as not complying with applicable laws or the financial institutions' acceptable use policies and underwriting standards, they will no longer be able to accept Visa payments," the statement said.
Mastercard also said it was investigating the allegations against Pornhub with MindGeek's bank. "If the claims are substantiated, we will take immediate action," Mastercard said in a statement. "When we identify illegal activity, our policy is to ask the acquirer to terminate the relationship, unless an effective compliance plan is put in place."
Nearly seven million videos are posted on Pornhub each year, and while the vast majority of them probably depict consensual acts, many do not, Mr. Kristof wrote. He reported that videos of teenage girls who had been victims of assault and trafficking had been found on the website.
"In each case, offenders were arrested for the assaults, but Pornhub escaped responsibility for sharing the videos and profiting from them," Mr. Kristof wrote.
Pornhub denied the allegations and said it was "unequivocally committed to combating child sexual abuse material, and has instituted a comprehensive, industry-leading trust and safety policy to identify and eradicate illegal material from our community."
Some other payment companies do not allow their services to be used for adult content sites. American Express has a policy against using its cards for "adult digital content."
And PayPal "prohibits all account holders from buying or selling sexually oriented digital goods," including videos, pictures and subscriptions. Last year, PayPal barred Pornhub, and providers of videos to the site, from making and accepting payments through PayPal. After that, Pornhub added new payment options, including Tether, a blockchain-based cryptocurrency.

Texto completo: Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham appears to be staying in New Mexico following months of speculation she might lead the U.S. Health and Human Services Department or take another job in President-elect Joe Biden's administration.
The New York Times reported Sunday night (Dec. 6) that Biden selected Xavier Becerra, the Democratic attorney general of California and a former congressman, as his nominee for secretary of health and human services.
"As I've consistently said, I have the best job in the world as Governor of New Mexico. I look forward to working with the Biden Administration as we tackle the challenges we're facing here in New Mexico and also across the country," Lujan Grisham said Sunday in a statement. "COVID-19, combating climate change, and rebuilding our nation's economy are just a few of the areas where we need to make significant progress right now."
Democratic governors last week unanimously confirmed Lujan Grisham, a former congresswoman and secretary of the state Department of Health and the state Department of Aging and Long-Term Services, as the new chairwoman of the Washington, D.C.-based Democratic Governors Association for 2021.
Her term as governor runs through 2022, and after reportedly being considered as a potential pick for vice president, she is serving as one of five co-chairpersons on Biden's transition team.
Last week, the New York Times reported that U.S. Sen.-elect Ben Ray Luján, D-N.M., criticized the incoming Biden administration's treatment of Lujan Grisham after reports surfaced that she had been offered and turned down the position of secretary of the interior.
Luján rebuked the incoming White House chief of staff, Ron Klain, and other senior Biden officials for the leak, which cited a Democrat familiar with the virtual meeting between members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and top advisers to Biden, according to the New York Times.
In a statement provided to The New Mexican, Luján declined to address the accuracy of the report.
"I'm a firm believer that family discussions should remain between family," Luján said in the statement.
Politico reported last month that the Congressional Hispanic Caucus had been making a "strong push" for Lujan Grisham, who used to be a member of the group, to be tapped as health secretary.
For the job Lujan Grisham reportedly passed up, Biden also is rumored to be considering U.S. Rep. Deb Haaland, D-N.M.
She would become the first Native American to lead the Department of the Interior, which oversees concerns crucial to the West and the nation, including grazing, parks and recreation, and oil and gas extraction on federal land. The agency also oversees coastal drilling, among other environmental concerns. Haaland, a member of Laguna Pueblo, won the open 1st Congressional District seat vacated by Lujan Grisham in 2018.
Two other New Mexicans, U.S. Sens. Tom Udall and Martin Heinrich, are also said to be under consideration for secretary of the interior.

Texto completo: It would appear that the people in American hit hardest by COVID-19 — Black people — are also the group most leery about the prospects of a vaccine.
As a Pew Research report published last week pointed out: “Black Americans are especially likely to say they know someone who has been hospitalized or died as a result of having the coronavirus: 71% say this, compared with smaller shares of Hispanic (61%), White (49%) and Asian-American (48 %) adults.”
But that same report contained the following: “Black Americans continue to stand out as less inclined to get vaccinated than other racial and ethnic groups: 42% would do so, compared with 63% of Hispanic and 61% of white adults.”
The unfortunate American fact is that Black people in this country have been well-trained, over centuries, to distrust both the government and the medical establishment on the issue of health care.
In the mid-1800s a man in Alabama named James Marion Sims gained national renown as a doctor after performing medical experiments on enslaved women, who by definition of their position in society could not provide informed consent.
He performed scores of experimental operations on one woman alone, an enslaved woman named Anarcha, before perfecting his technique.
Not only that, he operated on these women without anesthesia, in part because he didn’t believe that Black women experienced pain in the same way that white women did, a dangerous and false sensibility whose remnants linger to this day.
When he finally got his experiments to be successful, he began to use them on white women, but he would begin to use anesthesia for those women.
As medical writer Durrenda Ojanuga wrote in the Journal of Medical Ethics in 1993: “Many white women came to Sims for treatment of vesicovaginal fistula after the successful operation on Anarcha. However, none of them, due to the pain, were able to endure a single operation.”
Sims would go on to become known as the Father of Gynecology, even though, as one researcher put it:
“Sims failed utterly to recognize his patients as autonomous persons and his own personal drive for success cannot be minimized, especially as a balance to the enormous amount of praise accorded Sims for his work and for subsequent applications of the technique developed in Montgomery and elsewhere.”
After the Civil War and the freeing of the enslaved, the limited and fragile infrastructure for Black people in this country collapsed and an epidemic of disease flourished.
Many formerly enslaved people were estranged from the small gardens they used to grow things for home remedies. The larger plantation that had sick houses saw operations cease.
White doctors refused to see Black people and white hospitals refused to admit them. Furthermore, federal, state and local governments squabbled over whose responsibility it was to provide health care for the newly freed men and women, with no entity truly wanting to assume that responsibility.
Because of all of this, Jim Downs, a professor at Gettysburg College, estimates that at least one-quarter of all former slaves got sick or died between 1862 and 1870.
For nearly half of the 20th century, women — often Black — were forcibly sterilized, often without their knowledge. As The Intercept reported in September, “Between 1930 to 1970, 65% of the 7,600-plus sterilizations ordered by the state of North Carolina were carried out on Black women.”
As Ms. Magazine pointed out in 2011:
“Some women were sterilized during cesarean sections and never told; others were threatened with termination of welfare benefits or denial of medical care if they didn’t ‘consent’ to the procedure; others received unnecessary hysterectomies at teaching hospitals as practice for medical residents. In the South it was such a widespread practice that it had a euphemism: a ‘Mississippi appendectomy.’ "
Even famed Mississippi civil rights heroine Fannie Lou Hamer was a victim of forced sterilization. As PBS has pointed out, “Hamer’s own pregnancies had all failed, and she was sterilized without her knowledge or consent in 1961. She was given a hysterectomy while in the hospital for minor surgery.” Hamer would later say, “(In) the North Sunflower County Hospital, I would say about 6 out of the 10 Negro women that go to the hospital are sterilized with the tubes tied.”
Furthermore, as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention explains: “In 1932, the Public Health Service, working with the Tuskegee Institute, began a study to record the natural history of syphilis in hopes of justifying treatment programs for blacks. It was called the ‘Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male.’ "
Hundreds of Black men were told they were being treated for syphilis, but they were not. They were being observed to see how the disease would progress. The men suffered under this experiment for 40 years.
I hope that America can overcome Black people’s trepidations about this vaccine, but it is impossible to say that that trepidation doesn’t have historical merit.

Texto completo: Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham appears to be staying in New Mexico following months of speculation she might lead the U.S. Health and Human Services Department or take another job in President-elect Joe Biden's administration.
The New York Times reported Sunday night that Biden selected Xavier Becerra, the Democratic attorney general of California and a former congressman, as his nominee for secretary of health and human services.
"As I've consistently said, I have the best job in the world as Governor of New Mexico. I look forward to working with the Biden Administration as we tackle the challenges we're facing here in New Mexico and also across the country," Lujan Grisham said Sunday in a statement. "COVID-19, combating climate change, and rebuilding our nation's economy are just a few of the areas where we need to make significant progress right now."
Democratic governors last week unanimously confirmed Lujan Grisham, a former congresswoman and secretary of the state Department of Health and the state Department of Aging and Long-Term Services, as the new chairwoman of the Washington, D.C.-based Democratic Governors Association for 2021.
Her term as governor runs through 2022, and after reportedly being considered as a potential pick for vice president, she is serving as one of five co-chairpersons on Biden's transition team.
Last week, the New York Times reported that U.S. Sen.-elect Ben Ray Luján, D-N.M., criticized the incoming Biden administration's treatment of Lujan Grisham after reports surfaced that she had been offered and turned down the position of secretary of the interior.
Luján rebuked the incoming White House chief of staff, Ron Klain, and other senior Biden officials for the leak, which cited a Democrat familiar with the virtual meeting between members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and top advisers to Biden, according to the New York Times.
In a statement provided to The New Mexican, Luján declined to address the accuracy of the report.
"I'm a firm believer that family discussions should remain between family," Luján said in the statement.
Politico reported last month that the Congressional Hispanic Caucus had been making a "strong push" for Lujan Grisham, who used to be a member of the group, to be tapped as health secretary.
For the job Lujan Grisham reportedly passed up, Biden also is rumored to be considering U.S. Rep. Deb Haaland, D-N.M.
She would become the first Native American to lead the Department of the Interior, which oversees concerns crucial to the West and the nation, including grazing, parks and recreation, and oil and gas extraction on federal land. The agency also oversees coastal drilling, among other environmental concerns. Haaland, a member of Laguna Pueblo, won the open 1st Congressional District seat vacated by Lujan Grisham in 2018.
Two other New Mexicans, U.S. Sens. Tom Udall and Martin Heinrich, are also said to be under consideration for secretary of the interior.

Biden’s shifting story on his bin Laden raid stance conflicts with Obama’s own telling

Texto completo: President-elect Joe Biden has offered contradictory accounts of his stance on the 2011 raid that killed Osama bin Laden, initially saying he opposed the operation and told President Barack Obama not to do it, but later changing his account to say he hedged in front of others but privately told Obama to go ahead.
Biden’s most recent iteration of the story contradicts Obama’s new memoir.

In 2012, Biden said his advice was “Don’t go.” By 2015, he had settled on saying he'd privately told Obama to “go.”
The former vice president’s most recent descriptions of his stance, when he morphed from vocal opponent of the raid to private supporter of it, contradict the public accounts of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, former Secretary of Defense Bob Gates, former CIA Director Leon Panetta, Obama himself, and others.
Biden provided his most recent version in an interview for a CNN documentary titled President in Waiting that aired Saturday, first reported by the Daily Beast. The president-elect gave his account of the April 28, 2011, meeting in the Situation Room, where Obama asked his national security advisers what they thought. Options included a raid or drone strike, and Obama wanted to be able to confirm bin Laden’s death.
“And it came time to go or not go, and the president went around the room ... Three people gave him an absolute when he said, ‘What do you think we should do?’ And everybody in the room was like, ‘Well, if, you know, 60-40, 49-51.’ Et cetera. Two said go, and one said don’t go,” Biden claimed.
Biden said to hold off on the raid.
“And I’m the last person in the room. Well, again, this is a place where I’ve gotta reserve space, in my view, for the president. And there was one option that was remaining. You could’ve done one more very low flight … in spying down on the site to determine whether this was bin Laden,“ Biden said, adding, “I said, ‘I didn’t think we had this many economists in the room. On the one hand, the other hand.’ I said, ‘Mr. President,’ to give him space, I said, ‘I think you should wait and do one more pass.’ Knowing that if you made a lower pass, they might observe it, and he’d flee.”
Biden claimed he then quietly encouraged Obama to go with his gut.
“But then, I walked out, as I always did after every meeting of the security council, I’d walk up to the office, and we’d have a private discussion. And I said, ‘Mr. President, follow your instincts on this one.’ Because what I didn’t want to have happen — he risked his entire presidency, and it took real, real, real courage to make that decision,” Biden said. “And had this decision been wrong, had he not been there or had it failed, I doubt whether the 17 people around that table said, ‘I told him he should go.’ So I was trying to preserve space for him.”
This account contradicted prior versions of Biden’s telling as well as Obama’s own version, revealed in detail in writing for the first time in his new memoir, A Promised Land. Obama said Biden opposed the raid and made no mention of any private encouragement from the now-president-elect to go for it.
Obama wrote that Adm. William McRaven, who helped plan the operation, told the assembled that preparations for the raid were ready, while Gen. James Cartwright said the secondary option of a drone strike could also be quickly activated.
The former president said Panetta, former CIA Director John Brennan, and former CIA Deputy Director Mike Mullen “favored the raid.” Obama wrote that Clinton said, “It was a 51–49 call,” but that “she ultimately came down on the side of sending in the SEALs.” Gates “recommended against a raid” and raised the failed 1980 helicopter rescue of the U.S. hostages in Iran and also “worried that a failed mission might adversely impact the war in Afghanistan.”
“Joe also weighed in against the raid, arguing that given the enormous consequences of failure, I should defer any decision until the intelligence community was more certain that bin Laden was in the compound. As had been true in every major decision I’d made as president, I appreciated Joe’s willingness to buck the prevailing mood and ask tough questions, often in the interest of giving me the space I needed for my own internal deliberations,” Obama wrote.
After the meeting, Obama didn’t mention a secondary talk with Biden, saying instead that then-national security adviser Tom Donilon “walked back to the Oval Office with me" to talk.
During a presidential debate with now-Sen. Mitt Romney on Oct. 22, 2012, Obama indicated Biden had opposed the raid, telling Romney that “even some in my own party, including my current vice president, had the same critique as you did.”

The CIA-planned U.S. special forces raid was carried out by SEAL Team Six when it disembarked from two MH-60 Black Hawks on May 2, 2011. It was launched from Jalalabad, Afghanistan, targeted bin Laden’s compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, and killed the al Qaeda leader and mastermind of 9/11.

The New York Times reported that Biden said at a late May 2011 Democratic fundraiser that he told Obama to “wait another seven days for information.”

The year afterward, Biden described himself as openly opposed to the raid. Speaking at a House Democratic Party retreat on Jan. 27, 2012, Biden said, “Every single person in that room hedged their bet” except for Panetta, who Biden recounts said, “Go.”
Biden said he criticized other people at the table and advised against the operation, saying: “We owe the man a direct answer … Mr. President, my suggestion is: Don’t go. We have to see two more things to see if he’s there.”
But Biden soon began shifting his story, telling New York Times Magazine in January 2013 that “I remember walking up to his office and saying, ‘Look, follow your instincts.'"

When weighing a presidential run, he said at an event at George Washington University on Oct. 20, 2015, that he didn’t give a definitive answer at the meeting but told Obama privately he was in favor of it.
In this new telling, there were now “only two people who were definitive and were absolutely certain” — Panetta in favor and Gates opposed. Biden said he “joked” to the rest that “y’all sound like 17 Larry Summers, economists.”
But when Biden was asked for his thoughts, he no longer said he'd told Obama not to do it but had suggested “there was a third option that I didn’t really think we should do” and says he told everyone that “I think we should make one more pass with another UAV to see if it is him.”
But Biden said that “as we walked out of the room and walked upstairs, I told him my opinion, that I thought he should go but follow his own instincts.” Biden said being definitive at the meeting “would’ve been a mistake.”
“Imagine if I had said in front of everyone ‘Don’t go’ or ‘Go’ and his decision was a different decision?” Biden said. “It undercuts that relationship. So, I never, on a difficult issue, never say what I think finally until I go up in the Oval with him alone.”
Biden told CBS News on Oct. 26, 2015, to explain the contradictions. Biden claimed that “everything I said was completely accurate, I just never, until last Tuesday night, told the whole story.”
When Biden was pressed on this, he said, “The reporting was accurate when I said ‘I didn’t say go.’ And I didn’t. What I said was, ‘Mr. President, try one more thing.’”
“Imagine if I had said, ‘Mr. President, go’ and he didn’t go? And then bin Laden did something else bad? They would’ve said, ‘Well, everybody said, even his vice president said to go, and he said no,’” Biden claimed. “And had I said, ‘By the way, when I went up privately I told him to go,’ it would’ve made it look like I was self-aggrandizing.”
In January, then-primary candidate Biden was pressed to answer for his contradictory accounts and told a reporter that it wasn’t true that he advised Obama against the operation.
Peter Bergen, the author of Manhunt: The Ten-Year Search for Bin Laden from 9/11 to Abbottabad, included a lengthy quotation of Biden’s words at the White House meeting: “We need greater certainty that Bin Laden is there … The risks to the Pakistani relationship and its importance are such that we need to know more before acting ... Mister President, my suggestion is: Don’t go.”
Clinton also said Biden opposed the raid, while she supported it, writing in her memoir, Hard Choices, that “I respected Bob [Gates] and Joe [Biden]'s concerns about the risks of a raid, but I came to the conclusion that the intelligence was convincing and the risks were outweighed by the benefits of success.”
In his book Worthy Fights, Panetta wrote: "Biden argued that we still did not have enough confidence that bin Laden was in the compound, and he came out firmly in favor of waiting for more information."
Gates wrote in his memoir, Duty: Memoirs of a Secretary at War, that Biden opposed the raid, writing, “Joe Biden and I were the two primary skeptics.” Gates recounted that “Biden’s primary concern was the political consequences of failure" and "Biden was against the operation.”
Earlier in the book, Gates said of Biden: “I think he has been wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades.”

Texto completo: Two large credit card companies are reexamining their business relationship with pornography website Pornhub.
Investigations at Visa and Mastercard are underway after the New York Times published a report by columnist Nicholas Kristof on Friday that alleged that Pornhub monetizes "child rapes, revenge pornography, spy videos of women showering, racist and misogynist content, and footage of women being asphyxiated in plastic bags."
Pornhub, which is owned by MindGeek, a large conglomerate that owns many different porn sites, called the claims “irresponsible and flagrantly untrue."
“We are aware of the allegations, and we are actively engaging with the relevant financial institutions to investigate, in addition to engaging directly with the site’s parent company, MindGeek,” Visa told the Associated Press in a statement. Visa added that if the company found Pornhub was in violation of the law or bank policies, the site would be barred from using Visa payments.
Mastercard told the Hill it would take "immediate action" if it found the allegations are substantiated and has “zero tolerance for illegal activity on our network.”
“We are investigating the allegations raised in the New York Times and are working with MindGeek’s bank to understand this situation, in addition to the other steps they have already taken,” the statement added. “When we identify illegal activity, our policy is to ask the acquirer to terminate the relationship, unless an effective compliance plan is put in place.”
Pornhub, which publicly donates to left-wing groups that focus on racial issues, blasted allegations that its website has content showing sexually abused children, saying it is "unequivocally committed to combating child sexual abuse material (CSAM), and has instituted a comprehensive, industry-leading trust and safety policy to identify and eradicate illegal material from our community."

Indoor Dining May Be Banned Again, Threatening Many NYC Restaurants

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
NEW YORK — Since the pandemic forced most New York City businesses to shut down nine months ago, the restaurant industry has warned that it was facing a crisis.
Though many restaurateurs tried to adapt once some of the restrictions were lifted — shifting to takeout and delivery, then moving outside, then cautiously welcoming customers indoors — they say that they are still barely hanging on.
Now, New York City’s restaurants face yet another possible blow. On Monday, Gov. Andrew Cuomo, citing the growing spread of the coronavirus, announced a new restrictions model that could halt indoor dining in the city as soon as next week if hospitalization rates do not stabilize — a prospect he said seemed likely.
The move, which Cuomo said was spurred by recent federal guidance that described indoor dining as “particularly high-risk,” could further devastate the industry at the same time that plunging temperatures threaten to keep customers away from outdoor dining.
Restaurant owners are warning that the industry, which employs thousands of low-income workers and is vital to the city’s culture, risks even further collapse without some form of aid.
“They’re not going to make it,” said Tren’ness Woods-Black, the vice president of communications at Sylvia’s, the soul food mainstay in Harlem. “That’s the truth of the matter. There are a lot of businesses that simply will not make it. And that’s heartbreaking.”
Cuomo’s announcement came as the virus has been spreading more rapidly in New York City. According to the state, the city’s seven-day average rate of positive test results last week surpassed 4% for the first time since late May. On Sunday, 1,416 people were believed to be hospitalized with the virus, according to state data, the city’s highest total since early June.
Included in the governor’s new plan for restrictions is a “clamp down” on indoor dining in any region where hospitalization rates do not stabilize for five days. Cuomo did not provide a specific measure or threshold. His office did not immediately respond to questions seeking more details.
Though restaurants in New York City would be required to end indoor dining, restaurants in other regions where hospitalization rates do not stabilize would have to reduce their indoor dining capacity from 50% to 25%.
New York is not the only state taking this patchwork approach. In California, where cases are also climbing, shutdown restrictions also vary by region.
Cuomo echoed calls for federal financial assistance, saying restaurants and bars had faced “a long year and they have bills to pay.” However, he did not provide any details about what threshold would need to be met for indoor dining to resume once closed, providing an uncertainty that frustrated the city’s restaurant owners.
“When you cut indoor dining without a plan, it really sends the wrong message to everyone,” said George Constantinou, who owns three restaurants in Brooklyn. “To customers, to employees, and everyone in the industry.”
Constantinou added that for months, New York City’s 25,000 restaurants had been in a state of constant whiplash as they adapted to shifting public health guidance and government regulations.
“They keep changing the laws on what’s safe, what’s not safe,” he said. “I feel like everyone’s confused.”
In March, when state officials closed all nonessential businesses, many restaurants overhauled their business models — and in some cases, their menus — to try and survive on takeout and delivery alone. The federal Paycheck Protection Program helped provide some relief, but with fewer customers, many employees lost their jobs.
The summer brought some hope with an outdoor dining program, but many restaurants described it as a tenuous lifeline at best that brought them a fraction of their business. Constantinou also noted that outdoor dining came with financial costs, as restaurants rushed to set up spaces that met the city’s guidelines.
The New York City Hospitality Alliance, an industry group, estimated that fewer than half of the city’s restaurants took part in the program.
Indoor dining only resumed in New York City at the end of September, even as restaurants in other parts of the state were allowed to resume serving customers indoors throughout the summer.
But there were limits. Establishments were held to seating at 25% capacity and had to keep their tables spaced at least 6 feet apart — a significant reduction in potential business, especially at cramped city restaurants where diners used to be packed into tables.
Still, both Woods-Black and Constantinou said that their restaurants welcomed the change at the time, noting that every table helped with the bottom line in a business where, even before the pandemic, profit margins were often tight.
Woods-Black said that Sylvia’s had started to see more of its business shift indoors as the weather cooled. About 60% of its sales from last week were from indoor dining, she said.
The restaurant had only recently started to hire back staff members that it had laid off to accommodate the change in demand. Now it was facing the prospect of dismissing employees again.
“They’re very worried,” she said of her workers. “And we’re worried for them.”
Still, Sylvia’s planned to do whatever it would take to stay open, she said. Until the governor’s order took effect, the restaurant would continue to serve customers indoors.
Constantinou, who owns Bogota Latin Bistro, Miti Miti Modern Mexican and Medusa Greek Taverna in Park Slope, said that he would spend the next week adjusting his staffing in preparation for the end of indoor dining.
Already, he said, he had been reducing shifts at his restaurants as cooler weather brought fewer customers to his outdoor tables. Over the course of the pandemic, he went from employing more than 150 people to around 80, and he anticipated more cuts would come.
Given the numerous limits placed on indoor dining, he had anticipated that more New Yorkers would choose to eat inside, helping his revenues during what was normally a slower winter season.
“If you have a choice to sit outdoors at 30 degrees or indoors at 25% capacity, I would say 8 out of 10 people would sit indoors as long as it’s not crowded,” he said. “Because people don’t want to freeze.”
Instead, he faced the prospect that the restaurants he had worked to cautiously reopen, whose atmosphere he had carefully cultivated, would again fall silent.
“The restaurants will be dead again,” he said. “And to have outdoor dining in a dead restaurant — it’s not the vibe you really want to give out.”
Tina Maria Oppedisano, the manager of Il Bacco restaurant in Queens, said an end to indoor dining would be detrimental to her business.
“He has scared everybody,” she said of Cuomo. “My business has gone down in the past three weeks. It’s been a tremendous decline because people are scared to come out.”
Though the restaurant has a large rooftop, it’s too cold for customers to sit outdoors. Il Bacco has lost millions of dollars in revenue, and employee shifts were cut to avoid layoffs, Oppedisano said.
Oppedisano has been critical of the governor’s restrictions on New York City restaurants and was part of a group that sued the governor and mayor over restrictions on indoor dining. Il Bacco is just 500 feet away from neighboring Nassau County, where indoor dining would likely not close in the coming days.
Though Oppedisano said she doubted the governor would go through with pulling the plug on indoor dining next week, she has been looking into third-party delivery apps like Grubhub and debating whether to spend money on heating.
“As long as we are abiding by all the laws and all the safety precautions,” she said, “I don’t understand why we can’t just conduct our business.”

Who gets the first batch of vaccines? And the second, and the third?
This political snaggle starts with very good news. By mid-month, Texas will get up to 1.4 million first doses of the two-dose coronavirus vaccine candidates from Pfizer and Moderna, Gov. Greg Abbott said Wednesday.
That’s not enough for everybody in a state with 30 million people, and state officials have said health care workers will be first in line for the shots, followed by nursing home staffers, emergency medical service drivers, and paramedics and home health aides. The list goes on, and if you think about the numbers, it’s no surprise that most of us aren’t on it.
This pandemic won’t last forever. But it will continue while the Texas Legislature convenes to talk about COVID-19 responses and everything else. Every constituent who’s not on the early vaccine lists will have a ready audience — if not an eager one — to make a plea for a place closer to the front of the line.
Teachers are already making a compelling case. Many of them are required to teach in person, just as if the pandemic had never arrived. Some of them have underlying conditions that make exposure to the coronavirus riskier. Maybe they should be vaccinated so they can concentrate on educating children instead of weighing whether their jobs are worth the health risks.
It’s an understandable argument, and that’s why this could develop into a political hot spot. It’s fair to say there are more than 1.4 million Texans who could make compelling arguments about why they should be vaccinated sooner rather than later. Health workers already have the best spot in line — an easily defended decision to protect the people whose exposure is greatest.
You can make a list of your own for the people who ought to be early vaccine recipients, and some are already there. The numbers pile up. Early estimates from the Texas Department of State Health Services include more than 638,000 health care personnel; more than 327,000 acute care hospital employees; more than 137,000 nursing home residents; and more than 66,000 emergency medical workers. There were 365,564 teachers working in Texas public schools during the 2018-19 academic year, according to the Texas Education Agency; 79,508 certified peace officers, according to the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement; 71,377 certified or licensed first responders, according to the Department of State Health Services; and millions more people at high risk because of their work conditions — think of outbreaks at meat-processing plants and prisons — or their health conditions.
It’s going to be impossible to keep everyone happy and also to treat everyone in a way they think is fair. Too many will see “fair” as getting an early vaccine shot, and “unfair” as someone else getting one. That’s before you include lists of celebrities, executives, politicians and others who are accustomed to first-in-line status.
The rationing won’t last long, hopefully, if vaccine manufacturing is speedy enough. But it will take months to take care of everyone. The health news here is great; these vaccines were developed quickly, and the public health machinery, in this regard, appears to be doing a terrific job. It puts politicians in a pickle, though, because there’s not enough for everyone right now.
The New York Times and others developed a pretty cool tool that calculates a person’s place in line based on geography, health and demographic information. Trying it at home can be awkward: You might find that not everyone in the family is in the same place in line. That ought to make for interesting conversation at the dinner table.
The bigger, figurative dinner table — the civic one — is already getting interesting. The question of who is and is not on the front line loudly echoes last spring’s debates over which businesses are essential and which ones are not. We’re still working out the political consequences of closing and opening bars, hair salons, movie theaters, stadiums and all the rest.
Getting vaccinations for everyone who wants them appears, at the moment, to be within reach. But it will take a while, and the people delivering the shots will have to make rules for who goes first. We’ll get there, but it’s going to be uncomfortable.

Roald Dahl’s family apologizes for his anti-Semitism

Texto completo: LONDON — The family of Roald Dahl has apologized for “the lasting and understanding hurt” caused by anti-Semitic comments the author made during his lifetime.
Dahl, the writer of classic children’s books such as “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory” and “The BFG,” made several disparaging comments about Jewish people in interviews and in his writing and made no secret of his anti-Semitism.
“Those prejudiced remarks are incomprehensible to us and stand in marked contrast to the man we knew and to the values at the heart of Roald Dahl’s stories,” the Dahl family and the Roald Dahl Story Co. wrote in the online statement.
“We hope that, just as he did at his best, at his absolute worst, Roald Dahl can help remind us of the lasting impact of words,” the statement added.
The apology was in such an obscure part of the author’s website that it was unclear how long it had been there. The Sunday Times, a British newspaper, drew attention to the statement in an article Sunday.
Dahl, who died in 1990 at 74, has a complicated legacy.
His many imaginative tales — including “Matilda,” “Fantastic Mr. Fox” and “The Witches,” as well as the Charlie books and “The BFG” — have endured through the years and have been adapted into films and musicals. This year alone has seen a new take on “The Witches,” starring Anne Hathaway and Octavia Spencer, and news of a “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory” remake by Taika Waititi for Netflix, which said in 2018 that it had acquired the rights to adapt some of Dahl’s books.
But Dahl’s self-avowed anti-Semitism has cast a shadow over his work.
“There is a trait in the Jewish character that does provoke animosity,” Dahl said in an 1983 interview with The New Statesman.
He reinforced his views in another interview months before his death in 1990.
“I am certainly anti-Israel, and I have become anti-Semitic,” he said, according to The Independent, a British newspaper.
Upon Dahl’s death, Abraham Foxman, then the national director of the Anti-Defamation League in the United States, called him a “blatant and admitted anti-Semite” in a letter to The New York Times, pointing out that in a 1983 book review the author had referred to “those powerful American Jewish bankers” and claimed that the U.S. government was “utterly dominated by the great Jewish financial institutions over there.”
“Praise for Mr. Dahl as a writer must not obscure the fact that he was also a bigot,” Foxman added.
In response to a further request for comment Sunday, the Roald Dahl Story Co., which manages the copyrights and trademarks for the author, said, “Apologizing for the words of a much-loved grandparent is a challenging thing to do, but made more difficult when the words are so hurtful to an entire community.”
“These comments do not reflect what we see in his work — a desire for the acceptance of everyone equally — and were entirely unacceptable,” the company added. “We are truly sorry.”
Other elements of Dahl’s work have attracted criticism. The Oompa Loompa workers in Willy Wonka’s chocolate factory, who were first depicted as African pygmies, were recast in later editions as fictional creatures from Loompaland.
The Royal Mint, which produces currency in Britain, rejected plans to honor Dahl with a commemorative coin in 2016, the centenary of his birth, citing his anti-Semitic comments. His views also led to questions about how, or even if, his work should be viewed and consumed.
In an interview with The New York Times in 2016 about his remake of “The BFG,” director Steven Spielberg said statements attributed to the author were “a paradox,” adding that many of his books “do the opposite, embracing the differences between races and cultures and sizes and language.”
“I just admire ‘The BFG,’ and I admire his values in that, and it’s hard even for me to even believe that somebody who could write something like that could say the terrible things that had been reported,” Spielberg said.
Dahl’s widow, Felicity Dahl, and his biographer, Donald Sturrock, revealed in a BBC interview in 2017 that Charlie Bucket, the central character in “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,” was originally supposed to be Black. Sturrock said that Dahl’s agent, whom he did not name, had discouraged the idea.
Apart from his children’s books, Dahl also wrote several books for adults and screenplays, including “Chitty Chitty Bang Bang” and a James Bond film, “You Only Live Twice.”

Pat Patterson, a Wrestling Star Who Came Out, Dies at 79

Pat Patterson, the first major wrestling star to announce that he was gay, died Wednesday in Miami Beach, Florida. He was 79.
The cause of his death, in a hospital, was liver failure, said Bertrand Hébert, who collaborated with Patterson on his autobiography, “Accepted: How the First Gay Superstar Changed WWE (2016).
After decades of working his way up through regional wrestling circuits in Montreal, Boston and San Francisco, Patterson found fame in the late 1970s, when he joined the World Wrestling Federation, which later became World Wrestling Entertainment.
In the ring, Patterson was fond of surprise. Normally cast as a “heel,” the wrestling term for a villain, he attacked opponents at the exact moment a fight began. He slipped off his belt and wielded it like a whip. Digging into his tights, his hand would emerge wearing brass knuckles. His theatrics often drew booing frenzies.
“Whether I was the good guy or bad guy, I always worked best when I was the one leading the dance,” he wrote in his memoir. “The magic of what we do in a wrestling ring follows the same principle as in a good movie when the hero is down. That desperation needs to register with the audience.”
At the height of his career, he was crowned the “intercontinental champion” and headlined matches at Madison Square Garden, perhaps most famously against the wrestler known as Sgt. Slaughter in 1981. Even as he seemed to be winning the fight, Patterson staggered around the ring, playing up his seemingly grave injuries. As he was being declared the winner, he lay on the mat, acknowledging victory only with a labored raise of his fist.
As his career in the ring slowed in the mid-1980s, he joined the World Wrestling Federation as an executive, putting matches together and working with wrestlers on their shticks. He invented the Royal Rumble, a last-man-standing free-for-all with new competitors entering at regular intervals. That format is still in use today.
A close associate of Vince McMahon, the WWE chairman, Patterson occasionally reentered the ring as McMahon’s bodyguard during McMahon’s rivalry with the wrestler Stone Cold Steve Austin in the late 1990s.
He announced he was gay in 2014 during an episode of “Legends’ House,” a reality television show on the WWE Network in which retired pro wrestlers were sequestered together.
Even though his friends and some wrestling insiders knew about his sexuality, Patterson rarely discussed it and had never done so publicly.
“For once in my life, I’m going to be me now,” he said on the show. “I survived all this being gay. I lived with that for 50-some years.”
In 2015, WWE staged a “Pat Patterson Appreciation Night” in Montreal, his hometown. “Pat Patterson,” McMahon said that night, “was different in an era when different was not cool,” and he mentioned “his life partner, Louie Dondero,” whom Patterson had been with for 40 years. Alone in the ring, Patterson sang “My Way,” and the packed arena filled with chants of “Merci, Pat!”
He was born Pierre Clermont in Montreal on Jan. 19, 1941. His father, Gérard Clermont, was a milkman who later went to work for Canadair making airplane parts; his mother, Simone Lupien, was a homemaker. Pierre had four brothers and sisters and every night was relegated — tellingly, he wrote in his memoir — to a pullout bed in a closet, sharing it with a brother.
Pierre began idolizing wrestlers and training to become one at about age 14. Unable to afford tickets to fight nights, he would cadge ticket stubs from audience members at intermission and catch the second half of a show. On other nights he would sneak in by standing where the wrestlers parked their cars and offer to take their bags inside for them.
Pierre fought his first bout under the Anglophone name Pat Patterson in 1958. (He changed his name legally in 2009.) Early in his Canadian career, he recalled, he sometimes traveled to towns “near the end of the known world” and wrestled there for five dollars a night.
When he was 16, he discovered a gay bar. With his first gay sexual experience, he wrote in his memoir, he found two things that had been largely missing from his life: “tenderness and affection.” He wound up coming out to his father, who responded with an epithet and demanded that he move out.
After graduating from his high school in Montreal, École Jean-Baptiste Meilleur, Patterson found a suitcase in a garbage can and headed for Boston, where he had once introduced himself to a wrestling promoter.
He also met Dondero in Boston, and the two remained a couple until Dondero died of a heart attack in 1998.
Though Patterson encountered homophobia in professional wrestling, he also found acceptance. Mad Dog Vachon was one of several fellow fighters who made a point of befriending Dondero and encouraging Patterson to bring him along when they traveled.
“I never introduced Louie as my boyfriend,” he wrote in his memoir. “It was always ‘my friend Louie.’ I still can’t call him my boyfriend. Somehow that feels wrong. He will always be ‘my friend Louie.’ And to me that’s so much more than a boyfriend.”
He is survived by four siblings: Claudette Clermont-Paquin, Lise Clermont and Michel and Richard Clermont.
Coming out proved to be one of his happiest decisions, Patterson wrote. And it resulted in an encounter he treasured, in Los Angeles in 2014.
“A FedEx truck slammed on the brakes in the middle of the street as I was walking on the sidewalk,” Patterson recalled in his memoir. “The driver, who was a big guy, jumped out of his truck and came toward me to tell me he was gay, too. He gave me a big hug, thanked me again, took a picture, jumped right back in his truck and drove off.”

WASHINGTON — In choosing a slate of doctors to testify about coronavirus treatments before his committee Tuesday, Sen. Ron Johnson has assembled a cast of witnesses who question much of the public health consensus about the virus.
There is a prominent vaccine skeptic, an outspoken critic of masking and social distancing, and at least two doctors who have promoted the use of an anti-parasitic drug that government scientists have recommended against using to treat the coronavirus.
It is the latest example of how Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican who has used his powerful investigative panel to amplify groundless accusations pushed by President Donald Trump, has now embraced the role of the Senate’s leading COVID contrarian.
Even as some of his Republican colleagues have sought to use their platforms to encourage Americans to take precautions against the spread of the virus and persuade the public that vaccines against it will be safe and vital, Johnson has suggested that the dangers of the coronavirus have been overblown and excessively regulated. And twice in the past three weeks, Johnson has used his gavel on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee to elevate voices who public health experts say represent fringe beliefs.
It has set off something of a quiet mutiny on the panel, enraging Democrats who plan to essentially boycott the traditional cross-examination of witnesses and unsettling some Republicans who are planning to skip Tuesday’s session lest their presence be seen as lending credence to the proceeding.
The selections underscore the extent to which Johnson, a former plastics baron who has made little secret of his disdain for the Washington establishment, has eagerly echoed the most conspiracy-minded and anti-science impulses of Trump and waded headfirst into battles even the president’s usually reliable phalanx of congressional defenders have been unwilling to fight.
Johnson spent much of the year pursuing a corruption inquiry into President-elect Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, that he conceded was driven by Biden’s political campaign, and that ultimately found no wrongdoing by the elder Biden. Since the election, he has questioned whether Biden won fairly, saying last week that Attorney General William Barr should produce proof to back up his statement that the Justice Department had found no evidence of the kind of widespread voter fraud Trump has baselessly insisted cost him the election.
Johnson is unfazed by the criticism he has attracted.
In an interview Monday, he said that while he supported widespread vaccination and masking, he believed that many of his colleagues had been too deferential to a public health establishment that, because of its obsession with finding a vaccine and lack of experience treating coronavirus patients, had undermined, neglected and even “censored” other potential treatments that he believes could help.
“We have grossly overreacted to this,” Johnson said of the virus. “We have not been smart. We should have isolated the sick, protected the vulnerable and then the rest of us carry on with our lives as safely as possible.”
Johnson’s lead witness Tuesday, Dr. Jane M. Orient, has cast doubts on coronavirus vaccines and has pushed for the use of hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug pushed by Trump, as a treatment. She helps run a group that believes government vaccine mandates violate human rights.
Another, Washington cardiologist Ramin Oskoui, said on Fox News last month that it was “settled science” that “social distancing doesn’t work, quarantining doesn’t work, masks don’t work.” On the contrary, it is settled science that all three are effective in limiting the spread of the virus.
Two others promote the use of ivermectin, a drug often used to fight lice and pinworms, to treat coronavirus patients, despite the National Institutes of Health’s recommendation against its use outside clinical trials.
Johnson said he felt that the public had a right to learn about early treatments they might not otherwise be aware of.
“There’s a blackout on good information in social media and media,” he said. “So people are being denied information to make intelligent choices themselves.”
Sen. Gary Peters of Michigan, the top Democrat on the panel, fretted that the witnesses would “amplify theories that are at odds with the broader scientific community and, according to experts, could cause harm.”
“These fringe views run counter to what the Senate should be doing — working on a bipartisan basis to protect the American people and tackle this deadly pandemic,” Peters said.
He pointedly declined to invite a witness to Tuesday’s hearing, and his aides said he did not plan to engage with the witnesses during the session. Instead, he is working with a group of a dozen prominent health experts to draft a letter to submit for the Congressional Record challenging their views.
Johnson’s inflammatory public statements and his decision to give a platform to an assortment of contrarian doctors promoting alternative treatments have also irked some fellow Republicans, who have privately groused that he is acting irresponsibly. But in the clubby Senate, few are willing to criticize a colleague openly or challenge a chairman on how he runs his committee.
Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, who had criticized the Hunter Biden inquiry as politicized, conspicuously skipped questioning witnesses at the earlier coronavirus hearing and does not plan to attend Tuesday. Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio, who is slated to take the top Republican slot on the panel in January after Johnson’s term as chairman ends, has gone out of his way to project trust for the scientific consensus on the coronavirus, publicly announcing last month that he had signed up for a vaccine trial in part to persuade Americans that it was safe.
Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, who tangled with Johnson at a November hearing dedicated to hydroxychloroquine, called that event “a powerful reminder that not even Congress is immune to toxic conspiracy theories.”
At the hearing, Johnson wondered aloud why medical professionals like Jha had scorned the drug, which has repeatedly been shown to be ineffective at treating coronavirus patients, and were supporting another drug, remdesivir, which has been shown to work but is more expensive.
“I question the fact that because this cocktail costs about $20 and remdesivir costs $3,000, that maybe there’s a little bias, maybe there’s a little conflict, maybe there’s a little agenda,” the senator said.
“He’s giving platforms to people who are way outside of the mainstream medical community,” Jha said in an interview.
Johnson said his own coronavirus infection in early October — “I had two positive tests. I guess they’re valid,” he said — did not require treatment.
Johnson’s interest in health issues is long-standing and consistent with his more recent statements. He was the lead sponsor, for example, of so-called right-to-try legislation that Congress overwhelmingly approved in 2018 to allow seriously ill patients to bypass the Food and Drug Administration and use unproven experimental treatments.
“He has always been a contrarian person,” said Mark Becker, former county chairman of the Wisconsin Republican Party, who recently wrote an op-ed for The Bulwark, a website with a bent toward “Never Trump” conservatism, about a recent call with Johnson.
“But everything on the Republican side has turned to be a political argument, even a public health crisis,” Becker said. “And he still cares about not pissing off those Trumpers. He said that to me very clearly: ‘I’m not going to piss them off.’”
The calculation is most likely a shrewd one as the senator looks toward running for a third term in 2022 in a competitive state where he has twice been elected by narrow margins. Though he initially pledged to serve only two terms, Johnson has since hinted that he may feel compelled to run again, arguing that times have changed. Trump’s vocal support could be key.
Thomas Nelson, the Outagamie County executive and a Democrat challenging Johnson, predicted that voters would remember Johnson using a powerful perch in Washington to publicly explore “rabbit holes of bizarre conspiracies.”
“What’s wrong with you? I mean, what is wrong with you?” Nelson said in an interview. “Do you not see the existential threat that communities like your hometown are facing, have been facing?”

LONDON — With time running out and the gaps still wide, Prime Minister Boris Johnson took personal control of the Brexit negotiations Monday, declaring that he would travel to Brussels later this week for a last-ditch effort to strike a trade agreement between Britain and the European Union.
Johnson’s announcement, after a 90-minute phone call with the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, raised the stakes as the talks enter their endgame. After 11 months of grinding negotiations, it appears, only a face-to-face meeting of political leaders can produce a breakthrough.
“We agreed that the conditions for finalizing an agreement are not there,” Johnson and von der Leyen said in a statement, adding that they had asked their negotiators to “prepare an overview of the remaining differences to be discussed in a physical meeting in Brussels in the coming days.”
The key sticking points, they said, were fishing rights, and state aid and fair competition for industry — issues that have divided the two sides from the start.
Analysts welcomed Johnson’s readiness to jump in, which came after days of intensive negotiations that had failed to narrow the gaps. With a deadline of Dec. 31 to conclude a deal, there were growing fears that the talks might end in failure, throwing Britain’s relationship with the 27-nation bloc into flux.
“Would Boris Johnson really go to Brussels if there were no longer any hope?” said Mujtaba Rahman, an analyst at the political risk consultancy Eurasia Group. “It is the moment either for a deal, or for a final attempt to demonstrate that both sides have tried very hard to get to a deal that was ultimately out of reach.”
If Johnson’s talks with von der Leyen were to fail to break the impasse, Britain’s strategy, Rahman said, would be to put the issue on the agenda of EU heads of government, who are gathering in Brussels on Thursday.
That reflects a belief that the negotiators have achieved as much as they can, and that a new political impetus is needed to break the deadlock. But Rahman warned that if Britain saw it as an opportunity to try to fracture the unity of the EU member states, that would likely backfire.
Britain left the European Union in January, but little has changed yet because it remains tied to the bloc’s trade rules through the end of the year. That arrangement was supposed to give London and Brussels time to hammer out a long-term trade agreement.
Failure to strike a deal would compound the damage done by the coronavirus pandemic on both sides of the English Channel. But it would have far greater implications in Britain, where it would mean new trade barriers with the country’s biggest partner, as well as potential friction with the United States.
Even with a deal, there will be more checks on goods at border points. The British intend to phase in most of these controls over six months to limit disruption, but France is unlikely to do the same, which could leave cross-Channel ports clogged and ferries stranded.
On Monday, Downing Street accepted that food prices would likely rise in Britain without a trade deal, though it argued these hikes would be modest. Food importers have warned that some products, including some fruit and vegetables, could disappear temporarily from grocery shelves.
Tariffs could have a devastating effect on some sectors and put the government under enormous pressure to step in to provide compensation. Among the hardest hit would be sheep farmers, whose exports of lamb to the European Union would be hit by tariffs likely to average around 48%.
Some automakers are warning that the imposition of export tariffs could make their business untenable. Even with a trade deal, they could face problems, depending on the fine print of the agreement and the specifications of what proportion of non-British components they are allowed to use in manufacturing.
“Take a moment to step back from the details and reflect on the sheer absurdity of breaking away from our nearest neighbours, who take 45% of our exports, without even a basic trade deal,” wrote Peter Ricketts, a former British national security adviser, on Twitter.
There would be problems on the European side, too, particularly for Ireland, whose economy is linked closely to Britain’s. German, French, Dutch and Belgian companies would suffer as well, though the pain would likely be more spread out, reducing its effect in any single country.
That has led European diplomats to conclude that Britain holds the weaker hand, particularly as its prospects of striking a trade deal with the United States have dimmed since Joe Biden became president-elect.
Nonetheless, Johnson’s ultimate decision on any possible deal probably depends on his calculation of the blowback from his own restive Conservative Party backbench lawmakers. The pro-Brexit faction forced out Johnson’s predecessor, Theresa May, and has warned Johnson he has limited room for maneuver.
“The hard-line minority in Johnson’s party wield a lot of weight, especially when they play on the sovereignty heartstrings,” said Bobby McDonagh, a former Irish ambassador to Britain. “There is a view of sovereignty in London that is hard to come to grips with because it doesn’t seem to take account of the sovereignty of other countries.”
On Monday, the Johnson government brought back to the House of Commons a bill that would renege on parts of its withdrawal agreement with Brussels that relate to Northern Ireland — a reversal that has infuriated many European officials. The House of Lords had rejected parts of the legislation, which the government acknowledges violate international law.
But in separate meetings, British officials extended an olive branch, telling European Union officials that they would strike the offending language from the legislation if the two sides struck a trade deal.
Britain’s treatment of Northern Ireland is also important to its relationship with Biden. He expressed concern during the campaign that Johnson’s negotiating tactics could threaten the Good Friday Agreement, which settled decades of sectarian violence in Northern Ireland.
The terms of Britain’s trade relationship with the United States will not change, with or without a Brexit deal. It will be covered by World Trade Organization rules, as it was before Brexit.
Biden has ruled out new trade agreements with any country until the United States improves its own competitiveness. Trade experts warned that Britain could be handicapped in other ways if the talks with Brussels ended in failure.
“If there is no U.K.-EU deal, it will make it very difficult to reach agreement with the U.S., including on such basic topics as rules of origin, agriculture trade and food safety,” said Daniel M. Price, a former top trade adviser to President George W. Bush.

Uber, After Years of Trying, Is Handing Off Its Self-Driving Car Project

Uber, which spent hundreds of millions of dollars on a self-driving car project that executives once believed was a key to becoming profitable, is handing the autonomous vehicle effort over to a Silicon Valley startup, the companies said Monday.
Uber will also invest $400 million in the startup, called Aurora, so it is essentially paying the company to take over the autonomous car operation, which had become a financial and legal headache. Uber is likely to license whatever technology Aurora manages to create.
The deal amounts to a fire-sale end to a high-profile but star-crossed effort to replace Uber’s human drivers with machines that could drive on their own. It is also indicative of the challenges facing other autonomous vehicle projects, which have received billions in investments from Silicon Valley and automakers but have not produced the fleets of robotic vehicles some thought would be on the streets by now.
Aurora’s chief executive, Chris Urmson, said Aurora’s first product will not be a robot taxi that could help with Uber’s ride-hailing business. Instead, it will likely be a self-driving truck, which Urmson believes has a better chance of success in the near term because long-haul truck driving on highways is more predictable and does not involve passengers.
In a statement, the Uber chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, said he was looking forward to bringing Aurora technology to market “in the years ahead.” Uber declined to comment further on the agreement.
Among self-driving car projects, Uber’s effort, which led to the death of a pedestrian in Arizona; a lawsuit from Waymo, the self-driving car company owned by the same parent company as Google; and a guilty plea from a former Uber executive accused of stealing intellectual property, was particularly fraught.
It began with an ambitious — but in hindsight fanciful — proposition: Uber’s biggest expense was its drivers. If it could replace the drivers with machines, it could eventually reduce expenses and become profitable, ending years and billions of losses.
Uber began its work on autonomous vehicles around 2015 when it announced a partnership with Carnegie Mellon University’s National Robotics Center. Uber poached 40 engineers and scientists from Carnegie Mellon later, establishing the foundation for its autonomous vehicle unit, called the Uber Advanced Technologies Group, or ATG. It came to have 1,200 employees.
In 2016, Uber acquired autonomous trucking startup Otto, led by Anthony Levandowski, a former Google engineer. When Google first tested its self-driving car on public roads a decade ago, Levandowski and Urmson, who played a key role in Google’s original self-driving car project before co-founding Aurora, were two of the project’s engineers. The test was a milestone that eventually led to an investment frenzy.
The acquisition, which valued Otto at $680 million, turned sour when Waymo filed a lawsuit against Uber in early 2017, claiming that Levandowski had stolen trade secrets from Google. Uber fired Levandowski, and though the case went to trial, the companies eventually settled. Uber agreed to give Google a stake in the company valued at $72 million.
Federal prosecutors charged Levandowski with 33 counts of theft and attempted theft of trade secrets from Google. He was sentenced to 18 months in prison earlier this year.
The death of a woman in Tempe, Arizona, in March 2018 — ultimately attributed to driver error and other safety shortcomings — was a grim turning point for Uber and other self-driving car projects. Uber and other companies suspended their road tests. Even after tests resumed, new investments slowed. When Uber finally returned its cars to the road, they continued to fall short of expectations.
In 2018, Uber received a $500 million investment from Toyota to help keep the self-driving unit afloat. The investment marked a shift in Uber’s strategy, signaling that the company no longer wanted to develop its own self-driving car but rather plug its navigation technology into a vehicle made by a traditional manufacturer.
A year later, Toyota added to its investment, partnering with Denso and the SoftBank Vision Fund to pour $1 billion into Uber’s self-driving effort. The deal valued Uber’s ATG at $7.25 billion. The cash infusion bought ATG some time, but its long-term future at Uber remained unclear. The unit was expensive to operate, though Uber maintained it would become profitable by 2021.
In 2019, when a well-known startup sold itself to Apple, the nascent autonomous vehicle industry began to consolidate.
The coronavirus pandemic presented more problems. It curtailed testing because social-distancing rules prevented companies from keeping multiple drivers in cars to guard against accidents. Some industry veterans admitted that success was further away than they had expected.
The pandemic also put financial strain on Uber, which saw its core ride-hailing business decline as people stopped traveling. Investors had long pressured Khosrowshahi to sell the self-driving unit. The demands became more urgent as Uber’s revenue plummeted.
Aurora has its headquarters in Silicon Valley but also runs an office in Pittsburgh, where its chief technology officer, Drew Bagnell, a Carnegie Mellon professor and former Uber employee, works. As well as acquiring Uber’s self-driving technology it is acquiring engineers and support staff, most of whom are based in Pittsburgh. In all, it employs 600 people.
As part of the agreement between the two companies, Uber is taking a 26% stake in the startup and Khosrowshahi will take a seat on the Aurora board of directors.
“Uber can still have a hand in the game, without putting out the enormous amount of money they were spending with ATG, but still have a path to market when this technology is actually deployable in several years,” said Elliot Katz, co-founder and chief business officer of Phantom Auto, a startup that helps companies remotely control autonomous vehicles.
In 2018, Aurora agreed to supply self-driving technology to Volkswagen Group and Hyundai, two of the world’s largest car companies. But both Volkswagen and Hyundai have since embraced other partners amid the wider industry shakeout, and Volkswagen is no longer working with Aurora.
For months, Urmson has said that his startup’s first product would involve long-haul trucking. The Uber deal, he said, will not change that.
“If you are a passenger in the back of a vehicle and the driver is too cautious, that can be frustrating, and if they are not cautious enough, that’s scary,” he said. “If you are a roll of toilet paper in the back of a truck, that is a different matter.”

MOSCOW — Alexei Zakharov, a Moscow economics professor, got the Russian coronavirus vaccine injected into his upper arm over the weekend.
Getting the shot was an easy decision, he said — not because the Russian government said it was safe, but because scores of Russians have shared their experience with it on social media.
“I trust the grassroots collection of information far more, of course, than what the state says, at least before the testing results are available and published in a medical journal,” Zakharov, 44, said in a telephone interview Monday, already clear of a mild fever — a side-effect of the vaccine. “There’s no safe, no-risk option here. Either you get the vaccine or you risk getting sick.”
Russia made its coronavirus vaccine available for free in recent days to teachers, medical workers and social-service employees younger than 61 in Moscow. But even more than in the West, a lack of trust is hobbling Russia’s rollout of a vaccine: The country’s scientists may well have made great strides in battling the pandemic, but many Russians are not ready to believe it.
That distrust looms large as Russia races to roll out the vaccine while facing the fiercest onslaught of the pandemic yet, with some 500 deaths per day.
The government, in part, has itself to blame. President Vladimir Putin proclaimed in August that Russia had become the first country in the world to approve a vaccine for the novel coronavirus, to great fanfare in the state media, even though it had not been tested in a large-scale medical trial. Putin said the vaccine worked “effectively enough,” given the health emergency, but critics charged that he was dangerously short-circuiting the long-established process for developing safe vaccines.
In research afterward, an independent polling institute, the Levada Center, found that the first-in-the-world bombast may have only deepened Russians’ suspicions: in October, 59% of respondents said they would not get a coronavirus vaccine, even if it was voluntary and free of charge.
Denis Volkov, Levada’s deputy director, said the typical response on the matter in focus groups was: “On the one hand, we are happy that we are first. But we won’t get it ourselves — let it go through the trials.”
“I’m not planning on getting vaccinated because half the people say it’s not a particularly good idea,” Valery Patrin, a 21-year-old jazz orchestra musician, said in an interview in Moscow on Monday. “There’s no way the vaccine will be tested normally.”
Alexei Navalny, the Russian opposition leader now recuperating in Germany from a nerve-agent attack, voiced doubts about the safety of the vaccine Saturday, calling on top government officials to get vaccinated themselves “under the eye of doctors and journalists.” While many members of the Russian elite — from top business executives and governors to the editor of the Kremlin’s RT television network — have said they have already gotten the vaccine, Putin has not, although he says his daughter has.
The Russian government entity that makes the vaccine being distributed says its product is 95% effective, but outside experts are skeptical of those claims. The name of the vaccine, Sputnik V, suggests the Kremlin views the vaccine as part of its competition with the West: Sputnik was the first satellite launched by the Soviet Union, in 1957, a high point for Moscow during the Cold War.
“Our Sputnik V is unpretentious and reliable, like the Kalashnikov rifle,” state television host Dmitry Kiselyov said on his show last month, describing the Russian vaccine as superior to the one co-developed by the U.S. company Pfizer.
At a state-run community clinic in the neighborhood of Golyanovo, on the outskirts of Moscow, on Monday morning, a steady stream of people who had previously signed up for a time slot online presented identification and paperwork showing they worked in education, medicine or social services. Clinic employees checked patients’ medical records for issues like allergies or having received a different vaccine in the last 30 days, then performed a quick checkup.
“I believe that before referring my patients, I need to be a pioneer,” a 38-year-old physician, Lyudmila Soboleva, said as she waited for her shot. “I need to get vaccinated myself.”
A nurse removed a vial of the vaccine, containing five doses, from a special freezer showing a temperature of minus 36 degrees Fahrenheit, and waited for it to thaw. Along with the half-milliliter shot of adenovirus-based vaccine, the patients received a stamped immunization certificate and a pamphlet explaining that nausea and fatigue were normal side effects.
Before leaving, they signed up to come back for a booster shot in three weeks.
“We have one feeling: pride,” said Maria V. Sokolova, the clinic’s head doctor. “After all, we were the first to develop a vaccine, and now we are the first in the world to begin vaccinations.”
Indeed, Russia is pushing ahead with its vaccination approval and administration one step faster than Western countries, although the rollout has been hobbled by production challenges. On Wednesday, the country’s health minister, Mikhail Murashko, said that more than 100,000 people had been vaccinated with Sputnik V, including members of the military.
But that is a fraction of the country’s population of 140 million. If Russia’s vaccination effort is to succeed, it appears likely that it will depend on positive word-of-mouth. Over the summer, polling firm Ipsos found Russians to be more skeptical of a coronavirus vaccine than the public anywhere else in the 27 countries polled.
Only 27% of Russians trust the official data on the coronavirus, according to Levada. Of those who do not, about half believe the numbers are too high, and half believe the numbers are too low. The distrust, Levada’s Volkov said, is in line with Russians’ overall disenchantment with Putin after years of economic stagnation.
“There is a disbelief in official information, by default,” Volkov said.
And yet, there are also many critics of Putin who see Russian-made vaccines — three are in Phase 3 trials — as their country’s best path out of the pandemic. Some Russians participating in the trials have been sharing their antibody-test results and side effects in groups on Facebook and the Telegram messaging app.
The volunteers’ general conclusion: the Sputnik V vaccine does appear to coax the body to produce COVID-19 antibodies, mostly without serious side effects. The organizer of one Facebook group of trial volunteers, Vera Smirnova, said she often criticized the government but was disappointed that many Russian liberals reflexively rejected the vaccine because of its association with the Kremlin.
“It makes me very sad. The price of this will be human lives,” said Smirnova, who is 42 and works as a university instructor in Moscow. “I think this is a moment in which, perhaps, we need to try to trust the authorities, because in the coming months we won’t have any other option.”

Elizabeth J. McCormack, a former Roman Catholic nun who was the catalyst for sweeping changes at Manhattanville College in the 1960s and ’70s, and who later advised major foundations on philanthropic strategies, died Friday at her home in Manhattan. She was 98.
Her grandson Nicholas Arons confirmed the death.
In recent decades McCormack had been one of the nation’s most influential philanthropic counselors, guiding the Rockefeller family, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation and other donors on the arts of humanitarian giving.
But she was best known to an earlier generation as the audacious president of Manhattanville, an independent liberal arts college in Purchase, New York, in Westchester County, from 1966-74. She oversaw Manhattanville’s transformation from a women’s college to a coeducational institution. It was an era of cultural turmoil, when the relevancy and even the survival of small Catholic women’s colleges were in doubt.
To many traditional Catholics, McCormack had some unthinkable ideas. She recognized a contradiction in a college culturally bound to church traditions but dedicated to intellectual freedom. And in what the church regards as a cardinal sin but what she called compassion, she quietly advised a student on how to obtain an abortion.
McCormack was a nun for 30 years, but as she came to question church teachings on a number of issues, she obeyed her conscience and left her order, the Society of the Sacred Heart. At 54, she married a divorced Jewish father of five children.
In her eight years as the college’s president, she never kept a paycheck, secretly turning each one over to her order. Later, as an adviser to philanthropies on the distribution of vast fortunes, she earned millions of dollars in salary herself and gave much of it away.
“I think now in retrospect I didn’t want the life that I would have had, had I not become a nun,” she told Charles Kenney for his book “No Ordinary Life: The Biography of Elizabeth J. McCormack” (2012). “I actually, from many points of view, had a much fuller life. I had a career. I was educated. I learned leadership. It really gave me an awful good life.”
Founded by a Catholic religious order as an academy for women in 1841 and reorganized as a college in 1917, Manhattanville College of the Sacred Heart had long been a school of choice for young women from affluent and middle-class Catholic families. Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy and some of her daughters and daughters-in-law were among the graduates.
While not funded or controlled by the church, the college had always been identified with Roman Catholicism. Prayer and Masses were elements of life. Gregorian chant was a required course. Many teachers were Sacred Heart nuns. McCormack, a 1944 Manhattanville graduate, wore the order’s black habit for much of her presidency.
But to win state and federal grants, as well as more students, single-sex education and ties to Catholicism had to go. As she told Kenney: “It became clear to me that it was change or go out of business, and what the change had to be was making the college available to a larger pool of students — Catholic, Protestant, Jewish, male, female. It was change or die.”
In stages, McCormack transformed an elite, traditionally Catholic women’s school into a nonsectarian coeducational college with a new name, progressive curriculums and a more racially, ethnically and religiously diverse student body and faculty.
“I did some very difficult things, which were important for the future of the college,” McCormack said in an interview for this obituary in 2017. “I received praise and blame. But I believe one has to make difficult decisions and stick to them.”
Dismantling the school’s Catholic identity meant dropping the Sacred Heart name and cherished symbols of Christianity, including hundreds of crucifixes. McCormack and three young nuns gathered them up from all over the campus and, with groundskeepers’ shovels, buried them in the woods behind a playing field.
They did it on a Good Friday, the commemoration of the burial of Christ.
“We thought it was an appropriate day,” she told Kenney.
She introduced curriculum changes over four years, eliminating grades and course requirements for graduation in favor of a “portfolio system,” with students charting their own courses of study and keeping portfolios of their work and extracurricular activities. A faculty board judged their achievements for graduation.
There were painful adjustments. In 1969, Black students occupied a classroom building, accusing the college of tolerating racism. McCormack did not call the police, but in five days of talks with protesters, she insisted that racial justice and the rights of the college community were valid causes. She made no definitive promises, and the protesters left peacefully after a week.
Manhattanville began admitting men in the 1971-72 academic year. A dormitory became coed, and curfews were dropped. By the end of her tenure, enrollment, 935 students when she started, had more than doubled, to 2,000, and government grants and private endowments were starting to roll in.
Over the years there were fusillades of protest from parents, alumnae and traditional Catholics, and once a bomb threat. McCormack said she received a picture of a stained-glass window depicting Judas kissing Jesus.
“This is you, Sister,” an anonymous alumna wrote.
“My thought was, ‘We certainly didn’t teach you Christian charity,’” McCormack told The New York Times.
But, Kenney wrote, “many of her accomplishments drew little controversy and set her mark upon the institution for many years to come.” He added, “The changes Elizabeth made almost certainly saved the college from closing.”
Even before stepping down as Manhattanville’s president, she had begun to question Catholic teachings on celibacy, birth control, divorce, homosexuality and abortion. She also questioned her own vocation. In 1974, she was released from her vows.
By then, she said, she was in love with Jerome Aron, whom she had hired as the college’s chief financial officer in 1969. After his divorce, they were married in 1976 by a rabbi, and then in 1978 in a Catholic ceremony. Aron died in 2004.
In addition to Nicholas Arons, her grandson, McCormack is survived by four of Jerome Aron’s children, Nan, Peter, Betsy and Mark Aron; six other grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren.
Elizabeth Jane McCormack was born in Manhattan on March 7, 1922, one of two children of George and Natalie (Duffy) McCormack. Her father was the president of an architectural firm. In 1926, the family moved to Larchmont, New York.
She attended St. Augustine’s Academy in Larchmont, and in 1940 she graduated from Maplehurst, a Catholic girls’ boarding school in the Bronx. She read voraciously, especially the Romantic poets Shelley, Keats and Coleridge.
McCormack attended Mass daily at Manhattanville and was in her senior year when she decided to become a nun. She took her final vows in Rome in 1952. After four years as headmistress of a Catholic high school in Greenwich, Connecticut, she earned a master’s degree at Providence College in Rhode Island and a doctorate at Fordham University in the Bronx. She joined the Manhattanville staff in 1958 and was a dean and administrator before becoming president.
McCormack became a philanthropic adviser to the Rockefeller family in 1974. She had little money, and a Rockefeller lawyer asked about that.
“She pulled out past checks that she had received as salary for being the college president — seven years’ worth of checks, and every one — one after the other — was signed over to the Society of the Sacred Heart,” Kenney recalled. “She had never cashed her paychecks.”
She began advising 22 Rockefeller cousins, the great-grandchildren of the patriarch, John D. Rockefeller. Their interests were scattered. But her personalized guidance focused on conservation, health, education, the arts and other beneficiaries.
McCormack, who lived in Manhattan, became a trustee of the Population Council, chairwoman of the MacArthur Foundation and a director of the Atlantic Philanthropies, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and dozens of other foundations, corporations and colleges.
“To use your money to make a difference is something one has to learn,” McCormack wrote in a 2004 article for The Chronicle of Philanthropy. “You have to think broadly, and in my opinion, give narrowly.”

Christmas Trees — an Elusive Bit of Happiness for Canadians

TORONTO — Scott Lunau was steering apple pickers onto his farm in mid-November when a customer asked if it was too early to cut down a Christmas tree. He scrambled out to the barn to find the wrapping machine and netting needed to tie up a tree like a package, ready for a roof rack.
“I thought I had a few crazy people who wanted to get trees early,” said Lunau, owner of Albion Orchards, a 50-acre farm 25 minutes northwest of Toronto. With six weeks to go before Christmas, he wondered if they were going on a trip and planned to celebrate early.
Instead, they were harbingers of the storm of early Christmas tree shoppers that would descend on his farm, and many others across the country, just as COVID-19 rates began to rise at alarming rates.
Christmas has come early to Canada, it seems, with parts of the country hunkered down since November. Its biggest city, Toronto, and two of its large suburbs went into lockdown two weeks ago. Since there is little Christmas shopping, few Christmas parties and fewer of the Christmas pageants that are a hallmark of the country’s annual celebration, all that festive energy is being squeezed into private happy-making — centered around the traditional Christmas tree.
Weeks before the first Saturday of December, when Canadians usually start looking for their trees, many cut-your-own Christmas tree farms were already picked clean, sold-out signs put up on Christmas tree lots and nurseries declared they were out of inventory. If toilet paper shortages and bare shelves in the baking aisle of grocery stores were the symbol of the coronavirus’s first crash through Canada, then Christmas trees are quickly becoming the symbol of the virus’s second wave.
“We’ve been trying for four days to find more,” said Steve Watson, who runs a large Christmas tree lot in Toronto’s Beaches neighborhood that was picked dry a week after it opened in November. “Someone offered me three times the price to give them a tree last night. It’s definitely COVID-panic.”
Christmas is Canada’s biggest holiday of the year. Traditionally, it is marked by large gatherings — Christmas markets, Christmas concerts, tree lightings and Santa Claus parades that weave through crowded streets packed with viewers who arrive hours early to mark their spot.
This year, as coronavirus rates break records across the country, most of those have been canceled.
François Legault, the premier of Quebec, had been among the few political leaders to condone small gatherings over the holidays. Last Thursday, he reversed his stand, saying the province’s soaring rates meant that family gatherings of any size were “not a good idea.”
On Friday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau weighed in. “We knew it wouldn’t be a normal Christmas,” he said. “Now we are going to have to try to connect differently with our loved ones.” He added, “It’s going to be a difficult time.”
Many Canadians who fly across the country to see family or escape south to the tropics for a few weeks of precious sun, have canceled those trips. About 70% of Canada’s 110,000 snowbirds, who typically head to Florida, California and Arizona for winter, decided to stay put, according to the Canadian Snowbird Association’s spokesman, Evan Rachkovsky.
Taken together, that makes for many more Christmas tree buyers — pushing sales across the country up by 25%, said Shirley Brennan, executive director of the Canadian Christmas Trees Association, a growers’ group.
“People want hope,” she said. “Christmas trees give them hope.”
That same motivation seems prevalent in Britain, several Western European countries and parts of the United States, where demand for trees — at tree farms, tree stands and online — is breaking records.
In Canada, the increase is not entirely the result of locked-down crazed shopping; it is part of a trend. Over the last five years, Canadian Christmas tree farm sales have more than doubled, to $108 million, or $138 million Canadian dollars, in 2019. That coincided with a lower supply, particularly in the United States, where the 2008 recession put many tree farms out of business and caused others to plant fewer trees.
Since the perfect Christmas tree takes about 10 years to grow, the market is still feeling the results now, said Doug Drysdale, a Christmas tree farmer. About half of Canadian tree sales go across the border into the United States, according to Statistics Canada.
“The U.S. is desperately short of trees,” said Drysdale, whose Drysdale Tree Farms is among the largest cut-your-own Christmas tree operations in the country. Two American wholesalers called him in August, looking for 50,000 trees each — enough to wipe out his entire inventory for years, he said.
On the first Saturday in December, which is officially Christmas Tree Day in Ontario, two parking lots in front of Drysdale’s farm an hour north of Toronto were jammed with cars. This year, because of coronavirus concerns, Drysdale was not offering his usual Christmas village fare — no carolers, no Santa for children to climb on, no horse-drawn carriage rides through the woods or bonfires over which to toast marshmallows. But it did not seem to matter.
“We’re all stuck inside,” said John Grogan, a 67-year-old retired electrician, standing in a long line of families waiting to board a wagon and be towed out into the Christmas tree fields. “Everybody needs something to cheer them up. This is the way to do it.”
Grogan’s grandchildren played around him, wearing masks. Since the coronavirus rates began to soar in the area, they had stopped coming into his home to be sure not to infect him or his wife, he said.
“This is our opportunity to be together again,” he said.
For some growers like Drysdale, the Christmas tree phase has come as a welcome boost to lagging profits because they have raised tree prices. For others, it has simply meant barren fields.
“When we are done, we are done,” said Matthew Whitney, who runs a small Christmas tree farm three hours west of Toronto. “We can only plant so many trees a year. We have to be strict, so you are not selling trees that are for next year.” The Christmas spirit kept him from raising prices — it was a tough year on everyone, he said, “when people weren’t as flush as they usually are.”
After only two weekends open, Whitney sold all 600 trees, around half to new customers who had never bought a real tree before. That means he and wife will have a novel Christmas season, without the bustle of customers arriving to their farm.
“That’s a refreshing change,” he said. “We can sit back and enjoy it.”

Biden Plans to Tap Lloyd Austin, Former Iraq Commander, as Defense Secretary

WASHINGTON — President-elect Joe Biden is expected to nominate retired Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, a former commander of the U.S. military effort in Iraq, to be the next secretary of defense, according to two people with knowledge of the selection.
If confirmed by the Senate, Austin would make history as the first African American to lead the country’s 1.3 million active-duty troops and the enormous bureaucracy that backs them up.
Austin, 67, was for years a formidable figure at the Pentagon and is the only African American to have headed U.S. Central Command, the military’s marquee combat command, with responsibility for Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen, Syria — most of the places where the United States is at war.
Austin is known as a battlefield commander. But he is less known for his political instincts — and has sometimes stumbled in congressional hearings, including a session in 2015 when he acknowledged, under testy questioning, that the Department of Defense’s $500 million program to raise an army of Syrian fighters had gone nowhere.
He was selected over another front-runner, Michèle A. Flournoy, who had served in senior Pentagon policy jobs and mentored a generation of women in national security who had pushed for her appointment as the first female defense secretary.
Biden, who is meeting with NAACP leaders Tuesday, was facing pressure from the Congressional Black Caucus and other Black officials to name an African American to run the departments of Defense or Justice. But he also skipped over Jeh C. Johnson, a former secretary of homeland security and former general counsel at the Pentagon considered by many to be a more politically astute pick for the first Black man to head the Defense Department
It was unclear Monday night what tipped the scales for Austin. People close to the transition noted that, during the Obama presidency, Biden was unhappy with the high profile of the Pentagon, with generals like David Petraeus gaining near rock-star status, and the belief that the Pentagon rolled President Barack Obama into increasing troop numbers in Afghanistan.
Austin’s lower profile, those people suggested, may match with Biden’s hopes for a more muted Defense Department.
Still, Austin may face some pushback from lawmakers who feel strongly about civilian control of the military, and do not think a retired general can make the transition. Like Jim Mattis, who was President Donald Trump’s first defense secretary, Austin would have to get a congressional waiver to serve, since he has been out of the military for only four years and U.S. law requires a seven-year waiting period between active duty and becoming Pentagon chief.
It is not assured that Austin would get the waiver; Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, had indicated after Mattis’ confirmation that he would oppose future waivers for the post. But for Reed to reject the first African American nominated to be defense secretary, after approving Mattis, would be notable.
Austin, who retired as a four-star general in 2016 after 41 years in the military, is respected across the Army, especially among African American officers and enlisted soldiers, as one of the rare Black men to crack the glass ceiling that has kept the upper ranks of the military largely the domain of white men.
Some 43% of active-duty troops are people of color. But the people making crucial decisions are almost entirely white and male.
Supporters say Austin broke through that barrier thanks to his experience, intellect and the mentorship of a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, who plucked him to direct the staff of the Joint Chiefs’ office.
After that, Austin continued to rise in the ranks. He was named commander of Central Command by President Barack Obama in 2013.
Shortly after the 2020 election, Austin took part in an online session that Biden had with former national security officials. During that meeting, Austin impressed Biden, aides said. His selection was reported earlier by Politico.
After retiring, Austin joined the board of defense contractor Raytheon Technologies, a fact that garnered criticism Monday night.
“OH COME ON. A General and Raytheon board?” said Danielle Brian, executive director of the Project on Government Oversight, in a Twitter post. “Possibly the worst of all options. Bad news for civilian control and any real distance from the military-industrial- complex.”
But his supporters point to a long career in combat and command, including some of the most difficult assignments of the post-9/11 era.
Austin became the top commander of U.S. forces in Iraq in 2010, when the United States still had roughly 50,000 service members there. Much of the attention had moved on to other hot spots in the Middle East, but major questions still existed about the direction of Iraq, including whether any U.S. forces would remain in the country beyond 2011. Austin and his commanders were convinced that a sizable force of more than 5,000 troops needed to remain to help the fledgling Iraqi military. But the commanders on the ground were ultimately overruled by the Obama administration, which pulled out all U.S. forces by the end of 2011.
Years later that decision would be blamed for the Islamic State group’s ability to seize wide swaths of the country.
Austin’s style was far more reserved than some of the officers with marquee names who spent considerable time cultivating their public image and using the news media to maneuver policy fights with the administration.
Despite overseeing the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq after a bloody war, Austin showed little interest in the public-facing parts of the job. He avoided speaking publicly or with members of the news media, allowing others to take the lead in the messaging as the war came to an end.
Subsequently, as commander of all U.S. forces in the Middle East, Austin was the principal military architect of the U.S.-led campaign to oust the Islamic State group, after the insurgents seized territory in eastern Syria and northern Iraq the size of Britain, in June 2014.
After first spending several months helping beleaguered Iraqi forces shore up defensive positions outside the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, the United States halted the Islamic State advance elsewhere in the country’s northern third with a campaign of airstrikes to weaken and damage the insurgent ranks.
By the fall of 2015, under Austin’s leadership, the U.S.-led coalition began preparing a major front in northeastern Syria, aiming to put pressure on Raqqa, Syria, the terrorist group’s de facto capital.
Under a war plan drafted by Austin and his aides, and approved by Obama, the Pentagon took two major steps. The military, for the first time, directly provided ammunition and some weapons to Syrian opposition forces fighting the Islamic State group on the ground. Obama also endorsed Austin’s idea for an increased air campaign from Incirlik Air Base in Turkey.
Together, these measures were intended to empower 3,000 to 5,000 Arab fighters who would join more than 20,000 Kurdish combatants in an offensive backed by dozens of coalition warplanes to pressure Raqqa.
This new northern front aimed at weakening Islamic State by trying to take away the group’s home-field advantage, even as the militants held on to Mosul and Ramadi in Iraq.
In testimony in September 2015 to the Senate Armed Services Committee, Austin said that over the next six months it would put “a lot more pressure on key areas in Syria, like the city of Raqqa.”
“Because of that access,” Austin continued, referring to the use of the air base in Turkey, “we’ll have the ability to increase the pace and focus on key places in Syria. So that will certainly shake things in Iraq.”
And over time, Austin’s strategy did exactly that.
Austin is a graduate of the U.S. Military Academy. He and his wife Charlene have been married for 40 years.
Austin’s elevation would be particularly poignant for Black West Point graduates: He was reared in Thomasville, Georgia, the same town that produced Henry O. Flipper, who was born a slave and in 1877 became the first African American graduate of the academy.

Texto completo: In a simple twist of fate, Universal Music Group announced Monday that it acquired Bob Dylan's entire songwriting catalog.
Dylan's oeuvre spans nearly 60 years and more than 600 songs, and his songs have been covered by other artists more than 6,000 times.
"To represent the body of work of one of the greatest songwriters of all time — whose cultural importance can't be overstated — is both a privilege and a responsibility," Universal Music Production Group Chairman and CEO Jody Gerson said in a statement. "We look forward to working with Bob and the team in ensuring his artistry continues to reach and inspire generations of fans, recording artists and songwriters around the world."
Universal did not disclose the price of the agreement, but it is estimated at more than $300 million, according to the New York Times. When the Michael Jackson estate sold its half-share of rights to songs from Dylan, the Beatles, and others, it fetched $750 million, according to the Associated Press.
Dylan, 79, has sold more than 125 million records around the world and has continued to tour and perform his music at nearly 100 concerts each year until the coronavirus pandemic shuttered events.
Last month, a trove of the Nobel Prize-winning songwriter's thoughts on anti-Semitism and unpublished song lyrics sold at auction for roughly $495,000.
Dylan has been hailed as “one of our culture’s most influential and groundbreaking artists” since he started his career in New York City’s Greenwich Village folk music scene, according to the press release announcing the “landmark agreement.”
"As someone who began his career in music publishing, it is with enormous pride that today we welcome Bob Dylan to the UMG family," said Universal Media Group CEO Sir Lucian Grainge. "It's no secret that the art of songwriting is the fundamental key to all great music, nor is it a secret that Bob is one of the very greatest practitioners of that art. Brilliant and moving, inspiring and beautiful, insightful and provocative, his songs are timeless — whether they were written more than half a century ago or yesterday.
"It is no exaggeration to say that his vast body of work has captured the love and admiration of billions of people all around the world. I have no doubt that decades, even centuries from now, the words and music of Bob Dylan will continue to be sung and played — and cherished — everywhere."
The deal for Dylan's catalog includes 100% of his rights to every song he's written and includes both his income as a songwriter and the control of each song's copyright, according to the New York Times. Vivendi, the French conglomerate that owns Universal, will collect all future earnings from Dylan's songs.

Covid and the New Age of Censorship; It doesn't promote public health when media and tech companies stifle scientific debate.

Texto completo: Information has never been more plentiful or easier to distribute. Yet we are sliding into a new age of censorship and suppression, encouraged by technology giants and traditional media companies. As someone who's been falsely characterized as a coronavirus "denier," I have seen this crisis firsthand.
Since June, Amazon has twice tried to suppress self-published booklets I have written about Covid-19 and the response to it. These booklets don't contain conspiracy theories. Like the scientists who wrote the Great Barrington Declaration, I simply believe many measures to control the coronavirus have been damaging, counterproductive and unsupported by science.
Amazon has said earlier that "as a bookseller, we believe that providing access to the written word is important, including books that some may find objectionable." The company sells "Mein Kampf" and "The Anarchist's Cookbook." But when it comes to Covid, Amazon has a different standard. At least half a dozen other authors have emailed me that their books have been pulled. Amazon won't disclose how many, or other details about how it picks books to censor.
Google-owned YouTube censors even more aggressively. The company disclosed in October that it had pulled more than 200,000 videos about the epidemic—including one from Scott Atlas, a physician who was advising President Trump. Facebook has not only censored videos and attached warning labels or "fact checks" to news articles, but removed groups that oppose lockdowns and other restrictions.
That online entertainment and retail companies have benefited financially from lockdowns adds to the ugliness of their suppression efforts. Interestingly, Apple—whose mobile business means it gains less than other big tech companies—has been less aggressive.
Tech companies aren't alone in their efforts to stifle debate. Traditional news outlets, book publishers and even scientific journals are reluctant to publish information that challenges ideological orthodoxies. The Danish authors of a study on whether masks protect their wearers from coronavirus struggled for months to get it published, despite its obvious public-health importance. When they finally convinced a journal to print the paper, which showed that masks didn't appear to protect their wearers, the journal's editor felt compelled to write a piece defending her decision to run it.
News organizations then treated the study's findings with a skepticism absent from the coverage of most other peer-reviewed scientific research. A New York Times headline declared: "A New Study Questions Whether Masks Protect Wearers. You Need to Wear Them Anyway." Newspapers are now in the business of ordering their readers around.
Outlets like the Times are increasingly unwilling even to ask ideologically inconvenient questions. Few acknowledge that top biologists are calling for an independent investigation into the possibility that Sars-Cov-2 is the product of a Chinese laboratory accident.
Although I was a reporter at the Times for a decade and I am no conservative, almost no one there spoke up for me when Amazon refused to publish my Covid booklets. Fortunately, business leaders like Elon Musk and independent-thinking media figures like Glenn Greenwald came to my defense. Amazon eventually relented. But many other people and ideas are still being suppressed.
The book business is also constrained. Even though my Covid booklets have sold almost a quarter-million copies, two mainstream publishers declined to make offers for a full-length book I am writing on the epidemic after saying they would. "You see what I mean about conservative imprints being some of the few places left truly interested in free speech," an editor at one wrote. I'll turn to a conservative publisher if that's what it takes to be true to liberal principles.

In Poland, Protests Over Abortion Ban Could Revolutionize Politics

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
Women have been at the heart of a protest movement that has grown and battled on Poland’s streets since October, sparked by a court decision to ban most abortions. But this was never just a one-issue protest. Something deeper is going on, and it has been building for years.
Hundreds of thousands of women, teenagers and their male allies have been turning out every few days on the streets of cities and small towns across the country for weeks, braving tear gas, court orders, harsh police tactics and surging COVID infections.
Ask them why, and many will say that an uprising felt inevitable.
“There is pressure to go to every single protest, even if you are totally exhausted and you don’t have energy to work, to go to school,” said Zoe Ślusarczyk, from Warsaw, who at 15 is a member of a newly active younger generation that has flocked to the protests and shocked the government.
What is underway in Poland is a forceful renegotiation of the foundations of government power, and the backroom deals, almost exclusively among men, that built them. Women’s demands for reproductive freedom and their calls for greater equality threaten to upend a power structure that has held since the fall of Communism.
Such disruptions have been seen globally in the wake of the #MeToo movement, which has toppled many powerful men, but none have gone to the heart of politics as directly as in Poland. Gender equality would disrupt a political arrangement in the country that has been set for decades: a symbiotic relationship in which the Catholic Church lends its authority to politicians in exchange for the government’s enforcing ecclesiastical morality, including by restricting abortion.
That arrangement now seems to many like a failed bargain with an institution that has been found lacking, after revelations that the church, when it was led by Pope John Paul II before he became pontiff, had protected pedophile priests. The Polish Catholic Church declined to comment for this article but referred The New York Times to previous statements on the sanctity of life and protection of children.
And the church’s claim to be the defender of Polish democracy, won by supporting the Solidarity movement against Communism in the 1980s, has been undermined by its embrace of the governing Law and Justice party, which has dismantled liberal institutions and promoted xenophobic and authoritarian policies.
‘A Contract Between Bishops and Politicians’
Most scholars of political transitions will tell you that successful transformations have one thing in common: Their leaders do not allow the perfect to be the enemy of the good.
Poland’s transition to democracy, and the compromises that were made, was no exception. After the fall of Communism in 1989, the Catholic Church gave crucial support to the pro-democracy movement. But while that enabled a smoother transition to democracy than in many other post-Communist countries, it left the church deeply embedded in politics and able to insist that the new government legislate the church’s position on social issues.
One of the church’s main priorities was a law restricting abortion, which had been widely available in the Communist era.
The resulting 1993 abortion law was “like a contract between politicians and bishops,” said Joanna Scheuring-Wielgus, a leftist member of Parliament known for her investigations of child sexual abuse within the church. The law came with some exceptions: It allowed abortions in the case of rape or incest, danger to the life of the mother, or fetal abnormality.
But there was no hiding the fact that women had more reproductive freedom under Communist rule than they did in the new democracy.
“It was not a compromise for modern society, for women,” said Danuta Huebner, a Polish member of the European Parliament. “Emotionally, this thing was never solved.”
Subsequent governments have struck similar bargains over issues like Poland’s membership in the European Union. And in 2015, the Law and Justice Party, led by Jaroslaw Kaczynski, swept to power with a pitch to voters that combined economic generosity and disgruntled nationalism with Catholic social conservatism. The party’s presidential candidate, Andrzej Duda, won reelection this year.
But women have gained economic and social power even as the far-right government pushes to preserve traditional gender roles that remain popular with voters, both men and women, in many rural areas. According to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the gender wage gap for median earners in Poland is only 10%, one of the smallest differentials among the group’s countries. Forty-three percent of young women earn university degrees, compared with only 29% of young men. When Poland joined the European Union, that brought new opportunities to work and travel in more secular countries.
Many Polish women, especially in the cities, empowered in other areas of their lives have become less willing to embrace a church that excludes them from positions of power and authority — or a political system that gives that church power over their lives.
“I think, I feel, I decide,” a signature slogan of the protests, has been chanted in streets and squares across the country during weeks of demonstrations.
‘Us’ and ‘Them’
Kaczynski says the Catholic Church is fundamentally interwoven with the Polish nation and Polishness itself. And that has meant embracing its values.
Party leaders have claimed that homosexuality is a threat to the soul of the nation and that the secular values of the European Union are incompatible with Polish life.
Ślusarczyk, the high schooler from Warsaw, said she fears those who believe in that vision of Polishness and believes that many hate her for not conforming to it.
“If I go out of the house and I see someone wearing a shirt with a Polish flag or a national symbol or a symbol of the independence day, I feel afraid,” she said. “Because of the way the country is divided, it’s always ‘us’ and ‘them.’”
No issue has provoked open conflict between those factions like abortion. In 2016, Law and Justice tried to pass a law outlawing abortion in the case of fetal abnormality, which accounts for more than 80% of the procedures performed each year, but failed after large protests erupted.
The government then turned to the constitutional court, which was packed with party loyalists, and asked for the same restrictions on constitutional grounds.
When the court issued its decision Oct. 22, the country exploded in even larger protests.
Even though the government later delayed putting the abortion law into effect, the protests have continued, with expectations high that it will eventually be pushed through.
Anna Jakubowska, 40, a businesswoman from Warsaw, kept returning to one word when trying to explain what had moved her and so many other women to protest: anger .
“We are very angry,” Jakubowska said, at politicians who legislate that women must give birth to severely disabled children but fail to support them as parents, and at fathers and grandfathers who wave away the trauma of unwanted pregnancy. Above all, she said, she was angry at the power afforded to the church even though it excludes women from its hierarchy.
Last year, the documentary “Tell No One” drew widespread public attention for the first time to the Polish church’s history of protecting priests who had raped and molested children for years.
A poll last year by IBRiS research found that fewer than 40% of Poles trusted the church, down from 58% in 2016.
For Jakubowska, the contrast between the standards the church wanted to impose upon women and the standard to which it held its own clergy was too much to bear.
“The Bible says if you are the sinner you have to pay the consequences,” she said, “But there are no consequences.”
She added, “That’s why women come to the street.”
A Generation Rejecting the Church’s Power
In most countries, angry teens shouting at an authority figure would be a dog-bites-man story. But when a video appeared of young women screaming obscenities at a priest in the northwestern town of Szczecinek in late October, it went viral.
The Szczecinek confrontation “beautifully illustrates the generation that has rejected the church’s power,” said Carolin Heilig, a doctoral researcher at the University of London who studies civil society, gender and protest in Poland.
Huebner, the member of the European Parliament, said that for young Poles, “this discontent has been brewing for a long time.”
“The church having this impact on the ruling party, this relation of host-parasite that exists in Poland, people do not approve of it anymore,” she said.
Poland’s protests have been disruptive, but their outcome remains uncertain. Change can be frightening, even for those who disapprove of the symbiosis between church and state. Unraveling that entanglement will also touch on personal relationships, religious faith, career decisions; for many, that prospect is too daunting.
“The crucial thing is to talk about it,” Ślusarczyk said. “For example, to grandmas and fathers, people who don’t get it because they never were taught to get it.”
But Jakubowska believes that change is inevitable.
“Even girls in small towns, even if they are still under the rule of men — because they are — they are changing,” she said. “In a few years there will be a great change because the church will be empty.”

NEW YORK — More than 1 in 4 workers in the West Farms neighborhood is out of work.
They were store clerks, hotel housekeepers, servers, cooks, for-hire drivers, security officers and maintenance workers before the coronavirus snatched away their livelihoods. Even before the outbreak, most were barely getting by on meager paychecks and scant savings.
Now their hopes for better lives are slipping away as they fall behind on rent, ration food and rack up credit card debt. Unemployment in this poor and largely Latino enclave of 19,000 in the Bronx was in double digits before the outbreak.
It has gotten far worse.
With an unemployment rate of 26% in September, West Farms has become an epicenter of New York City’s economic crisis, one of the hardest-hit urban communities in the country and emblematic of the pandemic’s uneven toll.
Though no corner of the city has escaped the fallout, the mass job losses have been concentrated in mostly Black and Latino pockets outside Manhattan that have long lagged economically behind the rest of the city. Communities like West Farms have also suffered disproportionately from the coronavirus itself, with higher rates of people becoming ill.
Meliza Mercedes, 26, was scouring apartment listings before the outbreak, hoping to finally give her 3-year-old daughter, Aubrey, a home of her own.
Mercedes, who stays with her mother in West Farms, had saved about $3,000 by living frugally. But then came the pandemic, which closed nonessential businesses in March. She lost her job as a store detective at Macy’s in Herald Square and her $550 weekly paycheck. Her savings were soon gone, too.
“I cry about it because I’ve been trying to get my own place,” she said.
Similar stories of hardship and loss are repeated countless times across West Farms.
Amanda Adedokun, a single mother, lost her babysitting jobs and can no longer support her own children. Eddie Suárez is a commercial landlord who built a storefront nearly three decades ago, but with a tenant missing rent payments, he struggles to pay his own bills. And Yalikhan Traore, a West African immigrant who worked in a beauty supply store, had to reinvent herself as a delivery driver to adapt to the new pandemic reality.
New York City’s economic crisis is among the worst in the nation, with unemployment at 13.2% in October, nearly double the national rate. But within the city, the pain varies vastly. Manhattan’s unemployment rate is 10.3%, but in the Bronx, the city’s poorest borough, it is 17.5% — the highest in the state.
In West Farms, the unemployment rate soared from 11% in February to 38% in June, before dropping to 26% in September, according to a statistical model developed by two analysts, Yair Ghitza and Mark Steitz.
James Parrott, an economist with the Center for New York City Affairs at The New School, said the pandemic had triggered many more layoffs among lower-paid workers, while far fewer higher-paid workers — including those in finance, technology and professional services, who tend to be mostly white — have lost jobs or benefits.
“It’s another dimension of the extreme differences in economic well-being in New York,” Parrott said.
Dozens of Job Applications and No Safety Net
Mercedes moved to West Farms with her family from a homeless shelter in the Bronx in 2008. The youngest of six children of immigrants from the Dominican Republic, she later dropped out of high school when she was 17.
Mercedes said she always wanted to work in law enforcement and was thrilled to be hired as a Macy’s security guard in July 2019. She was promoted four months later to store detective.
“Everything was going well until the pandemic hit,” she said.
When the store reopened in June, she received an email — it was addressed “Dear colleague” — that said, “Regretfully, we are unable to continue your employment at this time.” She received a severance check of $1,500.
Julie Strider, a Macy’s spokesperson, declined to comment on Mercedes but cited necessary reductions as a result of the pandemic.
“These are always hard decisions to make as they impact many of our valued colleagues,” she said.
Mercedes said she had applied for more than two dozen jobs.
“It’s a very scary situation,” she said.
Few in West Farms have a financial safety net. The median annual household income is $23,329, compared with $38,000 in the Bronx, according to an analysis of census data by Social Explorer, a research company. Citywide, the median income is $61,000, nearly three times higher.
‘Everything Has a Cost in New York’
When Traore was laid off from a beauty supply shop in March, she didn’t even have money to spare for the laundromat. So she started washing her clothes in the bathtub.
She pooled her food money with a roommate. She could no longer pay her $600 share of the rent.
“Everything has a cost in New York,” said Traore, 35, who immigrated from Guinea three years ago.
Traore learned about unemployment benefits from a friend. She applied right away but heard nothing for weeks.
Unemployment benefits have been a lifeline for many West Farms workers. Some earned as much, if not more, than they did at their jobs with the federal pandemic supplement, which added $600 a week to state benefits, and were able to pay bills.
But the layoffs overwhelmed New York’s unemployment system. And when the federal supplement ended in July, the remaining state benefit — capped at $504 a week — was not enough for most people.
Traore started to panic after weeks of waiting for benefits. She emailed state Sen. Luis R. Sepúlveda, whose district includes West Farms, for assistance.
With Sepúlveda’s office pushing her case, Traore’s benefits — $700 a week after taxes, including the federal supplement — were approved.
Sepúlveda has received more than 500 requests for help with unemployment benefits.
“It makes me angry because in the wealthiest city in the world, it’s inexcusable to have such a high rate of unemployment in one area,” Sepúlveda said.
As the public health crisis eased, New York restarted its economy. Stores and businesses reopened and started calling some of their workers back.
Traore was one of the lucky ones. She started in June as a driver delivering packages. She earns $17 an hour, or $2 more than her minimum-wage job at the beauty store.
Mercedes also has reason to hope. After The New York Times asked Macy’s about her job status, she said the company recently offered her a position at one of its Brooklyn stores.

The ibis and the kiwi are dogged diggers, probing in sand and soil for worms and other buried prey. Sandpipers, too, can be seen along the shore excavating small creatures with their beaks. It was long thought that these birds were using trial and error to find their prey.
But then scientists discovered something far more peculiar: Their beaks are threaded with cells that can detect vibrations traveling through the ground. Some birds can feel the movements of their distant quarry directly, while others pick up on waves bouncing off buried shells — echolocating like a dolphin or a bat, in essence, through the earth.
There’s one more odd detail in this story of birds’ unusual senses: Ostriches and emus, birds that most definitely do not hunt this way, have beaks with a similar interior structure. They are honeycombed with pits for these cells, though the cells themselves are missing. Now, scientists in a study published Wednesday in Proceedings of the Royal Society B report that prehistoric bird ancestors dating nearly as far back as the dinosaurs most likely were capable of sensing vibrations with their beaks.
The birds that use this remote sensing today are not closely related to one another, said Carla du Toit, a graduate student at the University of Cape Town in South Africa and an author of the paper. That made her and her co-authors curious about when exactly this ability evolved, and whether ostriches, which are close relatives of kiwis, had an ancestor that used this sensory ability.
“We had a look to see if we could find fossils of early birds from that group,” du Toit said. “And we’re very lucky.” There are very well-preserved fossils of birds called lithornithids dating from just after the event that drove nonavian dinosaurs to extinction.
First they had to gather data on the beaks of more than 50 bird species so that they would be able to say how similar or different the fossil birds were to modern birds. The team recorded the number of pits in the bone of the beak and the size of the beak and the head, important details because birds that dig for their food have a characteristic shape.
Then they took a look at the lithornithids. And indeed, the ancient beaks and head structure were extremely similar to the beaks of kiwis, ibises and sandpipers, far closer than any other bird in the study.
“It seems that they have this organ and were able to use the sense of remote touch to probe and locate prey as well, which is really cool, because it just shows that this is really old,” du Toit said.
That means that the ancestors of ostriches and emus lost the ability sometime after the lithornithids lived, leaving them with only traces in their bone structure of this lost talent. They lack as well the enlarged brain regions that kiwis, ibises and shorebirds devote to processing the sensory information pouring in from the beak.
Du Toit and her colleagues are now studying the hadeda ibis, a South African bird that uses remote sensing, to see just how far away it can sense hidden objects — perhaps buried as much as 8 inches below the surface.

Becerra Brings Environmental Justice to Forefront

Martha Romero felt that she had to send her daughters to safety.
She had seen air pollution grow worse in recent years as the truck traffic near her San Bernardino, California, neighborhood increased so she made the difficult decision to send her three daughters to live with her mother, whose home is farther from the worst of the fumes and dust from the unending parade of trucks moving to and from nearby warehouses.
“Unfortunately, we cannot keep them in an air bubble,” she said.
A coalition of local organizations is leading the fight against the expansion of the San Bernardino International Airport to accommodate Amazon’s burgeoning logistics needs with a complex that will bring more flights, more warehouses and even more truck traffic and pollution to her area. The coalition has an unusual ally: Xavier Becerra, the attorney general for the state of California, and the choice of President-elect Joe Biden to run the Department of Health and Human Services.
Opposing the airport expansion plan is the work of the environmental justice bureau Becerra created in 2018, the first of its kind. Its focus: the unequal effect pollution and other forms of environmental damage have on health in the most vulnerable communities. While local officials, understandably, want to promote economic development, the bureau created by Becerra is saying that environmental justice needs to be part of the equation.
“If we’re concerned about environmental degradation, we should be concerned about the people who are hit first and worst,” Becerra said in an interview.
Concern over the environment and climate change has long been a part of the character of the Golden State. Its leaders have worked to limit auto emissions — despite efforts by the Trump administration to curb its ability to do so — and the state is calling for a transition from internal combustion engines to electric for cars and trucks in coming years.
Those issues, and the effects of pollution on vulnerable populations, promise to be a prominent part of the agenda for Biden, as well. He named his $2 trillion climate proposal the “Plan to Secure Environmental Justice and Equitable Opportunity in a Clean Energy Future,” which set a goal that 40% of all clean energy spending would go to disadvantaged communities. Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, during her tenure as California’s attorney general, pursued a number of cases dealing with the disproportionate effect of environmental issues on disadvantaged communities. As a senator, she introduced the Climate Equity Act with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., a bill that focuses on the environmental health of low-income communities of color in efforts to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases that are causing climate change.
Attorneys general tend to make headlines with litigation, including more than a hundred lawsuits that Becerra and other Democratic attorneys general have filed to stop the Trump administration’s rollbacks of environmental regulations and other initiatives. But the work of the environmental justice bureau in San Bernardino and a number of other California cities involves less flashy but equally important work from the state’s chief law enforcement officer.
“This small bureau, in its short span of life, can probably demonstrate greater impact than most other parts of the Department of Justice or state government, simply because we’ve been able to redirect a lot of these projects,” Becerra said. The office often supports ongoing legal actions, but Becerra’s staff members also work with local planning commissions to urge them to take environmental laws into consideration when reviewing new development so that they don’t need to intervene later.
The work is not “glamorous,” said Arsenio Mataka, the attorney general’s environmental adviser, but it can be an important boost for vulnerable communities that have little influence, and are subject to the extra pollution and health effects from the increased traffic that major warehouse development can bring to their neighborhoods. Even sending a letter can have an effect, he said: “If you are a mayor or local official, if you get a letter from the attorney general, it’s a big deal.”
In another highly polluted California city, Fresno, the environmental justice bureau helped local activists score a win. When the attorney general intervened in a lawsuit there over a big industrial development in 2018, Veronica Garibay, a founder and director of the Leadership Counsel for Justice and Accountability, said there was little government notice of the enormous project. “We found out,” she said, “from a reporter.” Adding warehouses and truck traffic to an area that is among the most polluted neighborhoods in the entire state angered local activists.
“Community residents know what is needed in their communities,” she said. The attorney general’s intervention, she said, made sure that those voices were heard.
In February 2019, the city rescinded the permit for a 2 million square foot project and settled the litigation with the Leadership Counsel and allied groups.
The links between air pollution caused by trucks and diseases that include cancer, asthma and cardiac symptoms are increasingly well established, said Gina Solomon, a clinical professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco and a principal investigator at the Public Health Institute in Oakland, a nonprofit group. Noting estimates that the San Bernardino airport project could add traffic from close to 500 trucks a day to an area already under a severe pollution threat, she said, “That community is already seeing a higher risk of heart, lung and even stroke risks due to the levels of pollution right now, right there.” Solomon added, “This facility is like a very large piece of very rich cheesecake for someone who is already a walking heart attack risk.”
Esther Portillo, interim executive director of the Center for Community Action and Environmental Justice, one of the groups involved in the San Bernardino fight, said that winning would not mean shutting down development. Instead, she said, it would be to “take a hard look at the environmental impacts that we’ll have, and minimize those impacts as best we can.”
Although jobs tend to be the biggest selling point in new development, a union chapter, Teamsters local 1932, has joined the fight against the airport expansion. Randy Korgan, secretary-treasurer of the local, said: “Fine, bring the jobs, but make sure you deal with the environmental impact, with the impact on the community — make sure these people have good benefits, that they’ll be able to live in the area and buy homes in the area.”
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will hear the airport case as early as February.
The attorney general’s involvement in local disputes can anger those who staunchly support development. Steve Brandau, a Fresno county supervisor, was a member of the Fresno City Council during some of the heated conflicts over the warehouse expansion plans.
“It’s maddening that the AG’s office, Attorney General Becerra, steps in and comes down even tougher than the local advocates,” he said. Citing a long-standing conservative refrain, he said that in the long run, such activities “end up running business completely out of the state.”
Mataka acknowledged the friction in Fresno.
“They thought we were out of our lane,” he said. “Unfortunately for them, the attorney general is responsible for enforcing the California Environmental Quality Act. We were in our lane.”
Becerra said his office works carefully with local government before ever filing a brief in a case, and seeks ways to find compromises. Some communities, he said, do not understand that their old ways of doing business leave communities underserved. They say, “we did this 20 years ago, why can’t we do it now?” he said.
He cited his experience as a 12-term congressman in arguing that he sees the role as more a negotiator than a fighter. “You’re always looking for votes,” he said, “even on the other side of the aisle. I don’t want people to be blindsided.”
Fresno resident Katie Taylor applauded the state’s work in her city. She is 75, and is the caregiver for her 51-year old daughter, who has Down syndrome. The increase in truck traffic is maddening, she said. “It’s just trucks, trucks, trucks, coming and going.”
She first found out about the warehouse complex planned for her area when union activists came knocking on her door.
“We didn’t know we could have a say in any of this,” she said.

LONDON — In Bristol, a sports stadium is being converted into a temporary clinic to provide inoculations, as is a racecourse outside London. Village halls, libraries and parking lots across the country are also being quickly turned into makeshift vaccination centers, with the government enlisting military planners for advice.
As it prepares to begin rolling out a coronavirus vaccine Tuesday, Britain is taking on the biggest logistical challenge ever faced by the country’s health service: the vaccination of tens of millions of people against coronavirus in a matter of months. At the same time, law enforcement authorities are contending with an array of potential security threats to the vaccination campaign.
Inoculations are expected to begin Tuesday at selected hospitals throughout Britain that have received the first batches of vaccine made by Pfizer and BioNTech, which need to be stored at very low temperatures. But the temporary clinics that are being hurriedly put together are expected to play critical roles as the mass vaccination program expands.
Retired health workers are being asked to help, while the National Health Service is also recruiting tens of thousands of first aid workers and others to help administer the shot, as the vaccine becomes available to progressively more people.
“I think all people who can help should put their hands up,” said Sarah Wollaston, who worked as a doctor before serving in Parliament until recently. She has just completed part of an online refresher course to qualify to help in the vaccine rollout.
“Physically, giving someone a vaccine is very straightforward,” she said. “The challenge is the logistics.”
While industry experts and health officials grapple with that, law enforcement officers and cyber-sleuths face an equally pressing challenge in the potential security threats surrounding a product in such high demand.
“It is the most valuable asset on earth right now,” said Lisa Forte, a former British counterintelligence employee and a partner at Red Goat, a cybersecurity firm. “Naturally, this will attract highly skilled cybercriminals, criminal groups and state actors.”
Europol has warned that organized crime groups might target trucks containing vaccines for theft and hijacking, and last week Interpol warned against an “onslaught of all types of criminal activity linked to the COVID-19 vaccine,” which it has described as “liquid gold.”
From the factory to hospitals and other sites, the Pfizer vaccine — because it has to be stored at around minus 70 degrees Celsius, or minus 94 Fahrenheit — is acutely vulnerable to sabotage, in addition to theft.
“With the vaccine, the two biggest risks are maintaining the cold chain and interception by public or private actors,” said Sarah Rathke, a lawyer at Squire Patton Boggs who specializes in supply chain litigation.
“It may be the most difficult supply chain challenge posed in recent history, with not a lot of time to prepare for it,” Rathke added.
Cyberattacks can reveal a wealth of information about the vaccines that can be exploited by state actors and criminal gangs, experts say.
Last week, IBM said it had detected a series of cyberattacks in September against companies involved in the distribution of coronavirus vaccines across the world. IBM said the attackers, whose identity could not be determined, had tried to learn how the vaccines would be stored and delivered.
“We’ve seen petrochemical companies targeted, because they’re essential in producing dry ice used to store the vaccine,” said Claire Zaboeva, a senior cyber-threat analyst at IBM’s Security X-Force.
As nations compete to be among the first to administer the vaccine, Zaboeva added, state actors or even terrorist groups might try to disrupt deliveries. “Making loads of vaccine doses spoiled and useless, that would be a pretty destructive attack,” she said.
While security agencies look after those concerns, Britain’s health service will have the daunting problem of managing a mass vaccination program that will reach further and faster into the population than any other public health outreach in living memory.
One charity, St. John Ambulance, aims to help train up to 30,000 vaccinators and others to help at inoculation centers.
“Rolling out a vaccine to tens of millions of people will be a monumental task as we look to save lives and hopefully bring about an eventual return to our normal way of life,” said Ian Hudspeth, chairman of the Community Wellbeing Board for the Local Government Association, which represents local municipalities.
Success is hardly guaranteed, given Britain’s spotty record on logistics during the COVID-19 crisis. In the early stages of the pandemic hospitals were left chronically short of basic protective equipment like masks and gloves, putting some workers at risk of infection.
Since then, the government has struggled to establish a test and trace system, despite budgeting around $16 billion for the much-criticized project.
Already, Pfizer’s problems sourcing raw materials may force it to cut the number of vaccine doses promised for delivery this year to Britain possibly by around half, to 5 million. And there is a potential bottleneck in the production of dry ice needed for packing and shipping the vaccine.
Yet experts are cautiously optimistic that the vaccine rollout will go better than the government’s earlier, fumbling efforts to address the pandemic because it will be handled under the umbrella of the National Health Service, which has extensive experience with organizing mass immunizations, like annual flu shots.
“It is not going to be without problems because of its scale and the logistics — I would be amazed if, in six months something, somewhere, didn’t go wrong,” said Helen Buckingham, director of strategy and operations at the Nuffield Trust, a research institute specializing in health.
But the concept of mass vaccination is a familiar one, she added, “and overall people are putting a lot of effort into making this work.”
Vaccines will be offered at three different types of locations: hospitals; doctors’ offices and clinics; and temporary vaccination centers still being prepared, including drive-thru sites, sports stadiums and public buildings. Family doctors, who will carry much of the burden, can call on their experience of giving at least 15 million flu shots each year.
Coronavirus vaccination will be different for several reasons, however. In addition to the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine, Britain is likely to authorize at least two others, one produced by Moderna and another by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford. But when and where each one will be available is unclear.
Martin Marshall, chair of the council of the Royal College of General Practitioners, notes that refrigeration requirements particularly for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines introduce a complication doctors do not have to manage with flu shots. Both require a second injection after several weeks, which can be an administrative nightmare.
“We are pretty used to delivering big vaccination programs, but of course no one has ever had to deliver one in a situation where the vaccinations don’t come through in pre-filled syringes,” Marshall said.
Doctors’ offices and other temporary clinics might come more into play, experts say, if the AstraZeneca vaccine gains approval. In addition to costing far less, it can be stored at normal refrigeration levels.
Then there are worries that average Britons, not to speak of anti-vaccination campaigners, will be reluctant to take the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, which rely on a relatively untested technology.
Priority will go to those at highest risk and the oldest Britons, so a system will also be needed to call the right people in for appointments at specified times, then to do so again three weeks later for the second shot.
Early plans to vaccinate nursing home residents have been shelved because of the deceptively vexing issue of how to break down the 975-dose batches that Pfizer ships and safely take them into those facilities. And it is unclear when — and in what quantity — other vaccines will become available.
All this has to be done at a time when the health care sector is under acute strain, its staff stretched after months of relentless pressure and during a winter season when people are generally more susceptible to illness.
Nonetheless, Marshall is confident that the vaccine rollout can succeed.
“I think we can make this work if we work across the NHS and show some flexibility,” he said. “It plays to the strength of the NHS, which is a centralized, organized and managed system — and it plays to our values as well.”

Texto completo: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has resisted pleas from some of his states mayors to enact statewide measures to fight COVID-19, such as a mask mandate and the power to adopt local restrictions.

The day before Florida recorded its 1 millionth case, DeSantis told reporters that states in lockdown mode are faring worse than Florida.

So I hear people say, Oh, well, Florida is open, and theyre having increased cases,  DeSantis said Nov. 30. Well, okay, the states that are locked down are increasing at twice the rate we are. If you look at the per capita cases, in a lot of these states that have closed schools, businesses shuttered, some of them even post stay-at-home orders there, you see a huge increase in these cases.

We checked DeSantis claim that the states that are locked down are increasing at twice the rate we are. We found that while Florida is doing comparatively well at the moment, DeSantis overstated the correlation between cases and lockdown rules. Its likely that other factors beyond just a states rules are affecting COVID-19 rates.

The state of lockdowns nationwide

In an effort to reduce the spread of the virus, states have enacted  and then sometimes relaxed or lifted  various restrictions, including mask mandates, limits on restaurant

capacity, and bans on large gatherings.

DeSantis, a Republican, issued an order Sept. 25 that generally lifted restrictions on businesses and suspended fines for people who didnt comply. While many stores and restaurants have adopted their own mask and social distancing rules, Floridians have still packed into some bars and other gathering spots.

In November, cases in Florida were on the rise, but unlike some other governors, DeSantis said he wouldnt issue new mandates.

Reviewing the evidence

We asked Fred Piccolo, a spokesman for DeSantis, for evidence to explain the governors claim that cases in states that are locked down are increasing twice as fast as in Florida.

Piccolo cited a New York Times state-by-state analysis, updated Nov. 30, showing which states have businesses that are mostly closed, which ones have no restrictions, and which ones are mixed. The newspaper also published a map showing states with stay-at-home orders or advisories.

Piccolo then used the Covid Act Now website to calculate the number of cases and hospitalizations per 100,000 residents in some of the states with more stringent restrictions.

We checked the numbers ourselves. We focused on the states that the New York Times had cited as enacting the most stringent restrictions for either businesses or residents as of Nov. 30, as well as the states that had a medium level of restrictions on both businesses and residents. All told, 10 states qualified for this group of states with high coronavirus-related restrictions. (Our list of 10 states was slightly different from the one Piccolo provided, but not substantively so.)

Broadly speaking, we found that Floridas record, at least as of the beginning of December, compared favorably with most states across the country, including those with tighter restrictions. Specifically, in comparisons of coronavirus cases deaths and hospitalizations per capita, Florida ranked among the best, and better than some of the more highly regulated states.

So theres something to what DeSantis said. However, there are also some important caveats.

First, some of the more highly regulated states performed better than Florida did. For instance, Oregon, Washington state and California had fewer coronavirus deaths per capita than Florida did, while Massachusetts, Oregon and Washington state had lower hospitalization rates.

Second, DeSantis reference to twice the rate undercuts the strength of his argument. Out of the 10 states with the most stringent rules, only about half had per capita cases, deaths and hospitalizations that were twice as high as Floridas rate.

Third, Florida may be faring better than many other states in fighting the coronavirus, but that doesnt necessarily mean that a lack of restrictions is to credit for better coronavirus statistics.

Another chart shows 27 states, including Florida, that the New York Times analysis found to have the least restrictive COVID-19 rules on businesses and residents.

Once again, Florida ranks well compared with the other states on cases, deaths and hospitalizations. But many of the states that followed similarly low levels of restrictions as Florida did end up with far worse outcomes.

We found that 12 of the low-restriction states had double Floridas case rate, eight had double the rate of deaths, and nine had double the rate of hospitalizations. Five states had double Floridas rate in each of the three statistics  South Dakota, North Dakota, Montana, Nebraska, and Indiana  and another five states had twice Floridas rate for two statistics.

Its also important to note that some states added or tightened restrictions in November, making the impact so far difficult to evaluate.

Why might Florida be doing relatively well?

The comparison with other lightly regulated states suggests that Florida may be doing relatively well for reasons other than its low-regulation policy.

For example, Floridas weather makes it easier for residents to eat and gather outdoors, even at this time of year. Scientists have generally said that the virus passes from person to person less easily outdoors than in cramped indoor spaces.

I think its reasonable to say that the warmer weather certainly plays a part in Floridas relative success, said Brooke Nichols, an infectious-disease mathematical modeler at the Boston University School of Public Health. Its no longer incredibly hot, necessitating indoor gathering for air conditioning, but not too cold that people need to congregate indoors for heat.

In addition, its hard to establish causation: Is it the loose regulation that helps reduce infection rates, or is it the low infection rates that allow for looser regulations?

Miami-Dade, the states most populous county, had an increase in cases following the removal of the mitigation strategies, said Mary Jo Trepka, chair of the Department of Epidemiology at Florida International University.

We dont know how bad it will get, Trepka said.

Its also important to remember that states arent walled-off jurisdictions. During much of the pandemic, Florida has been open to tourists, which means we dont know whether coronavirus transmission within Florida is increasing infections in other states after those tourists return home, said Marissa Levine, a public health professor at the University of South Florida.

Jason L. Salemi, associate professor of epidemiology at the University of South Florida, cautions that the success DeSantis claimed is only in comparison with other states, and that cases and hospitalizations have been rising over the last few weeks. That, to me, is indicative of how serious the situation is across the country, he said.

Our ruling

DeSantis said, The states that are locked down are increasing at twice the rate we are in Florida.

Currently, Florida does have relatively low rates of coronavirus cases, deaths and hospitalizations. But the connection between those statistics and Floridas light restrictions on businesses and residents is less clear-cut than DeSantis suggests.

Only about half of the 10 most stringently regulated states saw rates of cases, deaths and hospitalizations that were twice as high as Floridas  DeSantis benchmark.

Meanwhile, numerous other states that followed the same less restrictive policies as Florida have fared far worse than Florida. This suggests that factors other than behavioral regulations, such as warm weather, may play a role in keeping coronavirus infections relatively low in Florida.

We rate the statement Half True.

Texto completo: If we can't get a COVID-19 relief package through Congress in the next week or two, we're sunk. It means we have a legislative branch so ideologically divided it can't address even our most glaring problems. It means we have representatives so lacking in the willingness and ability to compromise that minimally competent government will be impossible, even under a President Joe Biden.
The problems a basic relief measure would address couldn't be more obvious. Under current law, up to 12 million Americans could lose their jobless benefits by year's end - a wretched Christmastime for millions of families, which could spawn a wave of depression, morbidity, family breakdown and suicide.
Millions of people could be evicted from their homes. Thousands more businesses may close during the long winter months before a vaccine is widely available. These are not failing, unproductive businesses. These are good, strong businesses that would have provided jobs and opportunity for millions of Americans for decades if they hadn't been hit by the pandemic.
Wendy Edelberg of the Hamilton Project calculates that if nothing passes, the U.S. economy will be $1 trillion smaller in 2021 and $500 billion smaller in 2022.
The means to prevent this suffering are also glaringly obvious. We did it less than a year ago with the coronavirus relief bill. All we have to do is pass a version of what we did before. How hard can this possibly be?
The $2 trillion coronavirus relief bill was one of the most successful pieces of legislation of modern times. Because of the lockdowns, U.S. economic output contracted by a horrific 9% in the second quarter of 2020, compared with the first quarter. But because of the coronavirus relief bill, disposable household incomes increased by 10%. The personal savings rate increased by 34% in April.
I don't love big government, but government is supposed to step up in a crisis, and with the coronavirus relief bill, it did.
Since summer, as the economy has deteriorated, Congress has been gridlocked on how to pass a supplemental relief package. At times Nancy Pelosi has been rigidly uncompromising, as if not wanting to hand Donald Trump a victory. But the core problem is that Republicans have applied a dogmatically ideological approach to a situation in which it is not germane and is in fact ruthlessly destructive.
Some Republicans act as if this is a normal recession and the legislation in front of them is a conventional Keynesian stimulus bill. But this is not a normal recession. It's a natural disaster. The proposals on offer are not conventional stimulus. They are measures to defend our national economic infrastructure from that disaster over the next five brutal months.
I agree with Janet Yellen, Mr. Biden's choice for Treasury secretary, who said, "The U.S. debt path is completely unsustainable under current tax and spending plans." But that concern is for another day. Right now, we need to protect the workers and businesses that generate wealth in this society.
Either we roar out of this pandemic with the economic might and surging wages we enjoyed in 2019, or we endure another decade of grinding stagnation, more populist anger, more people losing faith in America. Microscopic interest rates make this additional debt a relatively easy lift for us.
The 2020 election results have powerfully strengthened moderates. After months of gridlock, the moderates took charge this week, crafting a bipartisan $908 billion relief compromise. Led by Sens. Susan Collins, Joe Manchin, Mitt Romney and Mark Warner and endorsed by a bipartisan group of House members from the Problem Solvers Caucus, it is big enough to make a real difference and includes two thorny issues: aid to the states and liability protection, which should, on the merits, be in the law.
This is how democracy is supposed to work! Partisans stake out positions, and then dealmakers reach a compromise.
To their great credit, Ms. Pelosi and Chuck Schumer embraced the bipartisan framework. Mitch McConnell went on the Senate floor Thursday, pretended to soften, ignored the compromise and did not move an inch.
Mr. McConnell may think the Democrats will eventually come to him because something is better than nothing. But his proposal cannot pass. Democrats in the House will not accept a complete capitulation to Mr. McConnell on every front.
For the first time in a long time we have a core group of moderates, progressives and conservatives willing to practice politics - willing to work with the other party toward a reasonable solution.
Talks between the moderates and Mr. McConnell continue. But if Mr. McConnell won't do a deal now, in the midst of a clear crisis and under a Republican president, there certainly won't be one with more controversial issues under a Democratic president in 2021. If we don't see a COVID-19 relief measure pass in the next week or two, then our democracy is existentially broken.

Texto completo: Wait for it . . . any day now . . . get ready for the "multipliers." You know, the idea that a government dollar spent magically turns into multiple dollars in the economy. We ought to start hearing that silly word again as the lame-duck coronavirus stimulus negotiations kick in. Expect more multiplier mumbo jumbo as the Biden administration begins its tax-and-spend fiesta.
Let's face it, the Democrats haven't had a believable economic messenger since Robert Rubin during the Clinton administration. Since then they've presented a cast of characters -- Larry Summers, Mr. Biden's adviser Jared Bernstein, and lately Elizabeth Warren -- who bend themselves into pretzels to justify higher spending and then higher taxes.
The New York Times described this trend during the early days of the Obama administration. The financial crisis team of Jason Furman, Tim Geithner and Mr. Summers were "carrying around this list of multipliers" taken from a chart by Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody's Analytics. Every dollar spent extending unemployment insurance benefits would, the fairy tale went, boost the economy by $1.64. Sadly, a dollar in reduced corporate taxes would boost the economy by only 30 cents. But cheer up, every dollar spent on food stamps would spur a $1.73 increase in gross domestic product. Mr. Zandi called it "bang for the buck" -- the proverbial free lunch. It's more like "dud for the dollar" because it didn't work. It never does. Multipliers are a canard, a Keynesian conceit.
The economy grew after the Great Recession, as it does after every recession. The stimulus didn't stimulate. Shovel-ready projects weren't ready. Many complained that the stimulus wasn't big enough. More hooey. The Obama administration's high taxes and heaps of regulation held the economy back. Is spending driving today's recovery? Think back to the Heroes Act 2.0, Nancy Pelosi's $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief bill. Economic growth in the third quarter of 2020 was 33% as lockdowns were lifted, despite -- or because of -- that gigantic stimulus package not becoming law.
The theory of multipliers is based on the Keynesian view that poorer consumers tend to spend a large amount of increased income, and the rich less so. But multipliers are half a story. Someone has to put up the original money that allegedly gets multiplied, taking it away from the private sector and negating whatever dwindling chain of transactions are hypothesized. It's like two waves canceling each other out -- you can't just do the math on the additive public wave and ignore subtracting the private. This demand-side theory omits the principle of productivity, the real driver of economic growth and prosperity.
But no matter, expect multiplier talk to, er, multiply. The Biden team already has gnomes busy at work sharpening their pencils finding new and innovative ways to raise taxes to spend on green and other favored projects, without having to pass new laws in a potentially divided Congress.
Mr. Biden's secret weapon is a guy named Ben Harris, who apparently knows his way around budget models and tax tables. The New York Times quotes the University of Pennsylvania's Rich Prisinzano saying Mr. Harris and the Biden team have a plan to "tax the same people and the same income as Warren and Sanders" -- who want to impose wealth taxes -- "they just do it through the existing tax code." I'll bet you dollars to doughnuts the justification is multipliers.
They don't work. "Why the Fiscal Multiplier is Roughly Zero" is the title of a 2013 paper by Scott Sumner for George Mason University, summarizing the Obama stimulus. The key line is that "estimates of fiscal multipliers become little more than forecasts of central bank incompetence," meaning the Federal Reserve's job of maintaining stable monetary conditions should actually require it to fight against stimulus. I've also read papers from the International Monetary Fund (a better sleep inducement than melatonin) that support Keynesian multipliers, and others that say multipliers are a lot smaller in reality than theory.
Actually, if you want to see a real multiplier in action, take Amazon. Since it began, it's had $47 billion in invested capital, equity and debt. It's worth a tad more than that now. Just sayin'.
What else will be justified with multipliers? Maybe nationalizing the 5G network and reinstating net neutrality. The pesky private sector can't be trusted, the reasoning might go. This isn't voodoo economics, it's froufrou or even tutu economics: dressed up to look good but only a facade.
About the only government spending that might actually multiply in the real economy is basic research -- pure, fundamental research. Not enough, and you become a Third World has-been. Too much and you get Solyndra. Sure, I'd like to see money spent on basic research for nuclear fusion, advanced artificial intelligence, and genomic drug development. But keep it research; don't add in development as in R&D. And please don't slap a multiplier on the money spent, a number pulled out of thin air. How long will it be before Mr. Biden's pick for Treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, who studied under the Keynesian James Tobin, uses the M-word?

Texto completo: The Netflix drama "Mank" suggests that Herman J. Mankiewicz, credited along with Orson Welles, primarily wrote the script. But that has long been debunked by scholars.
"Mank," the new drama from David Fincher, revives an old charge against Orson Welles. Was Welles, who with "Citizen Kane" (1941) created what is often cited as the greatest movie ever made on his first try, actually standing on the shoulders of another genius?
The movie, which began streaming on Netflix on Friday, dramatizes the writing of "Citizen Kane" through the eyes of Herman J. Mankiewicz, who received top billing on the shared screenplay credit with Welles. The film focuses on the period when Mankiewicz wrote what became a 300-page doorstop called "American," partly drawing on his own experiences as a dinner guest of the newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst, the inspiration for the character of Charles Foster Kane.
Fincher's movie, using a screenplay by his father, Jack Fincher, implies that Mankiewicz was the principal author of the script. When "Citizen Kane" won the Oscar for best original screenplay, neither Welles nor Mankiewicz attended the ceremony, but "Mank" concludes with its title character (Gary Oldman) telling reporters the acceptance speech he would have delivered: "I am very happy to accept this award in the manner in which the screenplay was written, which is to say, in the absence of Orson Welles." (As recounted in Richard Meryman's 1978 biography of Mankiewicz, he really did devise an after-the-fact acceptance speech close to those words, although he also enjoyed a teasing correspondence with Welles at that time.)
For Welles scholars, the idea that Mankiewicz alone wrote "Citizen Kane" is an old falsehood, and its continued repetition may testify to the staying power of "Citizen Kane."
"It's the greatest film ever made, it has the longest track record of representing what cinema can be, and who's responsible for making it that way is a continuing story," Harlan Lebo, the author of "Citizen Kane: A Filmmaker's Journey," an exhaustive account of the movie's making, said.
Any controversy began in 1940, Lebo said. Welles, known for his spellbinding stage and radio productions with the Mercury Theater in New York, was making a much-watched arrival in Hollywood, having signed at age 24 to direct his first picture. He told the gossip columnist Louella Parsons that he had written the forthcoming "Kane."
"Herman immediately flips, is threatening to sue, wants to make sure he maintains credit," Lebo said.
Mercury Theater's radio writers typically didn't get credit, and Mankiewicz had waived his claim to authorship of "Kane" in a contract with the company. Welles could have pressed for full credit, Lebo writes, but his lawyer advised against the publicity of a dispute, and a shared credit was ultimately agreed to by both writers.
The "Mank" producer Douglas Urbanski said that Welles's lawyer, L. Arnold Weissberger, had left credit contractually vague. "If they got Herman the drunk who didn't deliver," Urbanski said, "there was no way they were going to give it, quite rightly, and if he earned it, Orson was going to do what he ultimately did." (He acknowledged that some of Weissberger's communications cut against this theory.)
The question of who wrote what has surfaced periodically over the years, but it lives on mainly because of the New Yorker critic Pauline Kael. In 1971, she wrote a two-part essay in which she asserted, quoting Mankiewicz's secretary Rita Alexander (Lily Collins in "Mank"), that "Welles didn't write (or dictate) one line of the shooting script." Fincher told The New York Times Magazine that the essay, "Raising Kane," provided the germ of an idea for the screenplay.
The 50,000-word essay is widely regarded as a misstep in Kael's work as a journalist. She was accused of not having spoken to Welles or Kathryn Trosper, his assistant when "Kane" was written, and of ignoring archival material that might have complicated the article's contentions. She was even accused of using, without credit, the research of Howard Suber, a young professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, whose interviews with Mankiewicz's wife, Sara, and others can be found on file with Kael's papers at Indiana University.
Peter Bogdanovich raised all these charges in 1972 in an Esquire essay, which itself has an air of mystique surrounding its authorship. "I did all the legwork, research and interviews, and the byline carried only my name, but Orson had taken a strong hand in revising and rewriting," Bogdanovich wrote in 1997. Brian Kellow's biography of Kael suggests that the critic, who died in 2001, chose not to respond to Bogdanovich's charges.
For all this, today there is relatively little argument over who wrote what in "Citizen Kane." In research published in 1978, Robert L. Carringer examined seven drafts of the screenplay in great detail and concluded that the writing Mankiewicz had done in Victorville, Calif., during the period depicted in the film "elaborated the plot logic and laid down the overall story contours," but that Welles, principally, transformed the script "from a solid basis for a story into an authentic plan for a masterpiece."
Carringer, who in a recent phone interview professed no interest in seeing "Mank," described the differences between the two writers' perspectives. Mankiewicz, he said, was a narrator. "You have a character -- well, you have to say his age, family situation, economics," he said. Welles, on the other hand, "hated that. So at every point possible, he created alternative ways of doing things."
Mankiewicz's contributions were essential and in some cases drew on his own experiences. Kael and Meryman both note that as a drama critic at The New York Times in 1925, Mankiewicz passed out drunk while writing a review, just as Jed Leland (Joseph Cotten) does in "Kane." (The Times ran a notice indicating the review's absence.)
But Lebo, who has done his own analysis of the scripts and posted various versions of the screenplay online for easy comparison, noted that even the closest thing we have to a final script -- the Museum of Modern Art, which holds one of two known copies of that draft, calls it the "Correction Script" -- is still filled with strange things that didn't end up in the movie.
"The final film is not really at all like the final script," he said. "Every script goes through revisions during production, but this one much more than most, and what Orson Welles did to it, probably literally at the last second during production -- just as he did with his theater productions -- that's what made the movie the movie we remember today."
Even at the time, some cinephiles perceived Kael's essay as an effort to discredit the auteur theory, the then-ascendant notion that the best directors were responsible for the stylistic imprints of their films.
"She picks the guy who is the epitome of the auteur in America and tears down his one great achievement that everybody can agree on," said Joseph McBride, who wrote three books on Welles and acted for him in "The Other Side of the Wind," a film belatedly completed in 2018. "But there's a misunderstanding about the auteur theory, too." The French critics who devised it "were accounting mostly for directors who didn't write scripts, like Raoul Walsh, and how they could put their imprint on films that they hadn't written."
That point is made in "Mank," when Welles (Tom Burke) angrily responds to Mankiewicz's demand for credit by saying, "Ask yourself, who's producing this picture, directing it, starring in it?" The critic Andrew Sarris, in an April 1971 retort to Kael's essay, noted that even if Mankiewicz had written every word, Welles was no less the auteur of "Citizen Kane" than he was of his 1942 adaptation of "The Magnificent Ambersons," whose "best lines and scenes were written by Booth Tarkington."
While Urbanski said that Kael's argument had been discredited by historians, he added: "You could equally say that our film is 100 percent accurate if, and here's the if, you accept that you're looking at it through Herman Mankiewicz's alcoholic perspective, because that changes everything." Mankiewicz, he said, was the "motor" of a movie that functions on several layers.
McBride, who defended moviemakers' right to dramatic leeway, nevertheless views "Mank" as a gross distortion and a missed opportunity to capture what was already an interesting relationship between Mankiewicz and Welles.
"They both worked on it, they both contributed their talents and they were better working together than they were alone," he said. "You could show that. It wouldn't detract from Mankiewicz's genius and Welles's genius."
To Fincher, the point of "Mank" isn't who wrote what. He said through a representative: "It was not my interest to make a movie about a posthumous credit arbitration. I was interested in making a movie about a man who agreed not to take any credit. And who then changed his mind. That was interesting to me."
Suber, now a professor emeritus, spoke almost nostalgically of how this debate has endured. When he began his "Kane" research for a seminar in 1969, he said, "I was simply interested in how a great screenplay -- I've never questioned whether it was a great screenplay -- how it came into existence."
In retrospect, he said, the debate over the authorship of "Citizen Kane" belongs "in the same category as debates over who wrote Shakespeare's plays or did Homer exist?"

Texto completo: He walks too slowly, a languorous Hawaiian ambler. She’s a get-to-the-point woman, in gait and gab. He’s a politician. She has no use for the type. He gets tangled up in fancy talk. She cuts through the fluff. He smoked. She loathes the smell of cigarettes.
Can this marriage be saved? We know, of course, that it can. We now have more than 1,100 pages on the extraordinary lives of Michelle and Barack Obama, as told by themselves. The two books — her “Becoming,” published in 2018, and his “A Promised Land,” out last month — broke sales records, almost single-handedly rescuing the bookstores of North America.
The national ground they cover, like the country itself, is vast: The biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression. The heavy lift of expanding health care. The stone-cold barnacle of Mitch McConnell. Their own historic marker: the first Black president and first lady.
But behind their national identities, there’s also the private love story, and scenes from a marriage just as complicated as any other.
Indeed, long after people stop wondering how the Affordable Care Act came to be, they’ll likely be reading the Obamas as a marriage tutorial. Though he seems to get his way on his grandest ambitions, she frequently pushes back, saying their lives have to be about we , not me — or it won’t work.
It’s been a long time, and is likely to be a long time coming, before a married couple from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue have as much to say about one of the central mysteries of life. I would have liked to have seen more of the interior life of the first lady Edith Wilson, after she essentially ran the executive branch following President Woodrow Wilson’s stroke. And who doesn’t wonder what went on behind the sad gaze of the long-suffering Pat Nixon?
The Obama marriage, as they tell it, reflects both the strains of their place in history, and the contemporary aggravations of professional strivers — the hard balancing of dual careers. Seemingly opposites, Barack and Michelle actually complete each other.
At times, her subtle snubs are just right, as when the president bolts out of bed early one morning to receive the news that he’s been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. “That’s wonderful, honey,” she says, unimpressed, then rolls over to get more sleep.
He knows how lucky he was to find her, and how — at the peak of his power — he misses the bond from simpler times. He says, “there were nights when, lying next to Michelle in the dark, I’d think about those days when everything between us felt lighter, when her smile was more constant and our love less encumbered.”
Somehow, they defied the stereotype of those living their vows inside a political bubble — the wife with the adoring stare, the absentee husband who only seems to care. What’s more, their description of how the two became one and stayed that way seems, dare I say, authentic .
Here’s Michelle, a first-year lawyer by way of the South Side of Chicago, Princeton and Harvard Law School, on meeting, dismissing and then falling in love with the man who walked into her office one summer day. She’d heard he was cute, smart and ambitious. “I was skeptical of all of it. In my experience, you put a suit on any half-intelligent Black man and white people tended to go bonkers.”
And just to be clear: “He was refreshing, unconventional, and weirdly elegant. Not once, though, did I think about him as someone I’d want to date.”
But as summer went on, she fell for his weirdness and his wit, his tardiness and his tranquility, and when the mystery tug at her heart became too strong to resist, she knew she was in trouble. “He was like a wind that threatened to unsettle everything,” she writes. She spends more than 50 pages in her memoir on the courtship.
By contrast, it takes Barack, a notoriously loquacious man, a mere four pages in a book of more than 700 pages to get from meeting Michelle to their wedding day.
Going into politics proved to be one of the biggest sources of contention in their marriage. “We began arguing more, usually late at night when the two of us were thoroughly drained,” he writes. “‘This isn’t what I signed up for, Barack,’” says Michelle. “‘I feel like I’m doing it all by myself.’”
Indeed, like so many women, she made a considerable sacrifice of her own career to ensure that the family they raised would be normal, and to help Barack become the most powerful man in the world — something he consistently acknowledges.
His wife, ever the pragmatist, and the more succinct of the writers, has the best explanation of how they have stayed together for nearly three decades:
“What happens when a solitude-loving individualist marries an outgoing family woman who does not love solitude one bit? The answer, I’m guessing, is probably the best and most sustaining answer to nearly every question arising inside a marriage, no matter who you are or what the issue is: You find ways to adapt. If you’re in it forever, there’s really no choice.”

Texto completo: Un médico de Nevada se sintió desanimado después de que una foto que se tomó a sí mismo en su hospital , un el estacionamiento habilitado para tratar a pacientes con COVID-19, se tergiversara en las redes sociales y fuera utilizada para afirmar que la pandemia es un engaño, cuando los casos en el estado van en aumento.
Ahora su hospital, el Renown Regional Medical Center, ha sido el objetivo principal de los teóricos de la conspiración, que están utilizando información errónea para alimentar su falsa narrativa, según informa The Associated Press.


As my 1st clinical week in the COVID ICU at Renown @renownhealth I want to thank all the incredible staff who are Fighting the Good Fight to help all those suffering from COVID-19. With 5 deaths in the last 32 hours, everyone is struggling to keep their head-up. Stay strong. pic.twitter.com/pHLp4PPzA6
— Jacob Keeperman (@critcare_airems) November 29, 2020


El Dr. Keeperman , director médico del Centro de Operaciones y Transferencias de Renown, publicó una selfie en Twitter con la esperanza de que comunicara la gravedad de la situación en el hospital, a medida que los casos continúan aumentando. Al menos 34 nuevas muertes por coronavirus y 2,731 nuevos casos se reportaron en Nevada el 3 de diciembre. Durante la semana pasada, hubo un promedio de 2,218 casos por día , un aumento del 21% del promedio dos semanas antes, The New York Times informó.
Keeperman le dijo a Associated Press que tomó la foto el día de la inauguración , el 12 de noviembre, cuando todavía no habían llegado pacientes. En un tweet, mencionó las 5 muertes que tuvieron lugar en las últimas 32 horas y habló sobre la lucha que todos enfrentaron, y agradeció a su personal por “ayudar a todos los que sufren de COVID-19”.
La fotografía del Dr. Keeperman fue luego utilizada por la cuenta @Networkinvegas para afirmar erróneamente que mostraba un “hospital falso” que “nunca había visto a un solo paciente”, informó The New York Times.
El martes, el presidente Trump supuestamente contribuyó a difundir las afirmaciones falsas al retuitear la publicación de @Networkinvegas con el comentario: “¡Resultados electorales falsos en Nevada, igual que esto!”. Twitter marcó el tuit del presidente como falso y señaló que la afirmación sobre el fraude electoral fue “disputada”, citó el periódico.
El 12 de noviembre, el hospital abrió un sitio de atención alternativa con dos pisos de camas hospitalarias suplementarias, dentro de una estructura de estacionamiento, para acomodar más casos de COVID-19 si es necesario. En las tres semanas desde la apertura del sitio, el personal médico ha atendido a un total de 219 pacientes con Covid-19 .
En todo Nevada, las hospitalizaciones han aumentado un 43% en los últimos 14 días, y un aumento del 55 % en muertes . Desde el comienzo de la pandemia, ha habido al menos 160,317 casos y 2,259 muertes en Nevada , según una base de datos del New York Times. (Estos números reflejan los datos a fecha 4 de diciembre).
“Es realmente desmoralizador para todos los que están trabajando tan duro que ese tema esté tan politizado y polarizado “, dijo el Dr. Keeperman a AP. “Estoy sosteniendo la mano de los pacientes cuando toman su último aliento porque su seres queridos no pueden estar con ellos”.
Durante una entrevista el miércoles, el Dr. Keeperman dijo que estaba “triste y decepcionado” al ver los ataques que rodearon su publicación en las redes sociales. “Envié ese tweet para reconocer y agradecer a todos nuestros compañeros de equipo de atención médica que a menudo no son reconocidos”, dijo. “Mi mayor deseo es no tener que decirle a otra familia que su ser querido no volverá a casa”.
Ha recibido una gran cantidad de apoyo de líderes locales, estatales y nacionales, de colegas de atención médica y de muchas personas anónimas en general, pero también ha recibido algunos “mensajes poco agradables” , reconoce. “He optado por ignorarlos y mantener la esperanza”, informó el Times.
El gobernador de Nevada, el demócrata Steve Sisolak , publicó en Twitter su respuesta a los últimos comentarios del presidente Trump sobre su estado el 1 de diciembre.


Today, I issued the following statement in response to a tweet from President Trump, where he agrees with the false claim that Renown Hospital’s alternate care site is “fake.”
My full statement is below: pic.twitter.com/6G1GqvDdRr
— Governor Sisolak (@GovSisolak) December 1, 2020


“Durante casi nueve meses, el estado de Nevada no solo ha tenido que luchar contra esta pandemia, sino que también hemos tenido que luchar contra los intentos continuos del presidente de politizar un virus que ha provocado más de 260,000 muertes estadounidenses”, dijo. “Su retórica consistente y engañosa sobre el COVID-19 es peligrosa e imprudente, y la suposición de que el lugar de atención médica de Renown es un” hospital falso “es uno de los peores ejemplos de este comportamiento que hemos visto”.

Manjoo: We’ve got a vaccine, now we need people to take it

Texto completo: In early September, officials in South Korea announced an ambitious plan to vaccinate 30 million people against the flu — 10 million more than last year, an increase aimed at keeping down rates of the flu while the country battled the coronavirus.
But as the New York Times reported, the internet soon got in the way. As the vaccine was distributed, a few logistical problems popped up, and South Koreans began circulating grave stories online — pictures of vaccine boxes that looked like they had been stored unsafely, reports of vaccine contaminated with mysterious white particles.
Then things got more serious. A 17-year-old died after getting the vaccine. Stories of more deaths began to pour in. “By Oct. 22, the reported death count had reached 28 and it was rising by the day,” the Times reported. “Singapore briefly suspended the use of a South Korean vaccine after the deaths were reported.”
Health officials were confident that the vaccine was safe, and they eventually determined that the deaths were coincidental; people die every day from a wide variety of causes, so it’s not surprising that among millions of people receiving vaccinations, some would die soon afterward for unrelated reasons. But online, the fear would not bend to rational explanation.
As the government took the time to thoroughly investigate the cases, “anxiety grew, trust fell and the vaccination program suffered,” Dr. Ki Mo-ran, an epidemiologist, told the Times.
This, I worry, is a taste of things to come in the United States.
In the last few weeks we’ve been blessed by spectacular news. “Operation Warp Speed,” the Trump administration’s program to expedite coronavirus vaccines, has been an amazing feat of science and public policy. Clinical trials suggest that vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna are each safe and effective at preventing infections of the coronavirus; a third company, AstraZeneca, has also reported positive results with its vaccine, though scientists are less confident about its findings. The three vaccines were all created in less than a year, a blistering pace for vaccines.
Yet we might still snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. A vaccine is most effective if a large portion of Americans take it — and on that question, recent history leaves me with a sour feeling.
Americans in 2020 exist in splintered realities. A large number of us believe one truth about Ukraine, face masks, hydroxychloroquine, climate change and the results of the presidential election; perhaps almost as large a number of us believe the opposite.
How can we prevent the coronavirus vaccines from falling into that perilous reality gap? The next few months could be pivotal, vaccine experts told me. With a new president in the White House, a loose-cannon ex-president who retains a hold on public attention and an internet-driven media ecosystem adept at minting rumor and outrage, there will be ample room for missteps.
What worries me most is that Americans’ decisions about whether to get vaccinated against the coronavirus might become less about science than about identity.
Getting people to trust vaccines is a long-studied question in public health. Jonas Salk’s vaccine for polio, one of the most devastating communicable diseases of the 20th century, was popular after it was tested and declared safe in 1955; rates of polio quickly fell.
But even the polio vaccine was plagued by distribution and manufacturing problems, and rates of vaccination in some urban and other low-income communities remained low for more than a decade. Polio was eliminated in the United States by the late 1970s.
Other vaccines gained traction more slowly. Though vaccinations against measles, whooping cough, diphtheria and rubella were first offered much earlier, it took until the 1990s for vaccination rates to eclipse 90%.
More recently, the internet has accelerated a global movement against vaccines — the so-called anti-vaxxers. Their numbers are relatively small, and the United States still has high rates of immunization. But because vaccine skeptics tend to be savvy about marshaling social media, they’ve wielded outsize influence in debates over vaccines, leading to a resurgence of measles and other preventable diseases in some communities. Now they could cause trouble in the rollout of coronavirus vaccines, too.
“The anti-vaxxers were very involved in the reopen movement, and in the anti-mask movement, and in the reject-all-scientific-evidence” movement, said Renée DiResta, the technical research manager at the Stanford Internet Observatory and a longtime scholar of how these groups use the internet. While DiResta expects that Americans are sick of isolation and will be eager to get vaccinated, she fears that in some geographic or social circles, anti-vaccine activists will wreak havoc.
“In certain communities, the low rates could mean that the vaccine is not as effective as it could be, and so diseases continue to take hold,” she said.
There are other worries. Noel Brewer, a professor at the Gillings School of Global Public Health at the University of North Carolina who studies why people choose to get vaccinated, told me that he hates the name of the program that accelerated work on the vaccines. “Warp speed” was a good way to emphasize its speedy development — but emphasizing speed could also sow doubt about the vaccine’s quality. In September, a poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that two-thirds of Americans worried that President Donald Trump was rushing the virus for political reasons.
Brewer also fears a slide into partisan warfare. “We don’t have much history with vaccination being a right or left issue — vaccination is pretty well embraced across the political spectrum,” he said. But on the right, there is a strong resistance to government mandates, which might play into increased skepticism about getting vaccinated.
South Korea’s public health officials have been praised for the transparent way they investigated and shut down misinformation about the flu vaccine, but rates of vaccination remain low — only 19 million people have gotten the flu shot, far short of the goal of 30 million. Still, Bruce Gellin, the president of global immunization at the Sabin Vaccine Institute, told me that Americans should allow scientists, rather than politicians, to take the lead in communicating about vaccines, as the Koreans did.
“If you do the math, you can anticipate that strokes and heart attacks will occur within days and weeks of being vaccinated, and since these are common occurrences, every media market will have a story about this — the person was fine, and then following vaccination they had a stroke,” Gellin told me. “That speaks to the need to keep our eyes open for things like this — to anticipate them and to look into them.”
Preparing for these incidents requires setting up monitoring systems early and quickly and transparently investigating problems in a way that solidifies public trust — in other words, exactly the sort of competence that has been missing from the Trump administration’s coronavirus plans.
I expect the Biden administration to be more rigorous and transparent. And Brewer told me that making the vaccines free and easy for Americans to get will be a much more effective way of promoting their use than devising some clever public relations campaign.
Still, I’m gloomy. We’ve had a hard time getting Americans on the same page about anything related to this virus. Now, we might have a magic bullet — or we may not, depending on whomever you choose to believe.

GAINSBOROUGH, England — The group of seven volunteers in high-visibility vests, equipped with GPS trackers and radios, gathered in the parking lot of a nature preserve on the outskirts of town.
“We’ll take the red route,” Rick Roberts said, shining his flashlight over a map of the woodland, as his breath formed a cloud in the cold, late-November air.
The group fanned out on the trails in teams for the next hour, the beams of their high-power flashlights crisscrossing through the trees outside Gainsborough, a once bustling market town nestled along the winding River Trent in Lincolnshire, in the East Midlands of England. They were there as part of Night Watch, a suicide-prevention initiative started just a few weeks earlier to monitor known suicide hot spots in the area, and they were looking for people in crisis.
This night was a good one: They found no one.
But the past few weeks have been busy for the Bearded Fishermen, the mental health charity behind the patrol project, and its co-founders, Roberts and Mick Leyland. With England just emerging from a second lockdown, they have seen a measurable uptick in calls for support and an increasing need for their crisis services as the community grapples with the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic.
“The cold and wet weather, long nights, it does affect a lot of people,” Leyland said. “And being on lockdown as well, it’s even worse.” In one recent week alone, they had responded to a number of crisis calls, including some from people threatening to take their own lives.
With the coronavirus pandemic devastating Britain and two national lockdowns leaving many feeling isolated, experts say there are rising concerns about the mental health and well-being of people across the country. Research has shown a rise in reports of loneliness — a particular concern for young people — difficulties for those with preexisting mental health issues and an increase in reports of suicidal ideation.
Though there is no recorded uptick in the national suicide rate yet, the risk of suicide among middle-age men remains concerning in Britain, where for decades the group has made up the highest number of suicide deaths.
The impact of the pandemic and its knock-on effects — lockdowns, an economic downturn and social isolation — on mental health have been well documented around the world. And in Britain, which is simultaneously grappling with the highest number of COVID-19 deaths in Europe and a deep recession, health experts worry that the effect could be felt for years to come.
Some neighborhoods in Gainsborough are considered the most deprived in Lincolnshire.
David, 22, who asked that his last name be omitted to protect his privacy, lives in the town and has struggled with depression and alcohol abuse for years.
“I was brought up by my granddad, so I was brought up to think, it doesn’t matter what’s going on, you have to just be strong,” he said. For David, the lockdown has posed new challenges. With his living situation growing more unstable and job opportunities dwindling, the stresses have added up.
“The pandemic has definitely made things a little bit more difficult, because there’s not as many services to access support from face-to-face,” he said, adding that the lack of human connection had been hard. He said that the Bearded Fishermen’s support provided a lifeline, but some days were better than others.
In some ways, Leyland said, the town feels “forgotten,” often overlooked in funding, even as “ homeless, jobless and low-income residents see their mental health adversely affected by the pandemic.
“There are a lot of people here who have been out of work for a while, who desperately want work,” Leyland said. “They get to that point where they think, ‘I’m better off not being here.’”
Leyland and Roberts officially registered the Bearded Fishermen charity — its name is a nod to their shared love of fishing and to the bushy facial hair they both sport — as the pandemic was just beginning in March. When England entered a second national lockdown, they began the Night Watch patrols.
The pair’s own mental health struggles and path to solace serve as powerful testimony. Both have survived suicide attempts. After being homeless for a time, Roberts moved to Gainsborough, and the two became friends during weekly fishing outings with a group of other men.
“We both suffer from depression and anxiety, and so fishing was a release for us,” Roberts said. “We used to sit there just chatting about things that we won’t chat to anyone else about.”
They thought others, particularly men who struggle to open up, could benefit from similar support. Late last year, they began a weekly community group, where men could “hash out their problems” over cups of tea at a local community center, Leyland said.
When the pandemic made gatherings impossible, they moved their meetings online. Then they set up the call center this summer, providing phone support 24/7.
“If someone doesn’t want to ring up because they’ve got it in their head that this is what they are doing,” Leyland said of people considering suicide, the patrols were an opportunity to intervene. The group works with emergency responders and the community to identify hot spots, and also helps search for missing people when their families have nowhere else to turn.
The charity has also found itself increasingly responding to mental health calls at residents’ houses. Last week, workers were called out to the home of a 28-year-old man whose wife said he was threatening to end his life. He had already written a suicide note. They spoke with him before calling the ambulance and police services, and referred him for counseling.
The situation in the Gainsborough area reflects the larger mental health strain across Britain. A report published by the British Journal of Psychiatry in October found an increase in reports of suicidal ideation during the pandemic. Young people, individuals from more socially disadvantaged backgrounds and those with preexisting mental health problems reported worsening conditions during the first national lockdown in the spring.
Mette Isaksen, a senior researcher and evidence manager at Samaritans, a British mental health charity that was a partner in the research, said that while the study revealed worrying trends, it did not necessarily mean suicides would rise.
“It’s just so important that people know they can get help,” she said. “Suicide is not inevitable.”
The Mental Health Foundation, which has been carrying out a nationwide study of the pandemic’s effect on mental health in Britain, found that reports of loneliness spiked during the first lockdown. The research also noted that, while some negative emotions reported early on — like anxiety, stress and panic — had dropped, feelings of loneliness and isolation had persisted.
Dr. Antonis Kousoulis, the foundation’s research director for England and Wales, said certain groups were of particular concern, including young people, who reported feelings of hopelessness at a markedly higher rate than the rest of population. Many with preexisting mental health issues have also seen their conditions worsen, he added.
“We are seeing that we are all in the same storm, but we are not all in the same boat,” Kousoulis said of the findings.
For Leyland and Roberts, the concerns for young people are also front of mind after a series of suicides and attempts in the nearby town of Winterton in recent weeks. With youth clubs closed and activities halted, they said many felt hopeless.
“It’s going to feel like the year that wasn’t,” Leyland said.
In response, volunteers with the Bearded Fishermen met with a group of teenagers at a makeshift memorial in Winterton for a young man who recently died by suicide, to offer their support.
“You’ve got a whole park fence just covered in flowers,” Leyland said of the tribute, his voice thick with emotion. He still feels a deep sense of regret over the young man’s death. “It’s like, maybe I could have been here two weeks earlier. But no one knew.”

MONTREAL— Félix Rose was 7 years old when he realized that the gentle father he idolized had a secret past.
“Your daddy killed someone,” his cousin told him during a family celebration, he recalled recently.
His father, Paul Rose, had been a leader of a violent extremist group, the Front de Libération du Québec, or FLQ, that agitated for Quebec’s independence from Anglophone-dominated Canada. The elder Rose was convicted in 1971 of the group’s most notorious crime: the kidnapping and murder in October 1970 of a Quebec Cabinet minister, Pierre Laporte. It was the first political assassination in Canada in more than a century.
Now, half a century later, the younger Rose, 33, has produced a documentary film about his family, “Les Rose,” that has been a surprise hit and sensation in Quebec, underlining how sensitive the events of that time remain, even decades later.
In making the film, Rose said, he was trying to understand what drove his father and uncle to violence. But some critics accused Rose of hagiography and historical revisionism, turning murderers into heroes.
“Every son wants to see their father as a hero, but ‘Les Rose’ is a whitewashing of history,” said Marc Cassivi, cultural commentator for La Presse, Canada’s leading French-language newspaper. “My fear is that young people will accept it as historic truth.”
From 1963 to 1970, the FLQ unleashed more than 200 bombs and robberies, most of them in Montreal, including a bomb that tore through the Montreal Stock Exchange in 1969, injuring 27 people. At least nine people died in the group’s attacks, among them a 64-year-old secretary and a 15-year-old militant killed by his own explosive.
Violence escalated in October 1970, a period that became known as the “October crisis.” Days before it took Laporte hostage, the FLQ kidnapped James Cross, a British diplomat, who was held for two months before being released.
Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau invoked the War Measures Act — the only time in Canadian history it was applied in peacetime. Armed soldiers patrolled the streets of Montreal, and hundreds of people were arrested without charges.
Le Devoir, a leading Francophone newspaper, said the film could allow “a whole generation to rediscover a part of its history,” while others lauded its lyrical evocation of a working-class Quebec family.
The debate over the film comes at a moment of cultural reckoning stirred up by the 50th anniversary of the October crisis. There are newly published memoirs by FLQ militants, books, podcasts and heated television discussions.
And, at a time when Quebec’s independence movement is in abeyance, Cassivi said some nationalists appeared drawn by the film’s romantic portrayal of the militants, eager to revive historical grievances and give their flagging cause a “spark.”
During the film’s Quebec City premiere, Catherine Dorion, a left-leaning member of Quebec’s National Assembly, raised her fist in the air in front of a poster of the film, mimicking a defiant gesture by Paul Rose in front of a Montreal courthouse in 1971.
Yves-François Blanchet, the leader of a Quebec nationalist party in Canada’s Parliament, called on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to apologize formally for what he said was excessive use of force during the crisis by the elder Trudeau, his father.
Félix Rose said he had not wished to reopen old wounds with this film but to understand why his father, who was a teacher, and his uncle, a mechanic, were radicalized and took up arms. His father, sentenced to life in prison, served 12 years before being paroled in 1982, and his uncle Jacques Rose, convicted of being an accomplice to the murder of Laporte, spent seven years in prison. Paul Rose died in 2013 at 69 of a stroke.
To make the movie, the filmmaker excavated family film footage and interviewed his uncle, his aunts and his mother.
“I didn’t set out to make a film purporting to be the only truth, but to find my truth,” he said from a park near the home where he lives with his partner and young daughter. “Being the child of someone who committed a crime is like having a phantom that haunts you, and I made this film to try to exorcise those demons.”
After his release from prison, the elder Rose rebuilt his life, working as a trade unionist and marrying Félix’s mother, Andrée Bergeron, a criminology student who was doing outreach at his prison. The October crisis was not brought up at family dinners.
But as the filmmaker grew older, he said, his desire for answers ate away at him. When his father fell ill, Félix, then in his 20s, finally confronted him. He said his father told him he had been a pacifist and had turned to violence after taking to the street was no longer an option.
“My father told me that kidnapping a man was a way to be heard because he no longer had a voice,” he said.
While researching his film, Rose said he had been struck by how generations of Québécois men in his family had been traumatized by their social exclusion in Ville Jacques-Cartier, a Montreal slum, while being subjugated by English-speaking bosses at work.
In one scene, Jacques Rose explains that his Anglophone manager chastised him after he hung a sign in French warning about safety hazards at his train repair plant.
But the film also glosses over the fact that by October 1970, Francophone Quebecers had attained new rights, including better access to education, during a period known as the Quiet Revolution.
“There is no statue of Paul Rose in a square in Quebec, no street or school in his name,” said Louise Harel, a former interim leader of the Parti Québécois, a pro-independence party that led Quebec from 1976 to 1985 and passed laws protecting the French language.
The film ignored that hard-won rights had been achieved through the ballot box rather than by blood, she said.
“Québécois do not support violence,” she said.
Others have criticized Félix Rose as having failed to hold his father and uncle accountable for their crimes.
The film does not adequately challenge Jacques Rose’s contention that the FLQ “never wanted to kill anyone,” even though the group claimed to have executed Laporte when the government refused to meet its demands.
Nor does it directly confront Jacques Rose about his role in killing Laporte, whose body was left in a car’s trunk near Montreal’s airport.
The film posits that Laporte was seriously injured when he tried to escape. A coroner’s report showed that he was strangled.
Félix Rose said that his father and uncle had vowed a pact of collective responsibility for the killing, and that pressing his uncle could have silenced him.
He also unequivocally condemned the killing, although he said he believes it was “an accident.” He said his father was absent during the act but accepted responsibility for it.
Geoff Turner, host of a recent podcast about the October crisis, said the memory of those events underlined the vast chasm that remained between Quebec and the rest of the country.
“My generation grew up with an ideal of a harmonious, bilingual Canada, and the October crisis gets little consideration outside of Quebec,” he said. “But in Quebec the feelings about it remain raw.”

NEW YORK — On a November afternoon, seven young students twirled, hopped and lifted their chests to the sky, as Waltz of the Snowflakes from “The Nutcracker” played through their computer speakers. Gathered for a weekly Zoom class, they had arrived at a part of the lesson that one of their teachers, Jenny Seham, called “freestyle snow dancing”: a moment to channel, through improvised movement, the wonder of Tchaikovsky’s music and the freedom of swirling snow.
“You guys really captured the feel for me,” Seham said when they had finished. “The important thing is that you’re listening to the music.”
Listening is a fundamental skill for anyone learning to dance, but especially so for Seham’s students. As a longtime teaching artist with National Dance Institute, which brings dance education to New York City children, Seham has worked for over a decade with students who are blind and visually impaired, in partnership with the Filomen M. D’Agostino Greenberg (FMDG) Music School.
This year, for the first time, the music school — which serves students of all ages with vision loss — is offering a five-week “Nutcracker” appreciation course to bring to life the holiday classic in a multisensory way. Led by Seham and Dalia Sakas, the music school’s director of music studies, the course provides background in the story, history and cultural context of “The Nutcracker” (presented a bit differently for children, teens and adults).
Each student also receives a package of “Nutcracker” artifacts: a pointe shoe, a candy cane, a long stretch of tulle (from which tutus are made), a story synopsis and glossary in large print or Braille, sheet music with sections of Tchaikovsky’s score, and, of course, a nutcracker.
Perhaps most important, the class allows students to imagine the ballet through movement — to experience aspects of the work through their own bodies.
“They can’t sit in the audience and see the snow, but they can be the snow,” Seham said in a phone interview. “For me this class is about being dance.”
While the course is new territory for the music school — a “beta tester” for teaching ballet appreciation, Sakas said — it also builds on existing programs. Founded in 1913 (and formerly part of the larger organization Lighthouse Guild), the school has a history of illuminating visual art through music. Since 1997, it has held an annual concert at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, pairing pieces from the museum’s collection with “music that enhances the spirit of the artwork,” Sakas said. In recent years, students have written poetry that informs the selection of music and art.
The “Nutcracker” course extends this idea to dance, opening up a fantastical world that students may know only by name.
“Even though they can’t see, they’re aware that there is a ‘Mona Lisa,’ they’re aware that these paintings exist,” Sakas said, “so why shouldn’t they be aware of dance as well?”
Because of the coronavirus pandemic, the music school moved its classes online, a shift that has been limiting in some ways but also “allowed us to dream a little bit” and try new things, Sakas said. Before the pandemic, children and teens from the school met for weekly in-person classes with Seham and volunteer alumni from National Dance Institute, who served as movement partners, guiding and collaborating with the students through physical touch. (The program is one of many facilitated by the dance institute, which was founded by New York City Ballet star Jacques d’Amboise in 1976 to make dance more widely accessible to children.)
“When we were able to meet in person, tactile teaching was a really important element,” Seham said. “Obviously online we can’t do that, so we’re left with audio description” — describing the steps in clear, direct detail — “and finding that we can do it; it’s just a little bit slower.”
To acquaint students with the traditional music and story of “The Nutcracker,” Sakas and Seham have been sharing excerpts from a 1993 video recording of the standard-bearer: George Balanchine’s 1954 version for New York City Ballet, in which a young girl, Marie, journeys with the Nutcracker Prince to the Kingdom of the Sugarplum Fairy (the Land of Sweets).
But Seham said she also wants students to know about more contemporary takes on the classic — with varied characters, settings, music and styles of dance — and to envision their own. She has introduced them, for instance, to Donald Byrd’s 1996 “Harlem Nutcracker,” featuring jazz arrangements of Tchaikovsky by Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn.
Students are asked to consider: “What would your ‘Nutcracker’ be? What would your magical journey be?” she said. “And how would that encompass what’s happening now and who you are?”
Those questions reflect Seham’s general approach to teaching at the music school, where she often connects dance with themes of social justice. Many of her students, she said, are children of color who confront multiple forms of discrimination in their daily lives.
“When we talk about systemic racism and lack of access and lack of inclusion, they’re in the middle of it,” she said. “And so I want, through the arts, for them to be able to express themselves and show themselves.”
For the “Nutcracker” course, Seham has been teaching some basic ballet steps while also leaving room for personal interpretation.
“How you interpret it, how you feel the rise and fall of it, that’s up to you,” she told a group of students, ages 12 to 17, referring to the back-side-side footwork of a pas de bourrée, a structured preface to “freestyle snow.” “You can’t really mess up,” she added.
In the absence of physical touch as a teaching tool, the items in the “Nutcracker” package offer a different kind of tactile experience. Daniel Gillen, 26, a pianist and longtime student at the music school, said the texture of the tulle surprised him. During the adult class, he danced with the wafting fabric wrapped around his waist.
“I didn’t think that it would be so porous,” he said in a phone interview. “Because all the air gets through, it almost becomes lighter than air.”
Opening the package, some students encountered a pointe shoe for the first time. (The shoes were collected by Daniel Ulbricht, a New York City Ballet principal, and are signed by members of the company who wore them.)
“Honestly, I’d never seen or heard of one,” Matthew Herrera, 12, said by phone. “It’s cool to see what real professionals wear.”
Matthew, who is visually impaired and has taken Seham’s classes for six years, said that as a musician who studies piano and voice, improvising is one of his strengths — and the same goes for dance. While dancing like snow, he said, he tried to think “about how it moves in the wind.”
“I feel like everyone, once in a while at least, should kind of just let themselves go, especially through art, dance included,” he said. “It’s fun to do it. It’s a beautiful thing.”

Texto completo: Wait for it . . . any day now . . . get ready for the "multipliers." You know, the idea that a government dollar spent magically turns into multiple dollars in the economy. We ought to start hearing that silly word again as the lame-duck coronavirus stimulus negotiations kick in. Expect more multiplier mumbo jumbo as the Biden administration begins its tax-and-spend fiesta.
Let's face it, the Democrats haven't had a believable economic messenger since Robert Rubin during the Clinton administration. Since then they've presented a cast of characters—Larry Summers, Mr. Biden's adviser Jared Bernstein, and lately Elizabeth Warren—who bend themselves into pretzels to justify higher spending and then higher taxes.
The New York Times described this trend during the early days of the Obama administration. The financial crisis team of Jason Furman, Tim Geithner and Mr. Summers were "carrying around this list of multipliers" taken from a chart by Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody's Analytics. Every dollar spent extending unemployment insurance benefits would, the fairy tale went, boost the economy by $1.64. Sadly, a dollar in reduced corporate taxes would boost the economy by only 30 cents. But cheer up, every dollar spent on food stamps would spur a $1.73 increase in gross domestic product. Mr. Zandi called it "bang for the buck"—the proverbial free lunch. It's more like "dud for the dollar" because it didn't work. It never does. Multipliers are a canard, a Keynesian conceit.
The economy grew after the Great Recession, as it does after every recession. The stimulus didn't stimulate. Shovel-ready projects weren't ready. Many complained that the stimulus wasn't big enough. More hooey. The Obama administration's high taxes and heaps of regulation held the economy back. Is spending driving today's recovery? Think back to the Heroes Act 2.0, Nancy Pelosi's $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief bill. Economic growth in the third quarter of 2020 was 33% as lockdowns were lifted, despite—or because of—that gigantic stimulus package not becoming law.
The theory of multipliers is based on the Keynesian view that poorer consumers tend to spend a large amount of increased income, and the rich less so. But multipliers are half a story. Someone has to put up the original money that allegedly gets multiplied, taking it away from the private sector and negating whatever dwindling chain of transactions are hypothesized. It's like two waves canceling each other out—you can't just do the math on the additive public wave and ignore subtracting the private. This demand-side theory omits the principle of productivity, the real driver of economic growth and prosperity.
But no matter, expect multiplier talk to, er, multiply. The Biden team already has gnomes busy at work sharpening their pencils finding new and innovative ways to raise taxes to spend on green and other favored projects, without having to pass new laws in a potentially divided Congress.
Mr. Biden's secret weapon is a guy named Ben Harris, who apparently knows his way around budget models and tax tables. The New York Times quotes the University of Pennsylvania's Rich Prisinzano saying Mr. Harris and the Biden team have a plan to "tax the same people and the same income as Warren and Sanders"—who want to impose wealth taxes—"they just do it through the existing tax code." I'll bet you dollars to doughnuts the justification is multipliers.
They don't work. " Why the Fiscal Multiplier is Roughly Zero " is the title of a 2013 paper by Scott Sumner for George Mason University, summarizing the Obama stimulus. The key line is that "estimates of fiscal multipliers become little more than forecasts of central bank incompetence," meaning the Federal Reserve's job of maintaining stable monetary conditions should actually require it to fight against stimulus. I've also read papers from the International Monetary Fund (a better sleep inducement than melatonin) that support Keynesian multipliers, and others that say multipliers are a lot smaller in reality than theory.
Actually, if you want to see a real multiplier in action, take Amazon. Since it began, it's had $47 billion in invested capital, equity and debt. It's worth a tad more than that now. Just sayin'.
What else will be justified with multipliers? Maybe nationalizing the 5G network and reinstating net neutrality. The pesky private sector can't be trusted, the reasoning might go. This isn't voodoo economics, it's froufrou or even tutu economics: dressed up to look good but only a facade.
About the only government spending that might actually multiply in the real economy is basic research—pure, fundamental research. Not enough, and you become a Third World has-been. Too much and you get Solyndra. Sure, I'd like to see money spent on basic research for nuclear fusion, advanced artificial intelligence, and genomic drug development. But keep it research; don't add in development as in R&D. And please don't slap a multiplier on the money spent, a number pulled out of thin air. How long will it be before Mr. Biden's pick for Treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, who studied under the Keynesian James Tobin, uses the M-word?

Report: Illness that hit spies, diplomats caused by radiation 'attack'

Texto completo: The most probable cause of a series of mysterious afflictions that have sickened American spies and diplomats abroad in the past several years was radio-frequency energy, a type of radiation that includes microwaves, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine has concluded in a report.
The conclusion by a committee of 19 experts in medicine and other fields cited "directed, pulsed radio-frequency energy" as "the most plausible mechanism" to explain the illness, which came to be known as Havana Syndrome, although they said that they could not rule out other possible causes and that secondary factors may have contributed to symptoms, according to a copy of the report obtained by The New York Times.
The report, which was commissioned by the State Department, provides the most definitive explanation yet of the strange illness that struck scores of government employees, first at the U.S. Embassy in Havana in 2016 and subsequently in China and other countries. Many of the officers suffered from dizziness, fatigue and headaches and loss of hearing, memory and balance, and some were forced to retire.
CIA officers visiting overseas stations experienced similar symptoms, the Times and GQ magazine reported in October. The officers were traveling to discuss countering Russia covert operations with foreign intelligence agencies, a fact that adds to suspicions that Moscow is behind the episodes.
Although couched in careful, scientific language, the new report reveals strong evidence that the incidents were the result of a malicious attack. It attributes the illnesses to "directed" and "pulsed" -- rather than "continuous" -- energy, implying that the victims' exposure was targeted, not the result of more common sources of microwave energy such as, for example, a cellphone.
It also said the committee found the immediate symptoms that patients reported -- including strange sensations of pain, pressure and sound that often appeared to emanate from a particular direction or occur in a specific spot in a room -- were more consistent with a directed "attack" of radio-frequency energy.
The committee considered other causes, like chemical exposures and infectious diseases, but said they appeared unlikely.
Several of the victims have accused Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other Trump administration officials of downplaying the issue in an attempt to avoid disrupting international ties.
The report does not point to a perpetrator, although it mentions "significant research in Russia/USSR" on pulsed radio-frequency technology.

Texto completo: By sharing less on social media, we might actually find ourselves sharing more.
By Kevin Roose | Technology columnist for The New York Times
When I was a kid, envelopes would periodically arrive in the mail from my grandmother, stuffed with articles she had clipped out of newspapers and magazines for everyone in the family. These clippings, all annotated with her handwritten commentary, meant the world to us because we knew she had taken the time and energy to pull her scissors out of the drawer, find a stamp and an envelope, and pick only the articles she knew we'd be interested in -- a book review for my mom, an art essay for my brother, a comic strip for me.
Had she been a generation or two younger, she likely would have shared those articles on Facebook. But they would have had none of the emotional resonance, and little of the personalized appeal, because of the corrosive impact of what might be the most destructive technological innovation of the last two decades: the share button.
The first share icons appeared online in 2006, and one-button sharing didn't arrive on Facebook until 2012, but then spread quickly to nearly every other major social app. At first, this function seemed like a harmless digital version of Grandma Roose's clippings: Here, check out this recipe. Whoa, cute dog video -- better share this with everyone I know! But we soon learned that their real purpose was to turn us all into high-volume broadcasters. The concept of "virality" was born, and publishers started taking advantage of this new, metastatic power, churning out lists and quizzes we would have no choice but to pass on.
The problem, of course, is that share buttons also made it trivially easy for bad things to spread. Scammers, extremists and conspiracy theorists took advantage of social media's mechanics, and soon our feeds were overflowing with irrelevant and dangerous posts placed there by our friends and acquaintances with minimal effort. Those hoping to sow chaos and division, like Russia's Internet Research Agency during the 2016 election, needed only to seed propaganda with a handful of share-happy Americans; we'd take it from there.
It would be facile to blame share buttons for all of society's evils. But getting rid of them could do us a world of good. Just ask Instagram, which has doggedly refused to add a one-tap "regram" button to its app for years, and as a result has had many fewer viral misinformation scandals than its parent company, Facebook. Other platforms that have experimented with making sharing harder, like Twitter and WhatsApp, have generally found that it improves the overall quality of their services.
Twitter recently reported that its pre-election experiment this year, in which it added an extra bit of friction to discourage thoughtless sharing, led to a 23 percent decrease in retweets -- a change it was actually proud of, since it slowed the spread of misleading information.
Social networks are learning, albeit belatedly, that sharing with everyone you know shouldn't be seamless and instantaneous. It should require something: some effort, a brief moment of consideration between consumption and replication. Share buttons don't just enable the bad guys. They deprive us of the opportunity to make meaning out of what we share -- adding the poignant caption, the funny aside, the personalized touch. They make us conduits for other people's tastes, rather than curators of our own. By sharing less, we might actually find ourselves sharing more.

Texto completo: IN THE EARLY 21st century -- a decade into the experiment of the public internet, which was introduced in 1991, and with Facebook and Twitter not yet glimmers of data on the horizon -- a new phrase slipped into Chinese slang: renrou sousuo, literally translated as "human flesh search." The wording was meant to be whimsical, suggesting the human-powered equivalent of what were then fairly novel computer search engines. (In English, the nuances are lost; no zombie inflection was intended.) A request would go out for wangmin (web citizens), or in this case the more intimate wangyou (web friends, internet users sharing a common passion or cause), to come together as a kind of ad hoc detective agency in order to ferret out information about objects and figures of interest. It was just an outlet for fandom. But soon attention turned toward supposed wrongdoers, those thought to exhibit moral deficiency, from a low-level government official spotted flashing a designer watch far above his pay grade, hinting at corruption, to, more horrifically, a woman in a "crush video" -- a fringe genre of erotica that traffics in animal cruelty -- wielding stilettos to stomp a kitten to death. Once these offenders were identified and their personal details exposed online, they were hounded, verbally flogged and effectively expelled from the community.
To a Western observer, this was human flesh indeed: a pound of it, exacted. Media coverage in the West framed renrou sousuo as an exotic phenomenon, almost unheard-of outside China. It couldn't happen here. When The New York Times ran a feature on it in 2010, one commenter wrote, "I am surprised by the intensity of the searches and I think this is an Eastern trait. Most people in the West can't be bothered, we are too individualistic and well served by existing mechanisms" -- even though English already had its own word, "doxxing," for such online revelations, with roots in 1990s computer hacker discussion boards. Weiwei Shen, a founding editor of the Tsinghua China Law Review, made a similar, if more subtle, argument in a 2016 essay, noting that the human flesh search was a "grass-roots" effort and thus far more likely to arise in "collectivist" China, as opposed to go-it-alone America.
But this is the American way now. We call it cancel culture.
So much has been written about cancel culture in the past year that weariness sets in just reading the words. What it is, what to call it and whether it even exists are all in dispute. The term is shambolically applied to incidents both online and off that range from vigilante justice to hostile debate to stalking, intimidation and harassment. Any of the following might qualify: outcries last summer over cellphone video footage of a white tech executive yelling expletives at a Filipino-American family at a restaurant in California (he reportedly resigned from his company); speculations that a pop star's father was secretly a C.I.A. agent and thus an accomplice to colonialism and genocide; editors at The New York Times and The New York Review of Books stepping down after running controversial pieces that provoked dissent from their own staff; the suspension of a white professor who used a Chinese word in class that sounded like a racial slur in English; a beauty YouTuber shedding close to three million subscribers in a single weekend after a colleague accused him of betrayal and emotional manipulation (he has since recouped these losses and currently claims an audience of more than 23 million); and far-right conspiracists dredging up an anti-Trump filmmaker's old, puerilely offensive tweets (he was fired by Disney, then rehired eight months later).
Once we spoke of "call-out culture," but the time for simply highlighting individual blunders for the edification of a wider audience, as in a medieval morality play, seems to have passed. Those who embrace the idea (if not the precise language) of canceling seek more than pat apologies and retractions, although it's not always clear whether the goal is to right a specific wrong and redress a larger imbalance of power -- to wreak vengeance as a way of rendering some justice, however imperfect; to speak out against those "existing mechanisms" that don't serve us so well after all; to condemn an untrustworthy system and make a plea for a fairer one -- or just the blood-sport thrill of humiliating a stranger as part of a gleeful, baying crowd. Some prefer the more sober term "accountability culture," although this has its own complications, having been heretofore deployed in the corporate and public sector to support the need for a hierarchy or external authority to hold employees and institutions to their commitments, with an eye to boosting results: a measure of productivity, not behavior or values.
To say "cancel culture," then, is already to express a point of view, implicitly negative. Although cancel culture is not a movement -- it has neither leaders nor membership, and those who take part in it do so erratically, maybe only once, and share no coherent ideology -- it's persistently attributed to the extremes of a political left and a fear-mongering specter of wokeness, itself a freighted term, originally derived and then distorted from the Black vernacular "woke," which invokes a spirit of vigilance to see the world as it really is. (The experimental novelist William Melvin Kelley may have been the first to introduce "woke" to the mainstream as an adjective, in his 1962 essay on Black idiom, "If You're Woke You Dig It," in which he noted how words change with the color of the people who use them: "At one time, the connotations of 'jive' were all good; now they are bad, or at least questionable.") Yet cancellations come just as easily from those aligned in thinking with the far right: Recall how, in 2014, a group of video gamers pressured corporations -- under the guise of championing ethics in journalism -- to withdraw advertising dollars from media outlets that had criticized lack of diversity in the game industry, and at the same time terrorized female gamers and writers with rape and death threats.
To some, this very amorphousness is the danger, making cancel culture a culture in the microbial sense, of a controlling environment -- a "stifling atmosphere," in the words of "A Letter on Justice and Open Debate," which appeared in Harper's in July as a call to arms against the perceived new dogmatism (without ever naming it), signed by 153 academic and artistic luminaries, some of whom themselves had been mobilized against (i.e., canceled) for expressing what the letter characterized, somewhat abstractly, as "good-faith disagreement." Many have dismissed this letter, mostly on the grounds of: It was ever thus. Cancel culture doesn't exist because it has always existed, in rumors, whispers and smear campaigns, and censorship and retribution are far worse when sponsored or tacitly sanctioned by the state, as with the imprisonment and kangaroo-court convictions of those exercising free speech under totalitarianism, or the blacklisting and barring from employment of suspected Communists in the United States in the 1940s and 1950s, a collaborative effort between the House Un-American Activities Committee and an eager-to-please private sector. The speed, sloppiness and relative anonymity of social media haven't created a radically new strain of bullying; they just facilitate and exacerbate an old one. And some would argue that it's not bullying at all, but the opposite: a means to combat abusive behavior and exploitation of power, and a necessary corrective to the failure of the state to protect its citizens.
Left unanswered is what explains the urgent need to not just call out but condemn -- the resurgence of ancient beliefs in scapegoating and human sacrifice; the shift in American society from guilt to shame; the evolution of a digital form of carnival and misrule as a safety valve to let out all our pent-up rage -- and why, even as pundits decry cancel culture as a mob running amok, the powers that be somehow remain in place, unchanged.
"CANCEL" IS A consumerist verb, almost always involving a commodity or transaction. Readers cancel magazine subscriptions; studio heads cancel TV shows; bank tellers cancel checks to show that they've been exhausted of value. The journalist Aja Romano, writing in Vox, tracked down what may be the first popular reference to canceling people instead of things in Mario van Peebles's 1991 cult movie, "New Jack City," when the crime boss Nino Brown slams his girlfriend down on a table -- she's protesting his fondness for murder -- and sloshes champagne over her, saying, "Cancel that bitch. I'll buy another one." The rapper 50 Cent reprised Nino's line in his 2005 hit "Hustler's Ambition," and Lil Wayne did the same five years later in "I'm Single." As this informal usage entered broader slang (again, like "woke" and much of contemporary American lexicon, taken from Black culture), it fused with the more common meaning of the verb and became an imperative to revoke allegiance. In perhaps the earliest instance of cancel culture to include the term, in 2014, the official Twitter account of the Comedy Central show "The Colbert Report" posted a joke that could be taken as a denigration of Asians, and the activist Suey Park responded with the hashtag #CancelColbert -- only to end up getting doxxed and canceled herself, with so much vitriol directed her way that she fled her home and started communicating with burner phones.
In "Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents" (2020), the American journalist Isabel Wilkerson reaches back to the Book of Leviticus to examine one of the mechanisms underlying hierarchy and the insistence of exclusion: the scapegoat, or sa'ir la'aza'zel -- a literal goat, ceremonially endowed by the high priest with "all the guilt and misdeeds" of the community and driven out into the wilderness. The Greeks practiced a kindred rite, using a human sacrifice, the pharmakos, who was beaten and promenaded in the streets before being exiled, which was considered a kind of death. (Some historians believe that executions took place as well, but others find the evidence inconclusive.) This was at once diversion and atonement, a way for a dominant group to label an "other" as evil and cast that evil out, as if it would then no longer abide within them and they could imagine themselves "free of blemish," Wilkerson writes.
The modern scapegoat performs an equivalent function, uniting otherwise squabbling groups in enmity against a supposed transgressor who relieves the condemners of the burden of wrestling with their own wrongs. What is lost, the Canadian philosopher Charles Taylor argues in "A Secular Age" (2007), is the ambivalent, numinous duality of the sacrificial victim. ("Pharmakos" comes from "pharmakon," which is both itself and its opposite: medicine and poison at once, healer and killer.) No longer is it acknowledged, however tacitly or subconsciously, that the scapegoat, whether guilty or not of a particular offense, is ultimately a mere stand-in for the true culprits responsible for a society gone askew (ourselves and the system we're complicit in). Instead, the scapegoat is demonized, forced to bear and incarnate everyone's guilt, on top of their own.
These expulsions are necessarily public, which is something of a historical regression: When the colonial theocracy of 17th-century America gave way to the Enlightenment and democracy, penalties as spectacle -- whippings, arms and legs trapped in stockades and pillories, Hester Prynne's scarlet A -- fell out of fashion and, as the British journalist Jon Ronson notes in "So You've Been Publicly Shamed" (2015), were largely abandoned as a government-mandated punishment, although they continued in extrajudicial form in the lynchings of Black people, from Reconstruction through the 1960s. In keeping with the American ideal of self-reliance, citizens were expected to be attuned to their own sense of guilt. The 20th-century American anthropologist Ruth Benedict, writing about cultural differences between Japan and the West, distinguished guilt as a legacy of Judaism and Christianity, suffering from the internal knowledge of having failed to live "up to one's own picture of oneself," versus shame as the fear of external criticism and ridicule. Guilt guides conduct even in the absence of social sanctions, when nobody knows you've done anything wrong; shame "requires an audience," a social network, to force you to change.
It's instructive that, for all the fear that cancel culture elicits, it hasn't succeeded in toppling any major figures -- high-level politicians, corporate titans -- let alone institutions.
But guilt still derives from communally agreed-upon standards, be they manifest as religion, ideology, a legal code or just the rudimentary ethics without which no group can survive. The increasing atomization of American society in the 21st century has brought an unmooring from such consensus. As standards have shifted, some have grasped for stone only to find a handful of dust. If you can't trust others to follow their conscience or even have one, and you've lost faith in the ability or desire of institutions to uphold what is good -- if you no longer believe that we live in a city upon a hill, that our society is just or even aspires to be -- there may be no recourse (short of revolution) but to scold and menace, like modern-day Puritans. The act of shaming draws a neat line between good and bad, us and them. Perhaps it's no coincidence that the etymology of "cancel" leads to the Latin "cancelli," derived from "cancri"/"cancer," a lattice or grid of crossed bars: a barrier, in other words, linked by dissimilation to "carcer" (prison), and in its early adaptation to English taken literally, as a crossing out, lines drawn through words on paper.
THE SHEER ARBITRARINESS of some of the targets of cancel culture -- singled out among many who might have committed comparable sins, often neither public figures nor possessors of institutional power but utterly ordinary people before their swift, simultaneous elevation-degradation to infamy -- lends a ritualistic distance to the attacks, enabling a casual cruelty, as in the American writer Shirley Jackson's infamous short story "The Lottery" (1948), when the villagers qualmlessly turn on one of their randomly selected own. The French philosopher René Girard, in "Violence and the Sacred" (1979), notes that "the very fact of choosing a victim bestows on him the aura of exteriority ... the surrogate victim is not perceived as he really was -- namely, as a member of the community like all the others." To justify vindictiveness, you can't recognize yourself in those you denounce; you have to believe, as Taylor writes, that they "really deserve it."
Critics of cancel culture see parallels in the Jacobins of the French Revolution in the 18th century, the Red Guards of the Chinese Cultural Revolution from 1966 to 1976 and the estimated 600,000 to 2 million private citizens -- out of a population of around 17 million -- who acted as part-time informants for the Stasi, the East German secret police, from 1950 to 1990. None are proper analogues, for all derived their punitive power from the state. Allusions are also made to the Spanish Inquisition, which persecuted heresy from the 15th century to the 19th, and the Salem witch trials in late 17th-century Massachusetts, both a joint effort of church and state, when there was little distinction between them. These examples are relevant only in showing how the archaic use of violence to affirm purity has evolved to serve latter-day ideologies. In France, the spree at the guillotine was rationalized as the pursuit of good: a Reign of Terror to yield a Republic of Virtue. (The revolutionary leader Maximilien Robespierre, who famously declared in 1794 that without terror, "virtue is impotent," supported the future elimination of the death penalty even as he ordered executions by the thousands.) Mao Zedong embroidered the same theme in a letter to his wife in 1966, invoking "great disorder under heaven" in order to achieve "great order." And while some Stasi informants may have reported on their friends and neighbors out of fear, researchers have determined that most did so to safeguard the state's righteousness and, by extension, their own.
Compared to these authoritarian regimes, however, cancel culture is rudderless, a series of spontaneous disruptions with no sequential logic, lacking any official apparatus to enact or enforce a policy or creed. If anything, it's anti-authoritarian: Historically, Westerners do not approve of informing on behalf of the government and its enforcers, giving the act shaded names like "snitch" and "narc," the latter explicitly defined in an 1859 British slang dictionary as someone who "breaks faith." Children are advised not to be tattletales. (We're more comfortable with whistle-blowers, who speak out against the powerful.)
What cancellations offer instead is a surrogate, warped-mirror version of the judicial process, at once chaotic yet ritualized. It's a paradox reminiscent of the mayhem in medieval Catholic traditions of carnival and misrule, wherein the church and governing bodies were lampooned and hierarchy upended -- all without actually threatening the prevailing hegemony, and even reaffirming it. "Misrule always implies the Rule that it parodies," the American-Canadian anthropologist Natalie Zemon Davis has written; the very excess and occasional destructiveness of the revelries gave testament to the wisdom of those normally in charge. Davis suggests that these festivals offered "alternatives to the existing order." But why would the church, which presumably brooked no alternatives, condone such subversion? From its perspective, carnival was a convenient catharsis: a brief hiatus from the moral strictures of daily life, when the populace was allowed to indulge their mutinous impulses and expend their restive energies, the better to return to compliance on the morrow.
It's instructive that, for all the fear that cancel culture elicits, it hasn't succeeded in toppling any major figures -- high-level politicians, corporate titans -- let alone institutions. Those most vulnerable to harm tend to be individuals previously unknown to the public, like the communications director who was fired in 2013 after tweeting, from her personal account, an ill-thought-out joke about Africa, AIDS and her own white privilege (she landed another job six months later) or the data analyst who was fired last spring after tweeting, in the wake of protests against the death of George Floyd in police custody, a study that suggested that riots depressed rather than increased Democratic Party votes (his employer has denied that the tweet was the cause for his dismissal) -- although both situations reveal less about the impact of cancel culture than the precariousness of at-will employment, in which one can be fired for any reason, whether legitimate or not. The more power someone has, the less affected they are: The British writer J.K. Rowling, one of the signatories of the Harper's letter, has been publicly excoriated in the past year for expressing her views on gender identity and biological sex, but people continue to buy her books; disgraced high-profile comedians who've returned to the stand-up circuit, not always repentant, have been rewarded with sold-out shows. When the mighty do fall, it often takes years, coupled with behavior that's not just immoral but illegal. The studio head Harvey Weinstein was indicted for crimes, not canceled.
In a 1972 conversation with the French theorist Michel Foucault, the French philosopher Benny Lévy (then using the nom de guerre Pierre Victor) pointed to the example, at the end of World War II, of "those young women whose heads were shaved because they had slept with the Germans" -- while a number of those who had actively collaborated with the Nazis went unpunished: "So the enemy was allowed to exploit these acts of popular justice; not the old enemy -- the Nazi occupation forces ... but the new enemy, the French bourgeoisie." In keeping a narrow focus on small-scale violations of the social contract, cancel culture has uncomfortable kinship, as the American essayist Meghan Daum has written, to the "broken windows" policing put into practice starting in the 1980s, based on a theory by the American criminologists George L. Kelling and James Q. Wilson that posited that cracking down on minor crimes would prevent larger ones. Instead, it led to the scourge of stop-and-frisk, in which ordinary people, innocent of a crime and disproportionately of color, were routinely and repeatedly treated like suspects and searched, manhandled and interrogated as such.
The trespasses cited in cancel culture often do encapsulate and typify greater ills, as when a white woman called the police on a Black birder in Central Park last spring and falsely claimed that he was threatening her. Holding these acts up as evidence of the dailiness of inequity might be revelatory for some and even budge the needle on how people think of racism, misogyny and class oppression in America today. As the British sociologist Stanley Cohen wrote, when crowds muster against perceived threats to public mores -- in what we call a moral panic -- those threats, while exaggerated, are still potent as "warning signs of the real, much deeper and more prevalent condition." But moral panics were traditionally engineered by those in power to reassert the need for modes of control, or by commercial interests to profit off the attention that comes via scandal. They were forms of manipulation, diverting public ire from structural injustice toward a specific ostracized group as an embodiment of evil, or folk devils, a coinage by Cohen in the late 1960s. (Fear of cancel culture is itself a moral panic -- a moral panic over moral panics, one orchestrated on high over those generated extempore below.)
Although in cancel culture the moral panics are roving and unpremeditated, they can still be exploited for the benefit of the dominant class. So long as the folk devils of cancel culture are plucked from the masses or are merely artsy celebrities or subalterns of politics or industry, the world stays essentially the same.
CANCEL CULTURE MAY have reached its apotheosis this September when a professor of history and Africana studies at George Washington University admitted online that she was white, not Black, as she had been posing for her entire career. "You should absolutely cancel me, and I absolutely cancel myself," she declared, but then added, "What does that mean? I don't know," nullifying the entire premise. Self-abasement was tendered, but no concrete action. She affirmed the importance of cancel culture as "a necessary and righteous tool for those with less structural power to wield against those with more power," yet insisted, "I can't fix this," as if she could embrace accountability without actually doing anything to alter her actions; as if she had no power to remove herself from power. Only after the university began investigating her public statement did she resign from her tenured position, nearly a week later.
On Twitter, people speak scoffingly of canceling themselves, as a joke or a pre-emptive measure, since presumably any of us could be canceled at any time, living in our glass Instagrams, leaving a spoor of digitized gaffes behind us. (The Canadian media theorist Marshall McLuhan eerily anticipated cancel culture in his 1967 book "The Medium Is the Massage" -- the title was a typesetter's error that McLuhan embraced -- expressing concern, before the first resource-sharing computer network was even completed, about the "womb-to-tomb surveillance" made possible by "the electrically computerized dossier bank -- that one big gossip column that is unforgiving, unforgetful and from which there is no redemption, no erasure of early 'mistakes."') There's the tacit hope that if we have the grace to cancel ourselves first, our ostracism will be temporary, a mere vacation from social media. Absolution is reduced to performance, a walk with bowed head through jeers and splattered mud. Instead of retreating into introspection and actually examining our behavior, we submit to punishment and imagine ourselves thereby purged of both sin and the need to do anything about it. We emerge clean, or so we let ourselves believe.
But what is the point of all this flagellation, of self and others, if meanwhile the structures that enable wrongdoing continue to creak and loom, doing business as usual? The scapegoat was not always a marginal figure. Consider Oedipus, the tyrannos-pharmakos of Thebes and unknowing sinner whose crimes brought great suffering to his people -- blighted crops, plague -- and who had to be sacrificed that they might live. This specter, of the sovereign laid low, appears to haunt the American entrepreneur and venture capitalist Peter Thiel, who in his 2014 treatise-slash-self-help manual "Zero to One" (co-written with Blake Masters) casts a glance at the restive hordes below: "Perhaps every modern king is just a scapegoat who has managed to delay his own execution" -- although it's worth noting that today's potentates rule unhindered by the bygone fetters of interfering gods and binding prophecies.
There was a time when we lived in a moral economy, which is to say, an economy that acknowledged, if not always observed, moral concerns. The British social historian E.P. Thompson used the term as a framework for understanding food riots in 18th-century England, when, in times of dearth, people set their sights on profiteers and organized what he described as "a kind of ritualized hooting or groaning" outside shops to make their displeasure known. Today we hoot and groan still, but seemingly everywhere and at everything, so that even the worthiest and most urgent causes get lost in the clamor. The many subcultures whose complaints buoy the larger, nebulous cancel culture tend to fixate on minutiae, which can distract from attempts to achieve broader change.
And this may be an intentional distraction. Every obsessive search on Google for proof of wrongdoing, every angry post on Twitter and Facebook to call the guilty to account, is a silent ka-ching in the great repositories of these corporations, which woo advertisers by pointing to the intensity of user engagement. "Despite the egalitarianism claimed for social media by capital's libidinal engineers ... this is currently an enemy territory, dedicated to the reproduction of capital," the British cultural critic Mark Fisher wrote in his 2013 essay "Exiting the Vampire's Castle." Twitter, cancel culture's main arena, is not the digital equivalent of the public square, however touted as such. We think of it as an open space because we pay no admission, forgetting that it's a commercial enterprise, committed to herding us in. We are customers but also uncredited workers, doing the free labor of making the platform more valuable.
For now, this is the circus that sates us, that keeps us from waking to the truth of our life and turning, glowering, toward the barred gates. We burn our effigies, forgetting that they're actual people like us, as our overlords look on from afar, brows knitted but not quite worried, not yet. Still, these "modern kings" would do well to remember: In Sophocles' telling, Oedipus doesn't run from his fate. He begs for exile, to heal his people. He cancels himself.

Texto completo: NEW YORK - President Trump, already saddled with lawsuits and investigations that will follow him when he leaves office, is now facing a legal challenge from former tenants who say he and his family manipulated the cost of apartment improvements to raise their rents.
The group of tenants from rent-regulated apartments that late family patriarch Fred C. Trump once owned are pursuing a class-action lawsuit, alleging a long-running scheme in which a Trump-controlled company, All County Building Supply, artificially adjusted the cost of appliances and other materials to justify raising rents at more than 30 buildings previously owned and managed by the Trumps in Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island.
The president is a named defendant in the lawsuit, along with his siblings Robert S. Trump, now deceased, and Maryanne Trump Barry, a retired federal judge. The companies that own or oversee the properties now are also named in the suit, because they have benefited from the rent increases that took effect years ago, the complaints says.
The case names 20 plaintiffs who represent a class of victims. It was filed in New York State Supreme Court in Brooklyn.
The lawsuit was first reported by the New York Times.
The allegations stem from a New York Times investigation that exposed a history of alleged malfeasance as the Trump family's sizable real estate business ballooned into an empire. The conduct alleged in the case began in the 1990s. The Trumps sold off the properties over the next several years.
If the plaintiffs prevail, Trump and the other defendants could owe "many millions" in compensation and damages, said lawyer Jerrold S. Parker, who represents the tenants. The suit alleges that current and former tenants from at least 14,000 apartments were overcharged.
"This is a massive fraud spanning 28 years, victimizing several hundred thousand tenants in Trump regulated apartments and needs to be addressed," Parker said in statement. "These regulated tenants, many of whom struggle just to pay the rent and put food on the table, must be made whole for the money that was unlawfully and unknowingly taken from them by the Trump family for their own personal gain."
The Trump Organization did not respond to a request for comment, though in a statement to the Times, a family spokeswoman dismissed the lawsuit as "completely frivolous" and unsupported by evidence.
The lawsuit alleges that the Trumps illegally raised rents by inflating the costs of apartment improvements. Under New York law, a landlord may increase rents if significant upgrades are made.
The tenants' lawsuit claims that Trump and his family used All County Building Supply to create doctored invoices reflecting inflated costs of improvements and resold items such as stoves and refrigerators to themselves for more money than they were worth. In doing so, the lawsuit alleges, the Trumps had license to increase rents higher than they would have been able to had they paid fair prices for making such improvements.
The lawsuit alleges that President Trump's late cousin John Walter created the All County invoices, and that Walter and the Trumps would keep the profits.
When Trump leaves the White House next month, he faces numerous other legal battles that began during his presidency, allegations that stem from his past business activity and personal conduct.
Manhattan's district attorney and New York state's attorney general both have active investigations into Trump and the Trump Organization.
Also in New York, Trump faces defamation lawsuits brought separately by two women who have accused him of sexual assault. Trump's niece, Mary L. Trump, also is suing the president and his siblings over an inheritance dispute.
In all instances, the president has denied any wrongdoing.

In Somalia, U.S. Troop Withdrawal Is Seen as Badly Timed

NAIROBI, Kenya — Somalis fear a U.S. decision to withdraw troops from their country will be seen as a victory for al-Qaida-linked militants who have wreaked havoc there for years, and sow the potential for further chaos at an especially delicate moment for Somalia and the region.
Somali presidential elections are scheduled in just two months; war is erupting in neighboring Ethiopia; and the militants, from al-Shabab, are still strong despite years of U.S.-led raids and drone strikes.
The timing of Friday’s Pentagon announcement, some Somalis say, is terrible.
“The fight against global terrorism is still ongoing, and we must still win the battle for peace and security to prevail,” said Ayub Ismail Yusuf, a Somali senator, who called the U.S. decision “untimely” on Twitter. “We must not give up on our successes.”
At Mogadishu University, Abdullahi, a 23-year-old political science student, said he feared al-Shabab will now be able to “strike without fear” in the capital.
“Now their leaders can move easily from place to place with little threat,” he added, asking that his full name be withheld to protect against possible reprisals. He lives near the charred remains of an ice cream parlor blitzed by an al-Shabab suicide bomber Nov. 27, an attack that killed seven people.
The Pentagon said it will “reposition” some of the estimated 700 U.S. troops in Somalia to other parts of East Africa — likely Kenya and Djibouti — and continue to carry out raids against al-Shabab and a smaller cluster of Islamic State group fighters in northern Somalia from bases in neighboring countries.
Drone strikes, which have killed numerous senior and midlevel al-Shabab commanders as well as dozens of civilians, will continue.
President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed of Somalia did not immediately react to the U.S. decision, announced late Friday as part of President Donald Trump’s drive to end what he calls America’s endless wars before leaving office Jan. 20. Whether fears over the withdrawal, which is expected by mid-January, are fully merited is not yet clear.
What seems certain, though, is that the brunt of the changes will be borne by Danab, an elite Somali force that the U.S. military took under its wing after its formation in 2013. Since then, U.S. soldiers have trained and armed the Somali commandos, whose numbers have grown to about 1,000, and have often accompanied them on raids against al-Shabab.
Now Danab will be largely on its own.
Col. Ahmed Abdullahi Sheikh, who commanded Danab between 2016 and 2019, said he expected the United States to continue funding and arming the elite force. But the crucial U.S. “advise-and-assist” role — Americans helping Somali officers plan raids and accompanying them into firefights — will not be easily replaced, he said.
“You can launch and stage operations from countries like Djibouti and Kenya, but it’s not the same as being in the country,” Sheikh said. “You can’t train a force remotely.”
Even with years of U.S. support, Somalia has been able to only partially blunt al-Shabab’s potency.
The group controls swaths of southern Somalia, where its fighters ambush and bomb Somalia soldiers and African Union peacekeepers. A recent U.S. government report noted that al-Shabab was involved in 440 violent events in Somalia between July and September — the highest number in two years.
U.S. and Somali pressure has succeeded, though, in stemming sophisticated, large-scale attacks in Mogadishu, said Omar Mahmood, a Somalia analyst at the International Crisis Group, a conflict research organization.
The Somalis were supposed to be standing on their own feet in the coming year. An international plan hashed out in 2017 called for Somali security forces to be operating independently by 2021. That will not happen.
Danab, the main counterterrorism strike force, still relies heavily on U.S. support and has reached only about one-third of its planned size.
The U.S. withdrawal “could have a pretty big impact” Mahmood said. “The American advisory role is invaluable for Danab. This raises concerns it can continue to develop.”
Danab is not the main pillar of Somali security. The government relies heavily on a 19,000-strong force of African Union peacekeepers — although that, too, has been buffeted by uncertainty because of the erupting civil conflict in Ethiopia, which contributes about 4,000 troops.
The U.S. pullout from Somalia may have been inevitable. President-elect Joe Biden has also committed to withdrawing U.S. troops from “forever wars” — open-ended counterterrorism missions that proliferated after 2001.
But Somalia experts warned that Trump’s decision to pull the plug now, as Somalia faces parliamentary elections this month and a presidential vote in February, was a recipe for chaos and maximum damage.
“It’s typical of the Trump administration’s incoherent policy toward Somalia,” said Matt Bryden, a strategic adviser at Sahan Research, a group that specializes in the Horn of Africa. “This is an incomprehensible decision at a time when governments are likely to change in both Somalia and the U.S. It would have made more sense to wait a few months.”
Pentagon assurances that the U.S. will continue to hit al-Shabab from bases outside the country, he said, “look like a brave attempt to put lipstick on a pig.”
Other experts, though, said there is never a good time to leave a fragile country like Somalia.
“It’s probably a good thing if the American relationship with Somalia is not predominantly about a few hundred soldiers,” said Brittany Brown, a former Africa adviser at the National Security Council in the Obama and Trump administrations and now chief of staff for the International Crisis Group. “But like everything with Trump, it’s been so poorly executed.”
Somalia’s turmoil will not be solved by drone strikes or military raids, she said. “It won’t stop until Somalia has a government that can provide services to its people. Until then, al-Shabab will continue to be a threat.”
The presidential election itself faces some uncertainty. The incumbent, Mohamed, has been at loggerheads with Somalia’s regional leaders, and the opposition fears he may try to manipulate the vote.
Without the U.S. troops, the Somalis can still rely on other foreign allies like Qatar, which provides cash and humanitarian aid, and Turkey, which aims to train about 10,000 regular soldiers.
But for the Danab force, the U.S. withdrawal will constitute a “wake-up call,” said Sheikh, its former commander. “They realize they can’t rely on outside help anymore.”
It may also leave the force more prone to political interference, not to mention the corruption that has blighted other Somali security units. And the U.S. departure may deal a blow to morale, raising questions about America’s commitment to their fight.
“A bit of trust will be lost,” Sheikh said. “And it will be really hard to get it back.”

For nearly 70 years, an unfinished roll of film that documented a couple’s escapades in Switzerland and Italy was hidden away in a brass container, forgotten as it changed hands.
The roll fell into the possession of William Fagan, a film collector from Dublin, in 2015 when it arrived in a box with a vintage Leica camera from 1935.
In August, curiosity got the best of him, he said, and Fagan delicately began to develop the film with the guidance of Mella Travers, a photographer and owner of a Dublin darkroom.
They soaked the film for an hour in a diluted developer, agitating it every 15 minutes while Fagan ate a blueberry muffin to pass the time.
The first things he noticed in the photos were “old people, in old cars, wearing old clothes,” Fagan said in a phone interview. Intrigued, he took them home to digitize them for a better view.
“The result was a revelation,” Fagan wrote in a blog post in September. “An unknown family, a clear location and a feeling of sadness that this talented photographer never saw the results of his labor.”
The photos — 22 exposed frames of the possible 36 — were taken by a gifted photographer, Fagan said, noting the intentional composition of the photos. He believes they were taken in 1951 or 1952.
The collection prominently features a woman, who is often shown with a dachshund. One photo shows a man who appears about 10 years older than the woman, Fagan said.
“I’m looking at these very personal moments in somebody’s life a long time ago and I’m saying, I shouldn’t have these. I shouldn’t be looking at these,” Fagan said. “These people were, at that moment, together in what appears to be having a nice holiday, and they have the little dachshund.”
The photos document the couple’s travels in a BMW convertible around Lake Como, a lake near the border of Italy and Switzerland, including a stop in Bellagio in the Lombardy region of Italy. The pictures include scenic mountains and trees along the way. The last photo is a portrait of the woman on a bench in Lenno, Italy, Fagan said.
He said he believes the couple were possibly from Austria, Bavaria or the German-speaking part of Switzerland.
Readers have jumped into the blog post’s comments section to identify familiar locations, and Fagan said he had received hundreds of emails.
In one photo, the woman is shown walking the dog down a narrow cobblestone street toward a church, her back to the camera. The signs on the street are in Italian. One person suggested that the photo was taken in Bellagio in northern Italy on Via Giuseppe Garibaldi and that she was walking toward the Basilica di San Giacomo.
“This all adds to the mystery,” Fagan said. “We know exactly where they were. You could drive to the exact spots.”
The car is featured in several photos, sometimes parked in front of scenic backdrops. In one picture, the woman and the dachshund are shown in front of the car in a busy Zurich street with “postwar American cars around them being used as taxis,” Fagan said.
In another, the car is parked on an unidentified snowy mountain pass with the woman standing just outside the door. In a third photo, the car is parked in front of a building whose signs led Fagan to identify it as La Veduta on the Julier Pass in the Italian-speaking part of Switzerland.
A former executive for BMW, as well as others, identified the car as a BMW 315 model. Others pointed out that its license plate indicates it was registered in 1948 in Munich in the American occupation zone in Bavaria after World War II, Fagan said.
Several other photos show a steamer on Lake Como, which Fagan identified as one that was taken out of service in 1952 and reconstructed in 1956, which dates the photos to the early 1950s.
“Almost every crowned head in Europe and almost every Hollywood star has been identified as the couple, including some of the Kennedys,” Fagan said.
One reader pointed out that the woman was wearing jewelry on the third finger of her right hand, rather than her left, which indicates they are “a wealthy German couple I think, rather than American.”
But mysteries remain, Fagan said.
“The question is why would somebody with a nice camera — and it was a Leica because these cassettes only work in Leicas — why they would take so many pictures, 21, 22 of a nice holiday in Switzerland, and roll it back into the thing and never touch it again,” Fagan said. “That is one of the mysteries about this thing.”
Fagan isn’t exactly sure how the roll ended up with the camera. Efforts to trace the camera back to its original owner have so far been unsuccessful.
Because of privacy laws, the records of buyers’ names are protected by camera dealers, and the same protections apply to car ownership information, Fagan said. He said his best bet for tracking the film’s origin was for someone to recognize the couple.
“The camera and the roll of film, they’re physical things — they’re belongings, they’re possessions — but these images actually belong to the people or to their families,” Fagan said. “I’m thinking the family may know these people and would probably like to have these images.”
Fagan said he published the photos in the hopes that someone, perhaps a relative, will recognize their subjects.
“They’re stunning, both the locations and the people,” Fagan said. “It’s hard for me not to continue to look for them.”

After Perilous Atlantic Journey, Migrants Await Their Fate in Canary Island Hotels

PUERTO RICO, Spain — After braving the Atlantic on a rickety and overcrowded fishing boat for six days, a group of young Senegalese has spent the past three weeks in a three-star hotel in the Canary Islands, overlooking a spectacular beach lapped by pristine waters.
While relieved to have survived their perilous journey to the Canary Islands, which has become the most deadly crossing from Africa into Europe for migrants, the six young men also know that their hotel stay is not a fairy-tale end to their odyssey.
“After this crazy trip, I am happy to be alive, but I really have no idea how long I can stay here and where I can go next,” said Ousseynou Diop, 19, who boarded the fishing boat in the Senegalese port of Saint-Louis on Nov. 1.
About 20,000 migrants have reached the Canary Islands so far this year, despite several deadly shipwrecks off Senegal and other African countries as well as some that occurred just as the boats were reaching the shores of the Spanish archipelago. At least 568 people have died while crossing from Africa to the Spanish islands between January and late November, according to the International Organization for Migration.
The sudden influx of migrants has caught Spanish authorities flat-footed, even though rights activists and other experts had been warning that traffickers were likely to divert to the Canary Islands after an increase in patrols virtually shut down many Mediterranean routes into Europe, notably from Libya.
Instead, Spain is now pressuring its partners in the European Union to establish a system to distribute migrants equitably across member countries and asking Morocco and other African nations to take back those without a legal claim to remain, at a time when travel restrictions related to the coronavirus have greatly complicated deportations.
“We are the southern border of Europe, not of Spain,” Hana Jalloul, Spain’s migration secretary, said in a video conference call with a group of foreign correspondents late last month. Other European countries that receive fewer migrants “should take into account our situation,” she added.
The steady influx of migrants is hitting Spain as the coronavirus has stifled its economy — particularly its cornerstone, tourism. Since March, the Canary Islands have only seen a fraction of the 13 million tourists who came last year for the beaches and the mild climate, much in demand during the European winter. In October, there were 88% fewer foreign visitors than in the same month last year.
Since the summer, as an emergency solution, the Spanish government has moved about 6,000 migrants from tents in Arguineguín — a port on Gran Canaria, one of the main islands of the archipelago — to 17 hotels that have been shuttered by the pandemic, several of them in the beach town of Puerto Rico.
The move was initially welcomed by local hoteliers, who received about 45 euros, or $55, a day from authorities in return for providing food and lodgings for each migrant, but tensions have built up as the flow of arrivals has shown no sign of easing.
Late last month, hundreds of residents demonstrated to demand the departure of the migrants, saying that their presence could deter European tourists as the winter season starts.
“We should put them on planes and send them home because we have people living here who have invested a lot of money to fill this beautiful place with tourists, and certainly not migrants,” said one of the protesters, Teresa García Llarena, a pensioner and former employee of a car rental company.
The island’s main association of hoteliers did not back the protest, but its Dutch president, Tom Smulders, said that “this crisis situation has got as far as it could go,” and he urged Spain’s government to evacuate all migrants from hotels by the end of the year.
The mayor of the municipality that includes Puerto Rico, Onalia Bueno, warned in an interview that tour operators could soon stop offering stays in Puerto Rico and other Canary Island resorts because of the “wrong image” given by the migrants. “Tourism and migration are simply not compatible,” she said.
Even though tourists now occupy only 7% of the hotel beds operated by members of his association, Smulders forecast that the number of holidaymakers from northern Europe would rise rapidly once airlines reopened more routes to the archipelago. The Canary Islands have maintained a low level of COVID-19 infection, he said, by following strict lockdown rules and also requiring all visitors to test for the coronavirus before traveling.
“Winter is our main tourism season, and when you come as a tourist, you don’t want to be next to a building that is filled with migrants,” said Smulders.
Spain’s government is led by a socialist prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, and the regional government of the Canary Islands is also socialist-led. But the politicians have struggled to coordinate their response to the islands’ migration crisis. The archipelago’s politicians say the central government reacted too late and is now scrambling to rebuild infrastructure that was unnecessarily dismantled after 2006, when the islands last witnessed a mass influx, with about 36,000 arrivals that year.
Once the Mediterranean became harder to cross for migrants, “we had the capacity to do a lot more to prepare for this, but I think that somebody in Madrid thought that the Canary Islands had somehow magically changed their location on the map and migrants would never get here again,” Noemí Santana, the regional minister for social rights in the Canary Islands, said in an interview.
While adult migrants are the responsibility of the central government, Santana and her officials act as legal guardians for about 2,000 underage and unaccompanied migrants scattered across several youth centers.
Their number has quadrupled since January, and like the adults, the children are mostly Moroccans. Many first traveled from inland Morocco to the shores of the Western Sahara, a long-standing territorial conflict area where hostilities recently resumed.
Saïd, 16, and his cousin Mohamed, 17, left their town of El Kelaa des Srarhna, northeast of the tourism hub of Marrakech, to reach Dakhla, in the Western Sahara, where they then boarded a boat bound for the Canary Islands.
Saïd said his elder brother paid traffickers about 1,000 euros (about $1,212) for his trip. “The young people in Morocco can now only look forward to misery, because there is the coronavirus, so really no way to work and earn money,” said Saïd, whose full name cannot be disclosed under Spanish rules that protect underage migrants.
Saïd and his cousin are in a youth center with a makeshift prayer area, a soccer pitch and leafy surroundings, in the grounds of an abandoned farmhouse.
One of the directors of the local nongovernment association running the center, Enrique Quintana, said his job at times felt like “looking after vulnerable babies,” because “migrating to another country with a different language and culture means that you really start again from zero, whatever you might have achieved before in your life.”
Like all his companions from Senegal in the Puerto Rico hotel, Diop barely spent time at school and instead became a fisherman when he was 12.
However, he said he struggled to survive, with COVID-19 restrictions hurting the local fishing industry already under pressure from Chinese trawlers operating in Senegalese waters.
Diop said he left Senegal without telling his family and now hoped to get travel documents to reach Madrid, whose most famous soccer team, Real Madrid, he loves. But underlining his lack of preparations, he sounded surprised to learn that Madrid was a landlocked capital.
“If I cannot fish in Madrid, I will do anything else that gets me money,” he said. “I don’t recommend that anybody try to get to the islands like I did by boat — it’s far too dangerous — but I also don’t want to be back in Senegal, where we sold our sea to the Chinese.”

NEW YORK — A fire in a vacant building in the East Village early Saturday morning spread to a 128-year-old church that houses the New York Liberty Bell, destroying its Gothic-style sanctuary and blowing out the Tiffany stained-glass windows that adorned the stone facade, fire and church officials said.
“I see a gutted building full of smoke,” said the Rev. Jacqui Lewis, senior minister for public theology and transformation at Middle Collegiate Church, a Reformed Protestant congregation that predates the American Revolution. “The sanctuary is gone, absolutely gone.”
The cause of the fire at the vacant building at 47 E. Seventh St., which was reported at 4:48 a.m., is under investigation, officials said. Four firefighters had minor injuries, said John Hodgens, an assistant fire chief.
The building has been vacant since February, after a smaller fire broke out. That fire was ruled an accident, Hodgens said.
Owners listed for the vacant building, which once housed a cafe, could not immediately be reached.
The fire Saturday spread to the church on Second Avenue and another building on Seventh Street, Hodgens said. That building is the site of the Women’s Prison Association, a shelter for single women coming out of prison, according to church leaders who work with the shelter.
Fire officials said they did not know the extent of the damage to the shelter but described the church as heavily damaged. “It’s going to be a difficult time for them to rebuild,” Hodgens said of the church.
On Saturday morning, congregants and East Village residents stood in the cold rain and watched, some crying and others shaking their heads in disbelief, as firefighters put out what remained of the fire.
“Am I hallucinating or is this actually happening?” said Joolz Gemini, 58, who joined the church 15 years ago and came to Second Avenue after a friend from Europe texted him about the fire.
Gwen Deely, 71, stood across the street from the church, wearing a purple T-shirt that read “Love. Period.” The statement symbolized the progressive themes of the church, which supports social justice causes like Black Lives Matter.
“It’s such a part of the neighborhood,” Deely said before pausing to cry. “It’s the fabric of the neighborhood. We will come back. We will. It’s our family. We call it our Middle family.”
The church welcomed everyone, she said, including Broadway stars and the destitute seeking help.
“It didn’t matter,” Deely said. “We welcome everyone. We have a diverse membership.”
Middle Collegiate Church was built in 1892 and has a congregation of about 1,400 members, said the Rev. Amanda Hambrick Ashcraft, the church’s executive minister for justice, education and movement building.
Lewis, who joined Ashcraft at the scene, said all that remained of the church was its stone front and signs that read “Just Love,” the church’s motto, and “Black Lives Matter.”
“The value of Black lives didn’t burn,” she said.
The ministers said they were hopeful they would be able to save the steeple, where the New York Liberty Bell had hung in the belfry.
Lewis said they were anxious to learn the fate of the bell, one of the oldest church bells in the country. It is about 25 years older than the cracked Liberty Bell in Philadelphia, according to a 1959 New York Times article.
Cast in Amsterdam in 1729, the bell was rung in 1735 to celebrate freedom of the press after John Peter Zenger, a German journalist, was acquitted of charges of seditious libel. He had published criticism of British tax collectors, according to the Times article.
It also was rung on the day that Rep. John Lewis died in July and a week after the presidential election to celebrate “that love and justice” prevailed, Ashcraft said.
The condition of the bell as of Saturday evening was unclear.
Middle Collegiate Church is the oldest congregation of the Collegiate Churches of New York, which were organized in 1628, making Middle Collegiate Church the oldest continuously active church in North America, according to church historians. The church was incorporated by royal charter from King William III of England in 1696.
The first church was built in 1729 on Nassau Street, then moved to Lafayette Place and Fourth Street in 1839.
The church at its current site had more than a dozen Tiffany windows and the social hall featured an enormous Tiffany skylight dome.
In 2009, church leaders apologized for the congregation’s early days when founders bought land from the Lenape people for $24. Some of the earliest clergy leaders owned slaves.
Now the church is known for participating in demonstrations and marches in support of the Black Lives Matter movement, the rights of women and gay and transgender people, and efforts to combat climate change.
“This is known as being one of the most progressive, multiethnic churches in America,” Lewis said.
Lewis said congregants had been meeting virtually since March and would gather again Sunday for worship online.
“We know that the spirit of God is much bigger than a building,” Ashcraft said. “We are hopeful and confident that we will continue to be a movement for love and justice.”
Gemini compared the fire to the one that nearly destroyed Notre Dame Cathedral in 2019.
“This is our Notre Dame,” he said. “Just like them, we will rebuild too.”

CARACAS, Venezuela — In the years since the Venezuelan crisis began, Yajaira Paz, 35, has lost nearly everything to its fallout: her mother, dead from a heart problem she could not afford to treat; her brothers, to migration; her faith in democracy, to the nation’s crippled institutions.
And so, on Sunday, when Venezuelans head to the polls to choose new lawmakers, she will not cast a vote. The election, she said, is nothing more than a charade, one designed “to make the world believe there is freedom in Venezuela.”
Venezuelans will cast ballots Sunday in elections that critics are calling a theater piece meant to lend a veneer of legitimacy to the government of President Nicolás Maduro, who has spent the past seven years jailing opponents, tearing apart opposition parties and using extrajudicial killings to stifle dissent.
If his allies win control of the newly expanded 277-seat National Assembly, as they are widely expected to do, Maduro will take over the last major opposition-held political institution in the country, solidifying his grip on the nation.
The election could significantly weaken Juan Guaidó, the opposition leader and legislator who in 2019 launched a bold effort to oust Maduro by declaring himself the country’s interim president, a move backed by the United States and dozens of other countries.
But Guaidó’s bid for power failed to gain traction, and his claim to the presidency is rooted in his being the head of the current National Assembly.
Following the selection of a new assembly, Guaidó will no longer be a legislator — he is boycotting the vote — making it increasingly difficult for foreign nations to recognize him as Venezuela’s president. This has left many Venezuelans who are eager for change calling for new opposition leadership, with some analysts saying that the moment for his coalition, sometimes called the G4, is ending.
“The idea that the G4 is the sole representative of the Venezuelan opposition is dead,” said Sergio Jaramillo, a former Colombian official who advises on peace negotiations around the world. “A much more inclusive approach is needed.”
Guaidó and his allies say they are boycotting the vote to avoid legitimizing a process that would be used to prop up Maduro. Instead, they will hold their own event, online and in-person, in which Venezuelans can register their desire to change the government. Guaidó has called it an “alternative to fraud.”
He and his allied lawmakers, elected in 2015, have said they will continue to claim to be the legitimate legislature, becoming a sort of congress frozen in time.
This has drawn criticism from some opposition politicians who have decided to run Sunday, declaring that no one can expect to effect change if they’re not at the table, no matter how lopsided the table.
“We can’t renounce the vote as a means of struggle and an instrument of change,” said Armando Amengual, a dissident candidate running from the state of Carabobo.
He added that Guaidó’s “vision of change” had been exhausted.
Independent observers have declared the election deeply flawed.
In a report on election conditions published by the Universidad Católica Andrés Bello of Venezuela and an intergovernmental organization, investigators described how Venezuela’s top court this year stripped three of four main opposition parties of their leadership, allowing the parties to be co-opted by politicians friendlier to the government.
In what the report’s authors called a clear constitutional violation, the country’s electoral body this year increased the number of seats in the National Assembly from 167 to 277 in an effort to splinter the opposition, “paving the way for the government party to win.”
And among other problems, there is widespread fear among voters that they will be stripped of food benefits if they don’t cast ballots, or don’t vote for Maduro-backed candidates, rumors the government has encouraged.
Diosdado Cabello, a top figure in Maduro’s party, joked recently at a campaign event that mothers should threaten members of their household: “Those who don’t vote, won’t eat.”
No major international organizations will monitor the vote. Maduro had invited the European Union to observe the process, but officials declined, saying that he had not given them enough time to organize a proper mission.
Despite fears of government backlash, turnout is expected to be low, with many people afraid to vote because of the coronavirus, or because they see voting as pointless.
In many areas around the country, the deepening economic crisis, and the failure of the U.S.-backed effort to oust Maduro, has heightened feelings of abandonment and political impotency.
“Who cares if there are elections or not, if Donald Trump or the new president of the United States helps us or not,” said José Urdaneta, 56, a driver who lost his job amid the pandemic and will not vote Sunday.
None of that would make a difference, he went on.
“Here, we fend for ourselves or we die,” Urdaneta said.
The election comes at a particularly difficult time for Venezuela. Hunger, joblessness, gasoline shortages and a breakdown of the health care system have only worsened with the coronavirus.
The gap between the poor and a small group of wealthy, government-connected individuals — often called “enchufados,” or the plugged-in crowd — has widened as U.S. dollars have increasingly replaced bolivares as the common currency, and prices of everyday goods have skyrocketed.
Ninety-two percent of respondents to an October poll by the firm Datanalisis had a negative view of the country’s situation, the highest number since 2011.
Maduro’s disapproval rating was 82%, while Guaidó’s was 67%, near records for both of them.
Paz, the woman who had lost so much amid the country’s decline, once had a decent life as a shop manager. She left that job to care for her sick mother, then watched with a broken heart as her brothers, who had fled to Peru, struggled to raise the money for their mother’s care.
The state, its health system in collapse, offered no help, and they never raised enough for a critical operation at a private hospital.
Her mother died of a heart attack in December. Paz is now preparing to leave Venezuela for Peru to join her siblings.
“No one will get me out of the house to vote on Sunday,” she said recently, waiting at a government office to get an identity card she would need to travel.
She was 1,576 in line.
“What will they threaten me with? What can they take from me, if they give me nothing? They have already taken everything.”

We Met Them in the Depths of the Pandemic. How Are They Doing Now?

NEW YORK — At the outset of the pandemic, I met many New Yorkers who were facing the challenges of the crisis in profound and transformative ways. Some watched as their livelihoods were destroyed, accelerating unwelcome retirement. Others were young and stopped short in their pursuits and promise. Others still saw opportunity in despair or managed to find serenity and quiet amid the tragedy and chaos.
Several people I profiled for this space during the spring sparked enormous interest from readers, some of whom wrote in the weeks and months that followed wanting to know what happened next and how they could help. I was curious too. So in the spirit of a reflective season, I caught up with those whose stories moved so many others:
The blues bassist who survived by playing live gigs: Amy Madden
When I met Amy Madden in March she was a 67-year-old out-of-work bass player. Now she is a 68-year-old out-of-work bass player, because the pandemic shut down live music in New York (and everywhere). A Princeton graduate, Madden had also been working part time at an art gallery to supplement an income that had been declining for years, as one performance space after another in New York was lost to escalating rents. The gallery, of course, closed as well.
Because she was lucky enough to own a small apartment, where she raised her son, she was not facing homelessness, as some of her musician friends were. But paying her maintenance costs each month was difficult; she was living on food stamps.
None of that has changed. Occasionally, she now visits the food pantries where she used to volunteer, mostly to get meals to friends and neighbors who are ashamed or unable to go themselves. For Thanksgiving, she got a turkey at a pantry and fed the people working in her building.
After my column was published in early May, Madden was flooded with offers of help from old friends and strangers, so she set up a GoFundMe campaign to raise enough money to produce an album that would allow her to employ other musicians who were also without work. More than $12,000 came her way, but she hasn’t touched that money, she said, because the people with whom she would make a record are all around her age: vulnerable and anxious about going into a recording studio with other people and poor ventilation.
Ultimately, she observed, it was COVID-19 that aged the ageless rocker.
“It’s like these great football players: You’re a quarterback and you take two years off at 40, you’re not coming back," she said. "We all suddenly got old and turned the page.”
Still, there have been moments of good news, pleasure — even delight. The gallery reopened, and Madden works there from time to time on Saturdays. Someone she knows in Norway offered to make her a guitar, even cutting down a tree for it. She reconnected with an old friend who married a rich fishmonger and sends her fresh fish. She continues to write poetry and struck up a vigorous correspondence with a fan, a nurse in Colorado who recently left her husband for a woman.
As ever, Madden succeeds in holding mourning and gratitude in the same hand.
“I miss so deeply the joy of performance," she wrote to me this past week, “the live creative moment; the presence; the conversation among us onstage — the magic that can happen, the unexpected.”
When the dorms closed, she had no place to go: Destiny Moura
Last fall, Destiny Moura had set herself on a new path as a freshman at the Borough of Manhattan Community College, after a traumatic childhood marked by abandonment and neglect and an adolescence spent in sex work. When the pandemic hit, she lost her newfound stability: a room in a residential hotel in midtown that served as student housing.
Dormitory spaces around the country had cleared out; young people were going home, but Moura did not really have a home. And in June, about to turn 21, she was aging out of the foster care system.
I often write about people struggling with the repercussions of lives spent in poverty, and many readers express a desire to help. But the response to Moura’s circumstance was of another order entirely. Countless emails came in, many from empty nesters offering to give her a room in a house or an apartment. Many more wanted to send her money. CASA, an organization of volunteers helping children and young adults in foster care, collected that money for her. Moura is saving it all, Kerry Moles, CASA’s executive director, told me, so that she will have a nest egg for an apartment of her own when she graduates from college.
Nervous about entering into another housing situation that inevitably would be short lived, Moura had returned to the apartment of her father and aunt, where so many of her problems were rooted, and stayed for months. She had a long and stressful summer, Moles said, but reached out for support when she needed it.
This fall though she moved into a dorm space in Queens with roommates and a kitchen. CASA helped her decorate her room.
“She’s working hard in school, and she has huge aspirations," Moles said.
They survived the Spanish flu and the Holocaust: Eva Kollisch and Naomi Replansky
As the rest of the world was unraveling in March, Eva Kollisch and Naomi Replansky greeted the pandemic with a calm born of the long view. Between them they had survived the Spanish flu, the Anschluss, family separation, anti-immigrant bigotry, homophobia and nearly every other ravage of the 20th century.
Together since the 1980s, Kollisch, 95, and Replansky, 102, have spent the pandemic in their Upper West Side apartment safely, in good health. They have been reading and writing prodigiously; they have gone on socially distant picnics. Replansky, who was a finalist for a National Book Award for poetry in 1952, is now having one of her collections republished and is rereading “The Brothers Karamazov.”
Kollisch is working with the Museum of Jewish Heritage for an upcoming exhibit. However driven by their aesthetic passions, the couple is not above Netflix. They watched and loved “The Queen’s Gambit.” Now Replansky is working on her chess game.
The “hipster priest” who fed hospital workers: John Merz
When I was introduced to John Merz, a hipster priest in Brooklyn, he had galvanized a mobile food pantry operation he helped start — North Brooklyn Angels — to take meals to overworked employees at Woodhull hospital. He hired newly unemployed restaurant workers to do the cooking. Over three months, the project produced about 27,000 meals.
When the hospital crisis began to abate, Merz’s focus shifted to homebound elders and the increasing number of people forced into food insecurity by the pandemic. North Brooklyn Angels soon doubled the number of sites it served.
Good things happened along the way. Grandaisy Bakery began donating approximately 20 “very long," as Merz put it, bags of bread every day. The Brooklyn Nets donated a Honda minivan. With transport and connections to other smaller-scale community groups, the North Brooklyn Angels emerged as a distribution center for food and household supplies.
“Let’s say someone drops on your steps 15,000 pounds of diapers,” Merz said. “You’ve got to move them fast. So we call these groups and say, ‘Hey, do you need 1,000 pounds of diapers?’”
At some point Merz couldn’t help but notice a volunteer who was coming in to work at the Angels kitchen every day.
“She was intimidating, very no-nonsense," he recalled, “like she really knew what she was doing."
The woman was named Sarah Herold, and she was the general manager of Frenchette, the celebrated Manhattan restaurant. Moved by the mission, she quit her job there and began working this past week as a staff member for the Angels, running the kitchen.
“We know there is light at the end of the tunnel, and we have learned a lot in the tunnel,” Merz said. “So much of this has been such a huge gift: You know, man, yeah, this sucks. But we have had so many people come through the door to volunteer, and their lives are falling apart. But they are here.”

Report Points to Microwave ‘Attack’ as Likely Source of Mystery Illnesses That Hit Diplomats and Spies

WASHINGTON — The most probable cause of a series of mysterious afflictions that have sickened American spies and diplomats abroad in the past several years was radio-frequency energy, a type of radiation that includes microwaves, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine has concluded in a report.
The conclusion by a committee of 19 experts in medicine and other fields cited “directed, pulsed radio-frequency energy” as “the most plausible mechanism” to explain the illness, which came to be known as Havana syndrome, although they said that they could not rule out other possible causes and that secondary factors may have contributed to symptoms, according to a copy of the report obtained by The New York Times.
The report, which was commissioned by the State Department, provides the most definitive explanation yet of the strange illness that struck scores of government employees, first at the U.S. Embassy in Havana in 2016 and subsequently in China and other countries. Many of the officers suffered from dizziness, fatigue, headaches and loss of hearing, memory and balance, and some were forced into permanent retirement.
CIA officers visiting overseas stations experienced similar symptoms, the Times and GQ magazine reported in October. The officers were traveling to discuss countering Russia covert operations with foreign intelligence agencies, a fact that adds to suspicions that Moscow is behind the episodes.
Although couched in careful, scientific language, the new report reveals strong evidence that the incidents were the result of a malicious attack. It attributes the illnesses to “directed” and “pulsed” — rather than “continuous” — energy, implying that the victims’ exposure was targeted and not the result of more common sources of microwave energy such as, for example, a cellphone.
It also said the committee found the immediate symptoms that patients reported — including strange sensations of pain, pressure and sound that often appeared to emanate from a particular direction or occur in a specific spot in a room — were more consistent with a directed “attack” of radio-frequency energy.
The committee considered other causes, like chemical exposures and infectious diseases, but said they appeared unlikely.
The report said that the variability of the incidents, which appeared to affect people in different ways, left open the possible influence of “psychological and social factors.” And it said that some of the victims may be experiencing a condition called “persistent postural-perceptual dizziness,” a nervous system disorder that produces a prolonged feeling of vertigo or unsteadiness.
The episodes have been the subject of much speculation and controversy. Many of the victims, as well as some government officials and outside scientists, have long argued that radio-frequency energy was the most likely cause, potentially the result of a weapon wielded by a foreign power.
But since 2018, the U.S. government has declined to speculate publicly on the cases, and some scientists have promoted alternate theories, like a kind of psychological illness that spread in the stressful environment of foreign missions.
Amid the controversy and confusion, some of the afflicted officers have complained that the United States has failed to support them. In several cases, the government initially refused to grant leave and provide the necessary medical care, the officers said. And with the government silent on the possibility of a foreign attack, many of the victims were left feeling that the public believed they had made it all up.
Several of the victims have accused Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other Trump administration officials of downplaying the issue in an attempt to avoid disrupting international ties. They now ask how President-elect Joe Biden and his nominee for secretary of state, Antony Blinken, will respond, especially given the new scientific findings.
After lawmakers pressured the State Department for months to release the report, the agency gave it to some congressional officials and others Thursday and Friday, asking them not to share it. The Times and NBC News separately obtained the report Friday, and NBC earlier reported the findings. The National Academies publicly released the report Saturday evening.
”We are pleased this report is now out and can add to the data and analyses that may help us come to an eventual conclusion as to what transpired,” the State Department said in a statement Saturday.
The department also said that “each possible cause remains speculative” and that various factors, including the committee’s lack of access to some information because of potential security concerns, “limit the scope of the report,” though “they do not lessen its value.”
For the Trump administration, acknowledging that the incidents were the result of a foreign attack could have necessitated evacuating U.S. missions in China, disrupting an important economic relationship. The administration did take a harder approach in Cuba, which aligned with its larger goal of reversing President Barack Obama’s diplomatic opening with Havana.
The question of Moscow’s possible culpability is a thorny one, given the sensitivities around President Donald Trump on any matters involving Russia or President Vladimir Putin. Moscow has denied any role, and Gina Haspel, CIA director, has not concluded the Kremlin was responsible. But some CIA analysts who are Russia experts, diplomats and scientists contend that evidence points to Moscow, which has a long history of experimenting with the technology.
The report does not point to a perpetrator, although it mentions “significant research in Russia/USSR” on pulsed radio-frequency technology as well as the exposure of military personnel in Eurasian communist countries to microwave radiation. The Soviet Union bombarded the U.S. Embassy in Moscow with microwaves in the 1970s and ’80s. In a 2014 document, the National Security Agency discussed a microwave weapon used by a hostile country, which people familiar with the document said was Russia.
Mark Lenzi, a diplomatic security officer who was afflicted with the symptoms while working in Guangzhou, China, in early 2018, said that the administration’s treatment of its employees, including its efforts to “deny and cover up inconvenient scientific and medical facts,” had left him angrier at his own government than the government that injured him.
“My government looked the other way when they knew I and my family were injured,” he said. “This report is just the beginning, and when the American people know the full extent of this administration’s cover-up of the radio-frequency attacks in China in particular, they will be outraged.”
Lenzi has sued the State Department for disability discrimination. The Office of Special Counsel has been pursuing two investigations into the State Department’s conduct.
Some family members of the affected U.S. government employees also fell ill overseas, including Lenzi’s wife. And at least 14 Canadian citizens in Havana said they had experienced similar symptoms.
The report by the National Academies also contains a stark warning about the possibility of future episodes, and the U.S. government’s ability to detect them, or to mount a response. The fact that American government employees reported afflictions not only in Cuba and China but also in Russia and other countries raises questions about how widespread the incidents may be.
The committee was not in a position to assess “specific scenarios involving malevolent actors,” David Relman, a Stanford University professor who led the committee, wrote in a preface to the report. Yet, he said, “the mere consideration of such a scenario raises grave concerns about a world with disinhibited malevolent actors and new tools for causing harm to others.”
The report recommends that the State Department act now to establish plans and protocols so it can immediately begin an investigation if similar incidents occur.
“The larger issue is preparedness for new and unknown threats that might compromise the health and safety of U.S. diplomats serving abroad,” the report concludes. “The next event may be even more dispersed in time and place, and even more difficult to recognize quickly.”
The panel said its findings were hampered by the government’s slow and uneven response to the incidents, in which patients were evaluated by various methods and clinicians at different points in their illness. Because the information made available on patients from China was “too sparse and fragmentary to be able to draw any substantive conclusions about these cases,” the report focuses on events surrounding the U.S. Embassy in Havana.
In August, the scientists sent the report to the State Department, where agency officials there then put it under review. Lawmakers pressed the department to publicly disclose the findings, saying its failure to release the information fit with a pattern of secrecy and inaction by the Trump administration. In interviews in October, Relman criticized the department for not acting faster to release the report.
Some victims said at the time that the Trump administration was trying to avoid addressing its shortfalls toward the safety of U.S. government employees overseas, especially before the November elections. Asked in late October by a reporter about the illnesses, Pompeo did not mention the report and said only that the government was unable to determine the cause.
Several lawmakers have forcefully pressed the State Department to be more accountable and provide proper health and work compensation benefits to all of the victims and affected family members. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., has inserted a provision on long-term benefits into the latest defense budget bill that Congress is expected to pass this month, although Trump has threatened to veto the measure for reasons unrelated to the provision.
“Their illnesses and suffering are real and demand a response from Congress,” Shaheen said. “While I’m encouraged by the progress we’re seeing, much more must be done to uncover the source of these incidents and ensure that no other public servant suffers in this way.”

CHULA VISTA, Calif. — When the Chula Vista police receive a 911 call, they can dispatch a flying drone with the press of button.
On a recent afternoon, from a launchpad on the roof of the Chula Vista Police Department, they sent a drone across the city to a crowded parking lot where a young man was asleep in the front seat of a stolen car with drug paraphernalia on his lap.
When the man left the car, carrying a gun and a bag of heroin, a nearby police car had trouble following as he sprinted across the street and ducked behind a wall. But as he threw the gun into a dumpster and hid the bag of heroin, the drone, hovering above him, caught everything on camera. When he slipped through the back door of a strip mall, exited through the front door and ran down the sidewalk, it caught that, too.
Watching the live video feed, an officer back at headquarters relayed the details to the police on the scene, who soon caught the man and took him into custody. Later, they retrieved the gun and the heroin. And after another press of the button, the drone returned, on its own, to the roof.
Each day, the Chula Vista police respond to as many as 15 emergency calls with a drone, launching more than 4,100 flights since the program began two years ago. Chula Vista, a Southern California city with a population of 270,000, is the first in the country to adopt such a program, called Drone as First Responder.
Over the last several months, three other cities — two in California and one in Georgia — have followed suit. Police agencies from Hawaii to New York have used drones for years, but mostly in simple, manually flown ways. Officers would carry a drone in the trunk of a car on patrol or drive it to a crime scene before launching it over a park or flying it inside a building.
But the latest drone technology — mirroring technology that powers self-driving cars — has the power to transform everyday policing, just as it can transform package delivery, building inspections and military reconnaissance. Rather than spending tens of millions of dollars on large helicopters and pilots, even small police forces could operate tiny autonomous drones for a relative pittance.
That newfound automation, however, raises civil liberties concerns, especially as drones gain the power to track vehicles and people automatically. As the police use more drones, they could collect and store more video of life in the city, which could remove any expectation of privacy once you leave the home.
“Communities should ask hard questions about these programs. As the power and scope of this technology expands, so does the need for privacy protection,” said Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst with the American Civil Liberties Union’s Project on Speech, Privacy and Technology. “Drones can be used to investigate known crimes. But they are also sensors that can generate offenses.”
With the pandemic still worsening, drones are a way of policing at a distance, said Rahul Sidhu, an officer in Redondo Beach, near Los Angeles, which started a program similar to the one in Chula Vista just after the virus reached the United States.
“We’re just trying to limit our exposure to other people,” he said. “Sometimes, you can send a drone without sending an officer.”
But down the road, he said, as these small unmanned helicopters become cheaper and more powerful, they will provide more efficient ways of policing urban areas. That could aid police departments at a time when the number of recruits is on the wane across the country and many voices are calling for funding cuts after months of protests against police violence.
In Chula Vista, drones are already an integral part of the way the police respond to emergencies. After an emergency call comes in, officers give the drone a location, and it flies to that point on its own — before returning on its own, too.
The department’s drones can cover about one-third of the city from two launch sites, responding to roughly 70% of all emergency calls. After asking the Federal Aviation Administration to approve a third launch site, the local police hope to cover the entire city, about 52 square miles between San Diego and the Mexican border.
Government regulations require that a certified pilot remain on the roof of the Police Department, overseeing the launch and, together with a police officer at a command station inside the building, handling most of the flying once the drone reaches its destination.
FAA regulations aimed at protecting the flights of commercial planes and other aircraft prevent drones from being flown beyond the line of sight of their operators. But Chula Vista obtained a waiver from the FAA, so the pilot and officer can fly the drone as much as 3 miles from its launch site.
Each drone — including long-distance cameras, other sensors and software — costs the department about $35,000. But the overriding cost of the program lies in the many officers needed to operate the drones.
On another recent afternoon, when the Chula Vista police were alerted to a car turned upside down in an empty riverbed, they sent a new kind of drone into the ravine. Built by Skydio, a Silicon Valley company, it could avoid obstacles on its own thanks to many of the same technologies used by self-driving cars.
“An ordinary drone would have crashed by now, guaranteed,” Sgt. James Horst said as he watched a video of the drone swooping down into the riverbed and inspecting the inside of the car at close quarters.
Later, in the courtyard outside the Police Department, he showed how, with another press of the button, he could instruct an automated drone to follow a particular person or vehicle on its own. Skydio has long offered a consumer drone that can follow you from place to place, even as you weave between obstacles, like trees in a forest. Now the company, which recently hired Fritz Reber, the former head of the Chula Vista police drone program, is selling to the police and other businesses.
Shield AI, a startup in San Diego that has worked with police departments, has developed a drone that can fly into a building and inspect the length and breadth of the premises on its own, with no pilot, in the dark as well as in daylight. Others, including Skydio and DJI, a company in China that makes the drones launched from the roof of the Chula Vista Police Department, are building similar technology.
The Chula Vista department treats drone video much as it does video from police bodycams, storing footage as evidence and publicly releasing it only with approval, Capt. Don Redmond said. The department does not use drones for routine patrols.
For privacy advocates like Stanley of the ACLU, the concern is that increasingly powerful technology will be used to target parts of the community — or strictly enforce laws that are out of step with social norms.
“It could allow law enforcement to enforce any area of the law against anyone they want,” Stanley said.
Drones, for instance, could easily be used to identify people and restrict activity during protests like those that have been so prevalent across the country in recent months. Redmond said the Chula Vista department did not deploy drones over Black Lives Matters protests because its policies forbade it.
The Chula Vista police do not require the approval of city officials to expand drone use, but, according to Redmond, they have publicly notified the community about the continued progress of the program.
Drone as first responder programs in places like Redondo Beach and Clovis, California, are seeking waivers that would allow them to fly beyond the operators’ line of sight.
In Clovis, near the middle of the state, the Police Department has found that its drones tend to overheat at the height of summer. “We were flying them four days a week until it got too hot,” Lt. James Munro said. “Then we had to ground them.”
But he thinks these and other technical obstacles will soon be overcome. “Drones are like iPhones,” he said. “As soon as you get one, a new one arrives with new technology.”

NEW ROCHELLE, N.Y. — There are lines again at Glen Island Park, the drive-thru coronavirus testing center that state officials set up when the coronavirus was discovered in New Rochelle in March.
Nurses at the local hospital went on a two-day strike this past week over fears that their working conditions made them vulnerable to infection as hospitalization rates climb.
And at the synagogue where the first case here was detected nine months ago, a sign on the door now turns people who live in coronavirus hot zones away. Prayers for them are virtual.
As the virus rages across Westchester County, it has returned to New Rochelle, a city hit so hard during the outbreak’s earliest days that it was for a time the epicenter of the pandemic in the region. In early March, when Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced the state’s first so-called containment zone in this New York City suburb, New Rochelle’s fate proclaimed an unnerving message: The virus is here.
Now it is back.
On Friday, officials added 11,271 cases statewide as the daily positive test rate climbed above 5%. In New Rochelle, which added 73 cases Friday, the surge comes with a profound sense of defeat. The city of 80,000 about 20 miles north of Manhattan on Interstate 95 had at one point emerged as a model of how to beat the disease.
That the coronavirus could reemerge in a city and county scarred by loss and intimately familiar with the disease is not only a testament to the virus’s intractability. Local leaders and health experts fear it is also a bellwether for the rest of the country: If the disease can roar back into Westchester, the home of New Rochelle, a city that met the virus first and knows it with cruel intimacy, it can happen anywhere.
Some residents have returned to the extreme measures that helped them survive the first wave, cloistering themselves in their homes. Others said they had watched with dismay as their neighbors let down their guard.
“It’s crazy that it’s back at the scene of the crime,” said Josh Berkowitz, the owner of Eden Wok, a kosher Chinese restaurant on North Avenue, just down the road from the Young Israel of New Rochelle synagogue.
A congregant there had the city’s first detected case of the virus.
“It just shows we are so powerless,” Berkowitz said.
The seven-day average test positivity rate in Westchester has climbed to about 5%, far higher in some areas: In Peekskill and Ossining, the rate among those who have been tested is about 10%. In November, the state designated Port Chester, on the Connecticut border, as an “orange zone,” shutting down in-person schooling and closing certain businesses.
“The first time through we didn’t really realize how severe it would get, so we were learning as we went along,” said George Latimer, the Westchester County executive. “There was a sense that we took the best shot that COVID could give us, but we survived it, and things got better — but the virus isn’t done with us.”
Parts of New Rochelle, as well as parts of Yonkers, Sleepy Hollow and Tarrytown, have been labeled yellow zones, requiring measures like weekly coronavirus testing for 20% of the student population, among other steps. As of Friday, there were 5,968 active cases countywide — more than double the number two weeks ago — and over 290 people were hospitalized; numbers on par with what they were in May.
Controlling the spread, which is dispersed across the region, is particularly problematic in Westchester. During the virus’s recent resurgence, about 70% of infections have been tied to private gatherings, according to the state’s contact-tracing efforts.
“When the virus is contained to one geographic area, or one source of spread that is easily controllable, it is easier to ‘close the valve,’ either geographically or by industry,” said Gareth Rhodes, the state’s deputy superintendent of financial services and a member of Cuomo’s coronavirus task force.
Now, with six cluster zones scattered across the county, he said, the virus “is geographically more dispersed than just one area, and the ability to conduct enforcement of gatherings in private homes is much more limited.”
There are other striking differences from the pandemic’s earliest days: Where the initial outbreak was first detected among a middle-class community connected to a local synagogue, the disease is now afflicting the predominantly blue-collar workers in the denser pockets of Westchester’s towns. And as hospitals fill up again, doctors in the area have learned new treatment strategies, like delaying the use of ventilators.
“The situation we are facing right now is undoubtedly grave and challenging, but it doesn’t have the same intense anxiety that I think we felt in the spring when all of this was painfully unfamiliar,” said Noam Bramson, New Rochelle’s mayor. “This is now a more familiar enemy.”
On Tuesday, nurses at Montefiore New Rochelle Hospital staged a walkout over contract negotiations that began before the pandemic hit, but they also cited risks they had been subjected to by the outbreak.
“This place was the epicenter, the beginning of COVID,” Judy Sheridan-Gonzalez, the president of the union representing the nurses, the New York State Nurses Association, told ABC News. “We have nurses who’ve died. We have people who’ve died, who’ve worked here for lack of PPE, for improper care, improper staffing and training. That’s what this strike is about.”
On Thursday, officials in Port Chester held an emergency meeting on how to fight the virus. Spanish and English language ads with clergy members and other local leaders highlighting the severity of the rise will be broadcast on local stations. Mobile testing units are being deployed. Giant electronic billboards flashing reminders to wear masks and social distance will be set up.
On Friday in Tarrytown, the annual party for the lighting of the village’s Christmas trees was moved online in an effort to comply with the yellow-zone restriction limiting outdoor gatherings to no more than 25 people. Similar holiday plans are in place in Sleepy Hollow, but also in areas that have not achieved that status but where numbers are creeping up, like Dobbs Ferry and Irvington.
Some county residents are taking matters into their own hands — as best as they can.
In New Rochelle, Dr. Michael Wechsler, 80, said that in recent weeks he had returned to the hermetic way he was forced to live at the height of the outbreak and had once again stopped going to the grocery store.
Wechsler, a urologist, blamed the rise in cases on a relaxed attitude toward the virus, even here, where National Guard troops rolled in to scrub public buildings in March, and fleets of health workers in head-to-toe protective equipment fanned out across neighborhoods.
“People tend to repress something bad,” he said. “It’s a coping mechanism.”
In Port Chester, Ana Ponce, 79, put a surgical mask under the carrot nose of the inflatable snowman in her front yard as a message to her neighborhood: Mask up.
“It makes me sad and it makes me worry,” Ponce said Thursday, referring to Port Chester’s 241 active cases.
By Friday, the total number of active cases in the village rose to 270.
Ponce said she was also frustrated by what she considered the lax approach that many local residents were taking to wearing masks and following social-distancing guidelines.
“A lot of people,” she said, “don’t have the sensibility to understand that they are hurting themselves and are hurting other people.”

COPENHAGEN, Denmark — In the opening scene of Danish director Thomas Vinterberg’s new film, “Another Round,” a group of teenagers plays an unusual drinking game. Racing giddily in pairs around a city lake, they stop at every bench to down a beer from the case they haul between them; the first pair to circle the lake and empty their bottles wins.
If this were an American film, the scene might lead to tragedy or a hard-won lesson. But in Vinterberg’s hands, neither catastrophe nor moralizing materializes. Except for a bit of synchronized vomiting, no one gets hurt; the adults watch the youths’ antics indulgently; and even the police seem in on the joke. “Another Round” may be about drinking, but its vision of alcohol, although nuanced, is largely jubilant.
In Denmark, where movie theaters have been open since June, the film has been a resounding success, selling over half a million tickets (in a country of 5.8 million people) in its first month. Part of this popularity is no doubt thanks to the quality of the performances, led by Mads Mikkelsen, and the script, which Vinterberg co-wrote with Tobias Lindholm. But its depiction of the Danish relationship to alcohol has also clearly resonated.
“It’s like what he did with ‘Festen’,” (“The Celebration” in North America) said Katrine Hornstrup Yde, a culture editor and film critic for the newspaper Information, of Vinterberg. “He shows us that this small, funny game is the key to really looking at ourselves.”
The film has also premiered at a time when, thanks to coronavirus and a resurgent #MeToo movement, Denmark’s alcohol habits are under new scrutiny. In a culture that perceives itself as reserved — even shy — and which has little tradition of small talk, drinking is an especially important fuel for social connection. That might help explain why Danes have the highest rates of “heavy, episodic” drinking of any country in the European Union.
“Another Round” begins its exploration of how alcohol can both enhance life’s joys and destroy them with an idea from Finn Skarderud, a (real-life) Norwegian psychiatrist who has suggested that humans are born with a blood-alcohol level that is too low; raise it to 0.05%, his theory goes, and they perform better. In the film, the main characters — four schoolteachers grappling with midlife malaise — put this theory to the test.
To prepare for their roles, the actors went through an alcohol boot camp of sorts. “We used breathalyzers to test, OK, what happens at 0.05, what happens to your speech at 0.08, at 0.1?” Mikkelsen said. “With two glasses of wine, everything becomes a little easier. You’re in the zone, having a nice conversation, playing darts really well. At five beers, you’re getting sloppy; at eight, you’re not hitting the board anymore.”
Encouraged by the creativity and passion unleashed by their elevated blood alcohol, the four characters pursue ever higher levels of inebriation. That became more of a challenge for the actors, who wanted to avoid any caricatures. “However blurry things get in the 0.0 to 0.1 range, there’s still consciousness there,” Mikkelsen said. “And then all of a sudden it tilts, and you don’t care anymore. That’s where all the crazy stuff happens.”
Alcohol’s shifting effects from social lubricant to knockout punch are well known to anyone who’s ever had a few too many. But Vinterberg also recognizes that for normally reserved Danes, alcohol can be especially important. “We have this very constant, very chaste debate about alcohol,” he said. “But we also drink like Vikings.” Whether it comes to sex or fighting, he added, “it helps us lose control.”
In its earliest incarnation, the film was “a celebration of alcohol, pure and simple,” Vinterberg said. “I looked at all the great, amazing accomplishments done by really drunk people in politics and the arts.” The drinking habits of Ernest Hemingway and Winston Churchill still figure in the film, and one of its funniest sequences is a montage of clearly sloshed world leaders. But in its final form, “Another Round” has acquired a more nuanced view, one that makes room for alcohol’s dark side, following a personal tragedy that spurred Vinterberg to expand the movie’s scope.
Four days after filming began, his 19-year-old daughter Ida was killed when a car driven by a man texting on his phone hit the vehicle in which she and her mother were traveling. Ida was meant to play one of Mikkelsen’s character’s children in the film, and the movie is set at her high school. In his grief, Vinterberg almost abandoned the project.
“My daughter is dead, and here we have this film about alcohol. It didn’t make any sense,” he said. “Unless we insisted that it become a film about life, that it become a life-affirming film.”
For Mikkelsen, the transition was subtle. “That other meaning was already there in the script; we just had to bring it into the light,” he said. “It wasn’t something we all decided. It just happened naturally.”
Part of what makes the Danish relationship to drinking unusual is how much takes place among the young — especially 15- to 17-year-olds. Vinterberg himself only recognized the peculiarity of the Lake Run tradition that opens the film when a visiting American friend registered astonishment at his letting his daughter take part, and “Another Round” raises the interesting question of whether Danes learn their habit of connecting through alcohol at an exceedingly early age.
Denmark has some of the highest rates of teenage drinking in the world; a World Health Organization report released earlier this year found that Danish 15-year-olds consumed alcohol at nearly double the European average. Recent efforts to raise the minimum age for purchasing alcohol to 18 from 16 have met with resistance, in part because older adults recall their own youthful intoxications so fondly.
“Being a young person in Denmark is and will be inextricably linked to alcohol and drinking. It’s part of who we are,” Maja Gildin Zuckerman, an anthropologist, wrote recently in the newspaper Weekendavisen. “So we toast with them when they are 15 and pick them up at the emergency room after their stomachs are pumped when they are 16.”
Adult drinking habits have also fallen under renewed scrutiny recently after a second wave of #MeToo sexual harassment revelations began in Denmark in late August, resulting in a number of high-profile resignations, including a political party leader and the mayor of Copenhagen. Both men admitted to inappropriately touching women at the office Christmas parties — called julefrokost — at which extreme inebriation and other transgressive behaviors are not merely common but expected (it is not coincidental that no one brings their spouse to such parties).
“It’s clear that our drinking culture has so much to do with sexual assault,” said Yde, the culture editor. “And right now, there’s a lot more reflecting going on about these things. Of course, corona has kind of forced it — we can’t have the normal big drunken parties. But it’s also like we’ve taken a timeout to reflect on work and power relations.”
Although he himself applauds the discussions about harassment and drinking that are taking place, Vinterberg is pleased that his film has not, by and large, been pulled into the debate. “We’re not politicians or schoolteachers or priests,” he says. “We ask questions but we insist on not giving answers.”
Still, he admits to some concern about how his disinterest in moralizing will play in the United States, where it opened in theaters Friday. (It will be available to buy on iTunes and other platforms Dec. 18.) “A movie about four white, middle-aged, heterosexual men teaching youngsters to drink,” he said with a slight smile. “What’s not to be worried about?”
In Denmark, which has chosen the film for its Oscar submission, “Another Round” is being received as the love letter Vinterberg intended. “We have a special drinking culture, but until now, I don’t think we’ve had a single cultural representation that captures it,” Yde said, adding that the film “seems destined to become our shared reference point.”

Texto completo: In a 45-year Times career, she also became the first woman to lead the Newspaper Guild of New York and fought a sex discrimination case against the paper.
Betsy Wade, the first woman to edit news copy for The New York Times and the lead plaintiff in a landmark sex discrimination lawsuit against the newspaper on behalf of its female employees, died on Thursday at her home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She was 91.
Her death was confirmed by her husband, James Boylan, who said she learned in 2017 that she had colon cancer.
In a 45-year Times career, Ms. Wade also became the first woman to lead the Newspaper Guild of New York, the largest local in the national journalism union (now known as the NewsGuild).
She was revered among peers for her role in the 1974 class-action suit against The Times, one of the industry's earliest fights over women's rights to equal treatment in hiring, promotion, pay and workplace protections under federal anti-discrimination laws.
Four years after being fired as a reporter for The New York Herald Tribune for being pregnant, Ms. Wade landed at The Times on Oct. 1, 1956, and instantly broke a 105-year-old practice of male copy editing in the news department, where women were rare, relatively underpaid and confined largely to reporting on fashions, cooking and other subjects considered by male colleagues to be "women's news," or to clerical or secretarial jobs.
"The copy desk did not put a screen around me," Ms. Wade told Nan Robertson for her book "The Girls in the Balcony" (1992), about the rise of women at The Times. "But they took the cuspidors out of the city room the first week. A copy boy got some deep ruffling and put it around my paste pot." And the men told clean jokes, she said, "to make me feel less like a temperance worker at a brewery picnic."
Ms. Wade, still a trainee, spent only a month on The Times's city news copy desk before she, too, was assigned to edit women's news. She was too good to be sidetracked, however, and by 1958 she was back in general news.
She was soon recognized for her cool appraisals of articles and her deft pencil -- invisible to readers, but all too apparent to colleagues -- as her surgical excisions and repairs saved The Times from factual errors and its writers from clumsy sentences, phrases of dubious taste and embarrassing flaws in grammar, spelling and syntax.
And her headlines -- the icing on the cake for a copy editor -- were often extraordinary, like one on April 9, 1962, over twinned stories datelined Moscow and Tokyo, in which she rendered "Spring" in Russian, Japanese and English to universalize celebrations of the vernal equinox.
She later moved up to jobs with more responsibility, and to other firsts by a woman at The Times: the first to edit articles by foreign correspondents; the first deputy chief of the foreign copy desk; and, in 1972, the first chief of the foreign copy desk, a job called "the slot" in news jargon -- the boss who traditionally sat inside a U-shaped desk and distributed tasks to subordinate copy editors around its rim.
The slot was often a steppingstone to upper management. But the newspaper's house organ, Times Talk, proclaimed her promotion with a sexist idiom: "Betsy's in the slot: first dame to make it."
A year earlier she had been entrusted to help prepare for publication the Pentagon Papers, classified documents and explanatory articles that told of American duplicity in Vietnam. In a historic ruling for freedom of the press, the U.S. Supreme Court denied a Nixon administration challenge. The Times won a Pulitzer Prize for publishing the papers.
Ms. Wade joined a women's caucus in 1972 to study gender issues at The Times. It found that weekly salaries for women were $ 59 less than those of men with comparable jobs; that there were no women in the top corporate or newsroom ranks, on the editorial board or among 22 national correspondents; and that the staffs of 33 foreign correspondents and 35 Washington bureau members included only three women each.
In 1978, after a four-year court fight, The Times and representatives of 560 women on its 6,000-member staff settled a class-action suit -- titled Elizabeth Boylan, et al, v. The New York Times, using Ms. Wade's married name (she went by Betsy Wade professionally) -- on terms approved by Judge Henry Werker. Both sides claimed victory.
The Times agreed to place more women in jobs ranging from entry level to top management, and to create annuities covering costs of "delayed career advancement or denied opportunity." But it did not grant raises or admit any violations of law. , The Times's executive vice president at the time, called the paper's voluntary affirmative action program "one of the strongest in the country."
Ms. Wade countered: "If Judge Werker is now able to say that The Times has progressed in affirmative action, it is our suit that compelled this. The paper began to move toward our goals when the suit went to court, and the women who have been hired since are aware of this."
Elizabeth Wade was born in Manhattan on July 18, 1929, to Sidney and Elizabeth (Manning) Wade. Her father was an executive with Union Carbide. Seeking better schools for Betsy and her younger sister, the family moved to suburban Bronxville, N.Y., in 1934.
Envisioning a journalism career, Betsy worked for student newspapers at Bronxville High School, from which she graduated in 1947, and Carleton College in Northfield, Minn. She transferred to Barnard College in Manhattan in 1949, earning a bachelor's degree in 1951. A year later, she received a master's degree from the Graduate School of Journalism at Columbia University.
She married Mr. Boylan in 1952; he founded The Columbia Journalism Review in 1961. They had two sons, Richard and Benjamin. They survive her, along with six grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.
Ms. Wade began her journalism career on The Herald Tribune's women's page. After her dismissal, she wrote for the Newspaper Enterprise Association from 1954 to 1956, when she joined The Times. In 1978, she was elected to a four-year term as president of the New York Newspaper Guild.
In 1987, after three decades as a copy editor, she took over The Times's Practical Traveler column, and for 14 years, until her retirement in 2001, wrote weekly tips-for-travelers articles. A collection of her columns, "The New York Times Practical Traveler Handbook," was published in 1994.
In retirement, Ms. Wade taught journalism and public policy at Hunter College in Manhattan. In 2016, she received the highest accolade for New York's veteran journalists, the lifetime achievement award of the Silurians Press Club.
Ms. Wade was also a board member of the Anne O'Hare McCormick Memorial Fund, which endows scholarships for women at the Columbia and CUNY journalism schools.
Since the 19th century, Times articles had identified men in secondary references as "Mr." and women as "Mrs." or "Miss." Stuck with the double standard, reporters asking female interviewees if they were married or single were often told to get lost.
But on June 20, 1986, The Times began using "Ms." The change first appeared in a Page 1 article about a Supreme Court ruling on the sexual harassment of a bank employee by a male supervisor. The article called the victim "Ms. Vinson."
It was edited by Betsy Wade.

Texto completo: NEW YORK - President Trump, already saddled with lawsuits and investigations that will follow him when he leaves office, is now facing a legal challenge from former tenants who say he and his family manipulated the cost of apartment improvements to raise their rents.
The group of tenants from rent-regulated apartments that late family patriarch Fred C. Trump once owned are pursuing a class-action lawsuit, alleging a long-running scheme in which a Trump-controlled company, All County Building Supply, artificially adjusted the cost of appliances and other materials to justify raising rents at more than 30 buildings previously owned and managed by the Trumps in Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island.
The president is a named defendant in the lawsuit, along with his siblings Robert S. Trump, now deceased, and Maryanne Trump Barry, a retired federal judge. The companies that own or oversee the properties now are also named in the suit, because they have benefited from the rent increases that took effect years ago, the complaints says.
The case names 20 plaintiffs who represent a class of victims. It was filed in New York State Supreme Court in Brooklyn.
The lawsuit was first reported by the New York Times.
The allegations stem from a New York Times investigation that exposed a history of alleged malfeasance as the Trump family's sizable real estate business ballooned into an empire. The conduct alleged in the case began in the 1990s. The Trumps sold off the properties over the next several years.
If the plaintiffs prevail, Trump and the other defendants could owe "many millions" in compensation and damages, said lawyer Jerrold S. Parker, who represents the tenants. The suit alleges that current and former tenants from at least 14,000 apartments were overcharged.
"This is a massive fraud spanning 28 years, victimizing several hundred thousand tenants in Trump regulated apartments and needs to be addressed," Parker said in statement. "These regulated tenants, many of whom struggle just to pay the rent and put food on the table, must be made whole for the money that was unlawfully and unknowingly taken from them by the Trump family for their own personal gain."
The Trump Organization did not respond to a request for comment, though in a statement to the Times, a family spokeswoman dismissed the lawsuit as "completely frivolous" and unsupported by evidence.
The lawsuit alleges that the Trumps illegally raised rents by inflating the costs of apartment improvements. Under New York law, a landlord may increase rents if significant upgrades are made.
The tenants' lawsuit claims that Trump and his family used All County Building Supply to create doctored invoices reflecting inflated costs of improvements and resold items such as stoves and refrigerators to themselves for more money than they were worth. In doing so, the lawsuit alleges, the Trumps had license to increase rents higher than they would have been able to had they paid fair prices for making such improvements.
The lawsuit alleges that President Trump's late cousin John Walter created the All County invoices, and that Walter and the Trumps would keep the profits.
When Trump leaves the White House next month, he faces numerous other legal battles that began during his presidency, allegations that stem from his past business activity and personal conduct.
Manhattan's district attorney and New York state's attorney general both have active investigations into Trump and the Trump Organization.
Also in New York, Trump faces defamation lawsuits brought separately by two women who have accused him of sexual assault. Trump's niece, Mary L. Trump, also is suing the president and his siblings over an inheritance dispute.
In all instances, the president has denied any wrongdoing.

Texto completo: If we can’t get a COVID-19 relief package through Congress in the next week or two, we’re sunk. It means we have a legislative branch so ideologically divided it can’t address even our most glaring problems. It means we have representatives so lacking in the willingness and ability to compromise that minimally competent government will be impossible, even under a President Joe Biden.
The problems a basic relief measure would address couldn’t be more obvious. Under current law, up to 12 million Americans could lose their jobless benefits by year’s end — a wretched Christmastime for millions of families, which could spawn a wave of depression, morbidity, family breakdown and suicide.
Millions of people could be evicted from their homes. Thousands more businesses may close during the long winter months before a vaccine is widely available. These are not failing, unproductive businesses. These are good, strong businesses that would have provided jobs and opportunity for millions of Americans for decades if they hadn’t been hit by the pandemic.
Wendy Edelberg of the Hamilton Project calculates that if nothing passes, the U.S. economy will be $1 trillion smaller in 2021 and $500 billion smaller in 2022.
The means to prevent this suffering are also glaringly obvious. We did it less than a year ago with the coronavirus relief bill. All we have to do is pass a version of what we did before. How hard can this possibly be?
The $2 trillion coronavirus relief bill was one of the most successful pieces of legislation of modern times. Because of the lockdowns, U.S. economic output contracted by a horrific 9% in the second quarter of 2020, compared with the first quarter. But because of the coronavirus relief bill, disposable household incomes increased by 10%. The personal savings rate increased by 34% in April.
I don’t love big government, but government is supposed to step up in a crisis, and with the coronavirus relief bill, it did.
Since summer, as the economy has deteriorated, Congress has been gridlocked on how to pass a supplemental relief package. At times Nancy Pelosi has been rigidly uncompromising, as if not wanting to hand Donald Trump a victory. But the core problem is that Republicans have applied a dogmatically ideological approach to a situation in which it is not germane and is in fact ruthlessly destructive.
Some Republicans act as if this is a normal recession and the legislation in front of them is a conventional Keynesian stimulus bill. But this is not a normal recession. It’s a natural disaster. The proposals on offer are not conventional stimulus. They are measures to defend our national economic infrastructure from that disaster over the next five brutal months.
I agree with Janet Yellen, Biden’s choice for Treasury secretary, who said, “The U.S. debt path is completely unsustainable under current tax and spending plans.” But that concern is for another day. Right now, we need to protect the workers and businesses that generate wealth in this society.
Either we roar out of this pandemic with the economic might and surging wages we enjoyed in 2019, or we endure another decade of grinding stagnation, more populist anger, more people losing faith in America. Microscopic interest rates make this additional debt a relatively easy lift for us.
The 2020 election results have powerfully strengthened moderates. After months of gridlock, the moderates took charge this week, crafting a bipartisan $908 billion relief compromise. Led by Sens. Susan Collins, Joe Manchin, Mitt Romney and Mark Warner and endorsed by a bipartisan group of House members from the Problem Solvers Caucus, it is big enough to make a real difference and includes two thorny issues: aid to the states and liability protection, which should, on the merits, be in the law.
This is how democracy is supposed to work! Partisans stake out positions, and then dealmakers reach a compromise. This is a glimpse of the sort of normal-functioning democratic process that has been largely missing since Newt Gingrich walked onstage lo these many decades ago.
To their great credit, Pelosi and Chuck Schumer embraced the bipartisan framework. Mitch McConnell went on the Senate floor Thursday, pretended to soften, ignored the compromise and did not move an inch.
McConnell may think the Democrats will eventually come to him because something is better than nothing. But his proposal cannot pass. Democrats in the House will not accept a complete capitulation to McConnell on every front.
For the first time in a long time we have a core group of moderates, progressives and conservatives willing to practice politics — willing to work with the other party toward a reasonable solution.
Talks between the moderates and McConnell continue. But if McConnell won’t do a deal now, in the midst of a clear crisis and under a Republican president, there certainly won’t be one with more controversial issues under a Democratic president in 2021. If we don’t see a COVID-19 relief measure pass in the next week or two, then our democracy is existentially broken.
If that happens, McConnell should spend Christmas with people thrown out of work and witness the suffering he has caused.

Texto completo: Donald Trump’s win in 2016 never brought his followers the cultural power they’d hoped it would. Quite the opposite, it prompted many cultural institutions — from professional sports to Hollywood — to oppose Trump and his political project with more fervor.
That reaction helped fuel a sort of Möbius strip of grievance: We came to power because we were the overlooked, hated silent majority. But, when we came to power, our opposition hated us and treated us unfairly. The result of that treatment is the loss of our power and proof that the system is rigged against us. Once again, we’re the overlooked, silent majority.
That telling omits quite a bit. Most important, it omits the political power that the right wields and accumulates through the courts and through structural advantages in institutions like the Electoral College and the Senate. But the sense of threat is fundamental to the modern right’s self-identity. It’s worth noting, too, that conservatives say they recognize this same dynamic on the left.
“Both sides feeling like they are losing is a crucial aspect of American cultural conflict,” David French, a senior editor of the conservative publication The Dispatch, told me. “To both conservatives and progressives, the culture war looks like one side is routing the other. Each side takes its natural advantages for granted. But losses, of any kind, feel existential.”
This is the culture war doomloop. It’s not a reflection of reality, but a distorted perception of it — a gut feeling that increases conflict.
“For every political action or reaction or overreaction there seems to be an equal and opposite political action or reaction or overreaction,” French said. “The situation escalates. Each side activates the other in a profound way.”
For instance, in mid-November, with Trump’s election results denial in full swing, the Fox News host Howard Kurtz posted a tweet destined for the “both sides” hall of fame.
That Kurtz conflates vague pop culture power (daytime television) with hard political power (an executive pressuring the federal government to ignore the democratic will of its people) is ridiculous.
But that false equivalence is a revealing bit of rationalization that helps explain the Republican Party’s grievance cycle and its commitment to a ceaseless culture war. It is a tidy encapsulation of a facet of the pro-Trump mind-set, which reasons that political power (which Trump supporters have wielded for nearly four years) will never be enough if they don’t also feel that they have dominant cultural power.
The pro-Trump media has constructed an alternative reality, and I’ve spent the last four years dropping into it. With each news cycle the distance between the more traditional media and its MAGA counterpart widens. Deeply reported exposés of corruption in the Trump White House were met with crickets in the pro-Trump media, while smaller culture-war skirmishes stayed in their headlines for days. (Remember when Sean Hannity’s fans publicly destroyed their Keurig coffee makers after their manufacturer stopped advertising on his show in 2017?)
Many of the biggest outrages in the Trump media ecosystem during the last four years have been about cultural institutions. Liberal Hollywood is a favorite target, one that predates Trump. In sports, many culture warriors on the right boycotted the NFL after Colin Kaepernick’s kneeling protest. Conservatives have also delighted in lower than usual 2020 playoff ratings for the NBA, proof in conservatives’ eyes that the league has spent too much time focused on social justice issues. (Ratings have been down for all live sports this year.)
Then there’s “the media” — arguably the institution that looms largest in the mind of the president and his supporters. The right’s fixation on a certain segment of the press is nothing new and it ignores the vast audience for conservative talk radio, Sinclair’s network of local television stations, Fox News’s towering prime-time ratings, and conservative content’s domination on Facebook.
But Trump’s choice to declare insufficiently servile journalists “the enemy of the people” raised the stakes considerably. It’s a tactic that rallies the base but also serves another purpose: “I do it to discredit you all and demean you all so that when you write negative stories about me no one will believe you,” Lesley Stahl of “60 Minutes” recalled Trump telling her in 2016.
The media has always been Trump’s obsession because the cultural power it wields is the only power he’s known throughout his career. He used it to revive and inflate his reputation via reality television, and eventually he learned how to hijack and program the press. Political power, the kind granted to him on Jan. 20, 2017, has always seemed foreign to him, requiring elusive virtues like patience, empathy and curiosity.
Trump’s cultural cachet was a crucial asset in his surprise run and win in 2016. His very presence in Republican politics suggested to conservatives that he might be able to bestow the party with the kind of transcendent power it lacked.
Nothing demonstrates this quite like a Trump rally, an event that is a cultural experience as much as a sporting event, concert or big-tent religious revival. At every Trump rally I attended in the lead-up to the 2016 election, his supporters described the same electric feeling — that someone who embodied (or, more accurately, pandered to) their cultural values was ascending to power.
Much of the pro-Trump media’s project was an attempt to harness this feeling. Shortly after Trump’s election, pro-Trump media pundits bandied about the slogans “Conservatism is the new counterculture” and “Conservatism is the new punk rock.” But the pro-Trump media didn’t create a counterculture as much as a dangerous counter-reality — one that prods mainstream media organizations to push back harder to debunk the lies.
In 2017 I wrote that this online ecosystem “turned politics into a ledger with a running tally, where every outrage, misstep and hypocritical line builds on the outrages that came before.” And where every news event becomes “manipulatable evidence to fit a narrative for each side, building in intensity, crescendoing to some unforeseeable but somehow still inevitable conclusion.”
Three years ago, it might have been easier to imagine that the 2020 election might have offered up a denouement, or, at least, served as a valve to release a bit of tension. But what seems obvious right now is that the culture war doomloop defies conclusions. It is self-sustaining and also potentially lucrative — just ask Newsmax and One America News, whose post-Trump business models appear to be to indulge the president’s every conspiratorial fantasy and feed the loop.
There’s no easy way out. To break the cycle, one side would have to feel as if it’s definitively won or lost. But the ultimate effect of the culture war doomloop is that it distorts reality. Each side believes it’s winning and losing, all at once.

Texto completo: Gabriel Sterling, a Georgia election official and longtime Republican, held a news conference this week in which, with barely contained rage, he excoriated Donald Trump’s lies about voter fraud and the threats of violence those lies inspired.
He railed against Trump’s campaign lawyer, Joseph diGenova, who called for the shooting of Christopher Krebs, a federal cybersecurity official fired by Trump for saying that the election wasn’t rigged. (DiGenova later claimed he was joking.) Sterling described a “20-something tech” involved in the vote tabulation who was getting death threats.
“ It has to stop! ” he said, visibly seething. “Mr. President, you have not condemned these actions or this language. Senators, you have not condemned this language or these actions. This has to stop.”
The next day, Georgia’s secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, expressed his support for Sterling. “It’s about time that more people were out there speaking with truth,” he said. His office had asked Trump to “try and quell the violent rhetoric being born out of his continuing claims of winning the states where he obviously lost,” he said, to no avail. Trump’s language, said Raffensperger, was creating a “growing threat environment for election workers who are simply doing their jobs.”
Along with many other state-level Republican election officials, Sterling and Raffensperger have shown admirable commitment to the rule of law. Their refusal to participate in Trump’s attempted autogolpe helped avert a constitutional crisis. Yet it’s hard not to notice that their outrage is a bit selective.
There is nothing new about Trump inciting harassment against private citizens, or of his lackeys calling for violence against the president’s opponents. In 2015, after an 18-year-old college student asked Trump a question he didn’t like at a political forum, he targeted her on Twitter, and she was deluged with graphic, sexualized threats. Ahead of the 2018 midterms, a man named Cesar Sayoc sent homemade pipe bombs to Trump critics; he’s been sentenced to 20 years in prison.
In September, Michael Caputo, a former Trump campaign aide who was put in charge of communications at Health and Human Services, said in a Facebook video, “When Donald Trump refuses to stand down at the inauguration, the shooting will begin.”
Yet Raffensperger voted for Trump. On Thursday, he told CNN that he supports the president still. The fact that Trump has openly sought to undermine the 2020 election, or that he delights in siccing his followers on his perceived enemies, was not a deal-breaker for Raffensperger. If he is now incensed, it’s because he and his colleagues have become Trump’s targets.
Since Trump’s defeat, the MAGA revolution has begun devouring its own. As it does, some conservatives are discovering the downsides of having a president who spreads malicious conspiracy theories, subverts faith in democracy and turns the denial of reality into a loyalty test. As the internet meme goes, people voted for the Leopards Eating People’s Faces Party, and now the leopards are turning on them.
Historically the American left, more than the right, was known for circular firing squads and excommunications. By turning the Republican Party into a cult of personality, Trump changed that. As the archconservative Jeff Sessions learned years ago, even a lifetime of ideological service is no defense when you’ve displeased Dear Leader.
People and institutions that get involved with Trump often end up diminished or disgraced. Since the election, this is happening faster than ever. The president is reportedly thinking of firing Attorney General Bill Barr because, for all Barr’s obsequious toadying, he has declined to repeat Trump’s fantasies about widespread electoral cheating. Much of the MAGA-verse has turned on Fox News, because its news programs aren’t pretending that Trump won.
Both Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia and Gov. Doug Ducey of Arizona have been slavishly faithful to Trump, but stopped short of breaking the law by refusing to certify the vote in their states. For that, they’ve been at least temporarily cast out of Trump’s movement. “What is going on with @dougducey? Republicans will long remember!” Trump tweeted. At a berserk Georgia rally on Wednesday, the pro-Trump lawyer Lin Wood led the crowd in a “lock him up” chant against Kemp.
In concert with the recently ousted Trump lawyer Sidney Powell, Wood called on Georgians to boycott the Jan. 5 Senate election runoff unless state officials do more to help Trump cling to power. Speaking of Georgia’s senators, Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, Wood said: “They have not earned your vote. Don’t you give it to them. Why would you go back and vote in another rigged election, for God’s sake!”
Naturally, Republicans who understand that Trump lost and are worried about Senate control in a Joe Biden presidency aren’t happy about these antics. But what disconcerts these Republicans isn’t, by and large, that Trumpist lawyers are spewing demented misinformation. It’s that this misinformation might, for once, work against Republican power.
“At best, Wood-Powell are distracting from the GOP message in the races, and at worst, they are convincing persuadable Georgians that it is the Republican Party that needs to be checked, not Joe Biden,” wrote Rich Lowry in Politico. At worst! Republicans would almost certainly be fine with Wood and Powell eroding confidence in American democracy if it didn’t threaten members of their party.
“The Republican establishment, and also the conservative establishment, has always made this bet that it could open Pandora’s box and close it on command,” Rick Perlstein, a historian of American conservatism, told me. They could activate tribalism to achieve power, while maintaining a modicum of respectability. They could create an alternative reality but keep people enclosed within it. But with Trump “having pried Pandora’s box open, that becomes impossible,” Perlstein said.
Republicans helped Trump unleash countless civic evils. They shouldn’t be surprised when those evils don’t spare them.

Paul Krugman: U.S. should learn to stop worrying and love debt

Texto completo: Amid all the wild swings in U.S. politics over the past decade, one thing has remained constant: the GOP position on government debt. The party considers high levels of debt an existential threat — if a Democrat is sitting in the White House. If a Republican president presides over big deficits, well, as Donald Trump’s budget director reportedly told supporters last year, “nobody cares.”
So it’s a completely safe prediction that once Joe Biden is sworn in, we will once again hear lots of righteous Republican ranting about the evils of borrowing. What’s less clear is whether we’ll see a repeat of what happened during the Obama years, when many centrists — and much of the news media — both took obvious fiscal phonies seriously and joined in the chorus of fearmongering.
Let’s hope not. For the fact is that we’ve learned a lot about the economics of government debt over the past few years — enough so that Olivier Blanchard, the eminent former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, is talking about a “shift in fiscal paradigm.” And the new paradigm suggests both that public debt isn’t a major problem and that government borrowing for the right purposes is actually the responsible thing to do.
Why are economists thinking differently about debt? Part of the answer is that we’ve discovered some things about how the world works; the rest of the answer is that the world has changed.
It made some sense, nine or 10 years ago, to worry that the financial crisis in Greece was a harbinger of potential debt crises in other countries (although I never bought it). As it turned out, however, the full list of countries that ended up looking like Greece is … Greece. What briefly seemed like a spread of Greek-style problems across southern Europe turned out to be a temporary investor panic, quickly ended by a promise from the European Central Bank that it would lend money to cash-short governments if necessary.
In other words, those dire warnings we used to hear (and will soon be hearing again) that America faces imminent disaster once government debt crosses some red line were always misguided. We weren’t and aren’t anywhere close to that kind of crisis and probably never will be.
But what about the longer term? Doesn’t debt impose a burden on future generations, who will have to spend money paying interest that could have been put to better uses?
Here’s where it becomes crucial to realize that the world has changed: Interest rates are much lower than they were in the past, and all indications are that they’ll stay low for years to come.
One key indicator is the real interest rate on long-term government bonds — the interest rate minus inflation, which is a better measure of true borrowing costs than the headline rate. The real rate on 10-year bonds averaged around 4% in the 1990s; it has been generally less than 1%, and sometimes negative, for the past decade.
Why are interest rates so low? That’s a longish story, probably mainly involving demography and technology. Basically, the private sector doesn’t seem to see many opportunities for productive investment, and savers who have no place else to go are willing to buy government debt even though it doesn’t pay much interest. The important point for current discussion is that government borrowing costs are now very low and likely to stay low for a long time.
As a result, the burden of debt — which was always exaggerated and was misunderstood in any case — isn’t what it used to be. One measure of how much things have changed: On the eve of the pandemic, federal debt as a percentage of gross domestic product was twice its level in 2000. But federal interest payments as a percentage of GDP were actually down.
The bottom line is that government debt just isn’t a major problem these days. Which brings us back to the politics.
Biden has promised to “build back better,” a slogan that translates into proposals to spend big sums on infrastructure, climate policy, education and more, largely with borrowed money. And that’s very much the right thing to do; business may see only limited returns to investment, but we’re in desperate need of more public investment, broadly defined (for example, including spending on children).
Yet Republicans will surely oppose these proposals. Indeed, if they hold the Senate, they may well do what they did to Barack Obama and try to force Biden to cut spending. And they’ll justify their intransigence by railing against the evils of debt.
So how should we push back against this predictable attempt to stonewall the Biden agenda? It will be tempting to emphasize Republican hypocrisy. But the biggest problem with the debt-scare politics we all know is coming isn’t the hypocrisy or the bad faith; it’s the fact that it’s wrong on the merits.
For given what we’ve learned and where we are, it’s clear that the U.S. government should be investing heavily in the nation’s future and that it’s OK — indeed, desirable — to borrow the money we need to make those investments. That is, to act responsibly, we must stop worrying and learn to love debt.

Texto completo: New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham is taking on a new leadership post in Washington, D.C.
No, not that leadership post.
Democratic governors on Thursday unanimously confirmed Lujan Grisham as the new chairwoman of the Washington, D.C.-based Democratic Governors Association for 2021. Lujan Grisham was poised to assume the role after being elected vice chairwoman and chairwoman-elect last December; the association's bylaws state that the chairperson-elect will take over as chairperson the following year.
News of the governor's new and high-profile position comes amid intense and ever-evolving speculation about whether she is still being considered for a Cabinet post in President-elect Joe Biden's administration.
The political drama continued Thursday when Sen.-elect Ben Ray Luján reportedly jumped into the fray.
The New York Times reported that the outgoing congressman criticized the incoming administration's treatment of Lujan Grisham, the first Latina Democratic governor in the United States.
"One day after reports surfaced that Ms. Lujan Grisham had been offered, and turned down, the position of Interior secretary, Mr. Luján rebuked the incoming White House chief of staff, Ron Klain, and other senior Biden officials for the leak," according to the newspaper, which cited a Democrat familiar with the virtual meeting between members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and top advisers to Biden.
In a statement provided to The New Mexican late Thursday, Luján declined to address the accuracy of the report.
"I'm a firm believer that family discussions should remain between family," Luján said. "The Congressional Hispanic Caucus had a productive conversation with the President-elect's senior staff. I'm grateful for all of their hard work during this difficult presidential transition, and I look forward to working with them to deliver for the people of New Mexico."
Politico reported last week that the Congressional Hispanic Caucus had been making a "strong push" for Lujan Grisham, a former congresswoman who used to be a member of the group, to be tapped as health secretary. But this week, it reported that Lujan Grisham "is no longer favored for the role" and that she had turned down an offer from the Biden administration to serve as secretary of the Department of the Interior.
The report that Lujan Grisham had been offered the post of interior secretary stunned political observers, particularly because another high-profile Democratic woman in New Mexico, U.S. Rep. Deb Haaland, who is Native American, has expressed interest in the job. Two other New Mexicans, retiring U.S. Sen. Tom Udall and U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich, are also said to be under consideration for interior secretary.
Politico reported earlier this week that Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo was the front-runner to be the next secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. But Raimondo told reporters Thursday she was "not going to be President-elect Biden's nominee for HHS secretary."
"My focus is right here in Rhode Island, as I have said," Raimondo said during a news conference.
The New York Times said it remains unclear whether Lujan Grisham, who previously served as secretary of the New Mexico Department of Health, is still being considered for health and human services secretary under Biden.
What is clear, though, at least for the moment, is that New Mexico's governor will be chairwoman of an organization that describes itself as an independent, voluntary political organization that supports Democratic governors and candidates across the nation.
The vote to confirm Lujan Grisham as chairwoman occurred at the association's annual meeting, which was held online this year due to the pandemic, according to the association.
"I am honored to lead the Democratic Governors Association, and I join my fellow governors in thanking Gov. Phil Murphy for his remarkable leadership," Lujan Grisham said in a statement, referring to the governor of New Jersey, who served as the 2020 chairman. "This past year has been full of unexpected challenges, but with Gov. Murphy at the helm, the DGA successfully weathered the storm."

Flaws in Census Count Imperil Trump Plan to Exclude Undocumented Immigrants

WASHINGTON — Census Bureau experts have uncovered serious flaws in a section of the 2020 head count that potentially affect the enumeration of millions of people, according to people familiar with the census operations, delaying still further the completion of state-by-state population totals that the White House has demanded before President Donald Trump leaves office next month.
Census experts told the Trump administration last month that data-processing delays were making it impossible to meet that schedule, but the agency’s political appointees have continued to press for shortcuts in an attempt to deliver on the White House’s demand. On Friday, people involved with the census but not authorized to make official comments said the latest delay — adding 10 to 14 more days to a process that was already set to end well beyond the Dec. 31 statutory deadline — appeared to doom that last-ditch rush.
The extent of the additional problems — relating to the count of residents of group quarters like prisons, college dormitories or homeless shelters — effectively means that “that isn’t going to happen,” one official, who declined to be named for fear of retribution, said of meeting the deadline.
The week’s developments are but the latest trials in a beleaguered and fraught census, with career officials forced to steer between a pandemic that all but halted the count for months and political pressure from the White House for results on the president’s timetable — sometimes, some career experts say, with little regard for accuracy.
The Trump administration needs the bureau’s state-by-state population totals if it is to fulfill the president’s plan to strip undocumented immigrants from the state counts used to reapportion the House of Representatives. Such a move, unprecedented in American history, would produce an older, whiter, more rural population base for reallocating House seats that would mostly benefit Republicans, analysts say.
Many experts see the bureau facing deadlines it can’t possibly meet while maintaining its standards. Some bureau officials remain concerned that Trump will demand numbers anyway, a move that could plunge the nation into uncharted legal territory if the Democratic House and the new Biden administration reject the results.
“Anything produced in this compressed timeline the Trump administration has set increases the chances of a corrupted census,” Vanita Gupta, the president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, said Friday. “The data problems can be fixed and the deadlines extended. But career census experts need to be able to fix the problems before the count is submitted. If the final data that is sent is shoddy, that could mean a failed census altogether.”
Trump’s July order put enormous stress on the Census Bureau and its system for processing data at a time when it was also contending with the challenge of the pandemic.
With counting operations all but ground to a halt in the spring, the administration asked Congress in April to extend the legal deadline for delivering reapportionment totals to April 2021, rather than Dec. 31.
But in July, Trump abruptly reversed course, ordering that the Dec. 31 deadline be met. That forced Census Bureau experts to compress five months of data processing into two and a half months.
The Supreme Court heard arguments this week in two lawsuits contending that Trump’s plan violated federal law and the Constitution, which says the census should count all residents, not just citizens, and requires congressional districts to be apportioned “counting the whole number of persons in each state,” using information from the census.
The latest problems, which were not discussed at the Supreme Court argument, involve the tabulation of a category — people who live in group quarters — which totaled about 7.5 million residents in 2010, according to that year’s census.
To provide accurate numbers, the census asks for advance estimates from the institutions that house them and then matches those estimates with the totals it receives from census-takers in the field. This month, data processing operations have turned up large discrepancies between the two numbers in group quarters nationwide, differences that can probably be resolved only by further review and in some cases returning to the field. (For example, a homeless shelter or a prison might have expected to house a larger number of daily residents than it actually had when the census was conducted.)
By itself, that is not unusual; the bureau found similar variances in censuses in 2010 and 2000. In 2013, the bureau described how the numbers for residents of group quarters were resolved in a chart that is part of the 2010 census Planning Memoranda Series — effectively reducing the process to a historical footnote.
But in those previous decennial counts, time had been built into the data-processing schedule to remedy that and other problems. This year, in its rush to produce figures for the White House, the Census Bureau had already cut its data-processing schedule nearly in half, leaving no margin for mistakes.
Moreover, the discrepancies are exceptionally large this time because the coronavirus pandemic disrupted census work and led many residents of group quarters to move in the middle of the head count. This category includes college students in dormitories or off-campus apartments, many of whom returned home when the pandemic forced an end to in-person classes.
Terri Ann Lowenthal, a longtime census expert and consultant to a range of groups pressing for an accurate count, said the problems were not unexpected. She noted that the Census Bureau had cut back a dry run of its group quarters count and a post-count error check because of budget problems during a census dress rehearsal in 2018.
“I’ve been raising a red flag about the group quarters operation,” she said. “I think the pandemic exacerbated problems the bureau has had historically with ensuring an accurate count of group quarters residents.”
In meetings this week, the bureau ordered teams to find the source of the problems and recommend fixes by Sunday.
Problems counting university students appear to have been worsened by requirements of federal privacy laws that Congress failed to address before the count began. At least one university omitted last names of its dormitory residents in files sent to the bureau. Many schools did not turn over addresses of students who lived off campus but returned home, meaning that census-takers in college towns had no idea whether vacant apartments they found were truly empty or should be counted as a student’s place of residence.
Multiply that by millions of people who moved during the pandemic — children who brought parents home from nursing homes, jobless children who moved in with parents, relatives who consolidated households when money ran short — and the scope of the bureau’s problems becomes apparent, said Ron Santos, the vice president of the Urban Institute and president-elect of the American Statistical Association.
“They could be in a situation where they don’t know what they don’t know, and by the time they find out, it’s too late,” Santos said. “I don’t have high confidence that this can be done in two weeks, or three weeks, or a month. I think the Census Bureau needs time to do its due diligence, sort out the problems and fix them.”
In telling the administration last month that they would be unable to deliver totals to Trump before he leaves office, the bureau’s experts cited unidentified “anomalies” in the data that had to be resolved before work could continue.
In a letter released this week, the House Committee on Oversight and Reform stated that internal documents obtained from the Census Bureau described “13 anomalies identified as of November 19 that impact more than 900,000 census records.” The documents noted that if new anomalies were identified, “additional time may be required for comprehensive release.”
Officials say that the group quarters discrepancies were among those anomalies and that the true scope of the problem became known only as it was investigated.
With prospects of meeting the White House deadline increasingly dim, the bureau’s political appointees have ratcheted up pressure on career experts to meet it anyway, scrutinizing the data-processing timeline for operations that could be shortened or delayed.
Supreme Court arguments this week suggested that Trump’s effort to strip undocumented immigrants from reapportionment totals would face a second challenge — compiling an accurate count of people in the country illegally. Under questioning, Jeffrey Wall, the acting U.S. solicitor general, said that count “is fairly fluid.”

There may be some things more fun than hanging out with Candice Bergen and talking about Michael Caine, Sean Connery, Steve McQueen, Jack Nicholson, Princess Diana, Princess Grace, John Belushi, Donald Trump, Charles Manson, getting fat, getting old, getting wrinkled and not giving a damn.
But I don’t know of anything.
The woman who once specialized in playing icy Nordic beauties has a great throaty, spontaneous laugh. She’s an adventuress who has traveled to the most exotic spots, often solo with her camera. And she’s a Scheherazade who can tell witty stories about a Tiffany’s window of glitterati.
I mean, she was at Truman Capote’s legendary Black and White Ball in 1966 at the Plaza, wearing Roy Halston Frowick’s white mink mask with the long bunny ears and pink satin nose, chatting up newlyweds Mia Farrow and Frank Sinatra. Need I say more?
“There was a guy who wore an executioner’s hood,” Bergen recalled of the party. “It got a little creepy.” She doesn’t wear fur and hasn’t eaten meat in 40 years, but she still has the bunny mask on display in her living room in New York.
The Bergen family traces the history of show business in America, from the rise of her father, Edgar, in vaudeville, radio and fledgling TV as a ventriloquist — with a smart-aleck dummy named Charlie McCarthy — to Candice’s own half-century career in movies and TV, capped by her five Emmys for “Murphy Brown.”
When she was young, her parents had Christmas smorgasbords at their Beverly Hills house with the cream of Old Hollywood: the Reagans schmoozing; Fred Astaire twirling her mother, Frances; and Rex Harrison singing songs from “My Fair Lady” accompanied by Henry Mancini on the piano.
Then, in the 1970s, Bergen became the first woman to host “Saturday Night Live.” She chummed around with Nicholson, Mike Nichols and the hip crowd of moviemakers who ushered in what was then known as New Hollywood.
Now, at 74, Bergen is in the swim with streaming, starring with Meryl Streep and Dianne Wiest in “Let Them All Talk,” an extemporaneous movie for HBO Max, directed and filmed by Steven Soderbergh with a hand-held camera on board the Queen Mary 2, as actual passengers wandered about.
“The passengers were really overweight,” Bergen recalled with a mischievous smile. “They were good little eaters on this incredibly elegant ship.”
As we started our nearly three-hour Zoom interview, she walked with her iPad to the window to show me the view from her “tiny” house in Pacific Palisades, high above the ocean.
“The neighborhood is very comforting because it’s just lovely little houses,” she said. “A couple of big ones have come crashing in.” She had come to Los Angeles for Thanksgiving with her younger brother, Kris. Usually, she can be found at the Fifth Avenue apartment she shares with Marshall Rose, a real estate developer and philanthropist she married in 2000. He “has been facing health challenges with grace and elegance for the past few years,” she said. She had difficult caretaking duties with her first husband, Louis Malle, the French director. Their marriage lasted 15 years, until Malle died in 1995.
When she was single, Bergen lived in another little house in Los Angeles that was once occupied by Katharine Hepburn and, before that, by John Barrymore’s birds.
“I found fantastic paintings of men with plumes in their turbans and fantastic birds with elaborate plumage,” she said of the Barrymore aviary-turned-guesthouse. “It was like a little tiny chapel. There were stained-glass windows in the cupola. One showed he and Dolores Costello in a scene from ‘The Sea Beast.’ Nobody wanted the house. There was no garage. It was just useless. But it was heaven.”
Bruce, half-St. Bernard and half-poodle, was by Bergen’s side. She was wearing a striped T-shirt and shoes made out of African indigo cotton by Ibu, an online group of women’s cooperatives from around the world, which features designs by her old friend Ali MacGraw.
I asked how she felt about the election.
“When I found out that Biden had won, I was going out of my building, and I heard honking and people screaming, and I said to the doorman: ‘What’s happening? Is there a parade?’ He said, ‘He won.’ And I just burst into tears. It was just such a relief. We just needed a sense of decency, a sense of kindness.” She added, for the president-elect, “May the wind be at his back because he’s going to need it.”
I noted that she will have to put away her “Free Melania” sweater.
“Yes,” she said, smiling. “That’ll have to be repurposed somehow.”
“My life is a very tiny life now,” she said, referring to coronavirus restrictions and attending to Rose. “I don’t mind it, frankly. For someone in their 70s, it’s not a tragedy.” The couple have quiet dinners and watch “The West Wing” in a dark red room covered with dog paintings. “I’m an old person,” Bergen said, and then, later, stretching out her neck for me to see: “I have a wattle.”
“I would like to embrace being 74,” she said. “I mean, my hair is white up here. My COVID color, turns out, is white. I probably will leave my wattle."
Bergen, who had her eyes done during “Murphy Brown” — “because they were very hooded and people were talking” — continued, “I know I should have injections. I have deep lines along my lip.” But “I can’t take the pain.
“When I go to get my makeup done, the woman who does it says, when she is finished, ‘Now you look like Candice Bergen again.’ Because when I start, it’s like, ‘Uh, what a wreck.’ Stuff goes.”
‘The Elephant in the Room’
Bergen has always been blunt about not starving herself or doing extreme procedures to preserve her looks. She declared in her second memoir, “A Fine Romance,” published in 2015: “I am a champion eater. No carb is safe — no fat either.”
She told me, “I was never a good dieter,” adding brightly: “I ate an entire pumpkin pie at Thanksgiving, all by myself in my kitchen. Without the crust, but the entire filling of the pie.”
Her daughter, Chloe Malle, a writer and contributing editor at Vogue, said that Bergen’s lack of vanity was an extension of her I-don’t-give-a-damn attitude, which could be both stressful and refreshing.
“She really doesn’t care and would rather eat the cookie,” Malle said. “She has eaten mocha ice cream and Cheetos for her entire dinner. Most of quarantine, she has been strolling through Central Park with Bruce in her pajamas and the coat she got on Amazon, her hair sticking up, going into a Big Edie and Little Edie vibe.”
Malle continued: “I grew up with my friends’ dads saying, ‘Oh, my God, I remember when your mom was young; she was a knockout.’ I think she had great insecurity around the fact that people have always focused on that. It can be quite a burden. There’s something freeing about her beauty not being the only thing people are focused on.”
Bergen writes perceptively in her two memoirs about the phenomenon of beauty creating its own rules of conduct. “It’s often the elephant in the room and you’re the elephant handler,” as she put it.
After her 1967 Vogue cover in her modeling days and her movie debut in “The Group” in 1966, where she played the risky role of Lakey, a lesbian — “People saw posters of me in gay bars after that,” she said, pleased — Bergen’s perfect nose spurred a flood of plastic surgeries.
“Doctors used to come up to me and say could they take a cast of my nose,” she said. “I said, ‘Go away.’ My nose was very important to people. I never even thought about it. It’s strange.”
She speaks highly of her famous leading men: Caine, McQueen, Connery and especially Nicholson. Early in her career, she got scathing reviews. After “The Group” came out, Pauline Kael wrote about Bergen in Life magazine that “As an actress, her only flair is in her nostrils.” Reviewing “The Adventurers,” The New York Times said that Bergen “performs as though clubbed over the head.”
But on “SNL” and in the 1979 film “Starting Over” with Burt Reynolds and Jill Clayburgh, and then in “Murphy Brown,” she discovered she had comedic timing, perhaps honed as a child joining in her father’s holiday skits with Charlie McCarthy. Younger fans laughed at Bergen as a rabid former beauty queen in “Miss Congeniality” and as a Vogue editor in “Sex and the City.”
She recalled her first “SNL” hosting gig as “pure, distilled terror.” (Lorne Michaels, a friend, said the expression in her eyes that night was “like Patty Hearst when the Symbionese Liberation Army rang her doorbell.”)
Bergen recalled: “Belushi and Danny Aykroyd, who were best friends, were being very cute, and sort of flirtatious, kind of like young guys with an older woman. They were very dear, actually. Belushi had not yet started going to California to do drugs. They were all jealous of Lorne and resentful of his authority. I always got that from cast members. Lorne was a miracle. It was just staggering, the things they could pull off.”
Is it harder for beautiful women to be funny?
“I think men don’t like beautiful women to make fun of themselves,” the actress said. “They don’t like you to wear funny hats. They don’t like you to look less than a dignified, beautiful woman. I’ve noticed that. For me, being funny is my joy. Doing ‘Murphy’ was just such a gift for me.” She was very disappointed that the reboot did not catch on.
Her new movie is about three women who go to college together, fall out of touch and reunite when Alice, a Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist played by Streep, invites the other two on a crossing to London. It turns out that Alice learned about an affair that Bergen’s character, Roberta, had, which caused her rich husband to divorce her, stranding her to a life selling lingerie at a high-end department store — and then appropriated this plotline for a book.
Unlike Bergen, Roberta is pinched and bruised by grievances. At one point, Roberta wonders if men will want her given that she’s “old rotten meat.” It’s startling, more so knowing Bergen improvised the line.
In her big confrontation scene with Streep’s character on the ship, Bergen was jittery. As they sat down to shoot a scene, they received an outline from Deborah Eisenberg, the writer and Columbia professor.
“They tell you what the nub of the scene is, and then you just have to flail around,” Bergen said.
She did do research. “Candy told us she actually flew to Houston to see oil rigs as preparation for her role,” Wiest said, adding that Bergen conjured a character who “was so poor as a child, her only pet was a snake and her single mother worked as a housekeeper. I thought, ‘Wow, Hollywood royalty does deep research!’ She dressed herself like a real Texas babe. I sat across the table from her in the film and thought, she’s doing nothing obvious, and yet I’d swear she sprang from Texas dirt.”
Dates With Famous Men
Streep said she was surprised when Bergen, whom she did not know previously, was standoffish. “I thought, ‘She hates me.’ ” Then she realized that Bergen was using a “method-y” approach.
Now, she notes, “Candy is sort of like a sister I never had,” with traits that are shy and sly, kind and sharp, all at the same time. And then, she said, there’s that surprising, throwing-her-head-back laugh, which Bergen used to great effect in the 1971 film “Carnal Knowledge.”
Bergen had never done improv. “At her age, she doesn’t have to do any of this,” said her friend Diane English, creator of “Murphy Brown.” “She has such respect for the script and the written word, and she works so hard to get exactly right. This is a huge challenge for her. But she wants another challenge. It’s daunting but she totally embraced it.”
I told Bergen that in her confrontation with Streep’s character on the ship, she could have channeled the moment in 1980 when she had her only Oscar nomination, for “Starting Over,” and lost to Streep, who won for “Kramer vs. Kramer.”
“One of the first of her 18 nominations,” Bergen said dryly. (It’s 21.)
I wondered about the movie’s theme about strained female friendship. Bergen wrote in her first memoir, “Knock Wood,” that she did not have many female friends when she was younger and that women were often “wary” of her.
“Certainly, going into parties, my task for myself was to disarm myself, to go: ‘I’ve got no weapons. I’m here. I come in friendship,’” she said. “Because the women would back way up.”
She added: “Of course, as you get older, women’s relationships become primary relationships because we know so many women are widows, so many women are single, and they become their own pod and form these groups.”
Her friends gush about her. MacGraw loves the fact that Bergen — “a real American beauty with enormous class” — never wears anything that’s trying too hard and that she entertains and decorates with a sense of whimsy.
“When she lived in the fabulous former artist’s studio on Central Park South,” MacGraw remembered, “on one table there was a glass of milk spilled on the glass top. I don’t know how many times I tried to clean that up before I realized it was a fake.”
Bergen’s most important relationship is with her daughter. “The birth of my daughter was the greatest event in my life,” she said.
Some would argue, Malle said wryly, that the umbilical cord is still not severed. Bergen raised Chloe mostly on her own in Los Angeles, where she lived for the 10 years of “Murphy Brown.” After Louis Malle lost the Oscar for best foreign language film for the 1987 film “Au Revoir Les Enfants,” his dislike of Los Angeles deepened, and he went back to France to work.
“I was very happy being married to Louis,” Bergen said. “He was really a great love of my life, and we had a great time together, but you’re pulled in different directions, and then you have a child, and they become the love of your life, and that’s hard.” She added, “The distance was very hard on the marriage, and then the balance of power was in question,” referring to her growing fame with “Murphy Brown.”
Now she is focused on her 6-month-old grandson, Artie. “He’s just the dumpling,” she said. “He’s just the best arrival of joy in one’s life. I’m crying. I’m just looking forward to the future with Artie.”
She asked her daughter if she could take over a dilapidated barn, one of two on the land that Chloe and her husband, Graham Albert, a financier, bought in Connecticut. “That’s all I need,” mother told daughter. “That’s where I’m going to retire.”
Now, said an amused Malle, “she has built a Gil Schafer mini-manse on the site. She said it’s the smallest project he’s ever taken on.”
I ask Bergen what she thought of Quentin Tarantino’s “Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood,” released last year.
“The feeling of it,” she said, “was very close.”
In the late 1960s, she and her boyfriend at the time, Terry Melcher, a record producer and the son of Doris Day, had lived in the house on Cielo Drive before Sharon Tate and Roman Polanski. It has been said that a reason Manson targeted that house was because he was angry Melcher didn’t give him a record contract.
“Terry was very stupid, and he went out there to record Manson’s group singing,” Bergen said. “He knew it was very loaded, and one of Manson’s people came to the door once when I was at the house. Then one day, Terry just said, ‘We’re moving.’ I said, ‘When?’ He said, ‘Tomorrow.’ His mother had a house in Malibu that became David Geffen’s house where we went. Then they took the telescope off our balcony at the beach house. It was like Manson saying, ‘Don’t try to hide from me.’”
And about that famous date with Trump, when she was at the University of Pennsylvania?
He was shy, quiet and introspective, I presume?
“Yes, in fact his knowledge of philosophy goes way beyond,” she said, laughing. “We went to, I think, a steakhouse, but he picked me up from school in a limousine, which was unusual, and it was a burgundy limousine, and he was wearing a burgundy suit and burgundy patent leather boots. I just thought, this guy can color coordinate with the best of them. I think I was home by 9. I remember it being just very slow going and heavy lifting; it was just like pulling a sledge. And then I was home early.”
There was another renowned date in the 1970s, with Henry Kissinger, arranged by family friends. Bergen went ahead with it at the puckish urging of her counterculture boyfriend, Bert Schneider, and his pal, Abbie Hoffman, who wanted intel on the Vietnam War.
She said if it wasn’t the best date she ever had, it was “certainly the best-guarded. Some family friends invited Frank Sinatra and a date and Henry Kissinger and me for dinner. I remember, when he was late, getting a call that the Secret Service couldn’t find Beverly Hills. It was concerning. The whole dinner was just a mano-a-mano between Frank and Henry. I think Frank won.”
When I noted that Bergen had to be the only person on earth who was friends with both Nancy Reagan and Huey Newton, she laughed and agreed.
I said it was surprising Frank Sinatra did not woo her.
“He did ask a friend of mine for my contact, but it wasn’t given,” she said, with a prim smile.
Charlie McCarthy is now in the Smithsonian. Bergen wrote about her shock when her father left money in his will to her “older, all-powerful brother” — the dummy — and not to her. She used to talk to a shrink about their relationship, which she calls the zaniest sibling rivalry ever, but she said it was too wacky even for a therapist.
She has reconciled her feelings toward her wooden “brother” — and her father, who was a loving but emotionally distant child of Swedish immigrants. She said that she has Charlie McCarthy memorabilia on display and her daughter has windup toys and salt and pepper shakers.
“The older I get, the more fierce I am about my pride in being a ventriloquist’s daughter,” Bergen said. “I just think it’s the weirdest thing.”
—
Putting words in her mouth? No, just a holiday round of Confirm or Deny .
Maureen Dowd: You would have loved to work with Alfred Hitchcock.
Candice Bergen: Yes. I would have been a Hitchcock blonde. I did have lunch with Grace and Prince Rainier at David Niven Jr.’s house in the South of France. David and I had grown up together. The Rainiers came for lunch, and we talked about this and that. It was fantastic. She was lovely. And afterward, an interviewer said, “Who will be the next Grace Kelly?” She said, “Perhaps it’s Candice Bergen.”
Dowd: You used to figure out whom you wanted to date with the help of a shoe code.
Bergen: If you wanted to place really high on the board, Italian loafers. Any kind of loafer basically got you in the door, or sneakers. But no cordovans, no wingtips.
Dowd: You’ve read Matthew McConaughey’s memoir twice.
Bergen: All right, all right, all right. No.
Dowd: You love listening to the podcast “Call Her Daddy.”
Bergen: Here’s the thing. I’ve never listened to a podcast because I don’t know how. I know there’s a podcast app someplace, so I’m going to do that. I have to find my earphones first.
Dowd: You have James Bond’s old couch.
Bergen: Yes, Roger Moore’s — because I once bought his house. My daughter has it.
Dowd: You love practical jokes, but it’s harder in the woke culture.
Bergen: I think you have to pick your subjects more carefully. It’s a very structured moment in time.
Dowd: Your biggest regret is missing the famous Diana and Charles dinner-dance at the Reagan White House.
Bergen: I was pregnant with Chloe, and she was 2 1/2 weeks late. Mrs. Reagan was calling me, and she said, “Candy, what’s happening? We’d love you to be there.” I couldn’t go. Chloe was born the day before.
Dowd: You miss sitting on the bed and watching bad TV and smoking pot with Sue Mengers.
Bergen: Well, I do. That was fun.
Dowd: You would like to die the way the Maasai do, where they just lay you out in the savanna as a buffet for the animals.
Bergen: Exactly.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump was right about the “deep state” — sort of. There exist, in government, people and forces rigged to foil disruption.
And he has exposed that. Just not in the manner he intended.
The deep state isn’t a reflexive defense of a corrupt status quo. It’s a righteous defense against the corruption of democracy, which is what Trump continues to attempt.
And that defense is holding. Three cheers for the deep state, which has been on a roll these past three weeks.
I’m thinking of Brad Raffensperger, Georgia’s secretary of state, who supervises its elections. He refused to cry foul and fraud just because others in his party couldn’t abide Joe Biden’s victory in a state that hadn’t gone to a Democrat in a presidential election for nearly three decades.
“People are just going to have to accept the results,” he told the Washington Post. “I’m a Republican. I believe in fair and secure elections.”
He ordered a recount, but as Trump, the two U.S. senators from Georgia and plenty of others on the right pilloried him, he stuck to his assurance that a fair and secure election was precisely what Georgians had participated in and what had delivered the state’s electoral votes to Biden.
He was bolstered Tuesday by another top-ranking Georgia official, another Republican not about to let the republic go to hell. Gabriel Sterling, Georgia’s voting system implementation manager, scolded and shamed Trump at a news conference at the state Capitol, warning the president that his unwarranted smearing of the balloting in Georgia was “inspiring people to commit potential acts of violence” and that “someone is going to get killed.”
“It has to stop,” he said.
That was the deep state speaking, and its words were gold.
Raffensperger and Sterling are hardly the only Republican election officials who have refused to buy into Trump’s conspiracy theories. They have restored some of the faith and hope in me that the past four years eroded.
So have Lee Chatfield, the Republican speaker of Michigan’s House of Representatives, and Mike Shirkey, the Republican majority leader of Michigan’s Senate, who took that scary trip to the White House almost two weeks ago and then took a pass on propping up Trump.
“We have not yet been made aware of any information that would change the outcome of the election in Michigan and, as legislative leaders, we will follow the law and follow the normal process regarding Michigan’s electors,” they said in a joint statement immediately following their meeting with the president.
Follow the normal process. Such milquetoast verbiage, and such a titanic reassurance.
Also in my deep state: Judge Stephanos Bibas of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia, a Trump appointee who, in a blistering ruling Friday, rejected the president’s efforts to invalidate millions of Pennsylvania ballots.
“Voters, not lawyers, choose the president,” he wrote on behalf of the three judges hearing the case, all appointed by Republicans. “Ballots, not briefs, decide elections.”
Such statements of the obvious, and such sweet, sweet relief.
Was there a seed of truth in Trump’s fulminations about insiders so stuck in their ways and attached to their stations that they might balk instinctively at newcomers and new ideas? Absolutely. That’s a danger within any sprawling and enduring organization. It’s something to watch for and worry about.
But Trump’s watching was paranoid. His worry was hysterical. And his motive wasn’t the improvement of government but the inoculation of self. The deep state saw through that, and the deep state stirred.
“Deep state” isn’t the right term — its overtone is too clandestine, its undertone too nefarious — but let’s go with it, co-opt it, turn a put-down into a point of honor, the way gay rights activists did with “queer” and anti-Trump feminists did with “nasty woman.”
Let’s define it ourselves, not as a swampy society of self-preserving bureaucrats in Washington but as a steadfast, tradition-minded legion of public officials and civil servants all over the country, in every branch of government.
These officials and servants are distinguished by a professionalism that survives and edges out their partisan bearings, by an understanding that the codes of conduct and rules of engagement become more important, not less, when passions run hot. They’re incorrigible that way. Invaluable, too.
“Thank God for the deep state,” John McLaughlin, a former deputy and acting director of the CIA, said in October 2019 at a panel on election security at the National Press Club in Washington.
It was organized and sponsored by the Michael V. Hayden Center for Intelligence, Policy and International Security at George Mason University, and McLaughlin’s fellow panelists were other former leaders of the CIA and FBI.
But my deep state is both deeper and broader than those agencies. It extends beyond the diplomats (William Taylor, Marie Yovanovitch) and security officials (Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman) who played starring roles in Trump’s impeachment.
Anthony Fauci is the steely superhero of my deep state, but he’s flanked and fortified by all the government health officials who also pushed back against the quackery of Scott Atlas, the Trump-flattering pandemic adviser who resigned Monday.
They belong to a quiet and then not-so-quiet resistance that blunted, thwarted or tried to blunt and thwart Trump’s worst impulses when it came not just to public health but also to foreign policy, immigration, the environment. In the New York Times late last week, Lisa Friedman described such efforts within the Environmental Protection Agency.
“With two months left of the Trump administration,” she wrote, “career EPA employees find themselves where they began, in a bureaucratic battle with the agency’s political leaders. But now, with the Biden administration on the horizon, they are emboldened to stymie Mr. Trump’s goals and to do so more openly.”
That’s the deep state rearing up. That’s the deep state roaring. It should be music to our ears.

WASHINGTON — The prospects for an elusive bipartisan stimulus deal appeared to brighten Friday as Speaker Nancy Pelosi projected fresh optimism that the House and Senate could come to terms and President-elect Joe Biden prodded lawmakers to “act and act now” on a measure he insisted was within reach.
Even as liberal Democrats warned that the emerging compromise was woefully inadequate amid economic devastation wrought by the pandemic, Pelosi, D-Calif., told reporters that she and Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the majority leader, had agreed to redouble efforts to find a deal that could be merged with an enormous year-end spending package under discussion.
“That would be our hope because that is the vehicle leaving the station,” Pelosi said at a news conference in the Capitol on Friday, a day after speaking with McConnell. He expressed similar resolve Thursday.
After months in which the two top congressional leaders refused to budge from their respective positions, the shared goal marked significant progress — particularly as Pelosi appeared poised to accept a far smaller stimulus package than she had championed.
But while momentum has built behind a $908 billion plan outlined by a bipartisan group of moderates that top Democrats have embraced as the starting point for talks, significant hurdles remained. No actual bill has been written yet, and McConnell has yet to offer an explicit endorsement of a plan that is several times larger than what he has previously said Republicans could accept.
Biden said Friday that he was “confident” that an agreement was possible but pointedly declined to answer when asked by reporters whether he had spoken with McConnell, a negotiating counterpart with whom he has brokered many deals.
“It’s not going to satisfy everybody,” Biden said of the compromise plan, “but the option is, if you insist on everything, we’re likely to get nothing on both sides.”
Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., the former Democratic candidate for president, was among those who were not satisfied. He said Friday that he could not support the proposal without changes, deriding the inclusion of a liability shield for businesses operating during the pandemic as “a get-out-of-jail-free card to companies that put the lives of their workers and customers at risk.” He said the omission of another round of $1,200 direct payments to Americans was “unacceptable.”
“I look forward to working with my colleagues in the House and Senate to significantly improve this bill,” Sanders concluded. “But in its current form, I cannot support it.”
The compromise proposal was offered by a bipartisan group of lawmakers, including Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.V.; Mitt Romney, R-Utah; and Susan Collins, R-Maine. The group and their aides are expected to continue working to finalize legislation through the weekend.
Stimulus talks have been stalemated for months, with lawmakers unable to resolve differences over issues like the liability protections, a Republican demand that Democrats have resisted, and providing federal aid to state and local governments, a top priority for Democrats that many Republicans oppose. They are also still struggling to resolve a number of policy disputes in the must-pass bills needed to keep the government funded beyond Dec. 11.
The emerging compromise would revive lapsed federal unemployment benefits at $300 a week for 18 weeks and provide billions of dollars in funding for small businesses, schools and the imminent distribution of a vaccine.
“What I have real concerns about is the American people thinking, Congress struck a deal, we’re getting COVID relief, and then their lives changing very little,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., told reporters on Capitol Hill. “Will I support resources to hospitals and schools and firefighters? Absolutely. But I am extremely concerned that it’s not going to solve the immediate problems that people have.”
Although Pelosi conceded there were still obstacles to an agreement, she insisted there would be “sufficient time” to close a deal before the Dec. 11 government funding deadline. She pointed to lower-than-expected job gains reported Friday as an added accelerant.
“There is momentum. There is momentum,” Pelosi said. “I am pleased that the tone of our conversations is one that is indicative of the decision to get the job done.”
After months of insisting she would not accept a slimmed-down relief bill, Pelosi appears poised to accept less than one-third of the spending Democrats initially proposed to prop up small businesses, help the uninsured and jobless, boost state and local governments, and meet immediate public health needs.
Biden and his advisers, faced with the prospect of the economy cratering even further before his inauguration Jan. 20, have publicly pushed for lawmakers to reach agreement on a smaller package, promising more action in the coming months.
“To truly end this crisis, Congress is going to need to fund more testing as well as a more equitable and free distribution of the vaccine,” Biden said. “We’re going to need more economic relief to bridge through 2021 until this pandemic and economic crisis are over.”
Pressed on her reversal, Pelosi was defensive Friday, saying her earlier, multitrillion-dollar proposals that Senate Republicans called nonstarters were “not a mistake” but important parts of a negotiating strategy that may now yield results. She insisted that Biden’s election and the looming arrival of two vaccines amounted to “a total game changer.”
“President-elect Biden has said this package would be at best just a start,” she said. “That’s how we see it as well. It is less money, but over a shorter period of time, and we need to do it to save lives and livelihood, with the hope that much more help is on the way.”
Pelosi’s Republican adversaries portrayed her statements as an admission that she had put political considerations over those of American businesses and families. Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., the minority leader, called the remarks “despicable.”
“Anyone care to try and dispute the wasted time and damaged economy that came from this WASN’T flat out cynical politics on the Speakers part???,” Rep. Bill Huizenga, R-Mich., wrote on Twitter. “Workers and small businesses were crippled and we are in worse shape now because of it.”

Big Ferry Company Dumped Sewage Into Hudson for Years, Whistleblowers Say

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
WEEHAWKEN, N.J. — The dirtiest work happened while most of New Jersey slept, on boats docked across from Manhattan’s shimmering, half-lit skyscrapers.
Employees of New York Waterway, a tour boat operator and the country’s largest private ferry company, would uncap a silver pipe and attach a small pump, forcing unfiltered waste from the boats’ toilets directly into the Hudson River, two former workers claim in court documents unsealed Friday.
The practice went on for years, according to the former employees, who have filed a whistleblower complaint in federal court in Newark, New Jersey, accusing New York Waterway of violating the federal Clean Water Act.
“Anything that goes into a toilet would come right out,” said Rafi Khatchikian, 42, who was responsible for fueling and cleaning ferries at the company’s work dock in Weehawken. He worked the graveyard shift from September 2013 to August 2015, when he was fired after a diesel spill.
“It’s, like, blended when it comes out,” he said. “It looks like oatmeal.”
Once, after a large tour boat outing, Khatchikian said the pump spewed waste into the river for more than 45 minutes.
The company denies the allegations.
“We think it’s totally without merit,” said Armand Pohan, the company’s chair.
Khatchikian and a second employee, Ivan Torres, said they were acting on instructions from their bosses at New York Waterway, a company that before the pandemic shuttled more than 30,000 passengers a day across the Hudson, a service it marketed as “the civilized commute.”
Torres said the practice was part of the reason he walked off the job in 2015 and moved with his wife and two children to Florida, where he does maintenance work near Orlando.
“It was horrible,” said Torres, a mechanic who said he began working for New York Waterway in 2011. “You’d go home and go to sleep and your nostrils still smelled of it.”
New York Waterway was founded in 1986 by Arthur E. Imperatore Sr., a onetime trucking magnate who died last month at 95.
A spokesperson for the company, Patrick Smith, said the lawsuit was filed by “disgruntled ex-employees.”
Federal prosecutors disclosed this week that they had declined to intervene in the case after a lengthy investigation led by the Environmental Protection Agency. Smith said this showed the “baseless nature of these claims.”
A spokesperson for Craig Carpenito, the U.S. attorney in New Jersey, had no immediate comment.
“After years of investigation, the U.S. Attorney’s Office has declined to participate in this meritless lawsuit, which was filed by two disgruntled ex-employees of NY Waterway,” Smith said in a statement. “The government’s decision in that regard speaks volumes about the baseless nature of these claims.”
Michael Baldassare, a criminal defense lawyer hired by New York Waterway to address the lawsuit, declined to comment.
Under federal law, whistleblowers who disclose environmental fraud are eligible to be paid as much as 30% of fines recouped from polluters.
The allegations had been under investigation by the EPA’s criminal investigation division for more than two years, according to records obtained by The New York Times through the Freedom of Information Act.
The EPA inquiry began in July 2016 and appeared linked not just to the claims raised by the two men. Another employee, a captain, had expressed similar concerns, according to the records, which were heavily redacted.
The captain, who the records suggest had been suspended after a boating accident, told the EPA that “mechanics would plug in a pump right into the sewage and pump the sewage into the water (Hudson River),” a September 2016 investigation report states.
The captain’s goal, reports show, was to return to work to “get video evidence of illegal sewage dumping.”
Torres said he had done just that two years earlier.
In a nighttime video with an Oct. 6, 2014, time stamp shared with the Times, a man can be heard stating that he is pumping waste into the river as the camera shows what appears to be liquid flowing from a hose. “It’s done on a regular basis,” the man says in the recording.
Jeff Tittel, director of the New Jersey Sierra Club, a nonprofit environmental watchdog, said the EPA’s failure to pursue criminal penalties had caused untold harm to a river slowly recovering after decades of contamination.
A segment of the 315-mile river was once a federal Superfund site, teeming with toxic PCBs, a synthetic chemical. But a dredging effort that began in 2009 has helped turn the Hudson into a water sport playground safe for kayakers, paddleboarders and the occasional wayward seal.
On Oct. 4, 2018, Khatchikian’s lawyer, Michael D. Fitzgerald, notified New York Waterway that a complaint would be filed and asked the company to preserve all evidence.
Twenty days later, EPA agents boarded three ferries to try to place “concentrated green dye” in toilets to track the path of the wastewater, records show.
The toilet on one ferry had been removed altogether. The bathrooms on two other ferries were locked from the outside.
EPA investigators had interviewed a New York Waterway vice president months earlier, who, records show, told them that “the boats do not have the ability to discharge directly into the water anymore.”
The vice president, whose name was redacted, said that “if it happens, it is not company procedure.”
A spokesperson for the EPA, Mary Mears, said the agency had closed the investigation in December 2018, but reserved the right to “investigate any significant new information.”
“EPA took the allegations very seriously and we launched an in-depth investigation,” Mears said in an email.
She said the agency “did not find the evidence that it would have needed to request that the U.S. attorney bring formal charges.”
Khatchikian said that on the nights he worked, he was the only employee responsible for emptying the ferries’ waste tanks and refueling boats.
He said he believed he was instructed to use a small, hand-held pump to discharge waste into the river because of a shortage of employees and the difficulty of proper disposal.
A long hose that was needed to hook boats to the lone stationary pump on the dock that could dispose of sewage properly froze in cold weather, he said. The legitimate pump also lacked the power to push the waste as far, or as fast, as it needed to go, he said.
“It took longer to do it the right way,” Khatchikian said in an interview. “The illegal pump pumps very quickly — much, much faster.”
Khatchikian was fired after a fuel spill. His termination letter claimed he left a fuel nozzle unattended and was “observed being inattentive.”
Torres, 36, said he spoke to two EPA investigators who came to his house in Florida, but declined to give them the video and photos he had taken out of fear of self-incrimination.
“I’m going to make a very powerful man very angry,” he said about the company’s owner, “and what am I going to have to show for it?”
He added, “You think they’re going to make a movie about me because I ratted out the New York Waterway?”
Torres was recently added to Khatchikian’s lawsuit, providing him whistleblower status and the promise of being eligible to share in a percentage of any potential fines generated by the lawsuit.
A federal prosecutor who works for Carpenito participated in the EPA investigation, records show. Carpenito had signaled in the court documents unsealed Friday that he had no plan to intervene in the case. A spokesperson, Matthew Reilly, had no immediate comment about the decision.
It has been clear for years that the financial stakes are high.
As part of the inquiry, Fitzgerald hired a private investigator, Bari Kroll, and rented an eighth-floor apartment on the Weehawken waterfront for five months in 2018 to conduct round-the-clock video surveillance of New York Waterway’s work dock.
On Oct. 3, 2018, at 4:20 a.m., Kroll said her surveillance cameras captured a greenish orb in the water near a ferry named the Bayonne, less than a day after EPA records show that an agent had placed green dye in the toilet.
Fitzgerald shared the video with the EPA.
An EPA report from the next day acknowledged that a ferry crew member appeared to spot something unusual in the river, leading the worker to shine a flashlight toward the water.
“When the flashlight shines on the water,” the report states, “there are brief moments when the water appears to have a greenish tint.”
The allegations involve a time when New York Waterway was preparing to vacate, or overhaul, its Weehawken work dock.
With one foot out the door, the company would have had little incentive to upgrade its balky sewage disposal system and could explain why it required employees to take environmentally damaging short cuts, Fitzgerald said.
In 2017, New York Waterway spent about $11.5 million to purchase waterfront land in neighboring Hoboken, New Jersey, where it hoped to build a new work dock. It had been trying to buy the parcel for 10 years.
The purchase, which impeded Hoboken’s plans to connect its waterfront amenities, became the subject of intense rancor and political intrigue. The dispute is unresolved.
There have since been signs of wear and tear on New York Waterway’s fleet.
Last year, the Coast Guard briefly pulled 23 of the company’s 32 boats out of service after deeming them “operationally unfit.”
“I just don’t think that they wanted to put up the money to set up the pumping that they had to, to do this the right way,” Fitzgerald said.

Marian McCormick lives in Georgia, as do 2,700 other members of the Lower Muskogee Creek Tribe. She knows that comes as a surprise to some people.
“Here in Georgia, they tend to think that Native Americans were all removed,” said McCormick, the principal chief of the tribe, which is based in Whigham.
More than 180 years ago, as part of the Trail of Tears, the U.S. military drove thousands of Cherokee and Muscogee people off the land they had lived on for centuries and marched them to what is now Oklahoma. Today, the federal government doesn’t recognize McCormick’s tribe, or any other in the state.
But nearly 150,000 Native Americans still live in Georgia, by the Native voting rights group Four Directions’ estimate. They receive few government services and tend not to participate in nontribal elections, both because they face structural barriers — like hard-to-reach polling places and lack of voter ID — and because of the mistrust built by brutality and broken promises. Of the estimated 100,000 who are of voting age, only about 15,000 are registered to vote.
Organizers and tribal leaders recognize that if even a few thousand more Native Americans were inspired and able to vote in Georgia, they could play a meaningful political role in a closely divided state where two runoff elections Jan. 5 will decide which party controls the Senate. Buoyed by remarkable Native American turnout in other states last month, advocates are trying to make that happen at breakneck speed.
McCormick recently spoke with OJ Semans, a co-founder of Four Directions, which is nonpartisan. They agreed to begin a get-out-the-vote campaign with the Cherokee of Georgia and the Georgia Tribe of Eastern Cherokee, two tribes that, like the Lower Muskogee Creek Tribe, are recognized by the state. They also plan to press the Senate candidates — Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, both Republicans, and their Democratic challengers, Jon Ossoff and the Rev. Raphael Warnock — to address issues important to Native Americans.
Increasing turnout among members of a marginalized community in a month is a tall order, and the deadline to register to vote in the runoffs is even sooner: Dec. 7. The foundations that groups like Four Directions have spent years building in other states — the networks of volunteers and relationships with tribes — are not so well established in Georgia, and Native Americans there are not as heavily concentrated on tribal land.
But the examples other states set this year could provide a road map, even if the reward is further off than January.
Consider Arizona, which flipped blue in a presidential election for the first time in 24 years.
Based on a New York Times analysis of precinct data, President-elect Joe Biden received more than 80% of the roughly 55,000 votes cast in the Arizona portion of the Navajo Nation — the country’s largest tribe — and in the smaller Hopi Reservation, which shares precincts with the Navajo.
Turnout and the Democratic vote share on the Navajo and Hopi reservations both increased this year, compared with 2016, and turnout rose slightly more on the reservations than it did statewide. Biden received about 13,500 more votes from the reservations than Hillary Clinton did four years ago.
That alone could account for Biden’s 10,500-vote margin of victory over President Donald Trump in Arizona, even before looking at his strong support among other tribes there, like the Tohono O’odham Nation, which has been enraged by the president’s efforts to build his border wall through tribal land.
On average, Native voters lean left and have a history of swinging close elections to Democrats. Native Americans, including members of Sioux and Chippewa tribes and the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation, are widely credited with helping to elect former Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., in 2012, and Blackfeet and Crow voters were integral in reelecting Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., in 2018.
But like any group, Native Americans are politically diverse. In 2010, Native Alaskans helped reelect Sen. Lisa Murkowski as a write-in candidate after she lost the Republican primary. And come January, the six Indigenous members of Congress will be evenly split between the parties.
The strong preference for Biden among Navajo voters was related in part to the Trump administration’s handling of the coronavirus, which has devastated the Navajo Nation. But the high turnout was a product of organizing, which takes a lot of time and work in Native American communities that are affected by voter ID laws, far-flung polling places and poor infrastructure, and have centuries of reasons not to trust the U.S. government.
“No one has ever taken the time to really reach out to the individuals themselves and say, ‘These are the list of reasons why you need to register to vote and cast your ballot, because this is something that affects you,’” said Tara Benally, field director for the Rural Arizona Project and a Navajo citizen. “Building that relationship with the people, it’s what the federal government needs to do. They’ve never actually done that with the Indigenous nations.”
The Rural Arizona Project, a nonprofit that mobilizes voters in rural areas, had 7 to 10 field organizers this year and worked with 200 Indigenous artists and influencers to promote a voter registration tool designed for communities without traditional street addresses. Native Americans are often disenfranchised when clerks mistakenly register them in the wrong precinct, but the tool lets voters enter plus codes — essentially shortened coordinates — to identify their locations more precisely.
Benally’s team contacted thousands of Navajo and Hopi voters, held drive-thru events to register voters safely during the pandemic and ultimately registered more than 4,500, the group’s executive director, TJ Ellerbeck, said.
A separate effort by Four Directions — led by Semans’ daughter, Donna Semans, a member of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe — registered about 2,000 Navajo voters. VoteAmerica, a nonpartisan group focused on low-propensity voters, sent more than 400,000 texts, according to its chief of staff, Jordan James Harvill, a Cherokee and Choctaw citizen. Advocacy groups also reached out to postal workers, who agreed to drive mail-in ballots straight to their destination to avoid the circuitous route that mail from the Navajo Nation often takes.
Native Americans were also influential in Wisconsin, where Biden won by about 20,000 votes. The state’s most Democratic area, where Biden received 82% of the vote, was Menominee County, which is near Green Bay and is home to the Menominee Tribe. Ashland and Bayfield counties, which have significant Native American populations, were blue spots in a sea of red in northern Wisconsin.
Native turnout was substantial, and heavily Democratic, even in states where the race wasn’t close, like North and South Dakota (which Trump won) and Minnesota (which Biden won). Four Directions registered more than 8,000 voters in Minnesota.
In North Carolina, it was Trump who benefited: He improved on his 2016 margin in Robeson County, where members of the Lumbee Tribe are concentrated. Many Lumbee voters chose Barack Obama when he narrowly won the state in 2008.
Trump and Biden both support federal recognition of the tribe, but Trump held a rally in Robeson County where he emphasized it. That, along with his opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement, probably contributed to his success in the county, said Malinda Maynor Lowery, a professor of history at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who is Lumbee.
Native Americans’ electoral gains this year built on ones made in 2018, when voters elected the first two Native American women to Congress: Rep. Sharice Davids of Kansas, a member of the Ho-Chunk Nation, and Rep. Deb Haaland of New Mexico, a member of the Laguna Pueblo people. Haaland is a contender to be interior secretary, which could further energize voters.
“Those individuals are making a connection between us as members of our sovereign, Indigenous nations and us as citizens of the United States,” Lowery said. “That’s kind of a tortured relationship, but to see people who are willing to manage it and who have persuaded a wide swath of voters to support them is deeply encouraging.”
Part of the progress stems from years of work to decrease legal and geographical barriers. Groups like the Native American Rights Fund and Four Directions have challenged numerous laws that disenfranchise Native Americans, like a voter ID law in North Dakota that required traditional street addresses until the state agreed to ensure voting access for tribes.
The barriers still exist, but the advances have been strong enough to prompt groups to expand their focus to places like Georgia, where Native American populations are smaller and less recognized.
“I think that the fact that so many Native voters did turn out despite all of the obstacles is a really important moment of reckoning,” said Katrina Phillips, an assistant professor of history at Macalester College and a member of the Red Cliff Band of Lake Superior Chippewa. “It’s getting to the point where the government can’t necessarily forget about us anymore.”
McCormick, the chief of the Lower Muskogee Creek Tribe in Georgia, said she hoped that politicians would take note if Native Americans voted in the runoffs in larger numbers, and that they would develop policies to help Native communities in return.
That could mean reversing a Department of Housing and Urban Development rule that effectively restricts HUD funding to Georgia tribes; increasing education funding and access to health care; and recognizing tribes like Georgia’s federally.
Four Directions is already knocking on doors in Atlanta, where some of Georgia’s Native Americans live, and tribal leaders will help identify members who live outside the tribes’ main communities.
Next week, the group will send a policy questionnaire to all four Senate candidates, in hopes that the responses will help voters make their decisions and hammer home how federal policy can affect their lives.
“We’re going to bring Native issues to the incumbents and to the candidates,” Semans said. “Whether they want to hear it or not.”

All Santa Wants for Christmas Is to Stay Out of Politics

Ric Erwin is one of thousands of men for whom Santa Claus is both a sacred idea and a seasonal occupation. Earlier this year, he was looking forward to donning his red velvet suit and hat this December, just as he had each winter for the last decade.
But the pandemic has thrown a wrench in the usual Christmas shows and shopping mall photo ops. And Erwin, 62, chairman of the board of the Fraternal Order of Real Bearded Santas — a national association for men who grow and maintain their own beards to play Santa Claus at holiday events — has found himself advocating for 500 professionals to safely support their work while virus cases are surging.
In September, Erwin, who lives in Hemet, California, testified virtually before the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. He noted that the production and distribution of an H1N1 vaccine in 2009 allowed Santa Claus performers to save Christmas that year. He hoped the CDC could similarly expedite a vaccine in time for this holiday season.
After his testimony, Erwin received several phone calls, voicemails and emails from Michael Caputo, the assistant secretary for public affairs at the Department of Health and Human Services, who hoped to broker a deal with the Santas. Erwin recalled Caputo telling him that the White House was interested in having Santas participate in a 35-city rollout campaign for Operation Warp Speed, the federal effort to develop a coronavirus vaccine. In exchange, he promised the Santas access to a vaccine by mid-October.
“That sounded like a great deal to us,” Erwin said. “Within 24 hours we had over 100 volunteers. The response was overwhelming.”
Caputo told Erwin he couldn’t wait to tell President Donald Trump that the Santas were onboard with the plan. Then, Erwin said, Caputo, the CDC and the HHS ghosted him.
Erwin realized Caputo was never going to call him back when The Wall Street Journal published an article in late October stating that the campaign, which was meant to include not only Santa players but also celebrities, had been scrapped. (In a statement to The New York Times, an HHS spokeswoman reiterated: “This collaboration will not be happening.”)
“We saw the handwriting on the wall and we knew there was not going to be a collaboration at that point, so if we were going to save Christmas this year it was just going to be the Clauses,” Erwin said.
In addition to stoking some false hope, his negotiations with the federal government drew attention to the myriad societies Santa Claus performers belong to today (although the word “performers” is scorned by those who take a Method approach to the role). There are regional groups (like the Lone Star Santas and the New England Santa Society), as well as national and international ones.
For the most part, these organizations try to stay out of politics, activism and other kinds of campaigning. So some Santas were annoyed.
“First of all, Santa lives in the North Pole — he doesn’t live in the United States,” said Stephen Arnold, 70, a Memphis, Tennessee, resident and president of the International Brotherhood of Real Bearded Santas (IBRBS), a trade group with more than 2,000 members. “He might have an interest in seeing that the United States is a calm and safe place for him to visit and deliver Christmas presents, but as a Santa Claus, you shouldn’t have a political posture.”
Arnold added that his understanding was that only four or five people would end up eligible for an early shot of the vaccine, according to the offer Caputo made to Erwin.
To be fair, Arnold and Erwin have some history. The Fraternal Order of Real Bearded Santas (FORBS) emerged out of the dissolution more than a decade ago of the Amalgamated Order of Real Bearded Santas (AORBS), which was wrapped in scandal at the time. (“If you Google ‘Santa Wars,’ you’ll find articles on it,” Arnold said.) Today, FORBS is much smaller than IBRBS, which also includes Mrs. Clauses, and there are members of each group who will not forget the Santa tension of years past.
Personal matters aside, Arnold said his resistance to take part in the government campaign revolved largely around a desire to remain apolitical.
“Most of our members were reluctant to consider being first in line because they felt that the whole thing on vaccines was being politically manipulated,” he said. “We work very hard on not being political. We do not allow any political posts or anything on our Facebook group pages.”
“If somebody posts something that’s even slightly interpreted as a political statement, it’s gone instantly,” he continued. “It’s just deleted.”
Should a member like to make a statement out-of-character, that’s fine, Arnold said. “We encourage all of our Santas who want to make political posts to create a separate page where they don’t wear any red and don’t indicate they’re Santa Claus or have Santa in their names,” he said.
At this point, according to CDC recommendations, Santa players shouldn’t expect to be vaccinated before Christmas. So, what does that mean for this holiday season?
“Generally speaking, within the Santa community, we are being as cautious as possible,” Arnold said. “There’s a small contingency of people who have laughed it off and said ‘I’m going to go on normally, I won’t be performing with a mask.’” Most members of Santa organizations, however, are considered high-risk coronavirus candidates: They are retirees in their 70s and 80s, and many have underlying health conditions, Erwin said.
“There isn’t a group of people that are more compromised than the Christmas Committee,” Arnold said. “A lot of us are old and have diabetes. Most of us have a heart problem; most of us are obese. We check every box.”
While many Santa-related innovations have come out of 2020 — holiday-themed masks, Plexiglas and acrylic walls that can be made to look invisible in photos, video calls, drive-through greetings — Erwin is most enticed by the idea of placing Santa in a vinyl dome.
The dome provides physical separation, but it can also be explained with a clever story for the children to understand, Erwin said.
“If parents don’t want to explain virus transmission, they can say Santa got trapped in a snow globe by an elf magician and you have to come visit him at the globe,” he said.
But Erwin won’t be scheduling any in-person visits this year. His father-in-law suffered a stroke in April and was hospitalized for 30 days before he died; none of his family members were able to visit because of the pandemic. Erwin told his wife and his mother-in-law, who makes Santa costumes and goes by Mother Claus, that he would not take any chances with the virus.
“I don’t even care about giving up my season,” Erwin said. “I’m thinking about the 150,000 plus people that did not have to die.” He blames the rising toll on the current administration and plans to deliver fitting gifts to its members this Christmas.
“As a Santa, I am neutral and love everybody, but as a citizen I have to say something,” Erwin said, adding that he would not be giving politicians coal. “They are getting dryer lint, at best.”

For Boris Johnson, a Week to Exorcise the Demons of 2020

LONDON — Britain’s approval of a coronavirus vaccine this week, beating every other Western country, would be a political gift for any leader. But perhaps none needs it as much as Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
A successful vaccine rollout could be the last chance for Johnson’s government to show competence, after botching virtually every other step of its response to the pandemic, from tardy lockdowns to a costly, ineffective test-and-trace program — all of which contributed to the country having the highest death toll in Europe.
It also comes just as Britain has reached a climactic stage in its long negotiations with the European Union for a post-Brexit trading relationship. Allies of Johnson were quick to claim that the swift approval of the vaccine vindicated the Brexit project.
That claim was quickly debunked. Nevertheless, the mass vaccination program will be an early test of how well Britain works once it is fully untethered from Europe.
“The British government is looking for ways to claim a victory because they’ve made such a bloody mess of the epidemic,” said David King, a former chief scientific adviser to the government who has become a vocal critic of its performance. “The nationalistic response is brutish and rather distasteful.”
Still, it is difficult to separate politics from public health. As the first vials of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine rolled into Britain in refrigerated trucks from Belgium this week, negotiators in London were in the last stages of trying to stitch together a long-term, EU-British trade agreement. The talks were paused Friday evening, amid signs that a breakthrough would require personal intervention by Johnson.
The pandemic has raised the pressure on Johnson to strike a deal, since a failure could deepen the economic damage caused by multiple lockdowns. Yet the convergence of events could also be fortuitous, allowing the beleaguered prime minister to resolve an issue that has divided Britain for more than four years at the very moment that relief finally begins to arrive for a country ravaged by the virus.
Pro-Brexit politicians struck a bluntly nationalistic chord, saying Britain’s early approval of the vaccine was the first of many triumphs — though for all the fanfare, it may be only days ahead of U.S. authorization and a few weeks ahead of the EU.
The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, said Britain moved faster than its neighbors because “we’re a much better country than every single one of them.” The leader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, said European regulators were “a bit sniffy” that they had not yet managed to approve it.
“We have, we’re leaving, draw your own conclusions,” he declared. “We are now free of the dead hand of the European Union.”
In fact, the swift approval of the Pfizer vaccine was not enabled by Brexit. Although Britain formally left the EU last January, it continues to adhere to the bloc’s regulations until a transition period expires Dec. 31.
The British health regulator invoked an emergency power, available to all EU members, to move faster in the case of a pandemic.
Still, the optics of Britain striking out on its own, ahead of France and Germany, are appealing because they play into the pro-Brexit argument that a Britain unshackled from Brussels will be more agile and flexible, able to act as a free agent in the global market for everything from vaccines to ventilators.
“No one is very proud of our record on the pandemic,” said Jonathan Powell, a former chief of staff to Prime Minister Tony Blair. “But they believe we’re magically going to become a better country by being outside of Europe.”
If anything, Powell said, the Pfizer vaccine was a testament to the value of pre-Brexit, cross-border collaboration: It was developed by Turkish-born scientists at a German biotechnology firm, produced by an American pharmaceutical company and manufactured in a plant in Belgium.
Brexit has colored Johnson’s handling of the pandemic in ways obvious and subtle. Britain declined to join a multibillion-dollar EU vaccine purchasing fund and shunned a European consortium to buy ventilators. The latter decision provoked anxiety in the early days of the pandemic, when it looked as if hospitals might not have enough machines for their patients.
In the end, the hospitals were able to cope with the demand. On Monday, Johnson boasted that Britain, acting on its own, was the first country to preorder supplies of the Pfizer vaccine, securing 40 million doses. All told, it has ordered more than 350 million doses of seven vaccine candidates, hedging its bets in case some do not pan out.
But Johnson diverged from other European leaders in waiting until late March to impose a lockdown. This fall, amid a second wave of the virus, he again moved more tentatively than leaders on the Continent, imposing a nationwide lockdown only in November. Critics say those delays cost lives; Britain’s death toll just surpassed 60,000.
“While we were in lockdown, we appeared to do nothing about a test-trace-and-isolate system,” King said. “We still don’t have a system that has anywhere near the capacity we need.”
He and other experts expressed less concern about the British regulator’s rapid approval of the Pfizer vaccine. Britain’s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, they said, had a history of independence and a reputation across Europe for thoroughly vetting new drugs.
They also expressed confidence that the vaccine will be distributed through Britain’s National Health Service, not by private contractors, like the companies involved in the trouble-prone test-and-trace system.
Even so, there are worries about how to distribute the vaccine, which needs to be stored at ultracold temperatures. Before the first injections, the government abruptly changed the priority for who would get the shot first, ruling out those in nursing homes in favor of nursing home staff and people 80 and over in hospitals or with appointments there.
The government’s muddled messaging has damaged Johnson, not just with the public but also with members of his own Conservative Party. He had to fend off a rebellion among Conservatives in Parliament this week over tiered restrictions that replaced the nationwide lockdown lifted Tuesday.
Experts said they were hopeful that the arrival of a vaccine would leach some of the vitriol out of the debate over lockdowns. But the government’s messaging could be a weakness in winning broad public acceptance of the vaccine. In addition to anti-vaccination activists, experts said it would confront wariness from people who will question whether Britain rushed its approval.
“They need to think about people who are saying, ‘Why is this being pushed so quickly?’” said Devi Sridhar, director of the global health program at the University of Edinburgh, who added she would take it “tomorrow, if I could.”
Johnson named Nadhim Zahawi, a Conservative member of Parliament with a background in public-opinion research, to coordinate the deployment of the vaccine. Zahawi, who has a degree in chemical engineering, co-founded YouGov, an internet polling company, which he later sold.
In YouGov’s polling on the vaccine — conducted last month after Pfizer reported positive results in clinical trials — two-thirds of those surveyed said they were “very likely” or “fairly likely” to take the vaccine when it becomes available. A fifth said they were unlikely to take it, while 12% said they were not sure.
“You’re going to have to see social influencers or health care workers lining up to take it,” Sridhar said.

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
Back in 1973, often remembered as the bad old days of the Lower East Side, Miguel Algarín, focusing on the light he saw shining from an emerging New York Puerto Rican community, began hosting a series of informal poetry readings in his apartment on East Sixth Street that brought together poets, theater types and musicians.
The gatherings soon outgrew his living room. Together with several contemporaries, Algarín went on to found the Nuyorican Poets Cafe, which opened down the block from his apartment in a former Irish bar on East Sixth Street. A new literary movement was taking shape.
Algarín, who died Monday at age 79, helped forge that movement, playing a central role in creating Nuyorican poetry and in popularizing the term Nuyorican to describe the bilingual, bicultural reboot of Puerto Rican-ness blossoming in the neighborhoods of New York.
Born in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and raised on the Lower East Side, Algarín attempted to merge the highbrow culture of his working-class parents with a Rabelaisian Everyman rebellion from below. He had a fearless sense of pride and was a champion of the underprivileged. The passion for Shakespeare he displayed as a professor at Rutgers University seamlessly fused with the Africanist urgency of his own poetry, producing a body of work that reflected his fluid use of Spanglish and shifting sexual identity.
That first incarnation of the Nuyorican Poets Cafe acted as the headquarters of a generation of young poets who broke from the folkloric stereotypes of islander passivity to be reincarnated as “Super Fly” rhymers. The path was blazed by a cadre of poets including Miguel Piñero, whose play “Short Eyes ” was championed by Joseph Papp’s Public Theater; Pedro Pietri, who read his epic poem, “Puerto Rican Obituary,” in 1969 when the activists of the Young Lords occupied a church in Spanish Harlem; Sandra María Esteves, who was one of the pioneering women of the movement; Lucky Cienfuegos; and Jesús Papoleto Meléndez.
In an era that would soon give birth to hip-hop, the Nuyoricans embraced a declaiming style that was shaped by contemporaries including The Last Poets; many were influenced by Ntozake Shange, one of the cafe’s founding poets, and her Obie-winning play “For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow Is Enuf.” The cafe also had visits from beat writers, including Allen Ginsberg and William S. Burroughs, whose “pale, inflected voice,” Algarín once told me in an interview, “still could reach us through his humor.”
“The poet blazes a path of fire for the self. He juggles with words. He lives risking each moment. Whatever he does, in every way he moves, he is a prince of the inner-city jungle. He is the philosopher of the sugar cane that grows between the cracks of concrete sidewalks.”
When I read those words, written by Algarín in his introduction to “Nuyorican Poetry: An Anthology of Puerto Rican Words and Feelings,” in a corner of St. Mark’s Bookshop, it was as if time had stopped for me. I had become fascinated with beat poetry in high school and college, once daring to read the work of Amiri Baraka at a campus cafe, but this was life-changing. Here was that same spirit of rebellion and anarchic emotion, translated through a code-switching working-class eloquence, that spoke to me and to a generation of New York-bred Puerto Rican migrants.
In that 1970s period of identity-based nationalism, as sensuous salsa mined nostalgia while the Young Lords reveled in the militancy of the present, Nuyorican poetry looked toward the future — or, as Algarín wrote, “the street burning up with its vision of times to be.”
I didn’t get to meet Algarín until years later, when I took part in the Nuyorican Cafe’s rebirth in the 1990s, at its new home on East Third Street. I expected to meet someone more like Piñero, whose wiseguy Spanglish hipsterism had defined the genre for me. But if Piñero was a Lower East Side Jean Genet, Algarín’s bellowing voice rang down on me like James Earl Jones mixed with James Baldwin — imperious yet somehow vulnerable.
His first lesson was about breathing and performance, when I had expected a line-edit. And while he seemed ambivalent about my poetry, he accepted me into his community, like the prince of the Nuyorican kingdom that he was.
That second phase of the Nuyorican Poets Cafe had begun after Piñero, a tragic figure who was very close to Algarín, died in 1988. It was during Piñero’s wake at a funeral home on the Bowery that Algarín, already reeling from the earlier death of Cienfuegos, was approached by Bob Holman, who had been working with the St. Mark’s Poetry Project.
“Bob whispered, ‘Mike is saying, wake up, reopen the cafe,’” Algarín later told me in an interview.
The cafe reopened a little more than a year later, and this time, things would be different.
Under the direction of Algarín and Holman, the cafe expanded its mission, reflecting a time of change in the gentrifying East Village as well as a new era of identity politics. Holman brought in the idea of a competitive poetry slam, which created packed houses and caught the attention of MTV’s “Real Life,” which featured Kevin Powell, a cafe poet, as one of its original cast members. No longer an ethnic-specific venue, the Nuyorican Café embraced proto-hip-hop African American poets, NYU-ish white poets, feminist poets and LGBTQ poets.
Today, spoken word theater is universal, and the legacy of Algarín and the generation that founded the Nuyorican Poets Cafe has stretched across the globe.
In a sense, Algarín — who tested positive for HIV in the late 1980s, writing, “Can it be that I am the bearer of plagues?” in his 1994 poem “HIV” — was the ultimate survivor, outliving most of his contemporaries and maintaining a quiet presence on the Lower East Side, even as the cafe became a nonprofit corporation with a new board of directors. With a seemingly endless expression of varied sexuality, much of his work centered on the body.
As Ishmael Reed wrote in his introduction to the volume of poetry “Love Is Hard Work,” Algarín “believes with García Lorca that the poet is the professor of the five senses.” Ennobled by an unbridled spark that crossed borders, he left a legacy that will live long into the future, his brash street edge now at rest alongside his gentle love for his people.
there is a pleasure in living,there is no shame in beingfull of love
— From “Sunday, August 11, 1974”

CIRAQLI, Azerbaijan — The fate of the people of Ciraqli, in a rural corner of the southern Caucasus, had long been forgotten by the outside world since a war between Azerbaijan and Armenia halted in a cease-fire in 1994. But the conflict never ended for the villagers.
The cease-fire left the two armies facing each other along a front line, barely a few hundred yards apart. Dug in behind big earth berms, the soldiers sporadically traded sniper and artillery rounds for the next 26 years.
And so the people of Ciraqli have lived with war on their doorstep beside their own version of the Berlin Wall.
When Azerbaijan launched an offensive in September to retake territory it lost in the war, Armenian forces replied with a ferocious barrage of missiles that sent most of the villagers fleeing for their lives.
Now that peace has come, negotiated by the Russian government after six weeks of fighting, villagers were back home, picking up the pieces and patching up their roofs with a mixture of weariness and hope.
“It was difficult,” said Vugar Aslanov, 51, one recent afternoon as he cleared debris from a mortar strike on his barn. “Imagine, there is the enemy,” he said, gesturing across his yard.
Black smoke rose from across the fields, where Armenian troops were packing up — and burning buildings — as they prepared to withdraw from the area under the peace deal. “We could not go to the fields or onto the roof of the house because there is very little distance between us and them.”
Stone walls run along the properties on one side of the village, and high mud berms guarded by military lookout posts mark the front line beyond. Several ruined houses stand abandoned in a bare stretch of land that for decades was a no man’s land.
Over the years, the casualties mounted on both sides into the thousands. The International Crisis Group counted more than 1,600 fatal casualties along the 100-mile-long line of contact in sporadic fire in just five years, from 2015 to this year. The majority were military personnel, but 256 were civilians living and farming along the line of contact.
International monitors of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe made visits to the line twice a month, but otherwise there was little mechanism to enforce the 1994 cease-fire.
The front line through Ciraqli village divided family properties and cut farmers off from their fields and the market towns where they sold their produce.
Sveta Bayramova and her husband, Fikret Mamedov, built a wall at the end of their orchard to screen off their home from Armenian lookout posts. Their noisy flock of geese in the garden helped guard against intruders.
Once, in the middle of the night, Bayramova surprised an Armenian military reconnaissance unit scouting out their backyard. Azerbaijani soldiers were creeping up on them, and when she shouted, a shootout broke out. One Armenian soldier was captured, but the rest fled back over the berm.
“I have been living here 28 years, and we did not feel scared a single day,” she said defiantly.
She lost her father in 1994 in the last days of the first war. A sniper shot and killed him as he was driving back from work near the front line, she said.
It took her brother two weeks of searching before he found the car with his father still inside, but her brother was captured and taken prisoner by Armenian soldiers before he could retrieve his body.
Her brother was released, but Bayramova said he never recovered from his ordeal and died of an aneurysm two years later.
His ruined home stands in a buffer zone just beyond her garden wall. Her sister’s house is also in no man’s land, she said. To the right, she pointed out an Armenian guard post atop the earth berm within sight of her wall.
Her siblings and relatives moved away from the village, but she stayed on with her husband, who is a schoolteacher, and they raised three children just yards from the front line.
The Azerbaijani army set up a camp on the edge of the village, and the government helped families build protective walls along the edge of their properties to guard against stray bullets. But the toll continued.
One afternoon in January 2000, Aslanov’s father was herding his sheep and cows in the field by his house. “An Armenian sniper shot him,” Aslanov said. “He was shot under the arm. He lost a lot of blood and died.”
Aslanov, like most men in the village, is a veteran of the first war. He moved with his wife, who is disabled, and their two children to a nearby town when the war flared anew in September.
Those who stayed hunkered in their homes along with a few local police officers, demonstrating a resilient stubbornness.
They survived a monthlong barrage of rocket and mortar fire.
“It was dangerous,” said Hikmet Mamedov, 36, a wiry farmer in a leather jacket, “but why should I leave?” (Several of the villagers bore the same surname but said they were not related.)
In the war that ended in the 1994 cease-fire, Armenian forces seized control of Nagorno-Karabakh — a territory that was populated mostly by ethnic Armenians but legally part of Azerbaijan — and seven surrounding districts. They built extensive defenses against an attack by Azerbaijani forces along this part of the front line because it offered the shortest route to Stepanakert, the capital of Nagorno-Karabakh.
Azerbaijani forces made the main thrust of their attacks on Nagorno-Karabakh in the south and never breached the front line near Ciraqli. But that did not stop the two sides bombarding each other’s positions.
Almost half the village was badly damaged in the recent fighting.
Rovshan Mamedov, 68, stood shocked and barely able to speak as he inspected the burnt-out shell of his home just yards from the front line. “I left 15 minutes before it happened,” he said. “We heard shells coming in, so we left.”
He is now living with his wife and two grown sons in a school in a nearby town with other displaced families. “What can I feel? The most important is that we are alive,” he said.
At the other end of the village, near the small army base, Elman Mamedov and his wife, Parvana, had salvaged their belongings into the only downstairs room that was undamaged. Three rockets had hit the two-story building, crashing through the roof and ceilings into the rooms below.
“Bullets used to come, but we were not expecting bombs,” Parvana Mamedova said.
“Before the war, everything was very nice,” her husband said, looking out from his destroyed front porch. He fought in the war and lost his brother in 1993 in the fighting in the town of Aghdam, a few miles west of the village, he said.
He voiced a quiet satisfaction that the tables had turned. “We are in a different position now,” he said. “The people who left will come back.”
Most of the villagers are small farm holders and were happy that, with the departure of Armenian forces, they would gain access to fields across the front line.
“We are going to have our lands back,” Aslanov said.
“We will celebrate when they have gone,” his son, Sahin Aslanov, 18, added.
Above all, they would welcome the absence of gunfire, Hikmet Mamedov said.
“We are not going to be scared to let our kids outside,” he said. “We saw these wars, but we don’t want our children to see them.”

With the rescheduled Tokyo Olympics approaching in July, Human Rights Watch on Friday demanded that track and field officials halt sex testing of female athletes, describing the practice of measuring and restricting their natural testosterone levels as abusive and harmful.
Sex testing has been a deeply contentious issue in sports for decades, but the dispute has been heightened since 2018, when track and field’s world governing body instituted its latest rules regarding intersex athletes like Caster Semenya of South Africa, a two-time Olympic champion runner at 800 meters. The sport’s regulations have inflamed debates about biological sex, gender identity and fair play.
Semenya and others who have what are called differences of sexual development, or DSDs, are required to suppress naturally elevated testosterone levels — through hormonal therapy or surgery — before competing internationally in women’s running races at distances from the quarter mile to the mile.
World Athletics, track and field’s governing body, acknowledges that the restrictions are discriminatory but says they are necessary to ensure a level playing field.
Semenya, who identifies as a woman and has declined to undergo testosterone suppression, has lost appeals before the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which is based in Switzerland, and the Swiss Supreme Court. Last month, her lawyers said she would take her case to the European Court of Human Rights, though it is unclear if any decision can be reached before the Tokyo Games, scheduled to start July 23. Otherwise, Semenya, 29, has suggested she will try to run the 200, an event free of the recently introduced testosterone restrictions, at the Olympics.
In a 120-page report, New York-based Human Rights Watch amplified with athletes’ voices what critics of the current testosterone regulations have long argued: that they are medically unnecessary and humiliating; encourage coerced medical intervention; can result in physical and psychological injury and the loss of careers; violate fundamental rights to privacy, dignity, health, nondiscrimination and employment; and adhere to standards of femininity that are racially biased, disproportionately affecting women of color from Africa, Asia, Latin America and Oceania.
“Whether it is hormone therapy or surgery, why should a perfectly healthy woman agree to do so to compete in sports?” Francine Niyonsaba of Burundi in East Africa said in an email to The New York Times. She finished second to Semenya in the 800 at the 2016 Olympics and is also affected by the testosterone regulations.
Like Semenya, Niyonsaba has refused to undergo hormone suppression and is training to run the 5,000 meters, a distance at which the biological restrictions do not apply.
“They treat us as if we are cheats,” Niyonsaba said. “We deserve to be respected as athletes, as champions.”
The report was based on interviews last year with 13 female athletes from African and Asian countries, as well as input from lawyers, doctors, academics and medical ethicists. Annet Negesa, an intersex middle-distance runner from Uganda, told researchers that an operation to remove her internal testes was performed in 2012 without her consent. The operation, she said, left her battling headaches and achy joints and ruined her career.
Another athlete, identified by her initials as J.G., said in the report that once she was declared ineligible because of testosterone regulations, she lost her career, could not get a job and struggled to eat. “My life is over,” she said.
Payoshni Mitra, an Indian scholar and athletes’ rights advocate who was a co-author of the report, said in a telephone interview from London that “regulating fair play is understandable. Committing human rights violations in the process is not acceptable. And that is what World Athletics is doing.”
Human Rights Watch called on World Athletics to immediately rescind its testosterone regulations. And it implored the International Olympic Committee to uphold the Olympic Charter, which prohibits discrimination of any kind, and to develop guidelines that meet the standards of international human rights and medical ethics.
In a statement, World Athletics rejected the accusation that biological limits set on athletes competing in certain women’s events were based on race or gender stereotypes. Rather, the governing body said, the testosterone regulations provide “an objective and scientific measure” to preserve equitable competition.
The International Olympic Committee said it was working on inclusivity guidelines to “ensure fairness, safety and nondiscrimination of athletes on the basis of gender identity and sex characteristics.”
A 2017 study, commissioned by World Athletics and later challenged by independent researchers, said that women with DSDs tended to have distinct advantages in races from a quarter mile to a mile, distances that require a combination of speed and endurance.
In 2018, track’s governing body instituted regulations governing female athletes who have a disorder of sexual development and both X and Y chromosomes, the standard male pattern. Intersex athletes with testosterone in the male range, the governing body argued, possess an unfair advantage in lean muscle mass, strength and oxygen-carrying capacity in certain events. The lowest level of testosterone in the typical male range is four times greater than the highest level in the typical female range, according to World Athletics.
But critics of the regulations have contested the science underpinning the World Athletics rules and noted that there was no scientific consensus on the precise impact of testosterone on athletic performance.
In June, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights said that sports officials should revoke regulations regarding intersex athletes. And the World Medical Association last year urged doctors not to implement the regulations, saying they were based “on weak evidence.”
It is a mistake to view this issue in scientific terms alone, said Katrina Karkazis, a co-author of the Human Rights Watch report and a visiting professor of women’s, gender and sexuality studies at Emory University.
“In doing that, you obfuscate or ignore the very real harms done to women,” Karkazis said. “That is the importance of the report.”

JERSEY CITY, N.J. — Of all the toxic dumps in New Jersey, perhaps none was more infamous than PJP Landfill.
It was here, at the edges of the Hackensack River in Jersey City, that underground fires erupted spontaneously for more than a decade, belching acrid smoke so thick it could snarl traffic on an adjacent bridge, the Pulaski Skyway, a key link for commuters to New York City.
Firefighters tried dousing the smoldering land in the mid-1980s with 300,000 gallons of water a day, but residents complained that the spraying did not help.
A reputed mobster who had used the property when it was owned by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Newark even claimed that it was the final resting place of the world’s most notorious Teamster: Jimmy Hoffa.
That was then.
Now, 30 years after the dump was held up as the poster child for toxic nightmares by the New Jersey congressman who wrote the Superfund law, plans for a phoenixlike rebirth await.
It is about to be added to the ranks of wastelands reinvented as wonderlands, joining Fresh Kills on Staten Island, New York, Mount Trashmore in Virginia and Sai Tso Wan Recreation Ground in Hong Kong.
The site, which was designated a Superfund priority in 1983, is being converted into a public park with one of the nation’s first memorials to victims of COVID-19.
As part of a $10 million makeover, more than 500 trees will be planted in a grove of the newly named Skyway Park — one for every Jersey City resident who has died of the coronavirus, the mayor, Steven Fulop, announced Thursday.
Each person’s name will also be included on a memorial wall, giving relatives of the dead a place to mourn. Many families were unable to observe traditional funeral rituals as the pandemic ravaged the Northeast.
“We wanted to do something significant for those families that didn’t get to grieve properly, and we’re taking a step forward in that direction,” Fulop said. “It has been a tough year for the city.”
For Fulop, the pain is personal. His grandmother died of COVID-19, and the City Council lost one of its members, Michael Yun, to the virus in April.
Vernon Richardson, who was an aide to Yun, said the park would “represent the resiliency of the city — everyone from those who died to those who loved them to those who just had a bad 2020.”
The site, polluted by hazardous chemicals when it was used as an industrial landfill in the 1970s, has been remediated and capped to make it safe for visitors, but extra soil will be brought in for planting.
Once the park is complete — likely next summer or fall — walkways will wend along the river, through a pollinator garden and beside green spaces lined with flowers and reedy grasses native to the low-lying wetland area. A pedestrian bridge designed in the image of the Pulaski will connect two sides of the 32-acre site, which is bisected by a stream known as the Sip Avenue Ditch.
A formal COVID-19 memorial installation will be erected beneath the bridge; visitors will be able to walk between the rows of trees on paths that run perpendicular to the main promenade.
“To come into Jersey City from this west side, and to see a grove of trees, is going to be a beautiful thing,” said Mira Prinz-Arey, a Jersey City councilwoman. “It will be improving the quality of life for our residents in the area who have basically no green space at all.”
The idea for the park was planted more than 12 years ago when Bill Matsikoudis, the city’s former top lawyer, proposed buying the property. The $12.7 million purchase was finalized in 2012.
“To see a place that constituted one of the most polluted parcels in the United States of America be returned to nature — a place where trees and wetlands and egrets can make a home — is extraordinary,” said Matsikoudis, who ran for mayor against Fulop, a fellow Democrat, in 2017.
The memorial grove of trees, Matsikoudis added, is “fitting in so many ways.”
“They’re a sign of life,” he said. “They’ll bring oxygen into a community that was choked for so long.”
A public housing complex sits across a four-lane highway from the landfill, at the edge of the Marion neighborhood, a historically Italian enclave.
Decades ago, neighbors held community meetings and demonstrations, demanding action that eventually paved the way for emergency funds that were used to put out the fires for good.
On Thursday, as politicians and environmentalists gathered next to the river, they invoked that past and noted that the wheels of environmental justice often turn slowly.
“In a sad way,” said Bill O’Dea, a Hudson County commissioner who was on the Jersey City City Council in the 1980s, “you have to wait 35 years to see the end of that process.”
The park is a key element of a longer-term goal: creating a walkway along the Hackensack River that would stretch more than 10 miles from Bayonne north to Secaucus. A similar planned walkway, the Hudson Essex Greenway, would connect Jersey City, Secaucus, Kearny, Newark, Belleville, Bloomfield, Glen Ridge and Montclair.
Bill Sheehan, who leads the Hackensack Riverkeeper, a nonprofit environmental group, noted the importance of creating open vistas in communities crowded with tall buildings. Eagles, he said, now nest in nearby Kearny.
“When I was a little boy living in Jersey City, the idea of an eagle anywhere near Jersey City was totally off the rails,” Sheehan said. “Today we’ve got eagles; we’ve got plenty of fish in the river.”
Still, the site’s industrial past is never far from mind.
The Pulaski’s 3.5-mile black-steel span and smokestacks from a power plant across the river dominate the horizon. Planes headed to and from nearby Newark Liberty International Airport leave streaks of smoky white entrails in the sky. The adjacent lots hold an imposing distribution warehouse and an e-commerce company.
And, just maybe, Hoffa’s grave.
Phillip (Brother) Moscato, a reputed member of the Genovese crime family who grew up in Jersey City’s Marion section and died in 2014, reportedly said in interviews that Hoffa was buried in a plot under the Skyway, inside a 55-gallon drum. The body of the Teamsters union boss, who disappeared in 1975 near Detroit, has never been found.
A half-mile away, a large sculpture of a man holding a rolled-up green carpet stands in the shadow of the Skyway’s on-ramp, an image made famous by its appearance in the opening credits of the HBO Mafia hit “The Sopranos.”
Steve Krinsky, chairman of the Skyway Park Conservancy, said it was time to bury that sordid chapter for good.
“Someday soon, Skyway Park will be an open, natural area along the shores of this awesome and cleaner-than-ever river, a part of the rebirth of the green coast of Jersey City, a stop along the Hackensack River Walkway and a world-class park,” Krinsky said.
“Today is only the first step.”

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
NAPLES, Italy — Six years ago, Stéphane Lissner left Milan after a decade managing Italy’s most famous opera house, the Teatro alla Scala, to run the Paris Opera.
After a turbulent term, he left his Parisian post in March, nine months early, frustrated by widespread social unrest in France, strikes over an unpopular national pension reform plan and unproductive talks with the theater’s powerful unions. The pandemic was the proverbial last straw.
Now German impresario Alexander Neef has taken over in Paris, and Lissner is back in Italy, leading the Teatro di San Carlo, opened in 1737 and the country’s oldest opera house — and one of its most beautiful.
The pandemic, of course, upended the season in Naples, too, though this summer Lissner managed to stage “Tosca” and “Aida” in concert, as well as Beethoven’s “Ninth Symphony” in the majestic Piazza del Plebiscito, next to the theater.
In an interview in his airy office at the theater, Lissner said his 10 years at La Scala had been “the most interesting of my life.” But after only a few months, he added, Naples felt like home.
He said he was particularly impressed by the strong attachment the city’s residents felt to their opera house: 80% of the San Carlo’s season ticket holders had renewed their subscriptions for the 2020-21 season, even though it sometimes looked like it would never take place.
After two aborted attempts, that season is set to finally open with Mascagni’s “Cavalleria Rusticana,” starring Elina Garanca and Jonas Kaufmann. The performance, recorded on Monday in an empty house because of coronavirus restrictions, will be broadcast over Facebook until Monday for about one euro. (It will then be available for a week through the theater’s website.)
The partnership with that social media giant is part of Lissner’s vision for his tenure here: He wants to create a “social and digital theater,” broadening the San Carlo’s appeal to a potentially limitless audience.
In the interview, he discussed his online ambitions, whether vaccination for operagoers should be mandatory and what went wrong in Paris. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation.
Q: Do you think that the pandemic will have a long-term impact on the Teatro di San Carlo?
A: The future will be very different, and I am convinced that it will no longer be possible for a theater to be passive, waiting for the public, even with a great program. So in the future I see two aspects that are not contradictory but actually complementary: Live performances, as the mission of a public theater; and, alongside this, there’s the digital part.
Starting in March or April we will have our own production studio inside the theater. We will create our own productions, but also be open to artists, philosophers, authors, architects and photographers, giving them the possibility to create content about Naples, the San Carlo, history, music, the city.
We want to reach and dialogue with people who don’t normally come to the theater, who don’t live in Naples. This is the future. The world is changing.
But this will never replace live performances. They will continue, as they have since the time of Greek theater.
Q: You left Paris before you were supposed to, and began working full time in Naples as soon as the pandemic restrictions allowed travel. Did that impact your first months here?
A: The 2020-21 season was already set, even though productions had to be canceled, so 2021-22 will be my first real season.
Everyone tells me, “Lissner, you can take some risks” — this city has shown it is open to today’s artists. For my first season, I have invited the directors Damián Szifron, Dmitri Tcherniakov and Barrie Kosky.
I think we will start performing in front of a live audience again in May, June or July. Perhaps the entire theater won’t be filled. What scares me is that I read that 60% of French people don’t want to be vaccinated.
Q: Many Italians are skeptical of the vaccine, too.
A: If that is true, then it will be very complicated. Will people who haven’t been vaccinated be able to enter the theater? To reassure people, one would have to say no. Otherwise people won’t come. It’s a problem.
Q: Why did you leave Paris early?
A: Starting with the yellow vest protests, the theater was destroyed. Socially, it was chaos; I couldn’t work. Then the pension reform and a three-month strike, and then COVID arrived. So in the last period, I wasn’t able to work. The situation was really too difficult.
And then there was the political turnover and, let’s say, we had differing ideas. So it was better that I left early. My ideas for the theater are what they are. But the director is chosen by the President of the Republic, and often, when another arrives. …
It worked out for the best, because my successor could come immediately and do things he wanted to. We’re in a moment of great difficulty. It’s a moment in which decisions have to be made, and these are taken with political counterparts, so you have to get along.
And then the San Carlo proposal came along, which I liked very much. Perhaps without COVID, without all these questions, things would have been different, and I would have remained to the end of my contract.
Q: Why did things get so bad with the unions?
A: The union at the Paris Opera has never signed an accord, even positive accords. It didn’t even sign the accord on parity between men and women. It never signs anything.
This union has really harmed the Paris Opera. It cares less and less about defending the workers. It has become more political, ideological. And if the union is only ideological, then the boss is always bad, and the union is always good. But it’s not like this.
If you take an ideological, contrarian position on everything, against management, the theater doesn’t move forward.
Q: Do you have any advice for Alexander Neef, your successor?
A: I think that reform is necessary, that’s for sure. Both from the point of view of governance, which I think doesn’t function any more, and from the point of view of the organization of labor. Because you can’t manage a theater today the way you did 30 years ago.

Texto completo: ST. PETERSBURG  Rays top prospect Wander Franco has no structural injury, and the team says it has no long-term concerns about the shoulder and biceps issues that sidelined him during winter ball.

But to be sure there are no lingering issues heading into next season, the Rays wont allow Franco to resume playing in his native Dominican Republic.

The shortstop experienced shoulder soreness, as well as biceps inflammation, after playing five games for Leones del Escogido. When a weeks rest didnt help, and after an initial exam, the Rays had him fly back to St. Petersburg last week.

A further examination by team orthopedist Dr. Koco Eaton and an MRI exam revealed no structural injury and no long-term concerns, the team said Thursday.

But the Rays also announced that to ensure he remains fully healthy heading into the 2021 season, Franco would not rejoin Escogido, for whom he was to play at least three weeks.

Wander was cleared to resume activities, said Carlos Rodriguez, Rays vice president of player development and international scouting. In talking it over with him, we felt it was best for him to focus on preparing for the 2021 season rather than continuing with winter ball.

Franco wrote, as part of an Instagram post translated from Spanish, I couldnt complete all I wanted to due to discomfort in the shoulder, but I would like to be there and continue supporting them, but the organization has already stopped me, I wish my lions good luck, I will continue supporting them from afar.

Franco, the consensus top prospect in the game, was playing in his first competitive games since a brief winter-ball stint last year. He hit .350 (7-for-20) with one homer, two RBIs and a .935 OPS in the five games.

He played at Class A in 2019, then spent 2020 as part of the Rays 60-man player pool working out at the alternate site in Port Charlotte. He traveled with the Rays to San Diego and Arlington, Texas, as part of the postseason pool but was not activated at any point, though he benefited from the experience and the exposure.

Franco played in his first big-league, spring training games in February. He said at the time he hoped to join the Rays sometime during the 2020 season so he could reach the majors as a teenager. While that didnt happen, he has his sights set on reaching the big leagues in 2021.

General manager Erik Neander said Francos potential is obvious to all who see him play, but a spot in the majors is not something thats just going to be handed to him because hes a No. 1 prospect.

Ex-Ray gives his side of White House incident

The husband of White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said he happily would have worn a mask during her briefing if asked.

Former Rays reliever Sean Gilmartin said he would have happily put on a mask if asked during Wednesdays White House press briefing, adding there was no altercation with a newspaper photographer over the issue.

Gilmartin was at the White House to watch his wife, press secretary and Tampa native McEnany, deliver a briefing  the first time, he said, he had the opportunity to do so. The official press pool report included an item  with the description, Incident after WH briefing in the header field  about Gilmartin being told by a New York Times photographer that masks were required.

On Thursday, Gilmartin offered this version of events to the Tampa Bay Times via email:

During the entirety of the briefing, I was never asked to wear a mask by anyone. When the briefing concluded, a New York Times photographer loudly said to wear a mask next time after I had passed him and when I was a few steps from exiting the room. There were no words spoken by me in response to his statement. If the photographer had asked me to wear a mask during the two times he passed me during the briefing, I would have happily obliged.

Gilmartin, 30, who played at FSU and was a first-round pick by the Braves in 2011, pitched for the Rays during the 2020 season, making two appearances during the season. He was part of the postseason roster pool but not active and is now a free agent.

Rays sign former Orioles right-hander

Right-hander David Hess, who spent parts of the past three seasons with the Orioles, was signed to a minor-league contract. Hess, 27, made his debut in May 2018 (against the Rays), going 3-10, 4.88 in 21 games (19 starts) and then 1-10, 7.09 in 23 games (14 starts) in 2019. He spent most of 2020 at the Orioles alternate camp site, making three relief appearances. Overall, he is 4-20, 5.86 in 47 major-league games, allowing 210 hits (51 homers) and 69 walks in 190 innings while striking out 143.

MINOR-LEAGUE CLUB FILES SUIT VS. YANKEES: The Staten Island (N.Y.) Yankees said they are shutting down operations and have filed a lawsuit against the major-league Yankees and Major League Baseball to hold those entities accountable for false promises. The Yankees announced on Nov. 7 that they were moving the short-season Class A affiliate in the New York-Penn League from Staten Island to Hudson Valley, N.Y., for the 2021 season. In a statement released Thursday, the Staten Island club said it still had not heard from the Yankees directly: It would appear from their (Nov. 7) press release that they would like us to go from the past arrangement in which the Staten Island Yankees were an affiliated minor-league team of the New York Yankees  to one in which we play unaffiliated baseball with no relationship to the Yankees whatsoever. The Staten Island club said the expense required to pay the players and staff for such a team, as well as the cut ties with the Yankees, makes it impossible for the Staten Island Yankees to pursue this business model.

A Jobs Report Without Silver Linings

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
The bad news in the November jobs numbers reported Friday isn’t in the rate of job creation, although that was pretty bad.
U.S. employers added only 245,000 positions last month, and even if you adjust for the one-time effects of temporary census jobs being eliminated, it would take 29 more months to return to February employment levels at that rate of job creation. But at least there is good reason to expect those numbers to improve once coronavirus vaccines are widely available.
The thing that is most worrying is what seems to be happening among the people who have lost their jobs because of the pandemic. The jobs report offers clues that what was once temporary unemployment is becoming more permanent — in ways that, if unchecked, could do long-term damage to millions of families and to the economic potential of the United States.
Although the unemployment rate fell last month, to 6.7% from 6.9%, it was for the worst of reasons: Many Americans gave up even looking for work. The number of adults not in the labor force — neither working nor actively seeking work — rose by 560,000, as the labor force participation rate dropped by 0.2 percentage points.
The share of prime working-age Americans working — those between 25 and 54 — was unchanged in November at 76% and remains far below its 80.5% share in February. The number of people who are not in the labor force but say they want a job is 2.2 million higher than it was in February.
A growing share of the unemployed have been out of work for a long time. The number of Americans unemployed for more than 27 weeks rose by 385,000 in November. Since only September, the number of these long-term unemployed is up by a devastating 1.5 million people — a 64% increase.
Put those numbers together, and the pattern is clear: Many people who lost jobs in the spring have been without work continuously since then, and some of them have given up looking.
A central lesson of the grinding recovery that followed the 2008-09 recession is that these prolonged periods of unemployment (people actively seeking a job) or nonemployment (not working, and also not looking) have long-term effects.
Even as the economy recovered, people had experienced various forms of damage. Some people’s skills became outdated. But more generally, many people just lost a sense of attachment to the workforce. It’s much harder to find a job when you’ve been out of work for years than when you’ve been on a short-term layoff.
And that’s before you get to the more social dimensions of the problem; those out of the workforce can become more likely to develop addictions or mental health problems. The nonemployment crisis of the 2010s and the opioid crisis of the 2010s weren’t completely separate.
In that episode, the share of prime-age Americans who were employed did not return to its January 2008 level until August 2019! When economists talk about what a slow, disappointing expansion that was, this is a big part of what they are referring to.
There is a good chance to avoid that fate in the recovery from the pandemic recession. A quick snapback in employment after widespread vaccination is possible in 2021, and it could pull many of those long-term unemployed and nonemployed back into the workforce quickly, after only a year or so of detachment from the rhythms of work life.
This is normally the point in analyzing a bad jobs report where one points out silver linings — those little reasons for optimism that are hiding if you know where to look.
This month, they are hard to find.
The data in the new numbers are based on employment levels in the week of Nov. 8-14. Various real-time data sources point to a softening in economic activity since then, as coronavirus infections have risen and weather has turned colder, limiting outdoor dining and retail options. December employment numbers could well be worse.
For a slight hint of optimism, one of the big categories of job loss that dragged down the November numbers will probably reverse. Retailers cut about 35,000 jobs, according to the official numbers, which are adjusted for the typical seasonal patterns. But if you ignore those seasonal adjustments, the sector added 302,000 jobs — stores did do holiday hiring, just less than past experience would have predicted.
The good news, such as it is, is that in January this pattern should reverse itself, creating an apparent employment surge when seasonal adjustments are applied.
In a miserable November for U.S. workers, this is what counts as a cause for optimism: The people who weren’t hired as temporary help at retailers this holiday season won’t lose their jobs in January.
But the real hope for 2021 is that enough of the unemployed and nonemployed Americans can come back to work quickly enough that the long-lasting effects of that last scarring downturn can be prevented.

NEW YORK — The streets were still dark when two deputy U.S. marshals knocked on the door of a modest brick residence in the Wakefield section of the Bronx on Friday morning.
The marshals had spent days trying to locate Andre Sterling, a 35-year-old man wanted in connection with the shooting of a state trooper in Massachusetts two weeks ago.
The marshals had tracked Sterling to the two-story building on Ely Avenue in the Bronx, where he was possibly staying with a friend, a law enforcement official said, speaking anonymously to discuss an open investigation. When the marshals knocked at 5:30 a.m., an unknown man opened the door and invited them inside.
Moments later, gunfire shattered the quiet morning. Sterling had emerged from another part of the home and opened fire, the official said, striking two of the marshals and touching off a shootout that left four people injured and Sterling dead.
One of the marshals was wounded in the leg, the other in the leg and arm, according to a statement from the U.S. Marshals Service. A New York Police Department detective was also injured when he fell while carrying one of the wounded deputies to a police car.
Sterling was killed as he exchanged fire with the deputies, the official said. The other man, who answered the door, suffered a head injury but was expected to survive.
The marshals had been searching for Sterling because authorities in Massachusetts had issued an arrest warrant for him, seeking to charge him for the shooting of a rookie state trooper on Cape Cod last month.
In that incident, Sterling was pulled over in a stolen car by the young trooper around 11:30 p.m. near the village of Hyannis, the Massachusetts State Police said.
Sterling brandished a gun and fired, striking the trooper, John Lennon, the state police said. The bullet went through Lennon’s hand and hit his bulletproof vest. Although seriously injured, the trooper recovered after several days in a Boston hospital.
The shooting touched off an interstate manhunt for Sterling, whom authorities described as “armed and dangerous.”
Investigators found evidence leading them to the Bronx and determined that Sterling might be staying at the house on Ely Avenue, the Massachusetts State Police said in a statement. Four state troopers from Massachusetts were present during the predawn operation.
Sterling, a native of Jamaica, was also wanted on two other warrants in Massachusetts, including one for identity theft, as well as a narcotics charge in Wyoming, state police in Massachusetts said.
It remained unclear Friday if Sterling had a permanent residence.
Residents in the working-class neighborhood where the shootout happened woke up to the sounds of helicopters hovering above the street, which is lined mostly with single-family homes.
Jimmy Wright, 77, said he “knew right away they were looking for somebody” when loud sirens startled him early in the morning.
“The helicopters were flying up and down the street,” Wright said. “I knew something was not right.”
Noel Murray, 67, said he was waking up when he heard what sounded like four gunshots. The sound of sirens then filled the neighborhood, he said, as numerous police officers and ambulances arrived.
“This is usually a quiet neighborhood,” he said. “You don’t see this every day.”
Israel Quiñones, 50, who lives near the building on Ely Avenue, said she also woke up to the sound of gunfire and saw several officers running down the avenue. “I closed my curtain and made sure no bullets were coming this way,” she said.
Later in the morning, police lights were still flashing in front of the house where Sterling was killed. Police officers canvassed the street and sealed off several blocks.
Another local resident, Sandra Thomas, who lives on Edenwald Avenue, shook her head in dismay. “Everyone is in shock,” she said.

Press Herald to partner with Boston Globe on Spotlight project

Texto completo: The Portland Press Herald will partner with The Boston Globe next year for the Globe's Spotlight Fellowship, joining forces to produce a multi-part investigative report that will be published on both companies' websites and newspapers.
Penelope Overton, who covers the lobster industry for the Press Herald, will be the lead reporter for the project, which may involve other journalists from both newsrooms, including photographers, designers and editors.
The Globe has also selected Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter Sarah Ryley of New York to work with the Spotlight Team as a Spotlight Fellow.
"We had an extraordinary group of applicants this year, but these two stood out," said Scott Allen, the Globe's assistant managing editor for projects and one of the judges who selected the fellows. "Penny brings a wealth of experience and a powerful instinct for finding the real story, while Sarah is one of the most capable young investigative journalists in the country."
The Spotlight Fellowship, entering its sixth year, is funded by Participant, co-producer of "Spotlight," the Academy Award-winning movie about the Globe's famed Spotlight Team. The movie tells the story of the team's best-known investigation, exposing how bishops and cardinals in the Catholic Archdiocese of Boston covered up the sexual molestation of thousands of children by priests.
"The work that past Spotlight Fellows have done - and that this year's Fellows will certainly do - has been critically important to holding powerful institutions and individuals to account," said David Linde, CEO of Participant. "We're so proud to stand alongside these journalists in their mission to right wrongs and speak truth to power."
The collaboration with the Press Herald represents a first for the fellowship program, which allows fellows to work with Spotlight reporters and editors on a project of their choice. This time, the Globe will be teaming up with another newsroom, combining resources to produce an ambitious project of great import to the region and compelling interest nationally.
Overton, a Yale University graduate, has been a journalist for more than two decades, the last four at Maine's largest newspaper, where she covers the state's $1.4 billion lobster industry as well as the growing recreational marijuana industry. The New York Times Magazine once described her as a "fresh faced, but dogged investigative reporter."
"We're thrilled about the opportunity to team up with The Boston Globe," said Press Herald managing editor Steve Greenlee, who spent 12 years as an editor at the Globe before moving to Portland. "Pairing one of our best reporters with the Globe's top investigative journalists will help us elevate our work to an even higher level. We can't wait to get started."
The Press Herald will assign another reporter to temporarily cover the lobster and cannabis beats while Overton works with Spotlight.
Ryley, who will work directly with the Spotlight Team on a second project, won the 2017 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service for her series with the New York Daily News and ProPublica on the New York Police Department's use of the nuisance abatement law to drive people from their homes and business. Her investigation led to sweeping reforms. She has also reported for outlets such as the New York Times Opinion Video and BuzzFeed News, and has been recognized with a total of 23 awards and honors.
"I feel fortunate to have someone as talented as Sarah Ryley joining us this coming year," said Spotlight Team editor Patty Wen, who was also one of the judges. "She brings superb data-gathering and interviewing skills and seems like such a team player too. She will clearly be such an asset."
Past Spotlight Fellowships have produced groundbreaking work, including "Secrets in the sky" by Jaimi Dowdell and Kelly Carr, and "The danger in our salad bowls," by Christine Haughney. The Globe will soon publish a new investigation by Spotlight Fellow Mike Stanton. For more information about the fellowship program, go to spotlightfellowship.com.

Texto completo: The New York Times National Desk asked state poets laureate for some words of gratitude. We got a blizzard of lovely poetry in response.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
Many years ago, after covering a dreary meeting of the New Hampshire House Ways and Means Committee, I found myself struggling to craft a compelling story about state taxes and revenue forecasts. With deadline looming, an editor in my small newsroom offered this dispiriting advice: "We're not looking for poetry here. Just bang it out."
A few weeks back, Marc Lacey, The New York Times's national editor, had a contrary and more uplifting idea: What if we actually went looking for some poetry?
As an assistant editor on the desk, I wrote to the nation's many state poets laureate -- nearly every state has one -- and asked them to provide us with some words of gratitude in a relentlessly difficult year. What did the residents of their particular states have to be thankful for?
I harbored some skepticism. Would poets turn up their noses at a tight newspaper deadline and a 100-word limit? No, as it turns out. Most were happy to help bring a little positivity to Times readers.
The nation's poets laureate have a real sense of mission. They aim to encourage an appreciation for poetry, to challenge us, to generate some buzz for the art form. That has required more effort and ingenuity during the coronavirus pandemic. And so, like firefighters waiting in a quiet station for the call to duty, they embraced the Times assignment quickly and wholeheartedly.
"Poetry is spirit and can't be stopped by calamity," noted Grace Cavalieri, the poet laureate of Maryland. She reported that poetry is actually thriving online during the pandemic, at least in her corner of the world: "I was asked to do a remote poetry workshop for horse therapy participants. A first for poetry."
Many poets laureate serve two- or three-year terms and are eager to make the most of their short tenures, traveling their states (in ordinary times), giving readings, teaching classes, composing poems for special events. A rare few are appointed for life. Larry Woiwode, for example, has been the poet laureate of North Dakota for a quarter century. In North Carolina, the poet laureate Jaki Shelton Green told me, the state switched from lifetime appointments to short terms in an effort to diversify the voices on the public stage.
In their Times pieces, the writers gave thanks for some phenomena specific to their states -- "proximity to water, August at Narragansett Beach, / and lobster," in Rhode Island, for instance. But there were also many common threads: gratitude for natural wonders, for neighbors, family and health care workers, for health itself.
Pulling the project together was not without drama, though.
Illinois, for instance, had been without a poet laureate since 2017. We received quite a good submission from the former laureate, but then came an urgent call from Chicago. Gov. J.B. Pritzker would be naming a new poet laureate on Monday, Nov. 23, an aide assured me -- ample time to include her in our story on Thanksgiving Day. But Monday came and went with no announcement. Tuesday, too. Finally Wednesday arrived and with it a new bard for Illinois: Angela Jackson, just in the nick of time.
Some poets were tricky to track down. The writer from Vermont has no email address. But her friend, the poet laureate of Rhode Island, knew her phone number and sent her a text message to make sure she had received our query.
The poet from Oregon, much like every never-satisfied reporter in the world, kept finessing his poem, even as our deadline crept closer. One poet worried she might have contracted the coronavirus, but she still managed to send a submission.
Jeanetta Calhoun Mish submitted a poem in plenty of time, but something about her ode to Oklahoma set off the suspicion of the Times email system and it landed in my spam folder, hidden from view. "This message seems dangerous," my computer warned, when I finally tracked it down. We quickly added her piece -- not scary at all -- to our collection after its initial publication.
Shawn Hubler, a national correspondent based in California, artfully wove together a story about the three dozen submissions we collected, highlighting some of the most evocative language and ideas, like the one from Beth Ann Fennelly of Mississippi, who was "grateful to be counted on: One Mississippi, Two. Grateful for the word y'all. Grateful for the emphatic all y'all."
Clinton Cargill, another assistant editor on the National desk, commissioned several lovely illustrations to accompany the story. And Carrie Mifsud, a designer, created a graceful two-page spread for the Thanksgiving Day newspaper.
The result: On a day that also included alarming news about the pandemic, shrunken holiday plans and ceaseless squabbling about an election already weeks in the past, Times readers also got a large helping of poetry to make it all go down a bit more easily. Even in a post-pandemic world, this might be a terrific tradition to continue.

Texto completo: Five transit employees put in claims for 'almost physically impossible' shifts, a prosecutor said. That allowed them to outearn even New York's governor.
One night two years ago, Thomas Caputo, a senior track worker for the Long Island Rail Road, put in for 15 hours of overtime for work he said he had done at the West Side Yard in Manhattan. His shift began at 4 p.m. and ended at 7 o'clock the next morning.
But, the authorities say, Mr. Caputo was somewhere else that evening: at a bowling alley in Patchogue, N.Y., more than 55 miles away, where he bowled three games, averaging a score of 196.
He took home an overtime payment of $ 1,217, the government said.
Mr. Caputo was one of five current and former employees of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority charged on Thursday with participating in an overtime fraud scheme that allowed them to become among the highest-paid employees at the agency, federal prosecutors in Manhattan said.
The defendants, who worked at the Long Island Rail Road and New York City Transit, frequently volunteered for lucrative overtime shifts and later claimed they had worked when they were in fact at home or other nonwork locations, or even on vacation, the prosecutors said.
Audrey Strauss, the acting U.S. attorney in Manhattan, said the scheme involved claims for "extraordinary, almost physically impossible, amounts of overtime."
Mr. Caputo, 56, who retired in 2019 after three decades with the railroad, was listed in 2018 as the highest paid M.T.A. employee with total pay of more than $ 461,000, including about $ 344,000 in overtime. All five defendants each earned more than the salary of the M.T.A. chairman or Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who oversees the agency.
A lawyer for Mr. Caputo did not respond to a message from a reporter seeking comment. Mr. Caputo had been the railroad's chief measurement officer, leading a crew on a track geometry car that inspects the rails to identify areas that need repairs.
In 2018, according to a criminal complaint unsealed on Thursday, Mr. Caputo claimed to have worked 3,864 overtime hours, on top of 1,682 regular hours.
If he had worked every single day that year (which he did not), the complaint said, his claims would average about 10 hours of overtime each day for the entire year, beyond his regular 40-hour workweek.
Another defendant, Michael Gundersen, 42, a maintenance-of-way supervisor at New York City Transit, was accused of reporting he had worked long shifts in March 2018, for which he was paid $ 2,481. But evidence showed that at the same time, he had hotel reservations in Atlantic City and tickets for concerts there on successive nights, a second complaint charged.
During other periods that Mr. Gundersen was paid thousands of dollars for claimed overtime, he was on vacation in Williamsburg, Virginia, participating in a 5K footrace in New Jersey, and on a family vacation at a resort in the Hudson Valley, the complaint said. Mr. Gunderson's lawyer declined to comment.
Mr. Caputo and the four other defendants each earned more than $ 348,000 total in 2018, the authorities said. The others ranked fourth, fifth, 11th and 12th that year in pay among all M.T.A. employees.
The charges come at a time when the authority is confronting its worst financial crisis because of the pandemic and a stalemate over federal aid. Without a financial bailout, the agency has said that it will have to slash subway and bus service and that more than 9,000 workers could lose their jobs.
In a news conference on Thursday in the State Capitol, Mr. Cuomo noted that the five individuals charged represented a tiny fraction of the M.T.A.'s work force, saying that there were "bad apples" in every profession. He said the M.T.A. needed to have systems in place to monitor its employees and their bills.
Still, he said, "You will never eradicate all bad actors in any system."
The U.S. attorney's office investigated the scheme with the F.B.I. and the transportation authority's inspector general.
"This type of double-dealing directly contributes to rising M.T.A. fares for the average, hardworking commuter," said William F. Sweeney Jr., head of the F.B.I.'s New York office.
Tim Minton, a spokesman for the transportation authority, said, "The alleged conduct by these M.T.A. employees is an egregious betrayal of public trust."
He said the agency had undertaken aggressive overtime controls, which had resulted in a reduction of $ 105 million in overtime in 2019 alone.
The M.T.A. would "continue to root out waste, fraud and abuse wherever it occurs," Mr. Minton said, "and will continue cooperating fully with this critically important investigation."
The three other defendants were Joseph Ruzzo, 56, a retired Long Island Rail Road track foreman; and John Nugent, 50, and Joseph Balestra, 51, who are still working as track foremen.
Mr. Ruzzo's lawyer declined to comment. Mr. Nugent's lawyer, William Wexler, said his client denied "that he wrongfully obtained any monies from the rail road." Mr. Balestra's attorney, John LoTurco, said his client "vehemently denies all charges" and "adamantly asserts his innocence."
The New York Times reported in May 2019 that the prosecutors had subpoenaed pay records for Mr. Caputo and more than a dozen other employees at the Long Island Rail Road and New York City Transit.
The huge overtime payments made to Mr. Caputo and other M.T.A. employees were revealed a month earlier by the Empire Center for Public Policy, a conservative think tank in Albany. Its research showed that 33 M.T.A. employees earned more than $ 300,000 in 2018, with almost all receiving large amounts of overtime pay.
Each defendant was charged with one count of federal program fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years.
The charges come more than a decade after the Long Island Rail Road was caught up in a scandal over disability payments. A New York Times investigation had found that nearly every career employee who retired received a disability pension, even though many continued to lead active lives. More than 30 people -- railroad workers, doctors and a union official -- pleaded guilty to federal fraud charges.

Texto completo: A disclosure sheds new light on a high-profile national security law as lawmakers prepare to revive a debate over it in the Biden administration.
WASHINGTON -- The government has interpreted a high-profile provision of the Patriot Act as empowering F.B.I. national security investigators to collect logs showing who has visited particular web pages, documents show.
But the government stops short of using that law to collect the keywords people submit to internet search engines because it considers such terms to be content that requires a warrant to gather, according to letters produced by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.
The disclosures come at a time when Congress is struggling with new proposals to limit the law, known as Section 215 of the Patriot Act. The debate ran aground in the spring amid erratic messages from President Trump, but is expected to resume after President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. takes the oath of office in January.
Enacted after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, Section 215 of the Patriot Act permits the F.B.I. to obtain a secret court order to collect any business records deemed relevant to a national security inquiry -- a very easy standard for investigators to meet. The legal authority for it and two other surveillance-related investigative tools lapsed for new inquiries earlier this year, although the F.B.I. can still use them for pre-existing cases.
Section 215 has been at the center of repeated fights over the balance between empowering national security investigators to detect potential threats and preserving Americans' privacy and freedom to read what they want or call other people without fear of government observation. In the Bush years, civil liberties advocates raised alarms over the possibility that the F.B.I. might use it to monitor people's library records. In 2013, an uproar erupted over the disclosure that the National Security Agency had been secretly using it to collect bulk logs of all Americans' phone calls.
Demands to ban using Section 215 for library records gradually faded -- it appeared that in practice, the F.B.I. was not using it to monitor what books people had checked out -- and Congress ended the use of Section 215 for bulk collection of calling data in 2015. But new tensions have emerged over the extent to which the F.B.I. could use that law to gather logs of people's web browsing activities, as opposed to using warrants -- a tool that requires investigators to first be able to produce evidence that a person probably engaged in wrongdoing.
In May, 59 senators voted to bar the use of Section 215 to collect internet search terms or web browsing activity, but negotiations broke down in the House. During that period, Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon and one of the sponsors of the proposal ban, wrote to the director of national intelligence seeking clarity about any such use.
Six months later, the Trump administration finally replied -- initially, it turned out, in a misleading way.
In a Nov. 6 letter to Mr. Wyden, John Ratcliffe, the intelligence director, wrote that Section 215 was not used to gather internet search terms, and that none of the 61 orders issued last year under that law by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court involved collection of "web browsing" records.
Mr. Wyden's office provided that letter to The New York Times, arguing that it meant Mr. Wyden's proposal in May -- which he sponsored with Senator Steve Daines, Republican of Montana -- could be enacted into law without any operational costs.
But The Times pressed Mr. Ratcliffe's office and the F.B.I. to clarify whether it was defining "web browsing" activity to encompass logging all visitors to a particular website, in addition to a particular person's browsing among different sites. The next day, the Justice Department sent a clarification to Mr. Ratcliffe's office, according to a follow-up letter he sent to Mr. Wyden on Nov. 25.
In fact, "one of those 61 orders resulted in the production of information that could be characterized as information regarding browsing," Mr. Ratcliffe wrote in the second letter. Specifically, one order had approved collection of logs revealing which computers "in a specified foreign country" had visited "a single, identified U.S. web page."
Mr. Ratcliffe expressed regret "that this additional information was not included in my earlier letter" to the senator, and suggested his staff might take further "corrective action."
In a statement, Mr. Wyden said the letters raise "all kinds of new questions, including whether, in this particular case, the government has taken steps to avoid collecting Americans' web browsing information."
"More generally," Mr. Wyden continued, "the D.N.I. has provided no guarantee that the government wouldn't use the Patriot Act to intentionally collect Americans' web browsing information in the future, which is why Congress must pass the warrant requirement that has already received support from a bipartisan majority in the Senate."
Neither Mr. Ratcliffe's office nor the F.B.I. answered The Times's follow-up questions, such as whether the bureau had used the law to gather website visitor logs or other types of web browsing data before 2019 or in 2020 -- and if so, whether such information was collected without trying to filter out Americans' data.
The disclosure that the government has used Section 215 to gather logs of visitors to a web page may shed additional light on a fight in May between two factions of House Democrats over the law, before the legislative process collapsed.
The Wyden-Daines amendment had fallen one vote short of the supermajority it needed to be attached to the bill in the Senate. But similarly minded lawmakers in the House then sought to vote on attaching the same language to the bill in their chamber.
The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, instructed two Democrats from California -- the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Representative Adam B. Schiff, and a proponent of greater privacy limits on surveillance, Representative Zoe Lofgren -- to negotiate over a narrowed version of the proposal.
Mr. Schiff and Ms. Lofgren tentatively agreed on language that would bar the use of Section 215 to collect Americans' web browsing data and search terms. But while privacy advocates initially supported the compromise, they withdrew their backing after Mr. Schiff put forward an interpretation suggesting that it would leave the government, while investigating foreign threats, able to gather Americans' data as long as that was not its specific intention.
Debates in Congress over the wording of laws that govern classified surveillance-related techniques and abilities are often opaque, and the lawmakers participating in the May debate were not explicit about the crux of their disagreement.
But it appeared to fit a dispute over where to draw the line in preventing the government from ever collecting Americans' web browsing data using Section 215, and preserving its ability to develop investigative leads about foreigners by logging visitors to suspicious websites even if sometimes domestic users' data may get swept up too. The government cannot know ahead of time whom it will catch in such a net, and there is no foolproof way to screen out American users, computer experts say.
Asked whether Mr. Schiff had been trying to preserve that ability for national security investigators, as Mr. Ratcliffe's letter revealed they have done at least once, a Democratic official on the House Intelligence Committee said, "Schiff's efforts were not based on preserving any specific program or use, but rather balancing legitimate privacy interests and the need to maintain capabilities that are critical to national security."
Even as Mr. Schiff's and Ms. Lofgren's compromise was breaking down, Mr. Trump further disrupted the negotiations by abruptly urging Republicans to vote against the bill until the Justice Department's Russia inquiry was more fully investigated. (The bill also contained changes to national security wiretapping laws in response to findings that the F.B.I. had botched applications to wiretap a former Trump campaign adviser as part of the inquiry.)
With support bleeding away from both the left and right flanks, Ms. Pelosi punted and sent the legislation to a House-Senate conference committee for further negotiations. But without any coherent signal from Mr. Trump about what would avoid his veto, the Republican Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, appointed no members to the panel -- permitting Section 215 to remain lapsed until negotiations resumed under a new president.

Texto completo: The Trump administration's announcement sets the stage for leases to be in the hands of oil companies before president-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. is sworn in.
The Trump administration said Thursday that it would sell oil and gas leases in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska in early January, further accelerating its last-ditch effort to allow drilling there.
The Bureau of Land Management said the sale would take place on Jan. 6, following the publication next Monday of a notice of sale in the Federal Register. That notice requires a 30-day comment period before a sale can occur.
The announcement of a sale date came just 16 days after the bureau released a "call for nominations," which allowed oil companies and others to detail which tracts of land in the refuge were of interest for drilling.
Normally, a call for nominations allows at least 30 days for such responses, followed by weeks of analysis by the bureau to ultimately decide which tracts will be offered. That time frame would have pushed a sale to just a few days before, or beyond, the Jan. 20 inauguration of Joseph R. Biden Jr., who has opposed drilling in the refuge.
The announcement, which came from the bureau's Alaska offices, did not mention why the timetable had been accelerated. But the Trump administration has made no secret of its desire to sell drilling rights in the refuge before leaving office.
Environmental groups denounced the last-minute push.
"This is a shameful attempt by Donald Trump to give one last handout to the fossil fuel industry on his way out the door, at the expense of our public lands and our climate," Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, said in a statement.
Once the sale is held, the bureau has to review and approve the leases, a process that typically takes months. But holding the sale on Jan. 6 potentially gives the bureau opportunity to finalize the leases before Inauguration Day. That would make it more difficult for the Biden administration to undo them.
Environmental groups said they expected Mr. Biden to do just that.
"President Biden ran on, and was elected on, the most aggressive pro-climate platform of any successful candidate in history and he made protecting the Arctic refuge a day one priority," Adam Kolton, executive director of the Alaska Wilderness League, said in a statement. "We will need him to use all the tools at his disposal to stop the industrialization of this iconic national treasure."
The plan to sell leases is also the subject of four lawsuits filed by environmental organizations, some Alaska Native groups and, in one case, a coalition of 15 states. The lawsuits contend that the Trump administration took shortcuts in the leasing process and that an environmental review was deeply flawed.
The Arctic refuge is a vast expanse of virtually pristine wilderness, almost untouched by people and home to migrating caribou, polar bears and other wildlife. Of the refuge's 19 million acres, the lease sales would involve up to 1.5 million acres of the coastal plain of northeast Alaska. The environmental review, which was finalized earlier this year, recommended that almost all of the 1.5 million acres be offered for sale
The refuge has long been protected by environmentalists and Congressional Democrats. But in 2017, with Republicans holding the White House and both houses of Congress, the plan to sell oil and gas leases in the coastal plain was approved as part of tax legislation.
President Trump has said that opening part of the refuge to oil development was among the most significant of his efforts to expand domestic fossil fuel production.
The coastal plain is believed to overlie one of the last remaining significant petroleum reserves in the United States, and could potentially yield billions of barrels of oil. But that assessment is decades old and relies largely on studies that used now-outdated technology to detect petroleum deposits underground.
One exploratory well was drilled in the refuge in the 1980s, and a New York Times investigation found that the results were disappointing.
The American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, has praised the Trump administration's efforts to open the refuge to drilling, saying it would provide jobs and add to Alaska's revenue, which has been suffering as oil production on the North Slope has declined over the years. More recently, oil prices have sharply declined during the pandemic. Most of the state's political leaders support drilling in the refuge as well.
Yet it is not clear how much interest the sale will attract from oil companies. Drilling in the Arctic is costly, making it harder to achieve a good return on investment, especially compared with drilling in places in the Lower 48 states, like Texas, which have less onerous conditions.
Moreover, purchasing the leases would be only the beginning of the process. Most experts say it would be at least a decade or longer before any oil or gas was extracted from the refuge. By then, the drive to reduce worldwide fossil fuel use may mean there is little or no market for the oil.
Companies may also decide that pursuing oil in such a pristine area, one that is prized by environmentalists around the country and by some Alaska Native groups, is not worth the potential effect on their reputations. Many major banks have said they will not lend money to companies for drilling in the refuge.
In the 2017 legislation, the lease sale plan was billed as a means for raising revenue for the federal treasury. The Trump administration originally estimated a $ 1.8 billion windfall for the government over a decade. The Congressional Budget Office later offered a lower estimate of $ 1.1 billion.
But independent analyses, including one by The New York Times, found that even that revised amount was likely overly optimistic. Based on similar sales in Alaska over the past several decades, the analyses found potential revenue over the next decade would likely be in the range of tens of millions of dollars

Texto completo: The Boston Globe on Thursday announced that it will partner with the Portland Press Herald in Maine for next year's Spotlight Fellowship, joining forces to produce a multipart investigative report that will be published by both media companies' websites and newspapers.
Penelope Overton, who covers the lobster industry, will be the lead reporter for the Press Herald, but the project may involve other journalists from both newsrooms, including photographers, designers, and editors.
The Globe has also selected Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter Sarah Ryley of New York to work with the Spotlight Team as a Spotlight fellow.
“We had an extraordinary group of applicants this year, but these two stood out," said Scott Allen, the Globe's assistant managing editor for projects and one of the judges who selected the fellows. “Penny brings a wealth of experience and a powerful instinct for finding the real story, while Sarah is one of the most capable young investigative journalists in the country."
The Spotlight Fellowship, entering its sixth year, is funded by Participant, co-producer of “Spotlight , " the Academy Award-winning movie about the Globe's famed Spotlight Team. The movie tells the story of the team's best-known investigation, exposing the coverup of the sexual molestation of thousands of children by bishops and cardinals in the Catholic Archdiocese of Boston.
“The work that past Spotlight fellows have done — and that this year's fellows will certainly do — has been critically important to holding powerful institutions and individuals to account," said David Linde, CEO of Participant. “We're so proud to stand alongside these journalists in their mission to right wrongs, and speak truth to power."
The collaboration with the Press Herald represents a first for the fellowship program, which allows fellows to work with Spotlight reporters and editors on a project of their choice. This time, the Globe will be teaming up with another newsroom, combining resources to produce an ambitious project of great import to the region and compelling interest nationally.
Overton, a Yale University graduate, has been a journalist for more than two decades, the last four years at Maine's largest newspaper where she covers the state's $1.4 billion lobster industry as well as the growing recreational marijuana industry. The New York Times Magazine once described her as a “fresh faced, but dogged investigative reporter."
“We're thrilled about the opportunity to team up with The Boston Globe," said Press Herald managing editor Steve Greenlee, who spent 12 years as an editor at the Globe before moving to Portland. “Pairing one of our best reporters with the Globe's top investigative journalists will help us elevate our work to an even higher level. We can't wait to get started."
Ryley, who will work directly with the Spotlight Team on a second project, won the 2017 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service for her series with the New York Daily News and ProPublica on the New York Police Department's use of the nuisance abatement law to drive people from their homes and business. Her investigation led to sweeping reforms. She has also reported for outlets such as the New York Times Opinion Video and BuzzFeed News, and has been recognized with a total of 23 awards and honors.
“I feel fortunate to have someone as talented as Sarah Ryley joining us this coming year," said Spotlight Team editor Patty Wen, who was also one of the judges. “She brings superb data-gathering and interviewing skills and seems like such a team player too. She will clearly be such an asset."
Past Spotlight Fellowships have produced groundbreaking work, including “Secrets in the sky" by Jaimi Dowdell and Kelly Carr, and “The danger in our salad bowls," by Christine Haughney. The Globe will soon publish a new investigation by Spotlight fellow Mike Stanton. For more information about the fellowship program, go to www.spotlightfellowship.com.

Charles M. Blow: Obama is a politician, not an activist

Texto completo: Barack Obama continues his rather strange mission to confront and correct young liberal activists. It is an odd post-presidential note: A man who is beloved and admired on the left is using his cultural currency as a corrective against those who are on a quest for change.
Wednesday morning on Peter Hamby’s Snapchat show, “Good Luck America,” Obama said this:
“If you believe, as I do, that we should be able to reform the criminal justice system so that it’s not biased and treats everybody fairly, I guess you can use a snappy slogan like ‘Defund the police,’ but, you know, you lost a big audience the minute you say it, which makes it a lot less likely that you’re actually going to get the changes you want done.”
It was not the first time Obama had taken aim at these young activists. Last year he also took a swipe at wokeness and “call-out culture,” saying, among other things: “If all you’re doing is casting stones, you’re probably not going to get that far. That’s easy to do.”
That speech got him an amen from Ann Coulter, who tweeted: “Good for Obama. (Not sarcastic!)”
These chastisements by Obama delineate the difference between the politician and the activist.
The politician may be popular, but the activist will rarely be. The politician can unify, but the activist often divides. The politician seeks to unify people around a set of beliefs. The activist seeks to right a wrong that has been held up by a set of beliefs. In short, the politician navigates the system, while the activist defies it.
The politician builds a coalition by using middling philosophy and policies that appeal to the most and offend the fewest. The activist is driven more by purpose, morality and righteousness.
There is a reason most of our greatest activists in America never became politicians: They would have had to compromise too much of themselves and their causes.
Of course, as a political matter, Obama is right in a way. He is looking at the path to legislative and public opinion success. To take that path, the power structure can’t be so much confronted as coaxed. Those who do not recognize your full humanity must be convinced rather than condemned.
But that all feels like cowardice and accommodation to the activists. They are right, after all. Policing needs to be restructured in this country. Part of the reason so many unarmed Black people are killed at the hands of the police is that policing itself has become sick and corrupt; it has become bloated and impervious to prosecution.
I believe that Obama recognizes this, too, to some degree. But to the politician, baby steps are still progress. Winning the hearts and minds of the populace in that tradecraft, it is the way — the only way — they believe that progress is made.
Possibly.
But it is also true that it is often the presence of an extremist wing — I say extremist here only because that is the way the opposition sees strident activism — that makes successes of the moderate position possible.
Part of the reason the civil rights movement led by Martin Luther King Jr. could be so successful was the existence of the more radical — and less widely acceptable — Malcolm X.
Booker T. Washington was elevated because he was willing to forgo political power at a time when Black people outnumbered white people in some Southern states and were near a majority in others. The idea of Black political power and possibly even Black dominance had sent shock waves through the white South and animated white terror in the region.
This moment needs the radical young activists. It needs them to push far and hard. It needs them to confront the power structure, to stare it down, to demand its dismantling.
Obama is a good man and a great politician. History will always record him as such. But he is not an activist. He is not the person who can or will push for the immediate alleviation of oppression. That is just not who he is or how his power was derived. He is above all else a practical, left-of-center moderate.
His presence as president was his greatest symbol of change: a smart, competent Black man, devoid of personal scandal, who brought class and professionalism to the White House. He changed the idea of what was possible to America — including its children — and enshrined Black excellence at the highest level of government as just another normal thing.
That simple act, him doing his job well, was monumental in the quest for racial progress.
But none of that negates the legitimate cries of the activist that much more must be done, that Obama altered a racial image, for the better, but wasn’t able to alter the system of oppression. That was always too much of an expectation. No one can correct 400 years in eight.
But in their approach, the activists are right. I have no problem with “Defund the police.” I know that it means to reallocate funding so that social services and policing are properly weighted. If people are offended and “lost” because of that, they were actually lost before the phrase was uttered.

Six years later, the photo remains one of Ricardo Allen’s favorites. Standing in a Dick’s Sporting Goods, the Atlanta Falcons defensive back is smiling ear to ear, having just been promoted to the active roster after spending most of his rookie season on the practice squad. Matt Ryan, the team’s star quarterback, is walking into the frame to shake his hand.
“Now it’s time to be making some of those big checks,” Allen remembers Ryan saying, referring to the sixfold bump in pay he would receive. “And with them comes a greater level of responsibility.”
Allen, 28, cherishes the picture because it captured the elation he felt after overcoming being cut in training camp — a scene captured on the HBO reality show, “Hard Knocks” — and his unlikely relationship with Ryan, 35, that has now guided both men through this tumultuous year that has rocked them both, personally and professionally.
As two of the longest-tenured Falcons, team captains and leaders of the offense and defense, players who study the game obsessively and share notes, they have leaned on each other as the team — and its social justice committee that they lead — sought ways to respond to the social upheaval roiling the country, a journey The New York Times is following this season.
Allen and Ryan don’t finish each other’s sentences or hang out often at backyard barbecues. Rather, their friendship was forged in the training facility, where their lockers face each other’s, and it has deepened to the point that when Allen’s brother was killed this summer, Ryan was among the first people to reach out.
“There’s a level of depth that comes with time,” Ryan said of their relationship. “You just feel for the guy, your friend, and what he’s going through, losing a loved one.”
The team’s miserable start, in which the Falcons (4-7) lost their first five games and fired coach Dan Quinn and general manager Thomas Dimitroff, could change Allen and Ryan’s future as teammates, a concern that looms as the team continues social justice initiatives they’d planned as part of a wave of renewed NFL activism.
Like it or not, the losing has bled into the Falcons’ off-field activism, and the committee’s plans for 2020 were winnowed down to primarily focus on mentoring high school football players on election rights via videoconference calls. Their work resulted in students from Atlanta’s Booker T. Washington High School and Savannah’s Groves High School volunteering at polling stations during November’s general election, with plans to return for Georgia’s runoff election on Jan. 5. Personally, Allen plans to ramp up his work with Black teens in detention centers, and Ryan has raised nearly $2 million to help underprivileged youth in Atlanta.
Their efforts reflect the different paths they took to the NFL. Ryan attended private schools, was drafted third overall in 2008 and has become the face of the franchise in Atlanta. It was only after George Floyd’s killing at the hands of Minneapolis police in May that Ryan felt compelled to come off the sidelines on the issue of racial inequity.
“When you haven’t gone through something yourself, it’s harder to be able to relate to it,” Ryan said to explain not getting involved earlier. “But turning a blind eye is no longer acceptable to me. It took time, and I wish I had done it faster, but we’re in a position where I hope we’re starting to move things in the right direction.”
Allen’s involvement is driven more by his lived experience. The first member of his family to attend college, the diminutive cornerback (he’s 5-foot-9) earned a roster spot off the practice squad, a kind of NFL Horatio Alger story.
Allen was raised by a single mother, Brenda Green, who worked two jobs, and an older brother, Adrian, whom he idolized. Allen didn’t play youth football because money was tight. He later joined the football team at Mainland High School in Daytona Beach, Florida, where he befriended Michael Squillacote, one of a handful of white teammates. Their relationship changed the trajectory of Allen’s life.
He spent weeks at a time at Squillacote’s home, which sits on 10 acres in a largely white area north of Daytona Beach, about 10 miles and a world away from where Allen lived. The two teenagers bonded over video games, talking football and working out. In return for their hospitality, Squillacote’s parents, Steve and Betsy Squillacote, expected Allen to complete the same chores as their two sons and carry at least a 3.0 grade-point average. Allen and Michael Squillacote worked at Steve Squillacote’s homebuilding company.
“He just needed a push in the right direction,” Betsy Squillacote said.
The Squillacotes’ house, he said, was something “you only saw in the movies and on TV.” He appreciated that for the first time, he had a father figure in his life. He also fended off scrutiny from his Black friends.
“I’ve had people come up to me and say, ‘Hey, man, what are you doing hanging with that family?’” Allen said. “I said, ‘What are you talking about? They helped raise me.’”
The Squillacotes’ influence helped ease Allen’s move to Purdue University, in predominantly white West Lafayette, Indiana, to play college football. But it still came as a shock to him when campus police stopped him one night on campus and asked to search his backpack for no apparent reason. Later, Allen came to feel that he had been racially profiled, an uncomfortable reminder that even his notoriety as a football player did not exempt him from being targeted because of the color of his skin.
After Allen was promoted to the active roster late in 2014, he and Ryan’s relationship blossomed. They faced each other in practice, and Ryan taught Allen how to read offenses and how to navigate the off-field responsibilities of being a professional football player. Allen, a favorite of Quinn’s, rose to being a full-time starter at safety in 2015 and founder of the team’s social justice committee in 2017.
“I’ve always had a tremendous amount of respect for him as a player, but as he’s grown into a more veteran player, his voice is heard more on different topics,” Ryan said of Allen. “He’s a confidante for me.”
During their seven years together, Allen and Ryan have obsessed over the minutiae of their sport. Before every game, Ryan stops at Allen’s locker for a pregame pep talk. After practice, they chat about parenthood in the hot or cold tub. In the offseason, the pair organizes workouts in Florida for veteran players. Only occasionally did they discuss tougher topics like race relations and police brutality.
In the past three years, though, Allen and other Black teammates began speaking out publicly against police brutality. Few white teammates joined them, including Ryan, who said he didn’t have the vocabulary to speak up and said his support “was always in the background.”
That changed for Ryan this summer when the Falcons held virtual meetings about Floyd’s killing. Hearing players, including Allen, describe instances of being racially profiled by police, Ryan recognized he could no longer sit idly by.
“For our team, it was the third or fourth time talking about the same things,” Ryan said. “If we continue to take the same approach, and guys continue to do what we’ve been doing, that’s not going to work.”
In early June, after ESPN wrote about Allen’s 2018 trip to Selma, Alabama, to visit the site of 1965 Civil Rights march, Ryan called and, in what he said was an uncomfortable conversation, asked how he should speak out because he was unfamiliar with talking about issues of race.
Allen told him just to be himself and speak from the heart.
“I’m from the ’hood and live in the country club now, but I can see how people don’t understand what it’s like in the ’hood because they’ve never seen it,” Allen said of Ryan’s discomfort.
“Matt and a bunch of other white teammates hit me up, and the main thing they tried to tell me was, they don’t know the perfect thing to say,” Allen recalled.
Ryan’s community efforts, to that point, focused on supporting children’s hospitals and Boys and Girls clubs. Growing up outside of Philadelphia, Ryan had classmates and teammates of various backgrounds. But he did not have to confront the harsh realities that Black teammates like Allen routinely did.
“I feel fortunate to come from where I come from,” Ryan said. “Playing sports my whole life, I’ve also come to appreciate it even more because knowing other situations that guys have gone through. There’s a lot of things they’ve had to overcome that I didn’t.”
Ryan joined the Falcons’ social justice committee and decided to use his popularity in Atlanta to raise more than $1.3 million, including $500,000 of his own money, to support after-school programs in underprivileged neighborhoods in Atlanta to give Black children a safe place to exercise and learn from mentors.
To drum up donations, Ryan held a radio-a-thon and invited Allen, who talked about growing up in Florida. When Ryan formed a committee to help him disperse those funds, Allen suggested including influential people in Atlanta’s Black community, including rapper Killer Mike, born Michael Render, who is one-half of the hip-hop duo Run the Jewels.
Allen has been “one of the first guys I asked to help, and he’s been one of the first guys to give advice on things going on from the jump,” Ryan said.
Then the violence that surrounded Allen growing up hit home. In late July, Adrian Allen, who was 31, was stabbed to death in a fight in Daytona Beach. Adrian Allen had been in and out of jail over the years, Ricardo Allen said, cleaning up his life for a while, then falling backward.
Ryan was one of the few Falcons told about Adrian Allen’s death, and he immediately called to offer his sympathy, something that reminded Ricardo Allen of how far they’d come as friends.
“You don’t really have very many good friends in the NFL, because players come and go, and they’re focused on their lives,” Allen said. Ryan’s call “says that I’m not just a football player to him, that he cares for me outside the walls of what we do for a business.”

Betsy Wade, the first woman to edit news copy for The New York Times and the lead plaintiff in a landmark sex discrimination lawsuit against the newspaper on behalf of its female employees, died Thursday at her home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She was 91.
Her death was confirmed by her husband, James Boylan, who said she had learned in 2017 that she had colon cancer.
In a 45-year Times career, Wade also became the first woman to lead The Newspaper Guild of New York, the largest local in the national journalism union (now known as the NewsGuild).
She was revered among peers for her role in the 1974 class-action suit against The Times, one of the industry’s earliest fights over women’s rights to equal treatment in hiring, promotion, pay and workplace protections under federal anti-discrimination laws.
Four years after being fired as a reporter for The New York Herald Tribune for being pregnant, Wade landed at The Times on Oct. 1, 1956, and instantly broke a 105-year-old practice of male copy editing in the news department, where women were rare, relatively underpaid and relegated largely to reporting on fashions, cooking and other “women’s news,” or to clerical or secretarial jobs.
“The copy desk did not put a screen around me,” Wade told Nan Robertson for her book “The Girls in the Balcony” (1992), about the rise of women at The Times. “But they took the cuspidors out of the city room the first week. A copy boy got some deep ruffling and put it around my paste pot.” And the men told clean jokes, she said, “to make me feel less like a temperance worker at a brewery picnic.”
Wade, still a trainee, enjoyed only a month on The Times’ city news copy desk before she, too, was assigned to edit women’s news. She was too good to be sidetracked, however, and by 1958 she was back in general news.
She was soon recognized for her cool appraisals of articles and her deft pencil — invisible to readers, but all too apparent to colleagues — as her surgical excisions and repairs saved The Times from factual errors and its writers from clumsy sentences, phrases of dubious taste and embarrassing flaws in grammar, spelling and syntax.
And her headlines — the icing on the cake for a copy editor — were often extraordinary, like one on April 9, 1962, over twinned stories datelined Moscow and Tokyo, in which she rendered “Spring” in Russian, Japanese and English to universalize celebrations of the vernal equinox.
She later moved up to jobs with more responsibility, and to other firsts by a woman at The Times: the first to edit articles by foreign correspondents; the first deputy chief of the foreign copy desk; and, in 1972, the first chief of the foreign copy desk, a job called “the slot” in news jargon — the boss who traditionally sat inside a U-shaped desk and distributed tasks to subordinate copy editors around its rim.
The slot was often a steppingstone to upper management. But the newspaper’s house organ, Times Talk, proclaimed her promotion with a sexist idiom: “Betsy’s in the slot: first dame to make it.”
A year earlier she had been entrusted to help prepare the Pentagon Papers, classified documents and explanatory articles that told of American duplicity in Vietnam, for publication. In a historic ruling for freedom of the press, the Supreme Court denied a Nixon administration challenge. The Times won a Pulitzer Prize for publishing the papers.
She joined a women’s caucus in 1972 to study gender issues at The Times. It found that weekly salaries for women were $59 less than those of men with comparable jobs; that there were no women in top corporate or masthead ranks, on the editorial board or among 22 national correspondents; and that the staffs of 33 foreign correspondents and 35 Washington bureau members included only three women each.
In 1978, after a four-year court fight, The Times and representatives of 560 women on its 6,000-member staff settled a class-action suit — titled Elizabeth Boylan, et al, v. The New York Times, using Wade’s married name (she went by Betsy Wade professionally) — on terms approved by Judge Henry Werker. Both sides claimed victory.
The Times agreed to place more women in jobs ranging from entry level to top management, and to create annuities covering costs of “delayed career advancement or denied opportunity.” But it did not grant raises or admit any violations of law. James C. Goodale, The Times’ executive vice president at the time, called the paper’s voluntary affirmative action program “one of the strongest in the country.”
Wade countered: “If Judge Werker is now able to say that The Times has progressed in affirmative action, it is our suit that compelled this. The paper began to move toward our goals when the suit went to court, and the women who have been hired since are aware of this.”
Elizabeth Wade was born in Manhattan on July 18, 1929, to Sidney and Elizabeth (Manning) Wade. Her father was an executive with Union Carbide. Seeking better schools for Betsy and her younger sister, the family moved to suburban Bronxville, New York, in 1934.
Envisioning a journalism career, Betsy worked for student newspapers at Bronxville High School, from which she graduated in 1947, and Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota. She transferred to Barnard College in Manhattan in 1949, earning a bachelor’s degree in 1951. A year later, she received a master’s degree from the Graduate School of Journalism at Columbia University.
In 1952, she married Boylan, who founded The Columbia Journalism Review in 1961. They had two sons, Richard and Benjamin. They survive her, along with six grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.
Wade began her journalism career on The Herald Tribune’s women’s page. After her dismissal, she wrote for the Newspaper Enterprise Association from 1954 to 1956, when she joined The Times. In 1978, she was elected to a four-year term as president of the New York Newspaper Guild.
In 1987, after three decades as a copy editor, she took over The Times’ Practical Traveler column, and for 14 years, until her retirement in 2001, wrote weekly tips-for-travelers articles. A collection of her columns, “The New York Times Practical Traveler Handbook,” was published in 1994.
In retirement, Wade taught journalism and public policy at Hunter College. In 2016, she received the highest accolade for New York’s veteran journalists, the lifetime achievement award of the Silurians Press Club.
Wade was also a board member of the Anne O’Hare McCormack Memorial Fund, which endows scholarships for women at the Columbia and CCNY journalism schools.
Since the 19th century, Times articles had identified men in secondary references as “Mr.” and women as “Mrs.” or “Miss.” Stuck with the double standard, reporters asking female interviewees if they were married or single were often told to get lost.
But on June 20, 1986, The Times began using “Ms.” The change first appeared in a Page 1 story about a Supreme Court ruling on the sexual harassment of a bank employee by a male supervisor. The article called the victim “Ms. Vinson.”
It was edited by Betsy Wade.

Feeling Spurned by Trump, U.N. Sees Redemption in Biden and Team

After four years of disparagement and disengagement by the Trump administration, the United Nations is infused with expectations that President-elect Joe Biden will restore much of what his predecessor dismantled.
Biden has promised to rejoin the Paris Agreement on climate change immediately after taking office Jan. 20, reviving U.S. participation in a signature U.N.-led collaboration to fight global warming that President Donald Trump abandoned.
The president-elect has vowed to reverse Trump’s widely criticized decision to withdraw from the World Health Organization, the U.N.’s public health arm, in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. He has pledged to restore the funding that Trump ended to the U.N. Population Fund, a leading provider of family planning and women’s reproductive services, a cut that was part of a conservative-led policy to penalize groups that offer abortion counseling.
Biden’s choice for U.N. ambassador, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, a veteran American diplomat with vast experience in Africa — and his plan to restore that position to Cabinet rank, another reversal of Trump administration policy — have also sent powerful signals about the president-elect’s views toward the United Nations.
“The big picture is enormously encouraging and a huge relief for a lot of U.N. members,” said Richard Gowan, a former U.N. consultant who directs the U.N. advocacy work of the International Crisis Group, an independent organization that promotes peaceful resolutions to conflicts.
“People were quite exhausted at the prospect of another four years of Trump,” Gowan said. “Biden faces a very difficult world but a very easy pathway to gaining some political goodwill at the United Nations. Biden and his U.N. ambassador just need to be human, and they will be treated as conquering heroes.”
Even diplomats from American rivals like China have privately expressed hope that Thomas-Greenfield, if confirmed, will speak and negotiate with an authoritative voice. Trump’s unpredictability, some said, hurt the effectiveness of his U.N. envoys, Nikki Haley and her successor, Kelly Craft, neither of whom had extensive prior diplomatic experience.
Thomas-Greenfield, by contrast, spent decades in the State Department’s foreign service and was its top African affairs official during the 2014-16 Ebola crisis. She was threatened with death while traveling in Rwanda before the 1994 genocide and talked her way out of it, she once explained in a TED Talk. She was the ambassador to Liberia from 2008 to 2012 and was named its first honorary citizen by Liberia’s first woman president, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf.
Biden’s choice of Thomas-Greenfield, announced Nov. 24, was acclaimed by American diplomatic veterans. Madeleine K. Albright, the first female secretary of state and chairwoman of the Albright Stonebridge Group, a global strategy firm that had hired Thomas-Greenfield, said on Twitter that she was “a valued colleague and veteran diplomat who will restore US leadership and cooperation.”
Thomas-Greenfield is among the highest-ranking Black members of Biden’s team, with a seat on the National Security Council. Her nomination was widely seen as a sign of Biden’s respect for career diplomats and his commitment to picking a racially diverse leadership team.
Still, it may not be easy for Biden or Thomas-Greenfield to quickly undo the isolation that the United States has faced in the Trump era.
Biden’s plan to reverse Trump’s repudiation of the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement, an accord endorsed in a U.N. Security Council resolution, could prove impossible. Prospects for any improvement in U.S.-Iran relations may have been poisoned last Friday when Iran’s top nuclear scientist was assassinated in what Iran has called an Israeli operation abetted by the United States.
Biden’s goals remain unclear concerning some other U.N. agencies and agreements renounced during the Trump years — the Human Rights Council, UNESCO, the Palestinian refugee agency, and accords on global migration and arms trade. Biden also has not specified how he intends to deal with the International Criminal Court, created through U.N. diplomacy two decades ago to prosecute egregious crimes like genocide.
The United States is not a member of the court but cooperated with it until the Trump administration sanctioned its chief prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, and other court officials for efforts to investigate possible American crimes in the Afghanistan War and possible crimes by Israelis in the occupied Palestinian territories.
Richard Dicker, director of the international justice program at Human Rights Watch, said the sanctions order had cast a chilling effect on the court, with penalties usually reserved for “drug kingpins and terrorists.” Biden, he said, must repeal the order “as part of rejoining the community of nations that support the rule of law.”
Others are hopeful that Biden’s stated positions on human rights and international cooperation will have far-reaching effects.
“Under Joe Biden, the international human rights community and beyond will breathe a sigh of relief,” said Agnès Callamard, the U.N. Human Rights Council’s special investigator on extrajudicial killings.
Callamard expressed hope that the Biden administration would seek to regain the seat at the Human Rights Council abandoned by Trump in 2018 because of what Haley, then U.N. ambassador, called its heavy bias against Israel.
“The absence of the U.S. there in some of the council’s difficult debates and issues has led to a weakening of those espousing positions supportive of human rights protection,” Callamard said. With other countries failing to step up, she said, the council’s discussions are now “largely taken by countries whose primary interest is to weaken international scrutiny over their human rights records.”
Some diplomats have privately criticized Secretary-General António Guterres for what they described as his reluctance to confront Trump, partly because the United States, for all of Trump’s disregard for international cooperation, remains the biggest single donor to the U.N. budget. Gowan, for one, rejected that view.
“Now he has a chance to work with a far more sympathetic Biden team, and there are signs that Guterres will be pushing much more ambitious plans to fight inequality and climate change than he was able to risk before,” Gowan said. “Guterres has faced accusations of being too cautious around Trump, but he can say that Biden’s win vindicates his strategy.”
Guterres sought to maintain the appearance of impartiality through the 2020 presidential campaign and aftermath, although he was among the international figures to congratulate Biden in the days immediately after major news organizations declared him the winner.
Asked recently if Guterres was “doing cartwheels in his office” over Biden’s choice of Thomas-Greenfield as ambassador, the secretary-general’s spokesman, Stéphane Dujarric, delivered a diplomatic answer.
“I have never known nor can I ever imagine the secretary-general doing cartwheels in his office or anywhere else,” he said. “What I can tell you is that the secretary-general has always worked very closely with every U.S. permanent representative that has been sent by Washington and will do so in the future.”

Draped over a bare wooden floor with one leg bent behind and the other extended to the side, dancer Bettie de Jong slowly rotates, opening an arm and then a knee as if her limbs — long and luxurious — were pages in a book. She spirals up, balanced on one foot while the other leg unfurls high to the side. Her arms lift radiantly but without force. Finally, she descends back to where she started and performs the sequence again. And again.
In the mesmerizing film “9 Variations on a Dance Theme” (1966), filmmaker Hilary Harris trains his lens on de Jong, a longtime muse of choreographer Paul Taylor. De Jong repeats the variation, but as the film progresses it becomes less a straightforward dance than an intimate, cinematic exploration of the moving body. Shot in hazy black and white, “9 Variations” is a classic; it’s also newly relevant, as dance artists experiment with ways to present their art form on screens.
That’s not the only reason it feels so current: In her isolated state, de Jong, with her enigmatic, angelic face, cuts a lonely figure. It seems as if she’s dancing in a room by herself — who can’t relate? — yet her partner is Harris’ camera. It dances with her, gliding over her knitted unitard, closing in on her quivering muscles and following the motion of her graceful fingers while dissecting her body from above and below. But even as the camera has its way, distorting and blurring de Jong’s statuesque form to render her anonymous, nothing can diminish her ghostly aura.
Recently two Taylor dancers — Michael Trusnovec, who retired from the company but is now director of worldwide licensing for the Paul Taylor Dance Foundation, as well as a répétiteur of Taylor’s dances — and Kristin Draucker, a current company member, decided to pay homage to de Jong by creating a new film.
“I remember watching it one morning and just crying on the floor of my living room,” Draucker said of seeing the original during the early days of the shutdown. “It made me feel connected to dance again. I didn’t feel sad that I wasn’t onstage. I was just really moved by her dancing.”
For “Nine New Variations,” Trusnovec and Draucker’s second video collaboration, they asked nine dancers, all women — Sara Mearns, Margie Gillis, Tamisha A. Guy, Annmaria Mazzini, Xin Ying, Andrea Miller, Akua Noni Parker, Christine Flores and Caitlin Scranton — to watch Harris’ film and to respond both physically and with adventurous camera work. Those movement meditations were then edited by Draucker and Trusnovec, resulting in what they consider the 10th variation.
While these dancers largely filmed themselves quickly on smartphones, de Jong, who is now 87 and a rehearsal director with the Taylor company, said the making of the original unfolded over years.
“He started it in ’63,” she said. “It took forever. I hated every moment of it.”
The characteristically blunt de Jong, speaking in a Zoom conversation that also included Trusnovec, performed the 45-second variation repeatedly; she danced to silence — music was added later — in sessions that lasted from 10 a.m. until noon. After, she would rehearse with Taylor.
“It practically killed me,” she said. “I tried to get rid of it so badly because for me it was not dancing. No. I had no music, nothing to look at.”
Why did she do it?
“It was just money, I guess. And food. My tuna fish and my hamburgers.” She paused. “But it didn’t pay very well.”
De Jong did appreciate something about it.
“He wanted to make a film that the camera made rather than the dancer,” she said. “So he wanted minimal movement. I never prepared myself. I guess I had so much preparation in my wanting to dance that it was just like eating breakfast. Once I lay down on the floor with my arm across, it was very easy to get in the mood.”
De Jong said that Harris tried out another dancer, but the combination she created didn’t suit his purpose. For hers, de Jong got advice from a fellow company member, Dan Wagoner, who recommended that she use the start of her solo in Taylor’s “Scudorama” (1963).
“The beginning is from ‘Scudorama’ but then it goes into something that he liked,” de Jong said of Harris. “The leg lift and then going back down to the floor of ‘Scudorama.’ And then I had knitted a warm-up thing, and he said, ‘Can you knit something like that in beige?’”
Concerned about her sewing skills, de Jong turned to a professional. “I’m not going to go to knit anything that goes on the camera!” she said. “I found this little Hungarian lady who said, ‘Oh, sure, I can knit that,’ and she did.”
Harris, who died in 1999, didn’t tell de Jong that his experiment had more to do with the camera than her dancing until he was done filming. Even now, she has a hard time watching it; for one thing, he made her lift a leg she didn’t want to lift. “My right leg,” she said, “goes up higher.”
To get herself through it, she started to relate it to the repetition of a daily barre warm-up. “It’s boring!” she said. “Tendus are boring! So I took it as that: It was an exercise that I had to do. But it was excruciating. And maybe that’s why I can’t watch it. It wasn’t pleasurable. To dance that way without music is so boring and so hard.”
But she still appreciates the affect of his angles, the way his camera is guiding the action.
“That I love to watch because it’s very clear that the camera is doing it,” she said. “That is the art of the camera. I could feel him following me.”
For the meditative “Nine New Variations,” Trusnovec felt that the dancers responded to the camera, but more than that, they were reacting to de Jong and “to what she was doing,” he said. “They caught that purity, the elegance that she brings to every single time she does it. It’s just so stunning. There’s such simplicity, but it’s so rich.”
De Jong, who danced for Taylor from 1962 to 1985, said the choreographer’s response to the film wasn’t exactly positive.
“Oh, Paul hated it in the beginning,” she said. “And then just recently when I got the Dance Magazine Award, he said, ‘Why don’t you show your movie, Hilary’s movie?’ That was the first time he ever mentioned that movie. He must have liked it anyway.”
Why did she think he hadn’t?
“We all have very physical ways of letting you know,” she said. “He was a man of very few words and I knew that he hated it. Probably more jealousy than anything else. That he hadn’t made it.”
She met Taylor at the Martha Graham studios where de Jong, who was born in Indonesia and later moved to the Netherlands with her family, was a scholarship student. She heard that Taylor was holding an audition; even though it was invitation-only, he allowed her to attend.
After it, she asked Wagoner if he knew what Taylor had thought of her dancing. “He said, ‘He never thought of taking a tall dancer,’ and I said, ‘Oh, OK. That’s fine, that’s fine.’"
But the next day, after taking a morning Graham class, she returned home. She said: “At 1 o’clock the telephone rang and this voice said: ‘Where are you? We’re rehearsing!’ That was it.”
Trusnovec laughed. “That’s Paul,” he said. “I’ll bet that you got there as quick as you could.”
De Jong nodded. “I, even without money, took a cab,” she said. “I’m old now, but I feel like I had a very rich life being allowed to dance Paul’s work. I loved all of his dances. I never sliced myself in little pieces. I just was in heaven dancing for that man.”

Google Researcher Says She Was Fired Over Paper Highlighting Bias in AI

A well-respected Google researcher said she was fired by the company after criticizing its approach to minority hiring and the biases built into today’s artificial intelligence systems.
Timnit Gebru, who was a co-leader of Google’s Ethical AI team, said in a tweet Wednesday that she was fired because of an email she had sent a day earlier to a group that included company employees.
In the email, reviewed by The New York Times, she expressed exasperation over Google’s response to efforts by her and other employees to increase minority hiring and draw attention to bias in artificial intelligence.
“Your life starts getting worse when you start advocating for underrepresented people. You start making the other leaders upset,” the email read. “There is no way more documents or more conversations will achieve anything.”
Her departure from Google highlights growing tension between Google’s outspoken workforce and its buttoned-up senior management, while raising concerns over the company’s efforts to build fair and reliable technology. It may also have a chilling effect on both Black tech workers and researchers who have left academia in recent years for high-paying jobs in Silicon Valley.
“Her firing only indicates that scientists, activists and scholars who want to work in this field — and are Black women — are not welcome in Silicon Valley,” said Mutale Nkonde, a fellow with the Stanford Digital Civil Society Lab. “It is very disappointing.”
A Google spokesperson declined to comment. In an email sent to Google employees, Jeff Dean, who oversees Google’s AI work, including that of Gebru and her team, called her departure “a difficult moment, especially given the important research topics she was involved in, and how deeply we care about responsible AI research as an org and as a company.”
After years of an anything-goes environment where employees engaged in freewheeling discussions in companywide meetings and online message boards, Google has started to crack down on workplace discourse. Many Google employees have bristled at the new restrictions and have argued that the company has broken from a tradition of transparency and free debate.
On Wednesday, the National Labor Relations Board said Google had most likely violated labor law when it fired two employees who were involved in labor organizing. The federal agency said Google illegally surveilled the employees before firing them.
Google’s battles with its workers, who have spoken out in recent years about the company’s handling of sexual harassment and its work with the Defense Department and federal border agencies, has diminished its reputation as a utopia for tech workers with generous salaries, perks and workplace freedom.
Like other technology companies, Google has also faced criticism for not doing enough to resolve the lack of women and racial minorities among its ranks.
The problems of racial inequality, especially the mistreatment of Black employees at technology companies, has plagued Silicon Valley for years. Coinbase, the most valuable cryptocurrency startup, has experienced an exodus of Black employees in the last two years over what the workers said was racist and discriminatory treatment.
Researchers worry that the people who are building artificial intelligence systems may be building their own biases into the technology. Over the past several years, several public experiments have shown that the systems often interact differently with people of color — perhaps because they are underrepresented among the developers who create those systems.
Gebru, 37, was born and raised in Ethiopia. In 2018, while a researcher at Stanford University, she helped write a paper that is widely seen as a turning point in efforts to pinpoint and remove bias in artificial intelligence. She joined Google later that year and helped build the Ethical AI team.
After hiring researchers like Gebru, Google has painted itself as a company dedicated to “ethical” AI. But it is often reluctant to publicly acknowledge flaws in its own systems.
In an interview with the Times, Gebru said her exasperation stemmed from the company’s treatment of a research paper she had written with six other researchers, four of them at Google. The paper, also reviewed by the Times, pinpointed flaws in a new breed of language technology, including a system built by Google that underpins the company’s search engine.
These systems learn the vagaries of language by analyzing enormous amounts of text, including thousands of books, Wikipedia entries and other online documents. Because this text includes biased and sometimes hateful language, the technology may end up generating biased and hateful language.
After she and the other researchers submitted the paper to an academic conference, Gebru said, a Google manager demanded that she either retract the paper from the conference or remove her name and the names of the other Google employees. She refused to do so without further discussion and, in the email sent Tuesday, said she would resign after an appropriate amount of time if the company could not explain why it wanted her to retract the paper and answer other concerns.
The company responded to her email, she said, by saying it could not meet her demands and that her resignation was accepted immediately. Her access to company email and other services was immediately revoked.
In his note to employees, Dean said Google respected “her decision to resign.” Dean also said that the paper did not acknowledge recent research showing ways of mitigating bias in such systems.
“It was dehumanizing,” Gebru said. “They may have reasons for shutting down our research. But what is most upsetting is that they refuse to have a discussion about why.”
Gebru’s departure from Google comes at a time when AI technology is playing a bigger role in nearly every facet of Google’s business. The company has hitched its future to artificial intelligence — whether with its voice-enabled digital assistant or its automated placement of advertising for marketers — as the breakthrough technology to make the next generation of services and devices smarter and more capable.
Sundar Pichai, chief executive of Alphabet, Google’s parent company, has compared the advent of artificial intelligence to that of electricity or fire and has said that it is essential to the future of the company and computing. Earlier this year, Pichai called for greater regulation and responsible handling of artificial intelligence, arguing that society needs to balance potential harms with new opportunities.
Google has repeatedly committed to eliminating bias in its systems. The trouble, Gebru said, is that most of the people making the ultimate decisions are men. “They are not only failing to prioritize hiring more people from minority communities, they are quashing their voices,” she said.
Julien Cornebise, an honorary associate professor at University College London and a former researcher with DeepMind, a prominent AI lab owned by the same parent company as Google’s, was among many artificial intelligence researchers who said Gebru’s departure reflected a larger problem in the industry.
“This shows how some large tech companies only support ethics and fairness and other AI-for-social-good causes as long as their positive PR impact outweighs the extra scrutiny they bring,” he said. “Timnit is a brilliant researcher. We need more like her in our field.”

In Prison for Tax Fraud, He Committed More Tax Fraud, U.S. Says

NEW YORK — A Queens man who was serving time in federal prison for tax preparation fraud used a smuggled smartphone to file tax returns for his clients, diverting hundreds of thousands of dollars in refunds to accounts he controlled, the authorities said.
Abdel Soliman, 54, was arrested Monday on federal wire fraud and conspiracy charges. According to an affidavit submitted as part of an application for an arrest warrant, he took more than $470,000 from clients in 2018 and 2019 while he was incarcerated in a minimum-security camp at the federal penitentiary in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania.
“It’s all baloney — it’s not true,” Soliman, who is free on a $600,000 bond, said in an interview this week.
Soliman said he never possessed a cellphone while in prison, adding that the arrest affidavit was based on testimony from another prisoner who sought early release to home confinement.
“You wouldn’t believe how many phones are in federal prison camps,” Soliman said. “They’re all over the place.”
Messages left with Louis M. Freeman, Soliman’s lawyer, were not returned.
The affidavit, prepared by a special agent with the criminal investigation division of the IRS, says that while he was serving a 41-month sentence for a $2.9 million tax preparation fraud scheme, Soliman used a smuggled cellphone to commit the same crime. Soliman filled out tax forms for clients on his phone, and kept a portion of their tax returns while sending clients documents showing lower return amounts, the affidavit says.
Some clients did not know that the IRS had issued refunds on their behalf, the document says, and at least one client reported being unaware that Soliman was in prison at the time. The IRS interviewed 11 people it said had been defrauded by Soliman and found that he had taken more than $36,000 from them.
In other cases, according to the document, the IRS found that Soliman had collected a “fee” of around $900 that he charged against his clients’ tax refunds without notifying them. The money was diverted to an account that Soliman controlled with help from unnamed “associates,” the document says.
The IRS investigator also accused Soliman, a naturalized U.S. citizen originally from Egypt, of laundering the money he obtained from his clients, sending $150,000 to an account in Egypt and more than $40,000 to an account in Europe.
According to the affidavit, the Federal Bureau of Prisons provided the IRS with photos of an iPhone 6S that was confiscated from Soliman on May 9 and had his contact information in its settings. The authorities were unable to further search the device because its data “was remotely erased during the inventory process,” the document says.
Federal records indicate that Soliman was released from prison Oct. 9, and the affidavit says that he was to remain on supervised release until 2023.
In 2003, he pleaded guilty after he was accused of trying to smuggle $659,000 out of the country at Kennedy International Airport, and received a 30-month sentence.
The use of cellphones by inmates, including in the commission of crimes, is a growing concern, even though the devices have been banned in federal prisons since 2010. The New York Times reported earlier this year that inmates in a state prison in Alabama used illicit cellphones to extort money from the families of fellow prisoners.
In a statement, Justin Long, a spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Prisons, said the agency “continues to tackle the problem of contraband being introduced into our facilities, including contraband cellphones.”
Long said he was unable to speak about Soliman’s case, or say how common it was for inmates to use cellphones to commit crimes. Federal prisons, he said, use walk-through metal detectors and whole-body imaging devices to find such devices.

Miguel Algarín, a poet who was the driving force behind the Nuyorican Poets Cafe, a performance space on the Lower East Side of Manhattan that since 1973 has played host to poetry readings, plays and more by Puerto Rican and other artists who have had trouble being heard in the mainstream, died Monday in Manhattan. He was 79.
Judge John Howard-Algarín, a nephew, said the apparent cause of death, in a hospital, was sepsis.
Algarín, who was born in Puerto Rico but lived most of his life in New York, had a keen sense of the dual identity felt by many people with a similar story. He had an equally keen ear for the language of the street and the power of poetry performed live. He was a foundational figure in the Nuyorican literary movement, which encompassed writers and other artists born in Puerto Rico or of Puerto Rican descent but living in New York, whose works often explored their identity and their marginalization.
In the early 1970s his flat on East Sixth Street became a gathering spot for similarly minded writers, and in 1973 things came to a head.
“The gang of poets that he gathered around him were hanging out at his apartment when he said, ‘There are too many of us in here; let’s go over to that Irish bar across the street,’” his friend Bob Holman, who helped Algarín revive the cafe in the late 1980s after a period of dormancy, said in a phone interview. “That was the beginning of the Nuyorican Poets Cafe.”
The cafe caught on, and the performances there grew to encompass theater, poetry slams and more, with an emphasis on writers of color and other marginalized groups. Books were published. A theater festival was created. All of it sought to break the bonds that Algarín felt the arts world, society and language itself placed on such performers and writers.
“When a people are oppressed,” he wrote in the introduction to “Action: The Nuyorican Poets Café Theater Festival,” a 1997 collection compiled by Algarín and one of the cafe’s other founding poets, Lois Elaine Griffith, “the only way to hold their cultural space is to start talking.”
His own prose and poetry — he published a number of collections — was part of that conversation. There was, for instance, “Survival,” from 1978:
the struggle is really simple
i was born
i was taught how to behave
i was shown how to accommodate —
i resist being humanized
into feelings not my own —
the struggle is really simple
i will be born
i will not be taught how to behave
i will not make my muscles vestigial
i will not digest myself
Miguel Algarín was born Sept. 11, 1941, in the Santurce neighborhood of San Juan. When he was 9 the family moved to New York, where his father, also named Miguel, was a doorman and his mother, María Socorro Algarín, was a dietitian at Goldwater Memorial Hospital.
Algarín received a bachelor’s degree at the University of Wisconsin in 1963 and a master’s degree in English literature at Pennsylvania State University in 1965. He then settled in New York. He taught Shakespeare, creative writing and United States ethnic literature at Rutgers University in New Jersey for more than 30 years and at his death was an emeritus professor there.
But he was just as comfortable on the streets of the pre-gentrification Lower East Side as he was in the university classroom, as Ishmael Reed noted in his introduction to Algarín’s 1997 collection, “Love Is Hard Work: Memorias de Loisaida.”
“The poetry is as sophisticated as the author,” Reed wrote, “who is capable of leading a theater audience in a discussion of the links between William Shakespeare and Adrienne Kennedy and of ordering in French at a New Orleans restaurant. He is a professor who nevertheless hasn’t lost the common touch.”
Algarín strove to connect the two worlds. “He had a vision of the poetry of the streets being as respected as the poetry of the academy,” Holman said.
In 1975, Algarín and Miguel Piñero, another founding poet of the cafe, published “Nuyorican Poetry: An Anthology of Puerto Rican Words and Feelings.” It included an introductory essay by Algarín that became something of a foundational document for the Nuyorican literary movement.
“The poems in this anthology document the conditions of survival: many roaches, many busts, many drug poems, many hate poems — many, many poems of complaints,” he wrote. “But the complaints are delivered in a new rhythm. It is a bomba rhythm" — a music and dance form from Puerto Rico — “with many changing pitches delivered with a bold stress. The pitches vary, but the stress is always bomba and the vocabulary is English and Spanish mixed into a new language.”
In the 1980s the cafe moved to East Third Street, where it remains today. Over the years the variety of voices coming from its stage expanded, as did the forms — its poetry slams were lively affairs — and by 1995 Algarín was able to reflect on the role the cafe had played in broadening New York’s arts offerings.
“The poets of the Cafe have gone a long way toward changing the so-called black/white dialogue that has been the breeding ground for social, cultural and political conflict in the United States,” he wrote in the introduction to “Aloud: Voices From the Nuyorican Poets Cafe,” a 1994 compilation he edited with Holman. “It is clear that we now are entering a new era, where the dialogue is multiethnic and necessitates a larger field of verbal action to explain the cultural and political reality of North America.”
Algarín is survived by a brother, Arturo; a sister, Irma Antonia Algarín; and several nieces and nephews.
In a 1976 interview with The New York Times, Algarín talked about what attracted audiences and performers to the Nuyorican Poets Cafe. They were drawn, he said, “by the sense of not having to let go in order to survive; we are not forced to drop our language in some sort of search for American citizenship.”

Artists Ask MoMA to Remove Philip Johnson’s Name, Citing Racist Views

Philip Johnson was one of the most influential architects of the past century, chameleonic in each of his roles as a New York power broker, art collector and creator of his “Glass House,” a celebrated landmark of modernist design in Connecticut.
He also championed racist and white supremacist viewpoints in his younger years. Johnson’s Nazi sympathies, for example, have been well documented, and he spent the years after World War II trying to distance himself from them.
Now a group of more than 30 prominent artists, architects and academics are casting a light on the more unsavory part of Johnson’s legacy, demanding in a letter published online Nov. 27 that institutions such as the Museum of Modern Art and the Harvard Graduate School of Design remove the name of the architect, who died in 2005, from their spaces.
“There is a role for Johnson’s architectural work in archives and historic preservation,” the Johnson Study Group, a largely anonymous group of designers and architects, wrote in the letter. “However, naming titles and spaces inevitably suggests that the honoree is a model for curators, administrators, students and others who participate in these institutions.”
The letter was signed by contemporary artist Xaviera Simmons; the landscape architect and MacArthur fellow Kate Orff; and V. Mitch McEwen, an assistant professor of architecture at Princeton University, who is among eight of the 10 architects in an upcoming exhibition at MoMA — “Reconstructions: Architecture and Blackness in America” — that is slated to open Feb. 20.
It cites Johnson’s “widely documented” advocacy for white supremacist views, his attempt to found a fascist party in Louisiana, and failure to include work by a single Black artist or designer in MoMA’s collection during his tenure there. (He served in various roles over six decades.) The letter called on any institutions using his name to remove it.
“He not only acquiesced in but added to the persistent practice of racism in the field of architecture,” the letter said, “a legacy that continues to do harm today.”
Johnson’s name has been on one of the exhibition galleries at the Museum of Modern Art, where he served as its first head of architecture and design, since 1984. His name is also included in the title of the museum’s chief curator of architecture and design.
Johnson created buildings that are widely considered architectural masterpieces of the 20th century, among them the MoMA sculpture garden and the pavilion that houses pre-Columbian art at the Dumbarton Oaks estate in Washington. New York Times critic Paul Goldberger praised him as American architecture’s “godfather, gadfly, scholar, patron, critic, curator, and cheerleader” in his obituary.
But in his younger years, he openly admired Hitler’s manifesto, “Mein Kampf,” attended Nazi rallies in Germany and was investigated by the FBI for his connections to the Nazi party. He rejected Nazism after the end of World War II.
Representatives from MoMA and Harvard did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Thursday.
Orff, the landscape architect and MacArthur fellow, said in an email Thursday that removing Johnson’s name from the gallery and the curator position would represent a significant step in dismantling racism in design culture.
“Landscape architecture is catching up in its assessment of its own legacy,” Orff said. “To move forward with a more imaginative, just, and equitable culture in the design fields, we have to reckon with past figures who set the ground rules.”

How the Avalanches Put Themselves Back Together Again

During Robbie Chater’s most recent stay in rehab, he was pretty sure the Avalanches — the beloved, sample-heavy Australian group he’d helped found in the late ’90s — had broken up.
After checking into a detox facility in January 2017, the multi-instrumentalist didn’t have any access to the outside world. As far as he knew, his latest bout of drinking had caused the Avalanches to cancel a tour promoting their long-gestating second album, “Wildflower.” He felt awful about that, but if it meant the band was over that was also OK, because after two decades of struggling with addiction, he’d finally arrived at a place of acceptance.
“I’d been trying so hard to quit drinking on my own, but I could not do it,” Chater said on a video call from his Melbourne home in early November. His space was sparse and minimalist; a while back, he’d sold all but about 200 of his records in an attempt to break from his past. “You get so unwell that you eventually crack open and listen to a new idea or a new way of looking at life.”
In November 2000, the Avalanches released their magnificent debut album, “Since I Left You,” a painstakingly detailed tapestry of thousands of obscure, interwoven samples culled, mostly, Chater said, from “junk-store records.” Somehow as breezy as it is busy, “Since I Left You” sounds a bit like a 1960s beach party painted by Hieronymus Bosch. It was a critical darling and even an out-of-left-field commercial success, with the oddball single “Frontier Psychiatrist” receiving airplay on MTV and American alternative-rock radio. Its reputation has only grown over time, and it’s now mentioned alongside records like the Beastie Boys’ “Paul’s Boutique” and DJ Shadow’s “Entroducing” as a landmark achievement of analog sampling.
“It was one of the first CDs I bought,” producer Jamie xx said in a phone interview. “It led me to want to discover how people made music that sounded like that.”
But it was also a tough act to follow. The 16 years between “Since I Left You” and “Wildflower” were a dense maze of left turns, overthinking and abandoned songs. Another of the group’s founders, Darren Seltmann, left in 2006, making the Avalanches essentially a duo of Chater and his longtime friend and collaborator Tony Di Blasi. Progress was often stalled by Chater’s drinking.
“There were about five times where I legit thought, this is it, it’s over,” Di Blasi said in a separate video call, his cat, Jude, occasionally sauntering across the screen’s foreground. He saw the arrival of “Wildflower” as “a great achievement, regardless of how it was received or anything like that, just actually getting it done was the victory.”
Chater has been sober for almost four years. And when he checked out of rehab, he had a few surprises waiting for him. No, the band hadn’t broken up. In fact — against the advice of their manager — the Avalanches had even played those tour dates, with a full backing band and Di Blasi as the only official member. (“Which was kind of weird,” Di Blasi recalled, “but in the end it was like, who cares?”) Would he be up for playing Coachella in the spring?
Both he and Di Blasi describe those months that followed as the happiest in the Avalanches’ sometimes-torturous two-decade existence. “We were touring and seeing the world, and we felt so full of light and positivity and joy for living,” Chater said.
Di Blasi said they were charmed by the sense of routine. “We were just like, isn’t it great to be in a normal band?” he said. “We’d been sitting at home by ourselves for 16 years in a room.”
After a comparatively brief four-year break, they’re doing it again, releasing their star-studded third album, “We Will Always Love You.” Making the new LP, due Dec. 11, was a more streamlined process because it began with a unifying, if characteristically grand, concept: light, the cosmos and the Golden Records, the two 12-inch phonograph disks that were launched into space aboard Voyager in 1977. The albums contained Bach and Beethoven, Aborigine songs and a Navajo chant, the sounds of trains and horses, and a host of greetings in different languages. Chater was particularly moved by the fact that Carl Sagan, who contributed to the project, included a recording of his wife Ann Druyan’s brain waves as she thought about what it was like to fall in love.
The core of the new songs are still unearthed samples, but now they intermingle with a motley squad of live voices: Johnny Marr, Rivers Cuomo, MGMT, Karen O, Kurt Vile, Perry Farrell, Leon Bridges — and even two of Chater and Di Blasi’s early heroes, trip-hop legend Tricky and Mick Jones (of the Clash and pop-sampling pioneers Big Audio Dynamite). Jamie xx also coproduced a track on his idols’ latest record: “I still can’t quite believe it,” he said.
“Being a kid growing up in a country town in Australia and hearing that Big Audio Dynamite record, which was a pop hit here — I was like, ‘How did they make that?!’” Chater said. He’d been similarly drawn to David Byrne and Brian Eno’s patchwork “My Life in the Bush of Ghosts,” the collagelike production of early De La Soul and Public Enemy albums, and even EMF’s ubiquitous 1990 smash “Unbelievable.” Beguiled by the dark art of sampling, a teenage Chater began experimenting with tape loops at home.
Chater grew up mostly in the seclusion of the Australian countryside, “ loving music,” in his words, “but playing drums badly and piano badly.” He felt alienated by the machismo and virtuosity of Australian rock ’n’ roll culture: “I’m like, well I’m never in a million years going to be able to play a guitar as well as Angus Young, or whoever. I need to find my own little way of expressing myself that’s unique to me.”
Di Blasi moved to town at the end of high school, and he and Chater instantly bonded over music, jamming in Chater’s back shed with friends. But Chater was already a heavy drinker throughout his teens, and by 20 he’d become sick enough to land in a detox facility. Sobriety allowed him to focus more intently on music than ever before. Di Blasi brought Chater one of his samplers to occupy his time in rehab.
“I remember visiting him one day and he was like, ‘Oh, look at this,’ and he played me ‘Radio’ just on samples,” he said, referring to one of the layered songs that would end up on “Since I Left You.” “He was doing that in rehab! And he came out of it completely invigorated, from almost dying to just being life , absolute life.”
Chater agreed that a sense of rebirth animated that early work: “That’s why that record’s full of so much joy and light,” he said. “I was so happy to be alive, and that record just came pouring out.”
A sense of interconnectedness flows through “We Will Always Love You,” and Chater said the process of working with live singers isn’t that different from selecting found sounds. “It’s almost like sampling,” he said, “in trying to find the right vocalist, to match the music with someone who seems like they’ve got a certain spirit.”
Sampling is still a big part of the Avalanches’ creative process, and the stirring warmth of their work has always fought the misconception that music made with electronics can’t be as personal or emotional as someone crooning into a microphone or strumming an acoustic guitar. “Someone may have sung on this song back in the 1940s,” Chater said, “and that record’s laid in someone’s house for 30 years and they’ve listened to it and added to the crackles on it, you know? It comes to me, and I find it. Where do I fit into this whole flow of energy?
“It’s really humbling in a way,” he added. “Because then we’re putting this stuff out, and it floats back out there again.”

Like many of us, Momona Tamada, 14, has been trying to make the best of a tough year. Sure, the effervescent actress and dancer, who stars as the young trendsetting artist Claudia Kishi on Netflix’s summer hit “The Baby-Sitters Club,” has been shining by most measures — but pandemic life requires adaptation.
“Personally, I’m not a big fan of online learning,” the actress said, in a phone call in late November. In addition to school, she has been auditioning remotely, and taking vocal lessons and dance classes over Zoom. “The screens, they’re inverted, so everyone is going in different directions, and it’s a bit confusing,” she said of ballet.
But in some ways, between the demands of school and her career, she had a head start on our new reality.
“I had to switch to online last year even before everything kind of went crazy,” she said from her home in Vancouver, British Columbia, where she had been hunkered down with her parents, her younger brother, Hiro, and her puppy, a black Shiba Inu named Miso who is “always doing something funny.”
Being online early has had its perks.
“It definitely helped me find my own pace,” Tamada said. “I’m glad that I had a year to kind of get used to it. It’s a struggle to balance schoolwork and working a lot.”
She played a young Lara Jean in the popular Netflix rom-com “To All the Boys: P.S. I Still Love You” (2020). And “The Baby-Sitters Club” — a full-hearted, charming and progressive adaptation of the wildly popular Ann Martin book series of the same name — was renewed in October for a second season. As for when they would start filming again, Tamada wasn’t sure.
“I hope the virus doesn’t get worse,” she said. “I miss being on set and I miss all my friends.”
There was a glimmer of normalcy, though, the day we talked.
“Today is actually the first day I get to go back to dance,” she said with the crackling excitement of someone finally getting to leave her neighborhood. The actress also told me about her recent routines and the cultural items that have been inspiring her in these weird times. These are edited excerpts from our conversation.
Wednesday Morning
I woke up and took a shower while listening to the first chapter of the book, “Life as We Knew It,” for school. But I have a main book that I’m reading: “Crazy Rich Asians.” I love the movie. So I wanted to read the book.
And I took my pup on a quick walk. She is still new to this, but enjoying the fresh air. We got her in October, and we’re getting her used to kind of socializing with other dogs and other people. She’s the sweetest puppy ever, but she is also very smart, actually, and she has a lot of energy. So once she starts running, she can’t focus and, yeah, she kind of goes crazy (laughs).
Then I made a TikTok — kind of like my trailer in 30 seconds. I was just piecing together a bunch of funny videos that I found. Personally, I love watching fashion videos and fashion-inspiration videos. Also, one of my hobbies is baking, and I just love the short little tutorials. It’s so satisfying how cakes are being made, like how they pipe everything out. I think that’s what’s so cool about TikTok is that you probably never see the same thing twice. It inspires me to maybe make what I saw.
Later, I had a vocal lesson over Zoom, and I sang “What It Means to Be a Friend” from the musical “13.” The songs that I’m currently singing in my lessons, my coach and I agreed on together.
Wednesday Evening
I took an online ballet class. I’ve been dancing since I was 4 — jazz and tap are probably my two favorites. But I pretty much do everything.
While updating my journal, I listened to an episode of a podcast called “Daily Breath” with Deepak Chopra. That was my first time listening to it, but I love it so far. It’s like five to seven minutes, and it brings such a good start to your day. Or I listen to it before I go to sleep and it really calms me down, because sometimes I get very anxious. It’s a lot about self-love. Almost like meditation. The things that he talks about really resonate with my life. It helps ground me and center me.
Before I went to sleep, I studied a script for my audition (the next day). It’s a long script. I’m happy with how it turned out.
Thursday Morning
I woke up and listened to another episode of “Daily Breath” and to some music on shuffle. Some of the songs that popped up included “POV,” by Ariana Grande, “Lovesick Girls” by Blackpink, “Falling” by Harry Styles and “American Boy” by Estelle. I listen to a variety of music, whatever makes me happy.
I took some pictures of my pup in Vancouver because it was so nice out and then watched YouTube videos while eating lunch: Michelle Khare’s “I Tried Lifeguard Academy” video. Michelle does all these — she did like training to be a pop singer and training to be an FBI agent. I think that’s so interesting. I can see a little bit into other people’s careers and the challenges they have to face to get to where they are.
Thursday Evening
That night, Mom asked me to make pizza dough for our dinner. Yes! I love making dough. Something fun to do with my family. My pizza was so tasty. I’m a bigger baker than a cook, but I totally just try cooking new recipes all of the time. I just go off the fly and think about like, “Oh, maybe this is good together.” And usually it’s pretty good. I love watching Tasty, that YouTube channel.
Then I had an online ballet class after dinner. We played a terminology game in the last few minutes. My teacher had a bunch of, I guess, French terms — a word or, like, a move. And we have to define what that means in English. And then she’d mentioned a character from a ballet. For example, she said, “Clara,” and we’d say, “Oh, she’s in ‘The Nutcracker.’”
Before bedtime, I played “Among Us” with friends. It’s been trending for the past few months, and it’s just so fun. It’s anonymous, and you can’t add people on it, so you’re always in a game with new people. (But you can play with your friends by giving them the code.) There’s one person that’s the impostor, and they go around, like, killing people. It’s not as violent as it sounds, I promise. But you have to figure out who the impostor is. And I’ve played Minecraft since I was like 9. The cast of “The Baby-Sitters Club,” we used to play all the time on set. It’s a collaborative thing. And you get to really just create whatever you were imagining.

‘Field of Broken Dreams’: London’s Growing Taxi Graveyards

EPPING, England — Drive through a leaf-strewn forest and past a charming street market in this town about 20 miles northeast of London, and a jarring sight appears: black London taxis, parked bumper-to-bumper by the hundreds in a muddy field, surrounded by beehives and a barn for raising squab pigeons.
It’s a camera-ready monument to the economic devastation wrought by the pandemic. The cabs were returned by their drivers to a rental company because of the collapse in business after Britain went into lockdown in March. As the number of idled taxis piled up, the company ran out of room in its garage and cut a deal with a local farmer to store about 200 of them alongside his bees and pigeons.
“I call it the field of broken dreams,” said Steve McNamara, general secretary of the Licensed Taxi Drivers’ Association, which represents about half of the British capital’s more than 21,500 licensed cabbies. “It’s awful, and it’s getting worse.”
On Wednesday, England emerged from its second lockdown, but severe restrictions remain in effect, and it’s anyone’s guess when central London’s deserted streets will once again fill with office workers, theatergoers and tourists.
As of now, barely a fifth of London’s taxis are currently operating, McNamara said, and the drivers still on the road are averaging just a quarter of their pre-pandemic fares. The city estimates that 3,500 taxis have left the streets since June. They are stashed in parking lots, warehouses, garages and fields all around the capital.
To McNamara, who earned his scars battling for taxi drivers against the competition from Uber and other ride-hailing services, the pandemic is an even greater existential threat. Unless the government offers more financial aid, he said, London could lose one of its most recognizable symbols — one that ranks, in the tourist lexicon, with red double-decker buses, phone boxes and police officers in their dome-like helmets.
“The buses aren’t red anymore, the telephone boxes are gone, and policemen now sit in BMWs with submachine guns,” McNamara said, unfurling a colorful line he has doubtless used before. “We’re the only London icon left, and I genuinely fear that we’re not going to be around in three years.”
To some who watched the war between black taxis and Uber, the cabbies were not always the most sympathetic figures. For one thing, their services were, and still are, more expensive. Predominantly white, male and English, the cabbies present a superannuated vision of Britain, next to the ethnically diverse immigrants and other strivers who get behind the wheel and slap an Uber decal on their window.
With Uber’s customer service and image problems, however, the battle lines are no longer so clear. Also, McNamara said, the taxis have smartened up their service with phone-pay software, Uber-like apps that allow people to call a cab, and environmentally clean electric vehicles. Had the pandemic not struck, he said, 85% to 90% of the fleet would have been electric by the end of 2024.
There is no dispute that Britain’s lockdowns have devastated the trade. Ryan Spedding, who has driven a cab for nearly nine years, vividly recalls when Prime Minister Boris Johnson went on television in March to declare, “From this evening I must give the British people a very simple instruction: You must stay at home.”
The next day, Spedding, 44, drove his Mercedes taxi into London to discover a ghost town of darkened pubs and shops, deserted office towers and empty railway stations. Normally teeming spaces like Piccadilly Circus and Leicester Square needed only blowing tumbleweed to complete the portrait of urban desolation.
“You could drive around for two or three hours and not see a person on the street,” he said. “You go from your day ticking along nicely to something out of ‘28 Days Later,’” he said, referring to the Danny Boyle movie about a deadly virus that transforms London into an eerie post-apocalyptic landscape.
Spedding pays 280 pounds, about $375, a week to rent his taxi. At that rate, he saw no option but to return the car to his rental company, GB Taxi Services. As a self-employed person, Spedding was eligible for state aid that has compensated him for about two-thirds of his average income.
He and his wife, whose dog-walking business was hurt by canceled vacations and clients who now work at home and can walk their own pets, have also gotten a break on their mortgage payments. But Spedding said he had dipped into his savings and run up credit card debt to stay afloat.
Mostly, he said, he is “bored as hell.” Like all licensed drivers, he passed a fearsomely rigorous test of London’s streets, known as the Knowledge, a process that took him 3 1/2 years. Having invested so much of his life in becoming a driver, Spedding said, “I can’t even think about doing something else.”
This week, Spedding said he planned to take his taxi out for a post-lockdown spin to see if customers would return.
“There is a big part of me that thinks maybe not,” he said.
To make up for lost business, some drivers, like Dale Forwood, have taken to offering tours of the Christmas lights on Regent Street. There are few tourists to sign up, but locals, cooped up after weeks of lockdown, seem eager to get out. Forwood, 54, also drives a delivery van for a supermarket chain.
As she navigated the lightly trafficked streets one recent night, she spoke wistfully about how London was normally jammed with shoppers from all over the world at Christmas. With the return of those visitors still dependent on a vaccine-secured future, local residents remain the lifeline for taxi drivers.
“As long as people use us,” she said, “they won’t lose us.”
For drivers like Jim Ward, who own their cars, the drought is more bearable. He said he is picking up about four fares a day, earning an average of 60 pounds, about $80, compared with about 150 pounds during good times. But he bought his cab, the familiar boxy model made by the London Taxi Co. — since renamed the London Electric Vehicle Co. — secondhand years ago, and his costs are modest.
Since January 2018, all newly licensed cabs in London must be electric. A new electric model goes for about 65,000 pounds, about $87,000; many drivers finance the purchase, which saddles them with heavy monthly payments.
“The young guys, who are doing this with financing, can’t afford it,” Ward said of the repayments during the pandemic.
Ward, who is 67 and has been driving for 46 years, notes that the taxi profession has plied the streets of London since Oliver Cromwell licensed hackney carriage drivers in the 17th century to cut down on robberies (an example of the charming historical nuggets that seem to flow fluently from the mouths of black-cab drivers).
As they idle at somnolent train stations or in front of empty hotels, cabbies swap horror stories (one waited 22 1/2 hours for a fare at Heathrow Airport). And they play a doleful game of what-might-have-been. Howard Taylor, who is 60 and has been driving for 33 years, considered selling his three-year-old cab before the pandemic hit. Now, he figures, he’d lose at least a third of its value.
“You’d have to be a fool to buy it,” he said, “because right now, driving a cab is not a viable proposition.”

Between 9,500 and 19,500 Americans could die of COVID-19 during Christmas week, CDC warns

Texto completo: The recent spate of good news about a vaccine was leavened by a sobering update released Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that forecasts thousands of new COVID-19 deaths in the United States over the next four weeks, including an estimated 9,500 to 19,500 deaths the week of Christmas alone.
The CDC's National Ensemble Forecast, which aggregates models from 37 different groups, projects that by the end of December, the overall US death toll from COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, could reach 303,000 on the low end and 329,000 on the high end.
Public health and other officials use the ensemble forecast to gauge the range for best- and worst-case scenarios in the days ahead; the wide margin between the most conservative and most aggressive forecasts is tied to what behavioral assumptions each group uses in its calculation, such as whether people's social distancing behavior will maintain, erode, or intensify.
As of Thursday, at least 272,693 people have died of COVID-19 in the United States since February, according to data tracked by The Washington Post.
Washington Post
Fauci says he will stay on in new administration
Anthony S. Fauci, the country's top infectious-disease expert, said Thursday that he plans to stay on in his role as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases after the Biden administration takes office.
In an interview with CBS News's Major Garrett, Fauci said that he has already spoken several times with Ronald A. Klain, Biden's incoming chief of staff, and that he was to meet by teleconference Thursday with the entire Biden “landing team,” a group that facilitates the presidential transition.
“Today will be the first day where there will be substantive discussions about the . . . transition, between me and the Biden team,” Fauci said during a podcast interview with Garrett.
Before Trump gave the go-ahead to the General Services Administration to allow the transition to proceed, Biden had warned that the delay meant that his team would potentially be weeks or months behind in planning its response to the coronavirus pandemic, which has claimed the lives of more than 273,000 people in the United States.

Supreme Court sides with Calif. church objecting to restrictions
The Supreme Court on Thursday sided with a California church protesting Governor Gavin Newsom's pandemic-related restrictions on indoor worship services. It said a lower court should heed a decision by the justices last week blocking similar restrictions in New York.
The unsigned order, which contained no noted dissents, seems to leave in place for now the Democratic governor's substantial restrictions, which in some places serve as a ban on indoor services.
But it threw out a district court's order upholding the restrictions in the state, which like many others is seeing a spike in coronavirus cases.
The challenge was filed by the Pasadena-based Harvest Rock Church and Harvest International Ministry, which has churches across the state.
The Supreme Court on Nov. 25 voted 5 to 4 to block restrictions on synagogues and churches in New York imposed by Democratic Governor Andrew M. Cuomo as a violation of religious rights.
“Even in a pandemic, the Constitution cannot be put away and forgotten,” said the unsigned opinion granting a stay of the New York orders. “The restrictions at issue here, by effectively barring many from attending religious services, strike at the very heart of the First Amendment's guarantee of religious liberty.”
Meanwhile, California will impose stay-at-home orders in areas where intensive care units are close to filling up, the governor announced on Thursday. It was the state's most aggressive move since March, when it ordered all residents to stay home as much as possible, and it came as cases and hospitalizations have once again begun to soar.
“We are at a tipping point in our fight against the virus and we need to take decisive action now to prevent California's hospital system from being overwhelmed in the coming weeks,” Newsom said in a statement.
The new order will go into effect if available beds in intensive care units in an area drop below 15 percent of capacity, and will require residents to stay home except for essential tasks.
Most businesses will have to shut down, including in-person dining, salons, and sports events. Hotels in affected areas will be allowed to operate only “in support of critical infrastructure services.”
Church services will be allowed to take place outdoors, and any schools that have been allowed to reopen can continue to operate.
Mr. Newsom encouraged residents to go outside, to visit parks and beaches, or even take outdoor fitness classes, a change from earlier this year, when many beaches and parks were closed.
None of the five regions in the state have reached the threshold that would trigger the order, but some have been projected to get there this week, officials said.
Washington Post and New York Times
Protesters denounce Staten Island bar's closing
Hundreds of mostly maskless protesters stood shoulder to shoulder outside a Staten Island bar on Wednesday night to demonstrate against the state's coronavirus restrictions and support a tavern that was forced to shut down for flouting those guidelines.
The raucous scene of about 400 demonstrators in front of Mac's Public House came a day after plainclothes city sheriff's deputies busted the bar, which had been operating without a liquor license, for serving food and alcohol to patrons indoors past the 10 p.m. citywide curfew in exchange for a mandatory $40 “donation,” authorities said. The bar's owners previously declared the establishment an “autonomous zone,” and had publicly taunted New York Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo and Democratic Mayor Bill de Blasio.
Sheriff's deputies arrested Mac's co-owner Danny Presti on Tuesday for obstructing governmental administration, and a cook, bartender, and the bar's lawyer were also charged, according to the New York Daily News. Presti was released Wednesday.
The tavern's defiance is part of a larger pushback from bars and restaurants in Staten Island — a borough largely sympathetic to President Trump — that are flouting the state and local restrictions imposed to help stop the spread of a virus that has killed more than 24,000 throughout New York City. The state is facing a significant surge in COVID cases, hospitalizations, and deaths over the last week, according to data compiled by The Washington Post.
It mattered little to the hundreds gathered on Lincoln Avenue on Wednesday night, many of whom were waving American flags in an area described as “the middle of a COVID hot zone.” They chanted, “F--- Cuomo!” and “Open up!” and sang songs like Twisted Sister's “We're Not Gonna Take It” and a cover of the Village People's “Y.M.C.A.,” a staple of Trump rallies.
